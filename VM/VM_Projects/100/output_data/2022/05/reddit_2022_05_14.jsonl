{"title": "TSLA investors, how do you evaluate and manage the key-man risk that resides in Elon?", "selftext": "I am a TSLA super bull, I am heavily invested in it (let's call it 50%). During these last few weeks, having my money in TSLA actually gives me peace. Even though it's down \\~40% from ATH, it's still faring better than the likes of SHOP, and tons of other tech small caps, and I know it won't stay down here for long.\n\nHowever, something I've always struggled with is how to evaluate the key-man risk that Elon represents to the company, which I believe to be the only risk that TSLA faces in the short/mid term.  Here are my main thoughts:\n\n\\- He's a generational visionary, and the reason why many people invest in TSLA. I believe if he stays healthy and involved, TSLA will be the largest market cap stock within the next 10 years.\n\n\\- However he's gradually attracting more attention; from the negative sentiments surrounding the Twitter deal to receiving threats from Russian actors, the target on his back is growing bigger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's how I think of quantifying the key-man risk:**\n\n\\- During any given year, there's a small but real chance that something bad could happen to Elon, (health, accidents, etc) let's say it's 2%.\n\n\\- If that happens, how would TSLA stock react? My guess is an immediate 20-40% haircut, for various reasons. Not to mention Earth would lose one of the most valuable human beings alive.\n\n\\- Therefore, in any given year, my portfolio could see a 10-20% drop from this key-man risk alone. (50% allocation \\* 20-40% haircut). This would be on top of any drawdown caused by macro conditions.\n\n\\- It may take many years for Tesla to prove that the culture and roadmap Elon has built was robust enough to take the company to his original vision, if it can find a capable operator (like a Tim Cook) to take over.\n\nI understand that everyone has their own risk tolerance.

There really is something interesting about the 20% drop though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2008 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/jxu7y9hxlgz81.png?width=1465&format=png&auto=webp&s=962a6d7205aac6b691505df8d05924fa6f4eec23)\n\nIn 2008 the S&P dropped exactly 20%, then formed a double top pattern and had a bear market rally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/n62wgyn9mgz81.png?width=1465&format=png&auto=webp&s=37777907768ae40bc6130a8127211003f2563d19)\n\nA very similar pattern is now forming, this is definitely not something that is certain but I will take it into consideration in the following weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/xd1rgzn6ogz81.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=90633bbd3b9227f11a8c192a7db7ad68a49f68f6)\n\nDownward trending support line with 3 points of contact now, this is a stronger indicator and an important level now.  \n\nResistance \\~432 and \\~408\n\nMajor Support \\~388\n\nRSI has been below 50 for a long time now which is pretty unusual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Week Chart](https://preview.redd.it/bv6fl2kg9hz81.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7839918dd6a155b0ed7c3e068dd19336582f43)\n\nThere was a very strong bounce from the 380 level,  this is a bullish indicator heading into next week.\n\n[Federal Reserve Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/fkcwsu1p9hz81.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=046a85f2f89d164021aeaa87d3a9df0f66c43929)\n\nThe economy is getting worse, fast, Jerome Powell knows this now. A 75bp rate hike is seriously being considered now.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/uiye1mdsbhz81.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e6f7c501b58b4d4889c5e5fbe4374d4c6301935)\n\n**Predictions**\n\nNot only the United States economy is experiencing issues with monetary policy.  Inflation is starting to cause issues everywhere across the world, seriously this is happening everywhere.  Countries are starting to limit their exports because of how bad shortages are getting.  \n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine their wheat supply was completely cut off, India stepped up and started exporting more wheat, and people's fears of shortages faded away.  This is gone now, yesterday India just shut off all wheat exports to save it for their own citizens.  Inflation is accelerating at dangerous levels when the global economy is slowing.  I think that a 100bp rate hike is necessary but Jerome Powell does not have the guts to do that.  By the June meeting, a 75bp rate hike will be expected.\n\n The global economy is getting worse and worse.  I expect stocks to rebound this week though.  The bond market finally reached this trend line which has indicated every other past recession.  Usually, there is one final rally after the bond market tops though.  The market definitely will not reach near all-time highs but at this point, a bear market rally is extremely likely.  \n\nI still believe there will be a huge panic sell but that day is for sure not next week.  It will happen when wall street realizes that the world economy is slowing down.  I stand with my previous time of early June when this will occur.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5 Day Outlook**(Do not make plays on this)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r34gf3szdhz81.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=7958bb17f2468fb42b4ba4a57a3b3cc121fde266\n\nI will respond to every comment!", "id": "upmtnf", "created_utc": 1652551538.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|28|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|804|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ukkumd/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_59/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/swfwtz/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_221/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upmtnf/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_516/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uaa3k6/the_real_reason_behind_the_invasion_spy/) \n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=upmtnf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=upmtnf)\n    \nHey /u/5k4_5k4, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4745207130908966}, {"body": "Three ghosts visited me in the night.

{"title": "The Most Undervalued Stock In All The Market RN!", "selftext": "Edit: News just came out that Warren Buffet bought more than %10!!! I will do another write up later with an update. Valhalla, here we come!\n\nHello fellow autists. If you're tired of losing money on 0TDE options and starting to think about buying good companies, that make good products/ services, make a profit and you're thinking about leaving your money there for a couple of years playing the long game...say less.\n\n**The Markets**\n\nThe markets (including almost every stock within it) have bled since about Nov of last year. We are coming up on the 8th month and [according to Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=how+long+is+the+average+bear+market&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), the average length of all bear markets has been 289 days, so 9 and a half months. You may want to start thinking about front running and nibbling on some of your favourites. Sure, we can go a bit lower...but good companies are on sale rn and markets have historically recovered %100 of the time! Plus, the fear in the markets is same or worse than March 2020, the valuations have shaved off more capital than all the other downturns combined, and everything is technically VERY oversold. Again, we can go lower...but the risk vs reward is heavily skewed to the upside now.\n\n**The Play**\n\nParamount Global (ticker: PARA) is ViacommCBS and I am going to show why I think they are one of the most undervalued, overlooked companies in the world, and therefore possibly one of the best investment opportunities in the markets rn.\n\n**The Who**\n\nParamount has some of the most iconic and [highest grossing media brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises) ever made thanks to Nickelodeon. Just between Dora The explorer ($15.8 billion), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ($15.4 billion) and SpongeBob Squarepants ($14.8 billion), they've made $46 billion dollars. They have many, many more big brands (think licensing for merchandise, etc) as they host one of the richest content libraries in all media (Star Trek, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Paw Patrol are just some of the other ones). Their broadcast channel CBS is no slouch either; 7 out of the top 10 Most Watched Broadcast Series in the 2021/2022 season belongs to CBS (this allows them to demand top advertising dollar).\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/2aie1bx2biz81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=60b49a630001eaf9e1e44a7bf629db5da1c662ee](https://preview.redd.it/2aie1bx2biz81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=60b49a630001eaf9e1e44a7bf629db5da1c662ee)\n\n**The Fundamentals**\n\nThey have about 608 million shares outstanding and made just above $6 per share profit last year. They pay a $0.96 annual dividend which amounts to about %3.4. They have about $10 per share in cash.  Here, we have a company trading at a PE ratio of under 5 that is trading well below it's book value. Book Value is around $35. That means, if it went BK over night and they stripped it and sold off it's assets, you would get $35 a share...yet, the commons are trading at just above $28 today! Now, some people will say \"ya but that book value includes goodwill and intangibles\"...but the intangibles are those same brands I mentioned earlier. For example, Disney bought Star Wars for $4 billion, and they also bought Marvel for $4 billion. How much would selling each of the brands I mentioned fetch? Probably a lot more than the $18 billion market cap that the company stock is worth today! If they have $10 in cash per share...then ALL those other brands are worth $8 billion dollars? Not a chance.\n\nNow, Paramount is also turning to growth as it transitions from making money off licensing it's products to other networks and streamers, to going DTC through it's own streaming service, Paramount Plus. P+ is only a year old, but was CBS All Access before. They are growing at an enormous clip. Where did all the Netflix subscribers go? I think a lot are moving over to Paramount, who is growing so fast, management revised it's projections from 60 million subs next year to 100 million subs. Currently, between P+ and their other paying subscription services (Showtime, OTT), they have 60 million paying subscribers! By comparison, #1 Netflix has about 220 million and Disney has 205 million paying subs. Paramount is not likely to take over the #1 or #2 spot, but 3rd or 4th is a lock. Third place would be Warner Bros Discovery with about 100 million. Currently PARA is in 4th with 60 mil but I believe they can over take WBD in the next few years as they bring more of their licensed shows back in house - as is their game plan (%25 of whats on Netflix belongs to Paramount, which is all coming back in house). This shows they are very undervalued pegged up against it's industry peers and the industry averages. They will get to 200 million subscribers in the next 3-5 years, unless they get bought out before then. So there is tremendous growth ahead, yet it's not getting the same \"growth\" type valuations. It's being valued as solely a legacy cable business that has shrinking profits. Not true. While the year over year revenue declined in the most recent financial filings, this was due to the fact they had the Super Bowl last year and not this past January. Without the \"Super Bowl\" effect, revenue is actually up. They are a Free Cash Flow machine. While they themselves are projecting their earnings to go down in the next 1-2 years, this is bc they are spending more on content and investing back into their streaming business...by 2024, they are going to be doing 9 billion in revenue from the streaming DTC side alone. This is getting 0 love. I believe it will all change and the stock will double, if not triple from these levels. Even at double the current price, at around $56 per share, I'd say it's undervalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Industry Peers](https://preview.redd.it/ioo5wdoxaiz81.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2523b7abe405a659deb7f77804c4e84e1c310b)\n\n**The Technicals**\n\nThe stock has bounced off the low 27s twice now since the new year and bounced up to the 37 resistance zone. It's dropped now once again due to shitty market conditions, but I believe it is now setting up the rare triple bottom. I'm aware it dropped a bit lower than the previous $27.25 low, but I don't believe double/ triple top or bottoms need to be to the exact cent, I think %1-2 is within range. There is a juicy open gap around $35 that I believe will get closed sooner rather than later, and then there's the open gap way up top around $85 which I also believe will close -albeit that one may take some time. Maybe not though. There is also evidence of some bullish divergence on numerous time frames as is also evident in a ton of other names, and even the indexes. I believe they've got everyone on the short side, buying puts...and the markets are about to melt up fuelled by short covering, and people jumping back in with FOMO as they realize they missed the bottom.\n\n**The Bonus**\n\nShari Redstone is the controlling shareholder of the Board. She put down almost $3 million of her own money and bought the commons in Feb between $28 and $29, so basically where we are now. She also bought back in November 2021 at around $36 but that was a much smaller buy. They say do as insiders do and Shari has loaded up over $3 mil of her money as she feels like me, this is very undervalued and we should be able to make some money buying shares down at these levels. On top of this organic growth, there has been much speculation that Shari wants to sell the company. Since there has been a lot of consolidation in the industry (Amazon buying MGM, Warner Bros buying Discovery, etc)...people feel Paramount is next to be swallowed up. At just $18 billion market cap, someone could want the content library and fairly low valuations even if you bought it at $60 a share, that would still be under $40 billion dollars. There are only a few people that could do that, in my opinion it would be between Amazon, or Apple. I'd say Disney and Comcast in there as well, but those deals might involve separating CBS out of the deal and just buying Viacomm, as there might be some anti-trust issues if they took in CBS as well. Earlier this year, when the [CEO Bob Bakish got asked a question](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/paramount-sale-viacomcbs-bob-bakish-1234705887/) about his company, he gave a really odd response starting with \"When I look at buying a company\"....why even mention that IF it isn't the game plan? He's hinted the company is up for sale and why not, PARA is a prime acquisition target and while that may not be a reason to buy into a company on it's self, it's just one more reason I sleep easy at nights.\n\nAnother short term bonus is that Top Gun 2 is coming out in a couple weeks and it's looking like it's going to be one of the biggest blockbuster in recent times! [Early reviews are crazy good](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/top-gun-maverick-first-reviews-the-most-thrilling-blockbuster-weve-gotten-in-years/)! They are going to blow the box offices out of the water, make an absolute killing and I'm looking forward to the buzz :)\n\n**Positions**\n\n15k shares at $28.50. Target is $65 within a year when the market wakes up and realizes how incorrectly they've been pricing PARA. Stop loss: What's a stop loss? I'm not selling if it dips to $25, I won't sell if it dips to $15...I won't even sell if we get a black swan event and it dips to $5. I will buy more. I will buy 5k shares every $5 drop. This entire write up has felt very DFV'ish (minus the short squeeze aspect) as I sit here and back a company I believe is being mispriced in a big way for whatever reason and am playing the long game believing the reversion back to the mean will happen. DFV was banging on the table about GME for about a year and a half before the actual squeeze happened. He spent a lot of time getting shit on by you degenerates, so please, go easy on me. lol\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nPARA is undervalued amongst it's peers and is growing in streaming like crazy rn and in the next few years. I believe they are getting valued incorrectly solely on their legacy cable side and getting nothing for all their intangibles which they could sell for multi-billions if they wanted to and their streaming side of the business (which is where all the growth is). All that content is coming in house, plus big blockbuster films are coming out - and it's a potential buy out target. Sitting on the low lows. Big upside potential.\n\n\\*Disclosure: Purple crayons taste best.

If, by historical measures, the market is undervalued by a standard deviation or more, you own stocks and you keep holding until such time as the market approaches being over-valued by a standard deviation, at which point you start to trim. The higher the market goes from there, the more you trim, and as the market approaches being over-valued by two standard deviations, you get out.\n\nI'm being specific to make my example concrete. The principle is that if stocks begin to look more like speculation than investment, you get out.\n\nIn a world of black swans, this plan can fail you, but this is at least a version of timing the market that makes use of the notion that over a time scale of years, it is possible to assess whether the market is \\*likely\\* to return more than alternative holdings.\n\nTwo things can screw this up badly. One is that you are investing in a very small number of individual companies. The risk of a surprising event, in either direction, is considerable for an individual company. The fewer your holdings, the more potential there is for the company to be subject to something wonderful or awful.\n\nThe other thing that can screw it up is normal, short-term volatility. In the short term, the market is driven more by emotion than reason. If you're talking about a handful of trading days, emotion can trump reason significantly. If a market drops 20% over six months, that likely reflects a change in conditions. But the daily swings up and down on the way there will be many multiples of 20% and will be the result of how market participants are feeling about the market on that particular day.\n\nTechnical analysis aims to capture those changes in sentiment, and technical analysis can be successful if it's predictive for slightly better than half the time. Technical analysis will thus be wrong \\*close to\\* half the time at least, and the shorter the time frame, the worse it will perform.\n\nSo the shorter the time frame and the smaller the number of stock issues being considered, the less there is to reliably say about where the price may go next. To hold on to shares with money that you're going to need in less than a year is speculating, not investing.\n\nAnyone can get surprised by an unexpected need for cash, but that's also something to consider before buying shares.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I am very grateful for your thorough and understandable help, my friend \u2665\ufe0f I so wish I had this kind of knowledge when younger!\n\nI will probably be needing funds in 2 months or so, have 336 of Apple, 20 of FB.\n\nThanks again and take care \u2665\ufe0f", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I hope that your shares are up on Monday morning.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you with all my heart for your kindness!
