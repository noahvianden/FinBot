It's actually rather complicated.\n\nIf you want to get technical about it, \"naked\" is basically a slang term at this point. You don't find \"naked\" in any official document of the exchanges or FINRA or the OCC. The formal term is \"unsecured.\"\n\nHowever, from long usage, naked is taken to mean the same thing, as shown by these links:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_put\n\n\"A naked put (also called an uncovered put) is a put option contract where the option writer (i.e., the seller) does not hold the underlying position, in this case a short equity position, to cover the contract in case of assignment.\"\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp\n\n\"A naked put is an options strategy in which the investor writes, or sells, put options without holding a short position in the underlying security.\"\n\nhttps://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/naked-option/\n\n\"A naked option is an investing term that refers to an investor selling an option without holding a corresponding position in the option\u2019s underlying security.\"\n\nhttps://wealthfit.com/articles/naked-options-vs-covered-options/\n\n\"When you own naked options, you hold an option without holding the underlying security (such as the stock the option is for).\"\n\nAnd the OIC itself calls a cash-secured put a *variation* on a naked put, not the opposite of naked:\n\nhttps://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put\n\n\"A cash-secured put is a variation on the naked put strategy.\"\n\n**HOWEVER**, you can also find links that make it seem as if a cash-secured put *is* the opposite of a naked put, such as:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedoption.asp\n\n\"Naked options refer to an option sold without any previously set-aside shares *or cash* to fulfill the option obligation at expiration.\"\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/n/naked-put-or-call\n\n\"A naked or uncovered option is a call (or put) written without the offsetting shares (*or funds*) necessary to fulfill the terms of the contract should it be exercised by its buyer.\"\n\n--------------------------------\n\nSo at the end of the day, it's slang, and different people can interpret slang to mean different things. My interpretation is that all naked puts require cash collateral to open. What distinguishes a cash-secured put from other naked puts is that it requires 100% of the assignment value as collateral, while other naked puts do not. But that doesn't mean it's not naked, since it is not secured by short shares.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the explanation!

Its flying off the shelves in my semi-rural non-affluent town. Somehow, regular people are *able* to continue to pay the higher prices *across the board*. Its possible to see this in a not-so-terrible light. Most people in US live paycheck to paycheck. they did before inflation and they do now. These people cannot go very deep into debt to pay extra for all items across the board, nor would they if they could. At some point they would buy fewer things. inflation is just as heavy on TVs and swimming pools as it is diapers and milk. so regular people are still buying non-essentials at a clip high enough to continue to push prices higher for *all* items. Wages have been increasing, but not enough to keep up with inflation. Therefore regular people *must* have more spendable money than they did a couple of years ago. this *could* be due to technology that has rapidly made our lives better and more effortless. technology within these very supply chains to make many of the products we desire cheaper than ever. technology such as the iphone provides to everyday people empowers them also with knowledge to be more efficient.  An example: I play guitar casually. always have. been playing for fun for 20+ years. guitars were $300+ for el cheapo, poorly built versions when i started playing. it was $1500 for a good amp and hundreds of dollars for good pedals. now with manufacturing technology and the niche driven tendencies of things means i bought a guitar kit where i built the exact guitar i wanted for $180, i learned how to do it by watching youtube videos produced by this kit company. I bought cheap modelling pedals for $35-50 each and an incredibly modelling amp that sounds better than any tube amp ive ever owned for $300. Are the products the same? no. certainly not. for the nice products of 20 years ago it would be 5x more expensive now. But technology has given me exactly what i wanted and needed for a fraction of the price. So that frees up my budget, lets say even on staples like steak, to be a little higher. i think theres an efficiency and effectiveness to things we dont necessarily see or are aware of such as provided by modern technology that has beget some of this inflation. We have more money even above our wage increases to spend on things because we are much smarter now and more aware of what our specific needs are. we dont waste as many purchases, etc. just a theory.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"]}

{"title": "if you missed the COVID-19 run up on PFE or BNTX in 2020, don't miss this Monkey Pox play", "selftext": "Monkey Pox outbreak is currently written off as:\n\n\"not contagious\"\n\"definitely won't be another COVID\"\n\"transmission is not airborne\"\n\"only transmitted sexually\" \n\"its only because a bunch of dudes had a sauna party in Spain\" \n\nBut that's what they said about COVID-19 in January 2020.\n\n------\n\nAnomalies of this current Monkey Pox outbreak of 2022:\n\nAlready identified in many countries as of today, latest ones including Australia, Israel and Switzerland. Last week, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and the US (Massachusetts) had its first cases. (totalling 100 cases) \n\nNever before had the outbreak been this viral. Even Nigeria, where this Monkey Pox is endemic, officially only had 558 cases with 8 deaths over 2017-2022. That's like 100 cases a year on average. Yet right now we are having 100 cases in 1 week, spread across Europe.\n\n__What I posit:__\n1. The strain might have mutated to become more viral (like COVID-19 did) \n2. Transmission is airborne (maybe due to a mutation) \n3. Incubation period of 2 weeks makes it hard to thwart and detect (like COVID-19) / countries don't know how to detect it yet\n4. Other unforeseen factors related to covid infections/vaccinations? idk. \n\n__Play:__\nI'm not saying that monkey pox will be another covid that will cripple the world. Maybe 1 in a million chance, it might. This would be the bull case. \n\nMy play is simply hope that the governments of the world will be afraid enough of the monkey pox that they'd start ordering vaccines from the producers. \n\nFact: some of the already has. \n1. __Bavarian Nordic (BAVA)__ shares shot up __almost 2x__ when they got some large orders of the monkey pox vaccines \n\n2. U.S. Patent holder and producer of the monkey pox vaccine, __Emergent BioSolutions (EBS)__ hasn't announced any orders yet, but their shares have gone up from $26 to $35. In its heyday in 2020 when people were buying up biotech stocks blindly, it went to as high as $130 -- this was just a FOMO run up because EBS has nothing to do with COVID-19nor were they developing any vaccines for COVID-19. But right now for the Monkey Pox outbreak, they are the ones that will be stepping up to be the main cast, the Iron Man superhero fighting against the monkey pox villain. Can you imagine how high this stock would run up to?\n\n3. There's a spike in options traded volume in EBS $60 strike, Dec 2022 expiry. 350 lots bought, spent __$70k__. If EBS went back to $130, that position will be worth at least __$2 million__. It might be someone in the CDC, or might just be speculators. \n\n4. EBS in itself is a very healthy company. Growing revenue year on year, currently at over a billion dollars. And gross profit margin of around 50% is above the industry watermark. Minimal debt and free cashflow is piling up every year. P/E ratio of 10 is a little high but you do pay a premium for a healthy company. Fun fact: They do own the patent to the vaccine of the anthrax virus as well. It's never bad to own a piece of a healthy company.", "id": "uv1kav", "created_utc": 1653186121.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|16 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uv1kav)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uv1kav)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0643882155418396}, {"body": "This article states that \"Nigeria reports about 3,000 monkeypox cases a year\", not 558 over a five year period. \n\nSource: [https://apnews.com/article/science-health-africa-france-56c405d91f650a41593a4a03c0ab9d79](https://apnews.com/article/science-health-africa-france-56c405d91f650a41593a4a03c0ab9d79)", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.644171953201294}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re saying if I invested my whole life savings into vaccine companies, now I have to have sex with dudes just so I don\u2019t get ruined?", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "You have to have sex with male monkeys", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "You say that like it's a bad thing", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.081757552921772}, {"body": "Or have sex with a GME ape.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6039450764656067}, {"body": "Or let the monkey have sex with him", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Even better, afterwards the monkey can throw shit at him.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7775807976722717}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6539582014083862}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3300474286079407}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Its almost \u201eSchr\u00f6dingers Blowjob\u201c \u2026 \u201eas long as you suck dick behind Wendy\u2019s, you don\u2019t end up sucking dick behind Wendy\u2019s\u201c", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07239006459712982}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11145104467868805}, {"body": "That\u2019s your insurance policy to make sure your stock goes up", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3806703984737396}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11145104467868805}, {"body": "It could well be, but the spread right now is too fast for anyone's liking.
