{"title": "Nvidia pays $5.5 million for allegedly hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners", "selftext": "Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)\n\n\"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to \u201cgaming,\u201d hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn\u2019t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\n\nThe charges stem from Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. \u201cThe company\u2019s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,\u201d the order says.\n\nGiven the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia\u2019s sales numbers didn\u2019t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company\u2019s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,\u201d the SEC alleges.\n\nDespite this, Nvidia didn\u2019t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division\u2019s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors\u2019 anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.\n\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company\u2019s business in a key market,\u201d says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. \u201cAll issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.\u201d\"", "id": "ukadoa", "created_utc": 1651918855.0, "score": 1199, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Drop in the ocean.", "score": 398, "replies": [{"body": "cost of doing business", "score": 171, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.046871986240148544}, {"body": "Barely even a drop lol", "score": 86, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24114276468753815}, {"body": "You say this, but the fine is not what matters here.
