Don't expect your broker to do it for you or do whats best for you. For future reference, you could have fixed this after close on Friday. I assume you sold the 2310C and bought the 2300C. Without further instructions your broker is obligated to exercise if its ITM, even if you don't have the funds to so. BUT! You had until 90 minutes after close to call your broker and tell em to not exercise your 2300C. That would technically mean you're out the few hundies it was above 3300, but you would not carry the risk of a 230k position over the 3 day weekend. Tiny problem was that your strike are so narrow and since the counter party also has 90 minutes to decide on the 2310C you kinda need to wait until shortly before time is up to not accidentally carry a fuckin 230k short over the weekend. So maybe don't do fuckin narrow strikes again.\n\nNow the saving grace is AMZN went up even further in AH, after the option exercise cut off. Last trade is about $2314. Barring any bad news I'd expect it to rally further on Tuesday. You regarded ass will likely make more money on this then the spread would have ever allowed you to do.

{"title": "Why the Fed wants corporate America to have a hiring freeze: Morning Brief", "selftext": "The chorus of those wanting a weaker labor market is getting louder and louder.\n\nAfter the recent job numbers were released last week, Bank of America analysts said in a note they are essentially \"rooting against the home team\" and hope the numbers stop being so strong. As higher wages contribute to inflation, the Federal Reserve appears to agree.\n\n\u201cChair Powell keeps mentioning the relationship between the high level of job openings and wage/price inflation,\u201d Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s not talking to investors. He\u2019s talking to corporate America, and his goal is to have companies essentially institute a hiring freeze and end the cycle of paying up for new hires.\u201d\n\nWednesday's economic release of consumer prices (CPI) showed inflation rose more slowly in April (8.3%) compared to March (8.5%). While the report was expected to have shown a March peak, there wasn't much good news.\n\n\"[Substantial] declines in the annual rate of inflation are unlikely to materialize until there are significant improvements in geopolitical tensions (that would get energy prices lower), supply chain strains and labour market shortages,\" wrote ING's James Knightley in a note after the release. \"Unfortunately, there is little sign of any of this happening anytime soon.\"\n\nTD Securities analysts agreed, noting the \"report should be of concern for the Fed given price gains in the core segment appear to be spreading.\"\n\nAccording to the consensus view of economists and analysts, shocks to commodities, supply chain issues, and the red hot (and very tight) labor market are all keeping inflation high and unpleasant. But it's the labor market that appears hardest to vanquish.\n\nWhile supply-chain problems and big price shocks have been easing, \"we see no such let-up when it comes to labor cost pressure,\" Bank of America's global economist Ethan S. Harris pointed out. Employers can't find people to fill open positions, tons of people are changing jobs, and \"looking ahead there is no sign of stabilization.\"\n\nIn Colas's view, the only way to get stabilize inflation is to use the monetary policy hammer to hit stock prices.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s goal is to convince corporate America to enact a short-term hiring freeze, and it will keep raising rates and talking about aggressive monetary policy until that happens,\u201d Colas wrote. \u201cLower stock prices are his way of convincing C-suites and boards to do that.\u201d\nThe Fed's 'blunt force tool of rate policy'\n\nPowell has been focused on the ratio between job openings versus unemployed workers and the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which measures inflation.\n\n\u201cChair Powell mentioned the ratio several times at last Wednesday\u2019s press conference,\u201d said Colas, who said job postings need to drop from 11.5 million to around 8 million to get to normalcy.\n\nThe only way to get there would be some sort of freeze from companies.\n\u201c[Freezes] typically [happen] when C-suites and boards decide that business conditions have become very uncertain. The Fed doesn\u2019t have a seat at those discussions, but it does have the blunt force tool of rate policy and its effect on stock prices,\u201d Colas said. \u201cChair Powell has made it clear that he wants to see openings decline.\u201d\n\nThe big question is by how much \u2014 and whether it will be enough to whip out the \u201cR\u201d word?\n\nHarris wrote if the strength stays at the 200,000 openings per month pace we\u2019ve seen, \u201cthe Fed will need to push job growth down to ~25k per month.\u201d\n\nBut, Harris added, \u201cIf the labor force has slowed to a more trend-like 100k then they will need to push job growth to negative 70k. That is, they would need to trigger a mild recession.\u201d\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-fed-wants-corporate-america-to-have-a-hiring-freeze-morning-brief-100055174.html", "id": "v068nm", "created_utc": 1653810118.0, "score": 212, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 285, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|51|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|768|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v068nm)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v068nm)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12290637195110321}, {"body": "Okay there daddy Powell.

However this is the grey area, economics merely pertains and explains from a capitalist society. What makes this a grey area is government intervention, Biden. To tell you the truth, recession will come due to the facts of economics I just explained and with hyper inflation due to government intervention. You're going to experience both at the same time. \n\nThis isnt going to be normal recession. You're about to experience the worst collapse in history. Dollar will fall due to having the need to have more dollars circulating due to hyper inflation. GDP will be negative for years as 70% of GDP is based on consumer spending and thus cannot handle a recession with hyperinflation. For the first time, US will need to declare default or go in even more hyper inflation to erase their contractual debts. Banks will receive bank bail ins and the government will need to print up to 250k per bank account of every american according to FDIC overnight which everyday prices will soar even further. You're fucked.\n\nAnyways this is what I think on the untested grey area. But what do know factually is unemployment and crash is coming.

When rates are high, transactions happen less often. When rates are low, transactions happen more often.\n\nThis is, of course, counterintuitive to how it should work. Deals should be much more common during high rates when asset prices are very low, and not as common as they are now at low rates because asset prices are very expensive (and can only go down in value because rates physically could not decrease anymore).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Which rates  in particular\u2026", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR: \"Rates\" refers to the fed funds rate.\n\n\"Rates\" is a general market term. It means the market rate for loans. \"Rates\" are generally guided by the fed funds rate, but have different base characteristics depending on the type of loan i.e mortgage rates are inherently higher than the overnight borrowing rates from bank to bank. Mortgages are risky, therefore the rate is higher, and overnight borrowing is very low risk, therefore the rate is only slightly higher than the fed funds rate.\n\nWhen someone says \"rates\" they are referring directly to the fed funds rate but indirectly referring to the market rates because the fed funds rate plays a large part in determining the market rates.\n\nRealistically the best rates you could ever get on a loan are the U.S Treasury rates, as that is the rate that the U.S government is borrowing at and it naturally has the highest credit rating because it is so economically strong and if worse comes to worst, it could print money to fulfill obligations.\n\nThe \"rates\" explanation ends here but I want to write down what rates mean to the market.\n\nSo, like I said, all types of borrowing are now cheaper because the fed funds rate is low compared to normal. Low rates mean that the cost of financing business is much lower because companies will start borrowing \"cheaper\" money instead of \"more expensive\" money. When a business finances expansion or operations, they do so through a mixture of 3 money channels. \n\n1) Debt\n2) Equity\n3) Cash\n\nEquity financing can be expensive. You're selling tranches of your stock to people, and if your investors are expecting to gain, for example, at least 15% in the next year, then you are selling a piece of stock for $100 today when it's supposed to be worth $115 in a year, which would be good for you if you weren't selling it right now. This means that the company is paying a 15% rate on their equity. Nobody wants to lose out on a 15% gain, but sometimes it is necessary because debt is MORE expensive than 15%. So look at it like this, equity financing has no real direct costs besides paying an investment bank to help get the deal done, it only has opportunity cost.\n\nWhen rates are low, companies look to debt to finance whatever they're financing. Why pay 15% on equity when you could pay 6% on debt? At this point, investors still want in on the action, but they have to expect lower future gains otherwise the equity rate stays too high and the business will prefer debt over equity. The way investors adjust for decreased future gains is by paying more for the stock. If the company is properly priced at $100 a share with an expectation of $110 in the future, it means that the rate is 10%. Rates drop and debt is 5%. Investors now have to lower their expectations to around 5% gain for the upcoming year, and therefore they purchase the stock at $104 because the expected stock price does not change, only the price you pay for it.\n\nSimply by lowering the rate, this company's equity value instantly increases by 4% and will only technically grow 5% in the next year from the point in time the issued equities are sold.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you but I don\u2019t get the debt approach with those figures vs equity", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3054215908050537}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4776048958301544}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37886738777160645}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47845274209976196}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4356690049171448}], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Jamie Dimon is the finest human being that god ever created.
