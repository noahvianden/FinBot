There are two fundamentals here. \n\n1) You use the calls to finance the puts\n\n2) You are selling a put in later months (calendar spread) to help finance the purchase of puts in early months as that gets better premium and if you are long NVIDIA, re-entering at a new lower price in later months should not bother you. \n\nGood luck.", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "Damn I paid $2,000 to learn this in my last finance class and it\u2019s just chillin in the comments for free lmao", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1034836620092392}, {"body": "What if it goes under $100?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Following on from previous: \n\n**If NVIDIA goes under $100** and you hedged as above:\n\nYou will be assigned NVIDIA via the $110 put (which becomes your new entry price) but the current price is $100 so that's a $10 paper loss on that. \n\nHere's all the steps. \n\n\\> You previously had a $200 net entry price but you've purchased a Put exit strike price where your shares are sold at $150 (so a realized loss of -$50)\n\n\\> You have a new entry via the put you sold: $110 strike (NVIDIA is $100) so -$10 paper loss\n\n\\> Net Premium received (+$8 credit)\n\n**Total loss: $42 realized loss + paper loss of $10**\n\nThen when you get assigned the $110 NVIDIA you sell covered calls for the $115 strike for a credit to start the journey back into profit or just hold as remember, getting NVIDIA long matches your original thesis of being long NVIDIA. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** With this hedging strategy and NVIDIA gets to $100, your new entry price is $110 and your new break even is actually the $42 (which is your realized loss) + $110 new entry price = $152 is you break even.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated chances of a contraction at about 35% over the next two years. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 recession-probability model has estimated a 44% chance of recession happening before January 2024.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said their goal is to achieve a soft landing -- cooling the U.S. economy to bring inflation back down toward their 2% goal while preserving a robust labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May 3-4 meeting and announce it\u2019ll start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet.\nIn the Deutsche economists\u2019 view, the FOMC\u2019s plans to raise rates to a neutral level -- one that neither stimulates nor contracts growth -- of around 2.5% won\u2019t go nearly far enough to ease inflation. That\u2019s because of a rising-price psychology taking root among American households, and an extremely tight labor market, where unemployment has fallen to 3.6%. \nDeutsche estimated a neutral rate that\u2019s much higher than the Fed\u2019s view, around 5%, and projected the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will rise to 4.5% to 5%.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Just delete the app silly", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0012539040762931108}, {"body": "Until you sell, it's all imaginary numbers.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23441950976848602}, {"body": "if you ain\u2019t selling keep holding you haven\u2019t lost a dollar, just worth", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3821653127670288}, {"body": "Go to walmart, buy a diary, enter your thoughts there.

{"title": "Theory Sharp Decline in the S&P 500 within 4 Months (TA inside)", "selftext": " \n\nI came across an interesting statement from [u/DaddyDersch](https://www.reddit.com/u/DaddyDersch/) about 5 red candles and the rarity in the last 22 years. This got me thinking, what could this this mean as we are at 5 Red Weekly Candles?\n\nTLDR, 5+ red weekly candles have only happened 8 times in the past 22 years. With 6 red candles being more common than 5. Additionally all 5+ WRC have indicated a drop below the weekly 200 EMA after a small pop.\n\nPositions: Friday next week SPY C443 06/17/2022, In four weeks SPY P345 09/16/2022\n\nThe DotCom Bubble had the majority of the 5+ Weekly Red Candles between 2000 and 2005 with a total of 5 of the 8 total. While 3 indicated a drop below 200 Weekly EMA and 2 happened while below the 200 EMA.\n\nThe Great Recession or the 2008 Financial Crisis had another 5+ WRC. However, we were just recovering from the DotCom Bubble. The 200 EMA was already close and we saw it break 200 EMA during the 3rd candle. Additionally, we saw the largest decline from any 5+ WRC with a push of -49%.\n\nIn May of 2011 we saw, what I would say is the smoking gun of my theory, a 5+ WRC which was the precursor to the August Black Monday (2011) Crisis, we saw a drop to the 200 EMA and a decline of 21% in about 17 weeks from the 5+ WRC.\n\nThe last 5+ WRC was the Covid Crash. I do not see this as a true 5+ WRC point but I have included it as we still hold true all the marks of a 5+ WRC. We saw a 32% drop smashing the 200 EMA during the decline.\n\nI have made a chart below as well as a few pictures to show my results.\n\nRebuttal, now we could experience a quick decline or with how computers have changed the landscape of trading we could never see a drop as low in the 4 months I'm speculating to the 200 EMA.\n\nNow, I also looked into the 4 WRC and the results were quite mixed but also rare with only 13 events in the last 22 years.\n\n05/01/2000 major drop\n\n03/18/2002 major drop\n\n01/13/2003 small drop & then spike up\n\n03/10/2006 small spike up, small drop then big spike up\n\n12/24/2007 small drop into 2nd 4 candle\n\n02/19/2008 small spike up into major drop\n\n01/05/2009 drop into 2nd 4 candle\n\n02/09/2009 spike up\n\n01/11/2010 small spike up, drop, spike up\n\n07/25/2011 post 6 candle spike up, drop, spike up\n\n09/22/2014 spike up\n\n05/31/2016 spike up\n\nAs last week\u2019s red candle was an extremely small red candle, some may say that it shouldn\u2019t qualify. I did not go into a fuller detail as I did the 5+ WRC but as you can see from the list we would still generally see 9 drops of some kind and 7 climbs up. Feel free to include more for the rebuttal.\n\n5+ WRC Table (Reddit hates tables this big) I'm not remaking this table again, see pictures\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPictures attached, EMA 20 red, 50 orange, 100 teal, 200 blue\n\nThank you for reading.

Numbers have been cooked for a long time, might as well make things look good on a midterm year. \n\n\n2) the CPI is a year-over-year number, so in the sliding 12-month window we're going to lose the change from March-April 2021, which was huge ( 1.6 ), and we're gaining the change from March-April 2021 (yet unknown), so as long as the cooked CPI formula reports a Delta smaller than the 1.6 from last March-April, the CPI number they report will go down.  Since the last few months have only gone up by 0.2-0.6 I feel pretty confident that with the 1.6 falling of the 12 month window will dominate the metric and the number will drop slightly\n\nAnother way to think about it is that since it's \"change in the last year\", this month has the advantage that inflation was already pretty bad last April, so they now get to use that already inflated period as the starting point.\n\nhttps://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/inflation/", "id": "ulrv2d", "created_utc": 1652104699.0, "score": 146, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|13|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ulrv2d)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ulrv2d)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07962089031934738}, {"body": "I think the pre market sell off this morning was an indicator of bad CPI numbers coming", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "An indicator of the *expectation* of bad CPI numbers.  \n\nClearly most people think the CPI will be bad.
