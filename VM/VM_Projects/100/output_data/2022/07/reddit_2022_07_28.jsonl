Ports got backed up because like tons (70,000? Ish?) US Truckers lost their truck license last year from drug tests?  Something like that - tens of thousands of truckers. \n\nOk... Inflation is whatever % it is- but a big big chunk of Consumer Price Inflation is simply the Price of Autos.  Automobile price is like 48,000 average sale price (auto volume is a thinning market - but skewing to higher average ticket).\n\nThat's why we had Actual price inflation the past decade- but the official COLA was 0% because auto prices weren't really inflating - the average price was much lower, etc. But the hamburger at my pub went from 5 dollars to 15 dollars over the past 15 years- while the CPI said we didn't have inflation.\n\nSo ya gotta take all those numbers and extract them. \n\nThey mean different things to different sectors of the economy.  \n\nSince 2009- the Market has been able to inflate the money supply dramatically- and the market was super simple - it was just like a tractor pulling uphill.  \n\nWhen the 2020 crash happened - the Fed added a lot of Real Money - but more importantly- the Fed allowed Supplemental Leverage to Big Banks. \n\n2022 is the aftermath of J Powell trying to take away the Extra Supplemental Leverage.
