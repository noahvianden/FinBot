(The five year average of the S&P is: 18.6 the 10 year average of the S&P is: 16.9, which implies that there is further downside, especially considering that most notable analysts believe that earnings are NOT going to meet expectations. Further, S&P 500 EPS guidance for 2022 is about $225 per share and 2023's guidance is about $240 per share. That means that putting the 10 year average PE (16.9) to those estimated EPS numbers would have you arrive at $3,805.50 in 2022 and $4,056 in 2023. The big assumption is that the earnings hold up, which again, are being touted by the main stream media as overexuberant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere am I going with all of this? The bottom line is that I think earnings at the end of this month are going to be extremely important. We know that energy companies are going to kill it on earnings, however, they do not really make up that large of a weight in the S&P 500 (tech, of course, is really the most heavily weighted sector of the S&P and, coincidentally, could be the earnings that disappoint the most). So, I think it is reasonable to assume that earnings for the S&P in 2022, potentially, could be flat to 2021, which would put the number at $208 per share @ 16.9x would mean fair value of the S&P for 2022 may be 3,515.20 BUT if the big 5 report gangbuster earnings, and guidance, (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook) then I think the sentiment in the market may change and the EPS guidance that was estimated for 2022 could be achievable (2022 EPS guidance is 225 per share @ 16.9x would mean fair value is: 3,802 OR @ 18.6 fair value would be: 4,185.00\n\nI have a lot of cash on hand, right now, and a very sizeable position in the S&P 500 so I continue to nibble on decent dips, however, to me, fair value of the market is about 3,500 for the S&P. I think if we get to that number then I will be a big time buyer for the next 5-10 years. Until then, I will simply nibble and, if we get solid earnings and a nice rally, then so be it. But right now, cash is king but you absolutely should be putting some of it to work. If we get the big dip, go all in, if we don't, sit tight and see how the economy plays out over the next 6 months. Time in the market is, no doubt, the best strategy, however, patience in implementing capital is also a solid investing attribute. Be strategic in your purchases and, over the course of time, when the fed eventually reverses course and oil prices come down, you're going to be glad you nibbled into the market OR, again, if we get the big dip and you buy big, you're going to be happy you did as well, in 5-10 years time.", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty rational way of looking at it in terms of earnings. \n\nHowever, I think your point about the rate hikes not taking effect for 3-6 months is inaccurate.

Lots of progress made in Fed-approved anti-depression meds to the economy during the last 90 years. \n\nNot to minimize the current econ problems but overall the US economy and stock markets are pretty resilient. Shocks to the system periodically occur shaking consumer confidence and the stock market. These tend to be great opportunities for prudent investors (and companies) if they have the funds to invest. \n\nI think it was WB who said to be greedy when others are fearful. Your post is an indicator that it may be time to start getting greedy. I am especially partial toward the semiconductor sector where there are many great companies already selling at cycle trough valuations. Those that are less consumer facing and which emphasize industrial, auto, iot, medical, telecom, and datacenter markets instead of PCs and smartphones are still reporting robust demand. The best companies in the industry have good operating margins even during cycle troughs and the cash to make strategic acquisitions furthering their competitive position. \n\nMuch of the current malaise in the economy which has led to 8.6% CPI rise can be attributed to pandemic caused high pent-up demand meeting supply chain disruptions. Over time this will gradually tend to normalize and self-correct. Guess what? Energy prices seem to have now peaked. Folks tend to cut back on long car trips when gas prices spike even as energy producers increase drilling. \n\nOur economy is strong and resilient. This is a great time to invest if you have the funds, the temperament and discipline for it. But be prepared to do your homework beforehand.
