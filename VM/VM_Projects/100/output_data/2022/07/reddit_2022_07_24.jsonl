{"title": "A Bear's Revenge", "selftext": "  \n\nIntroduction:\n\nI would like to begin by saying that I have consumed an entire 96 pack of crayons prior to typing this so take this DD at your own risk. Essentially, I think we are in for a massive drop in the market in the short term. From now until September I expect the market to be in a downtrend. Below I am going to detail why I believe this to occur while shaking my magic 8 ball in one hand and gazing into my crystal ball with the other. Additionally, for those of you who comment and have stuck around for more than 1 of my DDs I just wanted to say I appreciate you all for doing so and I have had so much fun doing these. Enough of the sappy shit though, lets talk about how we all can make a one-way trip to tendie town. My current position is puts on QQQ as well as COIN. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0a23d5bxifd91.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c03e9a95e21c1a9b41a99b310981b534e310ad2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy QQQ and COIN?\n\nWhen I was taking a massive shit at work I pondered what my next position and DD would be. I could not think of anything, so I figured screw it, why not do QQQ and COIN. The pre-analysis train of thought being that in a nutshell, tech stocks had rallied too much in the past few weeks and that a rally was unsustainable in the current macroeconomic conditions. As far as COIN specifically, I called bullshit on them months ago with me first DD months ago and hit it big so I figured why not do so again when COIN has a 52 week low of under $50 a share and $70 puts were reasonably priced. Essentially COIN makes money through transactions, they do NOT need a bullish market in order to make money as they make the same amount off of selling. It is a brilliant business model except that volumes have been in a downtrend for the internet money the past few months as evidenced by Robinhood\u2019s loss in volume as well as COIN\u2019s own volume losses in each of their last earnings call. I expect this trend to continue for COIN and as a result I expect the share price to drop closer to their 52 week low allowing for some quick money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5xg6fpzifd91.png?width=2280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cba9853d092667a8b7b63a579699673249b9fb7\n\nSource: [https://www.blockchain.com/charts/trade-volume](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/trade-volume)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is QQQ?\n\nQQQ tracks 100 NASDAQ listed stocks in proportion to their respective market capitalizations. This means that more weight is given to Apple rather than any other company due to their size. QQQ is a technology heavy index. Tech stocks are typically the most sensitive to increases in interest rates as their value depends on the value of future earnings. Tech stocks usually do not pay dividends and if they do they are very low so their share price is more sensitive to growth projections and rising interest rates are a great hindrance to growth as it will eat into profits, causing these high growth companies to slow in growth forecasts. Therefore, share prices drop as a result of tighter market conditions in terms of liquidity. Below are pictures of the market sectors that QQQ is in as well as QQQ\u2019s top 10 holdings. Additionally, a picture showing QQQ\u2019s price charted against the 10 year Treasury Rate further proves my point that rising rates are bad for Tech (and therefore QQQ\u2019s) share price. When the Federal Funds Rate is raised this pushes up the 10 year Treasury Rates and while the relationship between QQQ\u2019s share price and 10 Year Treasury Rates are not completely inversed there is negative correlation. When rates rise share prices fall and when rates fall share prices rise. (Yes the data is old but it still shows the appropriate relationship; Jan. \u201921 \u2013 Sep. \u201921)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grftf324jfd91.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=4520debeecae44b8282d7b1680b191010c66dcce\n\nSource: [https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2021/09/are-rising-interest-rates-bad-for-tech-stocks/](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2021/09/are-rising-interest-rates-bad-for-tech-stocks/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nlbsis66jfd91.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83d836501c457d567d87bffd6284013c937bc495\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/suqesyn7jfd91.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320c45a0272158be9359b81b26874d09910beffb\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMacroeconomic Indicators\n\nGDP: \n\n\u201cGDP represents the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a given period. The figure is usually given in nominal and real formats, with real GDP adjusting for changes in monetary value. Given its vast breadth, this indicator is among the most-watched by the financial markets. The expansion of a country's GDP is indicative of a growing economy, while a contraction in GDP indicates a slowdown in a country's economy. Meanwhile, a country's projected GDP growth rate can be used to determine an appropriate level of [sovereign debt](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-sovereign-debt-1978991) or determine if companies operating within the country are likely to experience growth.\u201d\n\nQ1 GDP came in negative. This is a massive deal because if Q2 GDP comes in negative on the 28th, by the textbook definition, that will signal a recession within the U.S. economy. In my opinion this would cause some irrational panic selling as investors and institutions shit themselves because of the \u201cR\u201d word. Below is the estimated Q2 GDP rate by the Atlanta Fed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxhlrwnbjfd91.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d991a39ee9fde53ae9179b181d29bc4f7d7f4c\n\nSource: [https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/atlanta-fed-forecasts-official-recession-with-negative-gdp-growth-in-q2/](https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/atlanta-fed-forecasts-official-recession-with-negative-gdp-growth-in-q2/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnemployment Rate:\n\n\u201cThe productivity and wealth of a country's citizens is arguably the ultimate determiner of economic success. Employment indicators, such as labor force, payroll, and unemployment data estimate how many citizens are employed and whether they are making more or less money than before. The financial markets carefully watch these employment indicators, especially in developed countries that generate most of their income from domestic consumer spending. A fall in employment is often followed by a fall in consumer spending, which can hurt GDP statistics and overall economic growth prospects.\u201d\n\nCurrently, we have very low unemployment here in the U.S. with it sitting at 3.6%. This would indicate tight labor markets for those looking to hire which is indicative of a strong economy. This only continues to give the Federal Reserve more conviction in continuing their interest rate hikes which as previously discussed is disastrous for tech stocks and therefore QQQ. Below is a graph of unemployment nationally from January 2021 \u2013 June 2022. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zka7wkzdjfd91.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=121b4258c0c150408c8bd05565c394ff8b8cf542\n\nSource: [https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm#](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm%23)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCPI\n\n\u201cCPI measures changes in the prices of consumer goods and services that are purchased by households. The index is a statistical estimate created by using prices from a sample of representative items collected periodically. Often times, this measure is used as a gauge of inflation, which can positively or negatively affect a country's currency. \n\nThe financial markets carefully watch CPI figures for signs of inflation. Rising inflation can lead to higher interest rates and reduced lending, while deflation can lead to lower interest rates and greater lending.\u201d\n\nAll I am going to say here is that the CPI has came in at the highest inflationary rates in over 40 years. Again, rates will be hiked aggressively as a result of this. Below is a graph of the CPI. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgi27g8gjfd91.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=f59450b5b978f2cec705d228169718ffcd84de5a\n\nSource: [https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFOMC Meetings\n\n\u201cCentral banks create monetary policy and exert significant control over a country's economy. Consequently, the financial markets tend to listen closely to every word that central bankers utter publicly for clues about the future. Central bank minutes are formal releases that contain valuable economic commentary that can signal future policy action.\n\nIn the U.S., the [Federal Reserve](https://www.thebalance.com/current-federal-reserve-interest-rates-4770718) issues what's called the Beige Book, which contains anecdotal information about current economic conditions from each Federal Reserve Bank. Similar notes are released by many other central banks, including the Bank of Japan, [European Central Bank](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-ltro-or-long-term-refinancing-operation-1979094) (ECB), and others on a regular or semi-regular schedule.\u201d\n\nRecently, the Federal Reserve in their entirety and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, have all taken a hawkish stance and said they will be aggressive in rate hikes. They have stated they will do whatever it takes in order to bring down inflation and restore price stability to the U.S. which essentially means \u201cwe do not give a shit if we RKO this country into a recession, we are going to bring down inflation no matter the pain it causes to the average and poor Americans\u201d. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPMI\n\n\u201cThe [Purchasing Managers' Index](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-purchasing-managers-index-pmi-1978996) (PMI) is an economic indicator developed by Markit Group and the Institute for Supply Management. By polling businesses on a monthly basis, the index reflects the acquisition of goods and services by purchasing managers. The two most important surveys are the PMI Manufacturing and PMI Services indices. \n\nThe financial markets watch the PMI Manufacturing and PMI Services indices as key leading economic indicators because companies stop purchasing raw materials when demand dries up. This can indicate problems in an economy much before other reports like retail sales or consumer spending.\u201d\n\nBelow is a graph of the PMI from July 2021 \u2013 June 2022. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ja7m5lijfd91.png?width=2286&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eac9a277b0ec163fc07d3ba8ce8999c4960c6e0\n\nSource: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/business-confidence](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/business-confidence)\n\nThis is the source for all the definition and words encapsulated in the quotes.\n\nSource: [https://www.thebalance.com/top-economic-indicators-for-global-investors-1979208#toc-1-gross-domestic-product](https://www.thebalance.com/top-economic-indicators-for-global-investors-1979208%23toc-1-gross-domestic-product)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConcluding Thoughts:\n\nAll of the above information considered leads me to believe that markets are in for a rout in the very short term. I think this month and August could very well be an easy time to make money with a variety of bearish positions. I also would like to mention for those that may join me on this crazy journey, please do take profits at some point. If it is good enough to screenshot or brag about to your wife\u2019s boyfriend, then it is good enough to sell. The worst thing to do when trading options is to get greedy. Additionally, sometimes cutting one\u2019s losses is the best thing to do instead of holding contracts to expiration that expire worthless. By following those simple rules, I have managed to grow the $2950 I started with in May to $7050 today. If you want to see the contracts I made money on, they are in my previous posts. Although I was dead wrong on some of them I sold at 20% gains oftentimes before earnings or other crazy events that saved my ass. Anyways this is not financial advice, and I hope you all enjoyed the post, feel free to follow me for weekly or biweekly DD\u2019s. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n5 QQQ $290 9/16 Puts\n\n2 COIN $70 9/16 Puts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnqqw17mjfd91.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45a8bd56e56b55ad2b1adc8fb76430e7c26ea5e3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mzypefnjfd91.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40b676522d66f729676b2125a3831fa28d1db4ed\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nGiven all of the dog shit economic indicators data that has came in the last few weeks, the current market rally is a fool\u2019s errand.

A lot of your logic isn't wrong but I stopped reading when I saw your treasury graph was from 2021! Lol! Actually in the past few weeks treasury yields have been coming down. That and the dollar weakening has fueled a lot of investment back into technology stocks. Earnings are being given a big pass this quarter and also accounting teams are probably told to get extremely creative because if they tell the truth they know they will get absolutely crushed. So I don't think we are getting the full picture from earnings this quarter. Less than stellar results from Google, and Meta have already been priced in thanks to Snap so a pop is more likely than another drop when they report. Inflation will probably come down a little next month (though I think it will go back up again in Sept as rent as gas prices continue their climb) commodity prices have been coming down (though probably not for good) so the Fed will do 75bps (they should do 100bps but they won't), what we saw on Friday was a classic taper tantrum not a true selloff as evidenced by the delayed reaction to earnings and the recovery at the end of the day. Had the market gone up another 1.5-2% I think the Fed would have been pressured to do 100bps seeing as how an overvalued stock market is contrary to their goals. Then after that there's no catalyst for a drop for another 4-8 weeks. As of right now no news is good news for wallstreet so my opinion is that the market will rise unless/until something breaks. The degenerate professional gamblers on wall street are playing chicken with a runaway freight train. Short term we rise, Q4 is when shit will hit the fan as the repercussions of another 225-250bps of interest rate hikes take their toll.

{"title": "Netflix is probably a $100 company if we're being real.", "selftext": "/* Edit. The fact that you people are disagreeing with me shows me I'm right. Inverting WSB never fails. */\n\nThey used to have a big moat with streaming services--but with every other media company diving hard into streaming Netflix no longer has this advantage. Instead, it's now really a media company that sucks at making media, and unless they change they're going to be filing a chapter 11 within a few years 100%.\n\n**The main problem:**\n\nNetflix is obsessed with investing in absolute garbage shows--particularly live-action stuff. It's a shame because Netflix has two things that can make them into a media giant: \\[1\\] The willingness to throw lots of money at ideas and \\[2\\] a massively wide audience that's receptive to kids shows to adult shows.\n\n**The solution:**\n\nStop paying for boring, over saturated shows/videogames. Then redirect that money into new content. \n\nFor example: instead of throwing millions of aggregate dollars into comedy specials nobody gives a damn about, throw all of that money at Mr. Beast to make an exclusive Netflix show. Considering we're about to be in a recession, people will be extra willing to do dumb shit for money. The show will be a 10/10.\n\nAnother example: Instead of putting money into live-action remakes of shows nobody cares about, start buying the IP to popular fantasy novels and make shows from them. Branden Sanderson is probably the most famous fantasy author right now, but there are a lot of other guys who write dope books that could be converted into dope shows. And especially with the flop of Wheel of Time on Amazon, you bet people will be psyched to watch a dope fantasy series.\n\n**Closing thoughts:**\n\nNetflix, baby. Stop being dumb. Your platform does something no other platform does very well: it appeals to younger audiences and adult audiences. They have a huge catalog of shows for young people and a lot of stuff for adults and controls to allow households to control each. I mean, why do you think Disney bought Marvel and kept the name separate? Because they wanted an IP that appealed to adults and teens. Netflix has this advantage literally built into their business model but they aren't using it properly. \n\nDude I'm just so mad at Netflix because they literally could be the biggest media company in the world if they weren't so goonish with respect to how they spend their money. It's insane.\n\nThe only thing blazingly fast about Netflix is how quickly they're going to need to file for bankruptcy within the next few years if they don't get it together.", "id": "w6magj", "created_utc": 1658634368.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|81|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|2027|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ryd1vk/possible_short_play_on_a_small_holding_company_bgs/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6qjk/what_nobody_is_telling_you_about_investing_life/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w6magj)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w6magj)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11616215109825134}, {"body": "Netflix won't renew mindhunter.

{"title": "Why China's banks are failing...", "selftext": "China is at the beginning of a 2008 US financial meltdown.   I'm sure a lot of you autists won't believe it because it's been discussed for several months but nothing egregious has happened to the US financial markets indicating this. \n\nWell, it's just because our laughable CNBC analysts and Jim Cramers have not pointed to China as any cause for the erosion of the US stock markets.  Maybe there is some thing more than just inflation and interest-rate fueled demand suppression causing a decline in the US markets.\n\nBut, some thing WILL happen.\n\nChina's \"bank\" issues started in one province, where customers of 4 \"banks\" could not get money from those banks.  Why?  Well the deposits were going to shareholders accounts.  One executive was arrested, one took off with $6 billion.  \n\nChina will not back the deposits of these \"banks\" because they are not actually banks.  They were investment institutions and governments don't back investments, only bank deposits.  The people were fooled into thinking they were banks.\n\nAnd many people were online only accounts since that's how they had to advertise to people outside of that province.  These people had complete access cut off.\n\nVery few will be able to get their money back.\n\nChina essentially said too bad, people need to research where they put their money. \n\n\nThat caused panic as the Chinese became frightened that their money may be at risk.\n\n\nNow this has spread to even the four state owned banks, where deposits are being limited.\n\nThey will only be able to suppress the information and kick the can down the road for so long before it implodes.\n\n\n[Here is a link to a video describing China's Failing banks](https://youtu.be/N57doBGQTNY)", "id": "w6u1c5", "created_utc": 1658664079.0, "score": 302, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|130|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|544|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvegwp/will_twtr_go_bankrupt_this_year/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ua4php/google_the_oversold_cash_cow_that_will_blow_past/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqt667/brkb_a_serious_market_underperformer/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w6u1c5)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w6u1c5)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3101699650287628}, {"body": ">But, some thing WILL happen.\r\n\nhands down best analysis", "score": 198, "replies": [{"body": "This dude doesn\u2019t realize 90% of the world relies on china not falling to shit.
