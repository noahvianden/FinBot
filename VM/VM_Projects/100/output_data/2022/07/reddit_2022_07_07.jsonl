{"title": "PSA: GME stock dividend will not force shorts to cover", "selftext": "A stock dividend is treated differently than a cash dividend. When a cash dividend is paid on a stock, anyone who has a short position against those shares has to pay that dividend back to the holder they borrowed it from. This is because a cash dividend is real economic value that the lemder is entitled to.\n\nA stock dividend, however, does not require the shorts to do anything because it doesn't represent missed economic value from the lender's perspective. If I lent you one share of GME representing 1% equity ownership and it does a 4:1 stock dividend, you now owe me four shares conveying 0.25% ownership each. There's no economic value being accrued to the shares the lender owns, so there's nothing the short seller has to pay to make them whole. The short seller does not have to return the share to the lender then re-borrow the four shares. \n\n**Here's the most analogous example I could come up with**\n\nPretend you're renting a four-room house (represnting GME pre-stock dividend) from a landlord (representing the lender of the shorted shares). you only rented this house because you believe it will decline in value. Once your lease started, you secretly sold the house to some sucker who buys it because he wants to live there and is confident that the housing market is artificially depressed by fake houses listed on zillow in the area. He also heard rumors about a new law coming into effect soon which will expose this fraud. You're secretly planning to buy it back once the market value plummets, then terminate your lease. This isn't meant to be realistic so please don't nitpick at things like home ownership titles.\n\nCash dividend:  the landlord has a magical marijuana plant which requires no care yet yields exactly one ounce of mid-grade weed every quarter like clockwork. As a tenant, it's your contracted responsibility to mail him this weed every quarter. Once you sell the house, the new homeowner is legally entitled to the quarterly ounce of weed from this plant, so you cant mail your landlord his weed anymore. Instead, you buy identical mid-grade weed every quarter from a dealer and send that to him. Landlord is happy to be receiving the mid-grade weed he's entitled to, and can't tell the difference bc shitty mids is shitty mids.\n\nStock dividend: a pointless new law is announced: all four rooms within this house now have a different address, and represent four distinct properties. As a result, your lease is changed to four separate leases, each at 1/4 the monthly rent. Your total monthly rent hasn't changed, and your landlord's house hasn't either. In other words, your monthly rent has not changed, and you don't owe your landlord anything. You don't have to move out of his house at 11:59 pm on the last day of your old lease and then move back in 2 mins later when the new 4-room lease kicks in.\n\n**TLDR and TDDU (too dumb don't understand)** - If that's still too complicated for you apes. The dildo I use on your wife breaks down into four stackable pieces of increasing girths, like those Russian matreyshka dolls. If I lend you that dildo and It comes apart while you're thrusting it into your dumb ass and can't figure out how to put it back together, you now owe me the four pieces of my dildo that add up to the whole dildo I lent you. That's it. You don't have to return the 4 shit covered dildo components to me then re-borrow them.\n\nI look forward to seeing where the next goalpost is placed.", "id": "vt5j7f", "created_utc": 1657154998.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|56|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vt5j7f)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vt5j7f)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02108854427933693}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "OP been real quiet since this\u2026", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly I skipped over his question at first because I had just answered about 20 questions in a row asking the same \"but what about the naked shorts?!\" \n\nThere aren't any naked shorts.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "there\u2019s the difference i suppose, a difference in speculation", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "you did NOT just come back 6 months later without even a remind me \ud83e\udd23 hope you\u2019re doing well.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09486114978790283}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.110982745885849}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1885928362607956}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17357751727104187}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19544921815395355}, {"body": "To answer your bolded question - nope. Let's pretend there actually a massive conspiracy to take down GME via fake shares (there isn't).\n\n\rA stock dividend is not passed through the short seller to the lender of shares, unlike a cash dividend. This is because the stock dividend increases the number of shares outstanding by 4x, while simultaneously decreasing the equity ownership conveyed per share by 1/4. Even if a bunch of GME short sellers were shorting fake shares (they're not), this still would not be a reason that they'd have to buy back shares to repay the lender. It's just not how this works.\n\nPretend you have a one dollar bill which is sitting on your desk and you had no plans to spend it. Pretend you lend me this dollar bill, and I agree to pay you interest while I'm borrowing it. If I take this dollar bill and convert it into four quarters, would you demand that I repay you three of those quarters? No, you wouldn't, because I still owe you a dollar. Also, making me return three of my four quarters would cost you money, because my future interest payments to you would be 75% less, and those 3 quarters would just sit on your desk doing nothing.\r  \n\r  \nThis is why this stock dividend is such a non-event.
