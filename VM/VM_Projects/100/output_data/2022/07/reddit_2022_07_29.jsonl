{"title": "The Fed vowed to crush inflation with higher rates. Then the stock market rallied. Here\u2019s why. (It\u2019s not good news)- Interesting read", "selftext": " The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points despite acknowledging that economic growth is clearly slowing. The central bank, under Powell, reiterated that the path of least resistance is well-represented by the so-called dot plot:\u00a0More hikes ahead\u00a0\u2014 all the way to a fed funds rate of 3.75%!\n\nAnd yet, the stock market has staged a\u00a0humongous rally,\u00a0led by the most valuation-sensitive and risk-sentiment-driven asset classes:\u00a0Nasdaq stocks **COMP,** **+1.08%** and crypto.\n\n**So \u2026 what the heck?!**\n\nIt all boils down to how\u00a0one single sentence\u00a0was able to affect the\u00a0probability distributions\u00a0that investors were projecting for different asset classes.  \nDoes it sound complicated? Bear with me: it\u2019s not!\n\n**Why did stocks rally?**\n\nWhen the FOMC\u2019s press release was published, it looked like business as usual: A\u00a0well-telegraphed 75-bp\u00a0hike with the only small surprise represented by an unanimous vote despite clear acknowledgment that economic growth is softening.\n\nBut not even 15 minutes into the press conference, the\u00a0fireworks\u00a0went off!  \nIn particular, when Powell said: \u2018\u2018We are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of\u00a0neutral interest rates, and after front-loading our hiking cycle until now we will be much more\u00a0data-dependent\u00a0going forward.\u2019\u2019\n\n **This is very important for several reasons-**\n\nThe\u00a0neutral rate\u00a0is the prevailing rate at which the economy delivers its potential GDP growth rate \u2014 without overheating or excessively cooling down. With this 75-bp hike, Powell told us the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate and, hence, from here they aren\u2019t contributing to economic overheating anymore. But that also means any further increases are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. And the bond market knows that every time the\u00a0Fed\u00a0became\u00a0restrictive\u00a0in the past, they ended up\u00a0breaking something.\n\nUntil Wednesday, you could be completely sure that the Fed would have just pressed on the accelerator \u2014 inflation must come down; no space for nuance. So journalists asked questions to find out something about the \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 forward guidance. It went roughly like this:\n\nJournalist: \u2018\u2018Mr. Powell, the bond market is pricing you to cut rates starting in early 2023 already. What are your comments?\u2019\u2019\n\nPowell: \u2018\u2018Hard to predict rates six months from now. We will be fully data-dependent.\u2019\u2019\n\nJournalist: \u2018\u2018Mr. Powell, due to the recent bond and equity market rally, financial conditions have eased quite a lot. What\u2019s your take?\u2019\u2019\n\nPowell: \u2018\u2018The appropriate level of financial conditions will be reflected in the economy with a lag, and it\u2019s hard to predict. We will be fully data dependent.\u2019\u2019 \n\nHe did it. He totally ditched forward guidance. And what happens when you do so? You give markets the green light to freely design their probability distributions across all asset classes without any anchor \u2014 and that explains the gigantic risk rally \u2014 as well as the jump in the broader S&P 500 SPX, +1.21%.\n\n**Let\u2019s see why-**\n\nIf the Fed is so data-dependent, and there is basically one data they care about, it all boils down to how inflation will evolve in the near future \u2014 and the bond market has a very strong opinion about that. Using CPI inflation swaps, I calculated the one-year forward, one-year inflation break-evens \u2014 basically, the expected inflation between July 2023 and July 2024, which is represented in the chart above and sits at 2.9%. Remember that the Fed targets (core) PCE, which tends to historically be 30-40 bps below (core) CPI: Essentially, the bond market expects inflation to slow very aggressively and roughly hit the Fed\u2019s target in the second half of 2023 already!\n\nSo if the Fed is not nearly on autopilot anymore, and markets have a strong opinion on inflation and growth collapsing, then they can also price all other asset classes around this base case scenario. It starts to be more clear now, right? This is what my Volatility Adjusted Market Dashboard (VAMD \u2014 here\u2019s a short explainer) showed soon after Powell enunciated that one single sentence.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-vowed-to-crush-inflation-with-higher-rates-then-the-stock-market-rallied-heres-why-its-not-good-news-11659037159?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-vowed-to-crush-inflation-with-higher-rates-then-the-stock-market-rallied-heres-why-its-not-good-news-11659037159?mod=home-page)", "id": "wayz3g", "created_utc": 1659082069.0, "score": 432, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Supply shock didn't cause housing to go up in price 80% over the past 2 years. The low interest rate and promising forward guidance did. Combined that with people widely employed, and business able to borrow to fund cash purchases is what resulted in the housing bubble.\n\nHousing costs has gone up way before food and gas.

Fine, that makes sense. \n\nWhat didn't make sense is once inflation reached 5%, he still wanted to keep rates low, believing the inflation transitory.

But he convenient ignores surging housing costs and a bubbling stock market.\n\nAt that point he should entertaining the idea that inflation may not be solely supply shock, and that he caused a shit ton of it.

I also fundamentally disagree with the feds heavy handed responses to their anticipated outcomes. \n\n\nHowever, housing has been in a shortage since the 2008 financial crisis, and building has not been able to keep up. COVID uncertainty slowed and halted many projects, supply disruptions on housing components, and labor disruptions have all contributed to rising housing prices.

And I attribute the demand soaring due to both loose fiscal and monetary policy. Monetary policy doesn't fix structural issues as you have noted, like supply chain issues. Hence they should not have been used to spur the economy.\n\nCOVID shutdowns were structural issues that should been addressed by fiscal policy, which the government tried by PPP loans and stimulus checks. Monetary policy used during that time to provide stability to credit markets is also reasonable. But in 2021, businesses were opening up, people were vaccinated, hospitalization were going down, asset prices were going up, and while you could argue that housing may have supply issues contribution to its inflation, I doubt you could say the same for stocks and cryptocurrency. \n\nSo not sure why the Fed didn't see that in 2021 and think \"oh geez, the markets rose 20+% in 2020, and it seems to be continuing to rise at that pace in 2021, and unemployment low, inflation rising, let me put a break on it?\" and instead goes, \"money printer go brrrr.\"\n\nI understand it's unfair to put the blame totally on the Fed, because the government keeps spending and doesn't raise enough taxes to cover the shortfall for at least a decade now, but we're entering a phase in which debtor keeps borrowing to keep himself afloat and kicking the can down the road.

In this case they talk about social media, so if they control enough of an app type, fitness here, then trying to convert people gets expensive because they are already used to something.\n\nHonestly I think the invention of the internet has yet to be completely addressed in our law when it comes to business related law.

Just put up some signs in a popular area and attract some of those customers and do your best to take them for yourself.

I left MySpace because my friends left. I\u2019ve never had a twitter because I don\u2019t personally know even a single person who has or ever had twitter account.

Human traders cannot possibly make the right moves as highly advanced algorithms are already 10 steps ahead\u201d.\n\nPart of the fear surrounding algo-trading is the nefarious idea it is designed to extract as much wealth as possible from real human beings and place it into the hands of the algorithms.  Khan continued \u201c... if algo-trading is not regulated soon, there is no telling how much impact it could have in the future, we fear the impact could grow exponentially\u2026\u201d.  Her logic seemed to imply the more money the algorithms control, the greater the impact they will have on the markets.\u201d\n\nIDK about you guys, but with the recent market behavior this explains everything.

This translates into approximately 110,000 individuals each month, a large sample compared to public opinion surveys, which usually cover fewer than 2,000 people. The CPS sample is selected so as to be representative of the entire population of the United States. In order to select the sample, all of the counties and independent cities in the country first are grouped into approximately 2,000 geographic areas (sampling units). The Census Bureau then designs and selects a sample of about 800 of these geographic areas to represent each state and the District of Columbia. The sample is a state-based design and reflects urban and rural areas, different types of industrial and farming areas, and the major geographic divisions of each state. \n\n>Every month, one-fourth of the households in the sample are changed, so that no household is interviewed for more than 4 consecutive months. After a household is interviewed for 4 consecutive months, it leaves the sample for 8 months, and then is again interviewed for the same 4 calendar months a year later, before leaving the sample for good.

It generally goes down when markets are going up and goes up when markets go down. The fact the market is going up and the VIX is down doesn't really tell you anything. They're basically the same trade.\n\nI guess you could say that a lower VIX correlates to market confidence and you would expect the VIX to trend lower as the market recovers, but it's not a leading indicator, and more importantly the VIX is mean reverting. Sudden spikes lower or higher in the VIX can be seen as an indicator that things might be getting over done either to the upside or downside.\n\nOn the flip side of that the VIX over short-periods is also trend-following. So a down move in the VIX is likely to be followed by more down moves until it's not. So near-term it probably could be seen as more positive than negative, but if you believe the bear market isn't done yet then you should also probably expect it to bounce higher at some point as it mean reverts to a more typical bear-market level.\n\nBasically it doesn't really mean anything. It tells you something, but it's fairly useless on its own. Where it might be handy is if you have an opinion on where volatility should be approximately because then you can use the difference between your estimate and the actual VIX as indicator that market sentiment might be about to change (assuming your estimate is roughly correct of course).", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "Calm before the storm.
