Tightening is also bringing in inflation and if they keep doing this it's going to lead to eventual deflation, so far everything I have said is terrible for gold. \n\nWhat gold does really well is preserve your purchasing power over a very long period of time. If you price a firearm or a horse or a house in Gold it really hasn't changed much over the past 100 years. In the short term it can be a little weird. Gold did nothing, absolutely nothing after the financial crisis when everyone expected it to. You have to remember it wasn't that long ago gold was at $1,000 an ounce. We did have a lot of money printing, we did have a lot of inflation, it's unlikely gold is going back to $1,000 unless we have some massive deflationary event.
