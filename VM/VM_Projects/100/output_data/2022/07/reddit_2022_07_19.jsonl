{"title": "Netflix shares jump as Q2 subscribers beat estimates. Reported Loss of 970,000 versus loss of 2 million users expected", "selftext": "Netflix (NFLX) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close as the company battles ongoing inflationary pressures, increased competition, and an uptick in subscriber churn.\n\nThe streaming giant's Q2 subscriber numbers showed a narrower loss than expected, causing shares to surge more than 8% in after-hours trading. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share were mixed amid the broader subscriber slowdown, in addition to increased pressures from foreign exchange with the dollar holding strong relative to other currencies.\n\nHere are Netflix's second quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg:\n\n**Revenue: $7.97 billion versus $8.05 billion expected**\n\n**Adj. earnings per share (EPS): $3.20 versus $2.98 expected**\n\n**Subscribers: Loss of 970,000 versus loss of 2 million users expected**\n\nThe streaming giant's anticipated loss of 2 million paying users for the second quarter would have been the worst quarterly decline in the company's history after the streamer lost 200,000 users in April.\n\nNetflix's Q3 subscriber guidance of 1 million came in below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 1.9 million, although analysts have admitted that the second half of the year could see potential downside risks amid macroeconomic concerns.\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-q-2-earnings-170448268.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-q-2-earnings-170448268.html)\n\nNetflix (NFLX) is currently up 8% after market close. This comes after the company reported Q2 earnings that beats estimates especially the reported 970,000 subscriber loss against the expected 2 million.\n\nDo you think it's now time to buy NFLX?", "id": "w32ogg", "created_utc": 1658262630.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|66|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|80|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w32ogg)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w32ogg)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06166379898786545}, {"body": "Ceo: \n\nSay we lose double of what we will lose\n\nIntern: \n\nBut sir..\n\nCeo:\n\nWe will pump it with good news", "score": 257, "replies": [{"body": "Instead of\n\n\"We lost 40 million a month in revenue\" (2 million x $20)\n\nIt was...\n\n\"We only lost 20 million a month in revenue!\"\n\nBULLISH!\n\n![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 138, "replies": [{"body": "Instead of \n\n\"We might lose 1m subscribers in Q2\" \n\nLet's make it\n\n\"We might lose 2m subscribers\" \n\nAnything less than 2m is strong beat ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Gotta justify the heroic actions of the CEO for pay bonus", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09288787841796875}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47235533595085144}, {"body": "Never heard a better argument for \ud83e\udd21 market than these two descriptions.", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.343563973903656}, {"body": "The institutions gonna pump this L company To the moon", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24742868542671204}, {"body": "Netflix Q2 earnings were up 10% yoy and they beat EPS so...", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4581352770328522}, {"body": "Didn\u2019t they drop like 25% on the bad news?
