Make sure to sell at strikes above your cost-basis and at a strike you are comfortable with selling your shares at if you get assigned (this way no matter what you always make money on the underlying, same as you would if you set up a long term limit sell at a set price) 2. -aim for weekly/monthy premium. The closer you are to expiry, the better in order to make theta work for you. You can also realize the premium within a shorter time instead of waiting 45+ days or more out. I like to sell contracts 3 to 10 DTE. 3- Sell calls that have a .30 delta or less (.20 delta or less if you want to ensure a very low probability of being assigned). Lower deltas have lower probability of falling ITM. \n\nThe other reason I like to to sell weekly/bi-weekly covered calls is flexibility. With 3 DTE you can take advantage of theta burn and sell at a slightly higher delta if the premium is worth it. If the stock is flat at 10 DTE you will typically see the premiums for the following week stay flat as well, so selling 14 days out won\u2019t make much of a difference, and selling 10 days out you are ahead on time decay by -4 days. Selling shorter weekly/bi-weekly DTE also allows you to adjust your strikes when there is an uptrend. If the stock moves up 10% in the same week your call expires, you can move your strike up the following week and capture the same or even higher premium at a higher strike, and you get paid out a higher premium while improving your underlying value if it ends up moving sharply and finds its way ITM. Another basic rule is try and sell on green days when your stock moves up. You want to take advantage of the highest premium you can get for that specific strike when you sell a call, and the premiums move up (in some cases, dramatically) when your stock moves up. The important thing when selling calls for profit is set up your calls so the likelihood of getting assigned is very low, and that in the event you do get assigned, you make money on the underlying as well as the premium on top. There is no such thing as zero risk of getting assigned, so when selling calls keep that in mind that if a sharp move up happens and falls ITM, you have to be ok with the strike you sold at. You don\u2019t want to be in a position where you target high premiums below your CB, have your CC\u2019s fall ITM close to expiry, and end up having to roll your calls into eternity. Put together a game plan of a realistic average weekly profit goal (example> if your sell 4 weeks DTE for 600 premium, your weekly ave profit is 150 per week. If you sell 1 week DTE your goal would be to make at least 150 or more per week). The other beauty of covered calls is they also hedge your shares on the downside. So if if the stock dips, the premiums drop and you can actually buy to close at the lower premium value and take profits earlier (which helps if you want the flexibility to release your obligation to sell those calls and still be able to keep a portion of the premium paid).

That is why, always set up your CCs right and shorter duration to expiry, the better. You will actually make a higher weekly average by selling weekly than going for higher premium 6-12 months out. It is always tempting, and higher premium further out means less work on your end, but if you want weekly/monthly profit and alot of flexibility where your shares aren\u2019t locked up for months, you go for a shorter 1 to 4 week strategy primarily targeting selling calls 3-10 DTE.

If I do get assigned, I would be technically selling the shares themselves at a loss. Is this a bad strategy?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Buying back after assignment is certainly also an option, but it depends on how sharp the move up is in SP and also consider how much you have already collected in premiums, because technically yes, you can get assigned on a Friday and buy back Mon and begin the process of selling calls again. But the only thing that can screw you is if the move up is sharp and the SP on Monday is much higher than your net profit from underlying + premium at assignment. You would end up having to buy the stock back for alot more than the overall net you made at assignment. But yes, technically when you collect premium and don\u2019t get assigned, the premium can factor into lowering your CB since the CC acts as a hedge as well. For example, if you have a cost basis for AAPL at 143 and sell a July 8 CC at 146 strike (.192 delta) for .36 and the option expires OTM worthless on Friday, factoring in the premium your cost basis becomes 142.64. You can decide to go for higher premium the following week at 145 if the stock stayed flat, and I don\u2019t mind taking a chance on higher premium if the expiry is 3-5 days out. The tough thing is, overall as you keep factoring in your premium received into your CB, after weeks or months of receiving premium, you diminish the potential capital gains you could be receiving on your original CB if you have a trend of selling calls closer and closer (and eventually below) your original cost basis. So you can run the risk of just ending up break-even if you get assigned instead ending up in the green overall. Your goal in selling covered calls for profit is you want to end up ahead with a healthy profit if you do end up getting assigned in the long run. Then buying the stock back higher after assignment isn\u2019t such bad thing because your overall net profit is still green even after buying the stock back. But you also want to protect your intrinsic value. This is why I prefer not to factor in the premiums received into my cost-basis unless the stock is in a downtrend, and I am selling calls to get out of a stock to break even without a loss.

{"title": "Has inflation really peaked ?", "selftext": "I'm trying to anticipate the CPI Numbers. \n\nIt has 3 major components : gas, electricity, and food prices. \n\nEnergy has started to roll over, but remember : this is a lagging indicator. The price of crude has gone down from the highs of 120 on 6/8, down to 100, it even peeked down under 100 this week. But in my opinion, it will be a while before consumers see this reflect on the price at the pump.\n\nElectricity : I think people aren't talking enough about the price of electricity, and it has partly been overshadowed by the price of gasoline. With the worldwide adoption of EVs, it's only natural that the price of electricity goes up in the next 10 years. Couple that with the fact that in EU, they made the painful, and definitive choice of switching away from Liquid Natural Gas. That means more consumption of electricity for heating. \n\nFood : the overall Food price index has gone down from end of may to end of June, from 159 to 151, but it's nothing to write home about. \nPrice of poultry has gone up, beef has fallen a bit, and pork has pleateau'ed\n\nPrice of cereals have gone up over the month of June. \n\n\nRent : rent price of 1 and 2 bedrooms has continued growing year over year, and month over month, according to the Apartment list national rent report, but we are starting to see a slowdown in rent growth.\n\n\n\nSo overall, I have a feeling that inflation isn't going down any time soon.

But what is true is that Tesla's market cap and enterprise value is already extremely high relative to their current production, which means that there is already a very significant amount of growth priced in. It is silly to think that from a competitive standpoint, Tesla could grow into one of the world's biggest automakers and not face margin compression and competitive response. They are competing against car manufacturers that have been doing it for decades and even centuries. They will need to overcome brand loyalists, expand product lines to capture different segments of the market, and generally settle into becoming one of the largest automakers. You are assuming that they can do that and have absolutely no impact on their profit margins, which is a big leap to make. \n\nFor reference, Toyota sold over 10x as many cars as Tesla in 2021 but Tesla's enterprise value is 2x Toyotas. That is bananas. For simplicities sake, if we were to look at Tesla as purely an auto manfucaturer, even if we assumed 2x the profitability of Toyota  once they mature, that they would need to sell over 10 million cars per year to justify their CURRENT market cap and enterprise value. \n\nI understand that Tesla is not just an auto manufacturer, and that they are trying to create a separate ecosystem with solar and battery tech, etc., but you are paying a significant price for it with limited upside in the long-term. We are talking about the 6th biggest company by market cap in the world here. Your upside is capped with Tesla unless you can somehow argue that they should be worth much more than Apple in the long-term (which is an argument I'd love to see) and you would be reliant on them meeting and exceeding already significant growth expectations that are priced into the stock at this point.

The question to ask is what does the market think the lowest multiple should be for Tesla to be a steal in this current market. Tesla will show some weakness due to manufacturing slowdown from China etc and they will show lower deliveries and people may hammer the stock down to maybe $600 or $625... JP Morgan says 380 which I highly doubt.
