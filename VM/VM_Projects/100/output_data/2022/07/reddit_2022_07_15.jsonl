The Fed's rate setting mechanism primarily drives demand for the overall US economy. Raising rates tempers demand, lowering rates fuels demand. The majority of historical instances of US inflation have been due to high consumer demand fueled by an overheated job market.\n\nWhile there is some of that currently, the primary cause of inflation currently is supply shocks from the CCP's unrealistic zero covid policy and Russias invasion of Ukraine. Without getting into the hopeful eventual resolutions of these, supply shocks reduce economic output (recession) while prices rise (inflation), or the economic asshole-fisting combo better known as stagflation.\n\nIn periods of stagflation the Fed has two options in the open market - lower or raise rates. Lowering rates will save economic output but inflation will accelerate and runaway. Raising rates will further decrease economic output (deeper recession) but restore price stability, which is overall seen as the lesser shitty of the two options.\n\nThe Fed and other economists know this, but will not openly state this to avoid panic by the US public which would drive a steeper recession (in the Fed's case) or so whoever is paying them can get their money moved at the best price before the public gets wise (in the economists case).\n\nThere is more pain to come \n\nTLDR; stagflation bad, fed can't fix supply side shocks, only way to tame this inflation is to bring the US economy to a moderate to strong recession.", "id": "vzo7d1", "created_utc": 1657890159.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vzo7d1)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vzo7d1)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.04454510286450386}, {"body": "Or give people a more attractive place to put their money other than buying goods until supply can normalize.
