The Fed's rate setting mechanism primarily drives demand for the overall US economy. Raising rates tempers demand, lowering rates fuels demand. The majority of historical instances of US inflation have been due to high consumer demand fueled by an overheated job market.\n\nWhile there is some of that currently, the primary cause of inflation currently is supply shocks from the CCP's unrealistic zero covid policy and Russias invasion of Ukraine. Without getting into the hopeful eventual resolutions of these, supply shocks reduce economic output (recession) while prices rise (inflation), or the economic asshole-fisting combo better known as stagflation.\n\nIn periods of stagflation the Fed has two options in the open market - lower or raise rates. Lowering rates will save economic output but inflation will accelerate and runaway. Raising rates will further decrease economic output (deeper recession) but restore price stability, which is overall seen as the lesser shitty of the two options.\n\nThe Fed and other economists know this, but will not openly state this to avoid panic by the US public which would drive a steeper recession (in the Fed's case) or so whoever is paying them can get their money moved at the best price before the public gets wise (in the economists case).\n\nThere is more pain to come \n\nTLDR; stagflation bad, fed can't fix supply side shocks, only way to tame this inflation is to bring the US economy to a moderate to strong recession.", "id": "vzo7d1", "created_utc": 1657890159.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vzo7d1)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vzo7d1)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.04454510286450386}, {"body": "Or give people a more attractive place to put their money other than buying goods until supply can normalize.

{"title": "A Golden Opportunity. Casino Crashing Imminent!", "selftext": "Degenerate gamblers of WSB, I present you with a rare opportunity to take back your tendies from the casino.\n\nCaesars Entertainment is a casino and hotel company. Its stock $CZR is extremely overvalued and unprofitable in a market climate that crushes such companies. Its price action consistently underperforms the overall market, and it will continue a downwards trend for the next several months.\n\n[Monthly Chart from 2017 to 2022. El Dorado acquired the larger Caesars Entertainment during the 2020 Corona Crash, temporarily saving both companies from bankruptcy. Opted for $CZR ticker and brand.](https://preview.redd.it/a9a4hlcmvqb91.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb1d2bf427b9844b578644e33d0cfa9d8070fbb)\n\nThe primary reason Caesars Entertainment is unprofitable is because of their crushing mountain of debt composed of variable interest rate loans (which increase as the Federal Reserve raises the key interest rate due to inflation) and high interest non-investment grade bonds.\n\n[High Debt with High\\/Variable Interest Rates. Previous financial reports denote the 4.5B variable interest rate loan maturing in 2024 as 4.5&#37; + LIBOR \\(3.9&#37; as of mid-July\\) currently totaling 8.4&#37; and rising.](https://preview.redd.it/uj6vi9xnvqb91.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=72044e7a5df8a647ca6e3e2ee4f8e783f2d01269)\n\n[Ratings of B1, B2, Caa1](https://preview.redd.it/szg8wdxpvqb91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=992eed3b7568201860bc29548271fba56567dc9e)\n\n[Literal Junk \\(Non-Investment Grade\\) Bonds](https://preview.redd.it/x3vds65rvqb91.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=d151c9027b69fe26e2951761b94e32f27a65297e)\n\nTo put this into perspective, here is a summary of their recent quarterly financial reports.\n\nAs you can see below, the interest payments cost approximately 550m-579m each quarter. Caesars' entire operating income (Total Revenue minus Cost of Revenue minus Operating Expense) ranges from 662m to -45m before interest. These interest payments are comparatively massive, and will only increase.\n\nFurthermore, their revenue is trending down while their *cost of revenue* and *operating expense* are trending up. Caesars explains it's primarily due to casino and pari-mutuel commission expenses meaning advertising, marketing, promotions, staffing, gaming costs, opening up casinos, etc. What's worrying is that despite spending more on what is ultimately a desire for customer growth, Caesars is showing decreasing customers/revenue for their efforts.\n\n[I can not emphasize enough how absurdly high these interest payments are on those junk bonds and variable interest rate loans.](https://preview.redd.it/kqkga26svqb91.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a8938530ea3b3b21af2d3f262613280f487ebaf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxv6uf7tvqb91.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f0316259c6dd0d8e6f1e6a88abd3903cbfa48f\n\nAdditionally, Caesar's real estate assets will decrease in value with the overall RE market as interest rates rise. They've already started selling assets in an attempt to deleverage and pay off interest + debt, but it is painstakingly difficult to find buyers willing to pay reasonable prices for their properties.\n\nThe 14b they have in debt doesn't even include their long-term capital lease obligations (they lease a lot of their casinos instead of owning them), which totals to an additional 12.5b in debt. They also have about 5b in current liabilities.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Caesars has about 5.1b current assets (allegedly, with 3.3b of that being assets held for sale), and 14.6b in PPE (Property Plant Equipment). The rest of their claimed assets equates to that load of horseshit called goodwill and intangibles.\n\nThis yields a net tangible assets/book value of -12b. Yes, *negative* 12b. No wonder there were bankruptcy concerns in 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8i8mt4uvqb91.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=f921ef45a7ba6cf568f28dc2fb8d3b6b30b0efc2\n\nCaesars' bleak financial outlook is not even close to being fully priced in.\n\nSee current earnings forecast/estimates with 0 revisions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iuenu36vvqb91.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=92ffea158ce92291b52345c8c91df60fbd4127ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzau9vyvvqb91.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=579c069bf6855bf7cabb635b246659ca5a95ab31\n\nPositions:\n\n$CZR 2022 Aug 12 Puts strike 45$CZR 2022 Aug 12 Puts strike 36\n\nI'm planning to hold through FOMC July 26-27, Q2 GDP July 28, and $CZR earnings August 2.\n\nEdit: Rolled the positions farther out by several months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85k9fdrwvqb91.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=252d4bc6a91e509e39ffd87266a82b7a1dfc435d\n\n[Heikin Ashi Candles, 3 Year Scale](https://preview.redd.it/k5l0o2gxvqb91.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bc6b60b64a2fad6dafc8032b52655f45c84e52a)\n\n[Daily Chart, 4 Month Scale](https://preview.redd.it/aaj7dow72xb91.png?width=2022&format=png&auto=webp&s=95a30c3c857d5a3bd4df31d036cc656021384055)\n\nNote potential technical convergence point.If $CZR can break through lower resistance, it's primed for another solid leg down.Otherwise, its price action may better align within the yellow channel rather than blue.\n\n[Daily Chart, 10 Month Scale. ](https://preview.redd.it/zsuw1k7t1xb91.png?width=2026&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc0b7ef5c9c6e7c693a61d5bcc0fbe657b2636f7)\n\nTL;DR: Puts on $CZR. Farther-dated contracts to target longer duration trend. e.g. Monthlies.\n\nEdit: Rolled my positions farther out. While $CZR has been underperforming the indices long-term, the market may have a bullish short term bounce. e.g. As of the 16th, the upcoming July Interest Rate hike estimate was just lowered to only a 29.1% chance of 100bps and 70.9% chance of 75bps hike. Down from a Wednesday peak of an 82% chance for 100bps.
