Buying NFLX pre-pandemic was solid move now with this market saturation, if they can't produce quality content with atleast 1 good show every month they are done. First order of business should be to stop the binge model. League Arcane showed that 3 week delivery works well and keeps suspence. The binge model worked to grow rapidly but with reduced show slate they need to think about that because they deliver 1 good show a month and you watch it in 2 days - so the attention retantion is very low, not a good mix. The old model 1 episode every week is also flawed because that is actually annoying to the viewer but I think that the 3 week - 3 episode delivery might be a key to new highs for Netflix. They can deliver less volume in terms of shows but higher quality and improve viewer experience and platform attention retantion which I think is one of their biggest problems at the moment.   \nAnother very weak side is subtitles. It should cost very little to attack foreign markets but you need the subtitles for it otherwise you are crippled.

Confirming what the book said.\n\nYou may be wondering how the max loss of the call wing was calculated. When the short call expires, you have to deliver 100 shares at $124. Since you don't have 100 shares, you end up short 100 shares but only receive $124 in return, despite the shares costing $131 to cover. So right off the bat you have a -$7/share liability, but let's continue.\n\nMeanwhile, the long call is exercised-by-exception and you must pay $128 and receive 100 shares.

The stock price has risen to 105. I obviously know that this option has made money, but how is the money made exactly?\n\nSome corrections:\n\n* We need to know the premium price (how much it cost to open) to know if it made money or not. If you paid $1 million for the call and it loses $12000 a day to theta decay, it is far more likely to have lost money than gained it to a 105 stock move (assuming it started at 100).\n\n* We also need to know the moneyness of the call at the time it was opened. If the stock started at $42 at open, making the call far OTM, a rise to $105 will make a lot more money for the call than if it started at $169 ITM and fell to $105.\n\n* But if you meant it started at 100 and ended up at 105, the call **may or may not have made money**. It isn't a sure bet that it made money just because the stock went up $5. Again, starting and ending premium price of the call is the most important factor here.\n\nExplainer for why a call doesn't necessarily make money just because the stock goes up: \n\n**FAQ: Why did my options lose value when the stock price moved favorably?**\n\n* [Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value)\n\n-------------------\n\nNow, to answer your question, it's actually quite simple. The reason a call contract gains value is *because the market bid the price up*. That's it. That's the whole reason. If the price of the call was originally $2.00 and the stock went up to $105, the market might decide it is now worth $2.69.\n\nWhen the market thinks a contract becomes more valuable, the price is bid up. If the market thinks a contract becomes less valuable, the price is bid down. Price is discovered through trading. That's the beginning and end of it.\n\n> Is the call sold back to a other buyer?\n\nThat is the best way, yes, though who the buyer is doesn't matter. If you buy shares of Apple stock and later sell them, do you think you sell those shares back to the same person you bought them from? No. Your mental model is you sell them on the open market. Options work the same way. So just think of options as stock that has a deadline. You trade them the same way, buy low, sell high at a later date, but before expiration. If you can't sell high at a later date, because the call's value was bid down, you might end up taking a loss. Exactly like shares.\n\n> Or is it exercised and now the trader and buys shares for 100 and then immediately sells it?\n\nThe big bold advisory at the top of this page is basically never exercise your option contracts and don't hold option contracts to expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45002084970474243}, {"body": "How do you choose a strike price for an option?\n\nIs it based on the options breakeven and you want your entry price to be that b/e price\n\n or \n\nbased on if you want to be itm or otm when the option expires?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "*Introductory Trading Commentary*   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;**[Monday School Introductory trade planning advice (PapaCharlie9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool)**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;*Strike Price*   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;[Options Basics: How to Pick the Right Strike Price (Elvis Picardo - Investopedia)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021014/options-basics-how-pick-right-strike-price.asp)  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;[High Probability Options Trading Defined (Kirk DuPlessis, Option Alpha)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWHh2co80M)   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;*Breakeven*  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp;[Your break-even (at expiration) isn't as important as you think it is (PapaCharlie9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6990928053855896}, {"body": "There is no sweat spot with strikes, unless you are selling. \n\nBuying ITM, ATM, OTM, and far OTM have their list of pros and cons", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43153318762779236}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4447256624698639}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The market index has been showing declining trends since January, and has not shown an upward trend, on a daily candle basis when looking at a three month period.  \n\nIf the market stays down, or resumes down trends, you may be losing on a long call or short put at 400.  \n\nAre you prepared to lose on the trade? \n\nCash can be a useful and strategic trading position.  \n\nThere are no medals given out for calling a bottom.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.025793908163905144}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.010023100301623344}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Options amount to a rental of a position.   \nEventually the lease is up, and if the underlying fails to gain, you have a loss.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.04722955822944641}, {"body": "CONS:\n\nSmaller profit", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02452259510755539}, {"body": "What expiration? \"LEAPS\" doesn't tell us how long to expiration, only that is might be more than 1 year.
