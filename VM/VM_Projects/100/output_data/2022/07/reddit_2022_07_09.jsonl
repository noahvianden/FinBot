{"title": "Giga Austin 2022 - Lounge Meetup Megathread", "selftext": "Let's use this thread to discuss all things Austin. Travel and stay plans. Lounge happy hour(s), breakfast, luncheon, poker & hookers, horsetrading, shooting the bird, etc. Anything you wanna do in Austin with fellow loungers, this is the thread to coordinate that. Also use this thread to post updates, pictures, videos from the Austin visit. Let the fun begin!\n\n**Below content added on 7/20:**\n\nWhat can we expect in the 2022 share holder meeting apart from the actual meeting itself? Anyone who attended past meetings in person? What was the experience like?\n\n2020 and 2021 meetings were f-ed by covid. 2020 meeting was combined with battery day. In-person attendees sat in Tesla cars in parking lots with the audio piped in through the car's audio system. 2021 meeting was virtual.\n\nThe last in-person meeting was in 2019. Check out this LA Times article to get the mood of those times: [https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-musk-annual-meeting-shareholders-20190611-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-musk-annual-meeting-shareholders-20190611-story.html) . Check the 2018 annual meeting media reports for even more chills. Can't believe many of us HODL'd and accumulated through those phases. Compared to those phases, ups and downs these days are really child's play. Those were the days when both the company's and Elon's future seemed a lot more risky.\n\nTesla has dubbed the 2022 meeting as Cyber Roundup. Why the Cyber branding? In a sense, this is Tesla's first in-person shareholder meeting as a big company, successful company with real rich shareholders. It would probably be the first real celebratory in-person shareholder meeting, Q2 results notwithstanding.\n\nHere are some things I am guessing / hoping for at the meeting:\n\n1. Factory tour, including the Gigapress in action.\n2. Up close and personal look at the Cybertruck. I hope they have several prototypes. I hope they have enough prototypes to give us joyrides.\n3. Optimus Prime prototype appearance... although this is probably reserved for AI day.\n4. New product announcements. There has not been much reporting about this, but Elon mentioned not too long ago that there are few new products waiting to be announced, and the announcements would need their own event(s). I hope the annual shareholder meeting qualifies for at least a few of those announcements.\n5. Some unique souvenir.\n6. Techno dance party?\n7.

I was already bearish though, so it\u2019s just feeding my bias. \n\nThe biggest thing that jumps out at me is sentiment vs actual positioning. I\u2019ve been saying this for a long time - but just because everyone is screaming something loudly does not mean it is reflected in their actions. Yes there is a lot of bearish sentiment, yet there is still relatively little bearish positioning.\n\nAnd the lazy comments on here, and the way it seems like so many people have no respect for debt or good economics makes you realize how lazy America has become. And why have we gotten lazy? It\u2019s pretty fucking simple - the fed printed money and put a band aid over a broken economy. There\u2019s something not right with our system. It\u2019s making Americans lazy, fat, arrogant, and entitled. \n\nMy personal thought is that a lot of the mentality has shifted that way because of the fed printing money. There have been no consequences for capital mis-allocation in the last 25 some odd years. There are numbers out there on zombie corporations - they are at all time highs. [link](https://m.dw.com/en/fed-may-finally-put-americas-zombie-firms-to-rest/a-62111545)\n\nMost alarming is that corporate debt is at an all time high, and there simply is not enough cash in existence to service that debt. [link](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/us-corporate-debt-hit-hard-inflation-shock-intensifies-economic-fears-2022-06-13/) I wonder how many shit companies out there with lazy management and a broken business model are going to fail as inflation continues to rise and the fed increases rates. According to Bloomberg, 20% of the top 3000 companies in the US are zombies. \n\nIs that the real bubble that pops this thing and sends us into a depression? It could be, who knows. I think that the US will be fine over the long term so long as the fed stops printing money and allows the economy to fix itself naturally. Let fucking winners win, reward the people and companies that are the most productive - the way it is supposed to be. It pisses me off that detailed analysis has less value than someone\u2019s gut feeling or opinion. \u201cYou can\u2019t time the market\u201d = fucking bullshit. It also pisses me off that bad companies get bailed out by big govt. Chroney capitalism. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if stopping the money printing meant a struggling US economy over the next 10 years. However, I do think if the fed keeps printing money then they all but guarantee war and an unproductive economy with a bunch of lazy citizens. The FED is trying to drive the country off of a fucking cliff.

And now we have the Curse of GME Stonk - If you bet against GME during the meme stock phase, you got trouble.

He lost 100% of his GME short position and has since [stopped publishing short reports](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qbfn5tftymfw/Amid-the-GameStop-Frenzy-Andrew-Left-Calls-It-Quits-On-Short-Reports-After-20-Years)\nOh and [his house was raided by the feds earlier this year](https://www.shacknews.com/article/128692/tsla-gme-short-andrew-left-of-citron-research-had-his-computers-seized-by-the-fbi-last-year)\n-- Robinhood - Stock is down 80% and even a FTX Billionaire Bro declined to buy 'em\n-- Vlad Tenev - Net worth down 90% and dude has been investigated by Feds and Congress. \n-- Citadel & Ken Griffin - Last seen digging himself into a [deeper hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uzbkk8/after_robinhood_melvin_capital_now_ken_griffin_jr/)\n\nMeanwhile in memeland: GME stock has stabilized, is doing a stock split and the company is moving aggressively with its growth plans.

Then things started shifting to more digital sales and publishers were happy because digital means no used copies to compete with, if someone wants to buy a digital copy, they have to pay the price the publisher asks, and the publisher can offer sales occasionally if they want, but they're in full control and get a large percent of the money from every sale.  \n\nFor like a decade now Steam has had the community market to allow users to buy and sell in game skins and shit if the dev wants to allow it, some games do, some don't. The ones that do, the devs get a cut of every skin traded on the market. That's the exact technology that would be required for reselling of game copies. The difference between crediting a skin to a user's steam account vs crediting a game copy to their account is a negligible amount of code. If Valve and its publisher partners thought that resale of used games on the market was a good and profitable idea, they would be doing it by now, but they aren't.  \n\nIf I'm Bethesda right now I can sell digital copies of Skyrim for $20 each (probably like $10 during holiday sales) and get like 70% of every sale.
