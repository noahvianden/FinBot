There should be an existing downtrend in place before the pattern occurs.\n2. The three lows should be roughly equal in price and spaced out from each other. While the price doesn't have to be exactly equal, it should be reasonably close to the same price, such that a trendline is horizontal.\n3. The volume should drop throughout the pattern in a sign that bears are losing strength, while bullish volume should increase as the price breaks through the final resistance.\n\nUsed some crayons for those that can't read.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/xV5dIfa\n\n2) This is the longest period of 100% borrow utilization for GME including prior to the January squeeze.
