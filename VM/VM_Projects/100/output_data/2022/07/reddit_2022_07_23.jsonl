Figure out how much you need per year in $$ for living expenses (food/ shelter/ etc...)\n2. Subtract out the above number with your projected SS (yours and spouse if applicable)\n3.

It makes everything SO. MUCH. EASIER.  \n\n\nThe way I see it...  You have these very basic types of \"assets\". \n\ntrades, growth investments, and asset holdings. \n\nHoldings are equity that is leveraged by a bank or lender for liquidity.  Holdings are the opposite of liquid assets.  Liquid assets like CASH travel at the spend of transaction and lust and immediately turn into things and services you want.  \n\nFor the sake of arguement, holdings like like gold bars, land, buildings, or directly registered shares (not in a broker/broker's street name) majorly STABLE companies (Berkshire, coca cola, and I don't want to name any more because I don't want to get yelled at).  You can't easily change these things into goods, services or tradable assets (like stocks). \n\nLiquidity is used to buy things, anything and everything.  Services, Goods, Tradable Assets, Growth Investments and Holdings.  You can increase liquidity buy earning money (selling your own service), having someone just give it to you,  or by selling less liquid assets for more than what you paid for them. If your adept, you could paid other people to do service for you and then collect the profits made from all of the service being done for you. \n\nThis will all come together, I promise. \n\nCash has a certain type of inherent risks, opportunity and opportunity cost.  \n\nInflation (at whatever rate) will ensure your cash is always worth less tomorrow than it is today.  If you only keep your wealth in cash, them you are certain to have less wealth over time by design of the market system and economy.\n\nSomeone can take it/steal it by force.  You could lose on the street or in a fire. Someone could fraud you for it, or hack your banking password/access card.  \n\nBut you can trade it for anything at any time. Super powerful.  If you have enough you can buy a holding (land, company shares in your name, gold bars), a growth investment like SPY ETF or pay an investment firm to manage/join a fund, a tradable asset, like something posted on the bets sub, or hookers and blow.  \n\nHOLDing assets are stable but not liquid on their own.  A nice position of yourname/owned stable company shares (not broker owned shares), gold bars and land (ironically the \"gold\" standard of stable asset) hold value in, traditionally, the most stable way.  Gold bars are hard to steal, Berkshire and coca cola are likely not going anywhere, and land is unlikely to be swallowed up by the sea or become unhabitable.  But these are very hard to trade your hookers, blow, or cereal directly or quickly.  \n\nGROWTH INVESTMENT, like the spy index your talking in between, and the risk/opportunity cost you kind of wrapped that up nicely yourself.  You've got a good idea that it will increase, but it's not a guarantee.  \n\nYou have to manage your risks and divide your wealth amongst those risks.  \n\nIf banks and lenders like you (and your holding assets), you can get great liquidity loans base of your charm, last name, profession and number of gold bars you have. This gives you cash.  If you have enough growth investments generating enough liquidity to pay for your liquidity loans and other liquidity needs, you don't need to actually DO anything anymore really.  \n\nSo...  You want to hold as much wealth that is needed (by your determination) in HOLDing assets that will back enough sustainable liquidty to accomplish the things you want.  Like, retire, pay for your kids' school, generational wealth creation,  world domination - whatever it is that gets you out of bed in the morning. The end of the road is not index funds. \n\nUse cash to buy tradeable wall street bets options and generate profit for growth investments like spy indexes, and then use that profit to organize into holdings that belong to you, like 5 shares of Berkshire registered in your own name, gold bars, and larger and larger chucks of land in your favourite neighbourhood.  \n\nSo you can't get a line of credit with your index fund position (not one worth agreeing to anyways).  You can, however, get a line of credit based your 5 shares of Berkshire and 10,000 shares of coca cola, and probably with more favourable terms and control than what a broker will give you. \n\nThese are easier to acquire and more simple to own than gold bars, or land.  Until, at least, you have enough to trade for gold bars and land. \n\nIn sum.
