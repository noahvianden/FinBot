{"title": "Wall Street Newsletter 8 : Stock market prediction for \u201cJuly\u201d month using pure logic based analysis. Hell ? or Slow death ?", "selftext": "[Happy 4th of July](https://preview.redd.it/47q88fk5xk991.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3183e10acf30fd7472ab5d708da553b757473db5)\n\n**Hey you on the other side,**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes it\u2019s you I'm talking to. C'mon don\u2019t look away. What are you doing here reading this sh9tpost? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be out enjoying the 4th of July all day? \n\nC'mon now please don't tell me you don't have friends. Even geeky people do have someone. And if you really don\u2019t then go get your keys and wallet and drive straight to your family or relatives. Today is the day the United States was declared independent by Continental Congress on 4th July, 1776 when American colonies threw off the yoke of British rule and adopted the Declaration of Independence. \n\nToday is not the day you are supposed to be sitting, crying or sobbing in your room all alone. So just go out there, definitely go wild and just be free for this day and I mean in a good way. Definitely not going all terminator today. I highly discourage you to do that ever in your life. In morning just go visit and later have lunch and discuss some serious issues that need to be addressed and raise awareness. \n\nIf you're from the investing world go tell the true truth and i mean the real one we learn everyday which some of the people from other sectors really don't know about. Because the media both social and televised one kinda brainwashes people with wrong facts or when the event is at its highest peak. And then later at night enjoy the fireworks and definitely get drunk.\n\nSo from the bottom of my heart i.e. ventricles i congratulate you a \u201cHappy 4th of July\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This post is meant to be read on 5th July 2022.\n* Tl:dr people go scroll down and read the conclusion and the result part.\n* This analysis is meant for beginner and intermediate level people in Wall Street. Definitely Not for expert level. For them i recommend reading Wall Street Specials where i just basically rewrote Block works macro awesome podcast called \"Collapsing liquidity\" with a little spice of my own.\n* This post is a combination of Technical Analysis, data and some basic fundamental analysis.\n* This is not financial advice, oh wait a sec it is financial advice. Oh wait it's not oh wait yes it is. Wtf is wrong with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Respected Traders and Investors,** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoly shit i think i fucked up. Sorry about this nuclear S and F bomb i dropped on you especially traders. So please bear with me. Okay!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Previously on Wall Street :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Post June Fomc rally. Green candles in July, August.](https://preview.redd.it/th5a2s9tyk991.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=4137fd59a019326ee7850379ee2566b4c1a4c38e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy old viewers know that I called for a March post Fomc rally then a Q3 rally where the bottom will be June Fomc and then post Fomc we rally and hence July and August will be green on monthly candles. Only to crash starting September triple witching week or October 23-27.\n\nif you remember guys i was quite adamant that i wont flip flop from my predictions which i made back in April when March rally was fading. Well folks, I have to say I'm about to flip flop now. Now I could be right and we go up but the odds of me being wrong have definitely gone up. \n\nSo in this post I will address how I am about to be wrong, my reasons for it and at last an experiment demonstrating with chart where we will fall and then rise and then fall and then rise and then fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So the sentence have now become like this** \n\n**\u201cWe make a bottom on July 26-30 either in July fomc or Gdp July 28 Q2 adv est\u201d And now after making a bottom and pricing recession we go up in August for a bear market rally and then we sell out somewhere in August making a bottom in September. Now my guess is it's gonna be a week of triple witching. But let's see later on that.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before we begin let\u2019s take a deep breath and now please shit as much as you can on me in the comments down below. I definitely deserved that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now after shitting lets see how much of a loss i made for you guys.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're my old viewers, you know I told to \u201cDca index, especially Nasdaq somewhere in June fomc\u201d and cautioned not to gamble on stocks here because if you really wanna do then find something that won't get Fud.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2.5&#37; up doesn't look bad :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9dup38kwzk991.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9cca566ce98655f4bc8e6e4dd7237e87367e2db)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell look at that we were supposed to follow a green path ( min a short or max a big one ) but look like we are unable to break the red Ketlner line and are probably heading down. But currently we are making a profit of 2.5%. So i guess ahhh not that bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Now lets Experiment : Swing trade July.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For people :** \n\n* This advice is mostly meant for traders and not investors whose investing goal is in a long term horizon lets say minimum 15 yrs. \n* My investing approach is simple Dca at key levels. Have cash in hand plus a secured job to be ready for Dow Jones -89% drop or falling around 200 monthly moving average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy own one trick pony approach : Swing the 2nd bear market rally and let\u2019s sit on the sidelines until there is at least -50%+ in all indices. You could also short after selling in bear market rally that is entirely up to you.\n\nFor no risk investors like billionaires : Just sit out and don\u2019t enter until Dow hits 200 mma. Park your cash with mmf in and only in rrp. Even liquid funds ex : t-bills aren\u2019t safe due to Paul volcker rate risk. Forget about keeping the money in the bank cause there will be a bank run if depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hypothesis :**\n\n* July we get -2% above contraction in the economy and also in July, August estimates.\n* We are not in a depression coz then these rules will fail and we just keep going down till November 2024.\n* A 3 factor world analysis including Gdp, Inflation and Fomc.\n* Markets are always forward looking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The reason why i\u2019m wrong :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[New York and Atlanta Fed negative estimates.](https://preview.redd.it/6gxy5f011l991.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=c46aca278cd3f44e534d53acd7939f8d9b902ce0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s pretty simple. There are 12 Federal banks in the United states of America. Out of which 2 of them recently came up with their Gdp forecast. These 2 banks have pretty good reputation and are certainly getting traction in the Twitter and Reddit world. So here\u2019s what they said.\n\nThe New York Fed released a Dyse model forecast on 16th June  ( which they say is not from them but c'mon it\u2019s on their website. Hence maybe signalling something ) that Gdp of Usa was expected to drop to 0.9 in march but they have now revised it to -0.6 in June. \n\nThe Atlanta Fed on the other hand previously had Gdp forecast around -1%. But then came a shock on July 1st when Atlanta Fed have revised their Gdp forecast to -2.1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean is you may ask. \n\nWell one conclusion is simply that now the market will price this in. Meaning it will make a lower low. It didn\u2019t get time on Friday but it nearly left an impression that it will go and test that support region it made after the Swiss franc surprise hike by 50bps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical data for recession :** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blue line : JHGDP \\( Gdp based recession indicator \\) , Orange line : Gdp yoy , Graph : SPX ](https://preview.redd.it/4cznen3s1l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=daab3a1305e03545f215b8c43d0f2afe695920e8)\n\nSo we established above that the market will make a lower low to price recession. But what does it mean to price ? \n\nIt means that markets will make a drop to -30%+ above by September. Don't forget we have discounted QT. But since i established earlier that this explanation is to a basic and intermediate audience therefore we won't dive into that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this chart above tell us ?\n\nIt tells us that markets have priced out recession before the Gdp yoy growth fell to 0. The red circles below represent that. Meaning before final September Gdp data we might have bottomed providing if Gdp yoy doesn't fall more in Q3 or Q4 adv est data. ( Meaning if we do then make new LL in Gdp contraction and hence more price dropping ) \n\nThe only two circumstance it didn\u2019t was Stagflation of 70\u2019s and 2008 recession. But why must the question be in your mind? The answer is pretty much simple. The Gdp yoy fell even more afterwards. So unless there was a proper bottom for Gdp the markets didn\u2019t stop making lower lows.\n\nNow there is an anomaly represented by a yellow circle. It\u2019s called the dotcom recession where the Gdp fell dramatically by earnings recession. Though the Orange line i.e our yoy Gdp never fell below 0 but there was a recession. Quite strange perhaps but we will fit this in our recession pricing going forward cause we are doing a simple analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now let's take all the recession into account.\n\nNote : % = ( ( L - H ) / H ) \\* 100 where L = low , H = high of candles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll data is in monthly charts because I'm not that free. Also I'm not using Dow Jones which I should but I'm not. But I should. Damn it's happening again. 400 Bad request.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1970-71 recession ( red circle no 1 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $109.37 ( Dec 1968 ) , L : $68.61 ( May 1970 ) , Crash : -37.267%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1974-75 recession  ( green circle no 1 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $121.74 ( Jan 1973 ) , L : $60.96 ( Oct 1974 ) , Crash : -49.926%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1980\u2019s recession ( red circle no 2 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $120.22 ( Feb 1980 ) , L : $94.23 ( Mar 1980 ) , Crash : -21.618%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1981-82 recession ( red circle no 3 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $141.96 ( Nov 1980 ) , L : $102.20 ( Aug 1982 ) , Crash : -28.007%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1990\u2019s-91 recession ( red circle no 4 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $369.78 ( Jul 1990 ) , L : $294.51 ( Oct 1990 ) , Crash : -20.355%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 2001 dot com recession ( yellow circle.

Sorry guys it's getting long and boring but honestly this is my way of doing things manually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let\u2019s deep dive into the Key events :**\n\nThere are only three events we need to watch for. \n\n* Inflation i.e Consumer Price Index\n* Fed Fomc\n* Gdp advanced estimates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Gdp comes in groups of three. Adv, second and final. Second and final will be released in August and September respectively. Usually they are all the same but this inflation swindler can f things up if it persists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Aladdin Software xD](https://preview.redd.it/tzazplxq4l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7aa658cc3d6d66fa077541574c2dc0c9b755bae)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut before we do that let me quickly go and grab someone\u2019s computer in Black rock. For those who don\u2019t know that I'm a toilet cleaner at Black rock. xD Running joke it is or is it not ;)  \n\nOkay I'm logging in guys and I'm opening this \u201cAladdin'' management software. So here\u2019s basically what it does in a three factor world.\n\nWe will be distributing points from now. As we all know data is either a hit or miss. A miss can be a miss to higher or lower. A hit is exactly as the estimates say meaning they are already priced in by the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is how the point distribution system will work.\n\nA miss to lower : +1\n\nA hit : 0\n\nA miss to higher : -1 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : In case anyone wants this full software for their company or for individual purposes just give $5M dollar to Jamie Dimon. He will get it installed for you right away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s now head back to our events\n\n**Inflation : July 13th 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cpi](https://preview.redd.it/4yqys1d35l991.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ee7bfeff4c055ef0177a961ab8c11c61f6e526)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm expecting it to come around est. 8.4% or is it 8.2% Just do check guys it's wrong in this photograph.\n\nAnd do remember if less then  +1\n\nIf higher then  -1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fed Fomc : July 26-27th 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fed monitor](https://preview.redd.it/onqmbme85l991.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=34a68c31fc0fdfa284b2f0826984e2cb01fb2152)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf 100 bps we fall : -1\n\nIf 75 bps sideways : 0. This is being projected by Fed monitor\n\nIf 50 bps we rally : +1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gross Domestic Product : July 28th 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGdp miss to higher : -1\n\nGdp hit estimates : 0 Currently markets have not priced Gdp estimates i.e. full definition of recession. We will discuss later how much it has priced. \n\nGdp miss to lower : +1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf market are forward looking they will price everything before September. Meaning markets will price somewhere b/w -20.34% to -49.93% if there is no banking crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What has been priced for recession :**\n\nCurrently ( as of 4th July 2022 )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS&P 500 - H : $4818.62 ( 4th Jan 2022 ) , L : $3636.87 ( 17th June 2022 : This number looks very funny i\u2019m starting to doubt myself xD ) \n\nCrash calculation : -24.524%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n% of recession priced in by markets  = ( x% ( currently ) / historical recession low ) x 100 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest case pure recession : Historical recession low = -20.34%\n\nProbability % = 100% already priced in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Everyone is looking at it)\\*\\* Average case pure recession : Historical recession low = -37.505%\n\nProbability % = (24.524/37.505) x 100 = 65.3886% \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Me) Worst case pure recession : Historical recession low = -49.93%\n\nHence probability % = 49% something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat this tells us is that markets are pricing in kinda worst case recession around 50%. As it should because we got one negative quarter of Gdp.\n\nSo if we get another negative quarter in July 28, then the market will start pricing another 50% if worst case recession till September final estimates for Q2. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now comes two scenarios :**\n\nCase a)\n\nWhat if i\u2019m wrong again? And market just prices full on recession in July itself and then we start moving up. Then market will just drop -50% from Ath in July itself. You should be just buying puts of 1 month expiry July 28 or later.  If you think that the case is. \n\nCase b)\n\nAnd if you still trust me and kinda liked my analysis until now. Here\u2019s what the market will do exactly and kinda dance on my whim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Two : 15&#37; bear market rally , One : 23&#37;+ bear market rally. Dates are given in chart](https://preview.redd.it/muij34ds7l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ed6ab65db8fdb86910b0103328f8497a77007b)\n\n[This is worst case recession probabilities.](https://preview.redd.it/mebvh5ds7l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7a3b03f907135394d5ab6a4e5f5eabbc434b4a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t do anything until September if you can't comprehend what the chart is showing you above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat this is basically telling you is there is gonna be a two 15% rally starting July (one around Cpi and other around Gdp) and one 26% rally in August. Around September Fomc is where you will get your bottom and then the market might have priced in probability % of 99% by then of worst case recession. So that takes S&P500 to $2400-$2600 range. \n\nExact number would be $245X . Now this X is something i don't know. So range is $2450-$2460.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could be wrong here and i really need to just quit posting sh9t. Or markets starts pricing in things after july 28 and hence eventual bottom will then be a day before September Fomc just like it was for June Fomc bottom and things started pricing in after April Gdp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Current levels as of now are higher than bear market tops will be. So don't forget to sell everything if swinging and trusting this case b).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beta calculations :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor this i will take just Nasdaq. You guys can calculate beta for your own stocks in a similar manner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Beta](https://preview.redd.it/7krhxcwi8l991.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ea74a58656625253601510fd7fbe9f25f7d567)\n\nHere is how it goes.\n\nWe know that NDX/SPY = 1.29 or sometimes 1.30. So providing if beta remains constant then if price of SPY moves down by -24.524% then the Nasdaq must have made low\u2019s higher than beta multiply SPY downfall i.e. NDX drop > 24.524% x 1.29 = 31.63%.\n\nHence NDX fall > 31.63% which actually was 34%. So not exactly close but definitely higher than 31% assumed. Here are pictures down below to prove it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY, NDX](https://preview.redd.it/ok1226fn8l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9025a5d3753695a3d3c8dafa80997b3b9944791a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow to use this knowledge ?\n\nWell if we assume SPX will fall around 49% then NDX will fall 49% x 1.29 = 63.91% roughly 64% by september. Since the NDX fall won't be exactly 64% but higher and if i roughly wanna assume what that number will be in case i\u2019m betting this on a casino table of billionaires or millionaires then i would i bet NDX fall by roughly 69% something for sure. xD \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other way we can interpret beta is with volatility\n\n.\n\n* A stock with beta greater than 1 tends to be more volatile whereas stock with beta less than 1 tends to be slow.\n* It can also be used to measure volatility of stock against its sector.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Volatility and beta are not the same thing. Also V asset class especially V king have beta higher than 1.67 so for them above 83% drop is coming.\n\nVolatility Example: if a stock such as Microsoft has an annual volatility of 40%, then it would be expected to move up or down 40% in price on an annual basis.\n\nBeta Example: if a stock such as Microsoft has a beta 1.26 in relation to the S&P 500 Index ( SPX ), it would be expected to move at a rate of 126% of the fluctuation of the SPX. (This beta is calculated over a period of months and does not necessarily hold true on a daily basis.) The higher the beta, the more volatile the stock. A beta of less than one indicates that the stock's price is more stable than the market (in general and over a long time period).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation : Here\u2019s why i could be wrong. Case a)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNew York Fed forecasted in March (read above sheet of Nyc. march 0.9) that Gdp will be positive. So the market being a voting machine in near term didn\u2019t price anything until we got close to that April advanced Gdp estimates which signaled start pricing in recession and till final estimate Gdp month we completed a worst case 50% probability recession. \n\nBut this time around the Atlanta and New york Fed has forecasted a recession already. So maybe it\u2019s time to increase from 50% to almost 99% in July itself. And after that we go up. \n\nTbh, this sounds stupid. Markets will die, banks will get broke and all our friends in Apple, Google Microsoft, Facebook except Tesla ( they are prepared ) will be crying because of huge layoffs. Because then it could signal a depression is coming and this 50% drop is just nothing as compared to -89% Dow Jones drop. Plus Fed is still buying Mbs and selling so low bonds. Man the bank reserves are just not there i guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nIf total pts >= 1 :  We are going straight up after July Gdp estimates. Not directly the day after.\n\nif total pts 0 :       We bear market rally like told above in graph\n\nif total pts <= -1  : Bear market rallies will be tough and not that higher. Don\u2019t bet on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Result :**\n\nCase 1 : ( Highly unlikely )\n\nJuly destruction : Price -50% right here right now by July 28 and open the doors for depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 2 : ( Most likely )\n\nCalm selloff : Two 15% rally and one 23%+ rally in august. On 20th September a day before Fomc we bottom. ( because last time it was on the day. Swiss franc was an exception won't count. And in march it was a day before too ) After that we shall see. Also we make a lower low from here now to July 28 because Gdp estimates aren\u2019t priced by markets. \n\nI like my odds with case 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 3 : So where did this come from. Well it's from my tweet. As I must have said on the latest tweet by institutional level analysis. $2800 - $3200 is the true range for recession because below this institutions believe financial system will struggle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons why number $2800 and $3200 :\n\n200wMA was the last time SPX bounced from and it could go a little lower due to QT. Hence this number is on everyone's lips nowadays and you must have heard on news many times.\n\nThe $2800 number is pretty easy. It\u2019s the average recession drop number around 37-38% that we calculated above. For Michael Burry this is the number coming and after this Fed will start QE again. Let\u2019s see if he right. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closing thoughts :**\n\nThat\u2019s all I have to say guys. I think i didn't do a great job explaining as i'm busy doing other things. You guys can perhaps improve the model better. My twitter post is kinda weird. It's based on institutional levels sh9t. Meaning think of it as someone sitting in Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan are doing things. \n\nI just try to give my original content only here for guys because I believe in the future of this platform.
