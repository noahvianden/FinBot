Look at each company. If you think it will go out of business, sell the stock now. If you think it's a survivor, sit back, hold it, and catch your breath.\n\nGiven that we find ourselves in bear country, stocks ARE likely to drift lower, but they will recover.

And then, when the difficult reality that this easy money can take years of knowledge and practice to mostly get right, they beat themselves up over their mistakes.\n\nYou can reduce your cost basis on your stocks with options by selling covered calls (a bearish strategy). Set the strike out to where you can just above break even if it gets assigned, and forget. Even for a few cents per cycle, you would have brought your CB down by the time the economy recovers. Please understand that this is a defensive strategy and is more complex than I have just described, involving changing the strike  points as your CB changes over time. Do not get involved with buying options, only selling them.\n\nEven if stocks drop further, as long as you do not sell, IMO this may help safeguard you through the storm to some degree.

After all there is almost no benefit to losing money. \nSome of the reasons a person may want to lose some money are:\nTo offset gains and lower their tax bracket, prevent a spouse from getting the money in a divorce, etc.\nWhile you may think it\u2019s super easy to lose money while trading stocks; this is false. The stock market will always try to trick you. So while you try to lose you may actually gain.\n\nThe main strategy for losing money is buy high, sell low. This way your stocks always lose.\nBecause market timing can be difficult an even simpler solution is to follow my portfolio and do exactly what I do. \nIm not perfect and occasionally I dont lose money on my trades. However, for the most part this is the simplest way to guarantee overall losses.\n\nOne more thing to remember: if you don\u2019t sell you didn\u2019t lose money so make sure to sell the dips.\n\n\nChapter 2: How to make money in the stock market\n\n\nIt goes without saying that this is the goal most people have when investing their money. Ideally as a trader we want our profit to cover taxes and inflation at a minimum. \nLoads and loads of books have been written with different strategies and techniques to time the market, set up trades and ultimately profit from the stock market. Most of these strategies require following complex patterns and following the markets closely to buy and sell at the right times.\n\nIn simpler terms the strategy is buy low, sell high. A lot easier said than done. \nIn this book we will explore a much simpler methodology based on basic logic that almost anyone can achieve.\n\nAs already talked about in chapter 1, I will consistently lose money. It\u2019s just me. When markets were up and inexperienced traders were making 100s and 1000s of percentage points, majority of my trades still resulted in red. \n\nWhile unfortunate for me, as I only trade to try and make money, this is very fortunate for all of you. \n\nThe same way one can lose money by following my strategy exactly, one can simply reverse this strategy for guaranteed wins. Simply watch my portfolio and everytime I make a move you do the opposite. I buy , you short. I sell, you cover. \n\n\u2026.\n\n\nIt\u2019s still a work in progress obviously but keep an eye on bookstores near you.

I am up 29% ytd. I wish there was a way I could communicate my procedure but it's very lengthy to describe. I'll give you the summary. #1, build good stock screeners. Mine are saved in Fidelity. I've got about five styles each with several parameters that must be met to be in the results. #2, convert each list into a \"watch list\" using the same name i. e. \"Beat up no Reason\"  etc. #3, using Active Trader Pro I have a custom interface saved with my charts and indicators in place. This sounds complicated but once it's set up, it opens the same every time. This also needs a picture which I can do if someone is that serious to see it. Within my set up are one year, six month and three month based charts (on tabs, but six month is on top) another cluster has one month and daily in tabs (just for in the moment viewing) #4 I use about six primary indicators that are stacked on top of one another. Stochastic, StochRSI, MFI, CMO, RSI, and MacD. #5, my watch lists are screen left bottom, just under held positions screen left top. Charts are screen right entire height.\nHere's my strategy (which is not 100% correct all the time. There are many times I get in to early and I have to watch it go down a little before it comes back up) I follow and view charts of major indices plus a few ETFs like IVV, IUSV, IUSG, & SPY, DJI etc.\nYou can see the indicator line for each of those mentioned move from up (like over bought) and down (over sold) each indicator has known trigger values that you can find and with ATP those trigger lines are already populated. So #6 major index and broad etfs all need to be down below the trigger line. All of them, or I do not buy. (and this is on the six month chart. Not day trading) then I click on each of my watch list stocks (I limit my list to ten for each style) I click and view the indicators to see if any are, once again all indicators below trigger line. This is a waiting game. And usually I find that most stocks will go down together with the broad market. So when one is a buy, there is usually a couple more as well.\n#6 When to sell. For this I use the three month chart because it is more volatile and moves to trigger faster than the six month. When all (ALL) of the indicators are up top trigger line, I sell.\nSome of my recent BUYS & SELLS, EPAM, IIVI, HCKT, MGA, OC, ABBV, MMM and CC. Within this year.\nI may never go into the same stock twice maybe I would. But I update my stock screener list and watch list about every three to four months. Sometimes the same stocks are populated sometimes its all new list.\nI try to not get emotional about purchases nor time to sell. I don't fall in love with any stock. My hold time will vary depending on how long it takes from six month chart buy trigger to three month chart sell trigger.\nDon't give up. Educate yourself. Back date your ideas and theories.

Anyone understanding this wasn't caught off guard this year. A ripping dollar and soaring commodities is bearish for stocks and bonds.\n\n\nGet a money management system. In the beginning no one trade should be larger than 10% of your portfolio and your risk tolerance on that trade should be 10% as this will only be a risk of 1% loss to the portfolio.\n\n\nLearn the difference between catching a falling knife and placing a trade on a mean-reversion.

I see no other auto manufacturer putting such an emphasis on safety.  \n\nWith Autopilot on:\n\n* Q4 2021: one accident for every 4.31 million miles driven\n\nAutopilot off:\n\n* Q4 2021: one accident for every 1.59 million miles driven\n\nAutopilot, while still not fully baked, is by far, safer than a human operator.  Is it \"perfect\" no.  But it is undeniably safer.\n\nThe amount of scrutiny and criticism towards Tesla is unfounded and boarding absurd.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Now you are just doing tech propaganda \ud83e\udd23 Beta testing on human lives, fun.\n\nAnyways, take care.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You too.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2721022665500641}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21183942258358002}], "tickers": ["tsla", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10774559527635574}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.020041216164827347}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23975081741809845}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4699312448501587}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4472247362136841}], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08215826004743576}, {"body": "Saw a Tesla on fire right outside the dealership I work at", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "did you? prove it you half brain", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Oh look, a Tesla shill whining", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just said I saw one on fire how does that make me a shill??", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4645999073982239}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Sent you proof :p", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24130971729755402}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10385677218437195}, {"body": "Yeh I got proof", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12368322163820267}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "If I had any money I'd dump it all into TSLA.
