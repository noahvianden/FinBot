New cars, I believe we could be in the 80% area by 2030.  Sure it's ambitious but we have many catalysts lining up.  But guessing at timelines is pretty pointless.  At this point it's clear EV's are far superior tech and in 20 or 25 whatever years most all vehicles on the road (personal and transport) will be EV's.  The tech and cost savings is just that good.  \n\nHow to play this is another matter since quite a few people see the same trend emerging, obvious stocks like TSLA are quite overpriced while traditional automakers like Ford (the best positioned) are still going to be dealing with significant headwinds from the chip shortage, a recession, a largely unionized workforce and a dying network of dealers.  \n\nOne interesting area that stands to grow significantly is EV charging infrastructure.  If you look at the growth of Tesla's supercharging network along side their growth in vehicle production, and then you extrapolate that now that we are actually just starting to see non-tesla EV's go mainstream, there's going to be a huge demand for national networks of fast chargers.  Where Tesla customers overwhelmingly use Tesla superchargers, nearly every customer who buys a ford or gm or rivian is going to signup with chargepoint, blink ect.  \n\nWe're also already seeing a huge push from governments and companies to partner with these companies to install charging stations across the country.   Just think, nearly every parking garage and street parking location is going to need to wire for charging for people without a garage.  \n\nThinking longer term 10-20 year timeframe with bi-directional charging Utility companies will essentially get millions of free load stabilizers plugged in all over.  Instead of having build out peak power capacity, all the EV's in a particular city (or even down to the street level) that are plugged in can just offload 1% of their battery to the grid.  In exchange for letting the utilities use something like 3% of their battery capacity vehicle owners will get discounted charging rates.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "\nHello!

Many people don't realise yet that a brand new $70K Tesla Model Y is cheaper to own and operate over a 5 year term of ownership than a $20K second hand ICE vehicle, assuming average mileage per year. If you're able to afford the sticker price of an EV (or second hand models become affordable), it's a no brainer already today.

Assuming the car market recovers to pre-pandemic levels as EVs become available, that's ~10M sales per year.\n\nEven if Tesla's ASPs come down a bit to ~50K as they have to introduce a cheaper model, and if margins stop increasing, they'd be doing roughly 10M * 50K * 19% = $104.5B in net income from cars alone by 2030. With a conservative PE of 20 (seeing as they'd be growing earnings roughly 45% annually throughout the decade), that's around $2T in market cap.\n\nRealistically I think their margins will continue to increase with increased scale, ASPs will not decline, the PE will not be below 40 and they'll sell 20-25% of the EV market instead of 10%, so I think the potential market cap from automotive alone is at least $6T by 2030.\n\nAnd then there's everything else they're doing that's just a bonus.
