Powell, the Fed chair, said policymakers would now set rates meeting by meeting rather than committing to a broad plan well in advance. Investors took that as a sign that the central bank was likely to slow rate moves sharply in the coming months as the economy slows. In fact, bond market pricing suggests that investors think officials may even begin to cut interest rates next year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the bond market is looking at in reaching that conclusion,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said, adding that the bar would be \u201cvery, very high\u201d to lower rates.", "id": "wbmzfw", "created_utc": 1659149709.0, "score": 298, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We've already seen above cheap transport has lost its \"cheap\" qualifier. So how about that fertiliser? \n\n[Here are the world's top fertiliser exporters](https://www.worldstopexports.com/top-fertilizers-exports-by-country/)\n\n1. Russia: US$12.5 billion (15.1% of total exported fertilizers)\n2. China: $10.9 billion (13.3%)\n3. Canada: $6.6 billion (8%)\n4. Morocco: $5.7 billion (6.9%)\n5.

May 11th, 2022\n\n\"**Record-high input costs**. Rising natural gas prices, especially in Europe, led to widespread production cutbacks in ammonia\u2014an important input for nitrogen-based fertilizers.  Similarly, soaring prices of coal in China, the main feedstock for ammonia production there, forced fertilizer factories to cut production, which contributed to the increase in urea prices. Higher prices of ammonia and sulfur have also driven up phosphate fertilizer prices. \" (Excerpt from the link above)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne more for the road?\n\nThis image should help visualise just how much more farmland is available now thanks to modern farm inputs.

Something we make a lot of here in the US. We have a lot of natural gas here simply as a by-product of fracking. Potash is abundant in Canada, and it's what they use to make their fertiliser. Therefore I am investing in nitrogen and potash fertiliser-producing companies based in the US. Because their major ingredients are all within the country or north America. And now will have a much higher demand. \n\n**TLDR / Conclusion:**\n\n**Here are the companies I will personally buy into for the long term. This is not financial advice.**\n\n* **( CF ) C.F.

Russian invasion of Ukraine, well, Russian is definitely not going to be able to keep this up forever, and the chance of further escalation is near zero. 2. Recession is here, but it s a technical recession triggered by inflation and supply side disruption, and with employment and consumer spending keeping strong, the impact is more technical and temporary. 3. Covid, well, we do have the super infectious BA5 variant, but thanks to vaccine, treatment and the relatively mild symptom, we are coping with this latest variant. \n\nSo, as long as we don\u2019t see significant change from these major issues, I think we are around the bottom and will see small upside to end the year.
