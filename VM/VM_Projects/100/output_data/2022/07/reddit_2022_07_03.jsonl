Not any time soon IMO. We may see north of 200 after the end of  the tightening cycle, and we go back to easy money, but that will be in 5 years or more.\n\nWhat happens to the stock depends on the growth story that nvidia puts forward. Can nvidia justify having an inflated P/E? Right now, no.\n\nI say this as someone holding 100 shares of nvidia at 240$. I would not have paid 240$ for nvidia; it was a gamble on a put that bit me when Brainard came out overly hawkish early in the year, and the stock tanked over 60$ in a day. Due to some life issues I was unable to buy back the put before it was assigned. I have been contemplating selling since, but kept selling CCs on the rallies. I am still thinking of selling, since the downside potential of nvidia right now could easily put it under 100$/share for years.\n\nShort term -> Downside to less than 100$/share.\n\nMedium term -> May go back up after easy money cycle resumes.
