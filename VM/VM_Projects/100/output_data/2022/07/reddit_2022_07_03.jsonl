Not any time soon IMO. We may see north of 200 after the end of  the tightening cycle, and we go back to easy money, but that will be in 5 years or more.\n\nWhat happens to the stock depends on the growth story that nvidia puts forward. Can nvidia justify having an inflated P/E? Right now, no.\n\nI say this as someone holding 100 shares of nvidia at 240$. I would not have paid 240$ for nvidia; it was a gamble on a put that bit me when Brainard came out overly hawkish early in the year, and the stock tanked over 60$ in a day. Due to some life issues I was unable to buy back the put before it was assigned. I have been contemplating selling since, but kept selling CCs on the rallies. I am still thinking of selling, since the downside potential of nvidia right now could easily put it under 100$/share for years.\n\nShort term -> Downside to less than 100$/share.\n\nMedium term -> May go back up after easy money cycle resumes.

Also the caveat that I'm mostly just keeping up with the market on the majors through outside news since I work for an independent upstream only company.\n\nMy take is that in the mid 2010s, prices crashed pretty quickly with OPEC opening up their supply. Before, many projects were profitable and gaining production was key well above operating prudently and cheaply. Spending excess dollars on finding new developments was great to keep future horizons open and deepen your reserve sheet. But now, at lower prices, all of a sudden only the best plays are making money. Therefore everyone pulled back and started only drilling their best stuff, thinking this was a short lived problem. When doing this there isn't much incentive to explore because you already have plays in your back pocket at higher breakevens and your balance sheet can't take much of a hit to explore. So everyone bunkered down. \n\nWell, fast forward a few years and this has started to feel like the new normal. Operators are getting better at being profitable, but there still isn't much being done for new exploration. Because of this, a lot of company's reserves sheets are starting to look a bit smaller than they'd like. They also aren't immune to the world around them and start to try to hedge for the new energy future you mentioned. This also (largely I believe) is being driven at the investor level. During this timeframe, investing in oil and gas was terrible and banks were getting fed up. They not only weren't getting a return, but public opinion was turning too and so the majors needed to find another way to appeal to them.\n\nThen, this year happens and they make a big windfall that they haven't had in a while. With investors getting shafted in years past the majors want to do what they can to build faith in that community and bring investment back and so they do anything they can to bring their price up. Also, at the lower levels there's worry that these other companies that are now sitting on cash are going to buy you out if your price isn't high enough so you better raise yours too.\n\nThat's also completely ignoring that the people making a lot of these decisions (the boards) have a lot of money tied up in these companies and finally they can strike to get a return and so they are. Not to say they won't continue to, well after \"getting theirs\" but when it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, I know it's a duck and so that is what they're going to do.\n\nThat was a long, but still much too short, explanation from my thoughts on why these companies have behaved the way that they have.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "nice appreciate the response, I think that all makes sense from a macro standpoint.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02274717390537262}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7368715405464172}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.562397301197052}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5607974529266357}, {"body": "OK guys, reality check.  \n\n* Russian oil production was up last month but is 7% lower then before the war.  https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/business/russia-oil-sanctions.html\n* OPEC+ has been missing its production quota's by over 2 million barrels per day as of last month.

These are not very sophisticated and can only separate the hydrocarbons that are already there. The products they can make are entirely dictated by the type of oil they're refining.

They can essentially breakdown the heavy hydrocarbons that would make things like bunker fuel or industrial fuel oil, and crack them into lighter hydrocarbons that can be used to make more gasoline and diesel. That same barrel of Saudi Arab Light could easily be turned into 50% gasoline and 30% diesel.
