Very short periods of decline are not con- sidered recessions. Most commentators and analysts use, as a practical definition of recession, two consecutive quarters of decline in a country\u2019s real (inflation adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014the value of all goods and services a coun- try produces (see \u201cBack to Basics,\u201d F&D, December 2008). Al- though this definition is a useful rule of thumb, it has draw- backs. A focus on GDP alone is narrow, and it is often better to consider a wider set of measures of economic activity to determine whether a country is indeed suffering a recession.

{"title": "Rate hikes will surprise everyone", "selftext": "When I was eating my daily dose of crayons, I thought that there is a relevant aspect of FED rate hikes that we are overlooking. The two relevant reserve currencies in the world are the USD and the EUR, the former constitutes 59% of reserves, the latter 21%. In the last year the EUR tanked, from 1.24 USD it reached parity with the USD, now standing proudly at 1.02. \n\nThis helped to cushion the inflation in the US, because the trade deficit of the country is huge (860 billion USD in 2021), and all these imports come dirt cheap when the dollar is strong. The US imports \\~3400 billion USD worth of stuff annually, and surprisingly only a small part of this huge amount are industrial raw materials (522 billion USD), the majority (1859 billion USD) is comprised of capital goods, consumer goods, automobiles, and food&feed ( [https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-top-us-imports/](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-top-us-imports/) ). In the US inflation is already at four-decades high while all these imports are getting significantly cheaper as the USD gets stronger. \n\nUp till now the strengthening of the USD was almost a certainty, the FED started rate hikes, and although base interest rate still stands at 1.75%, it is still higher than the measly -0.5% the ECB uses, EUR being the only relevant competitor for the USD as a reserve currency. And it seemed highly unlikely that the ECB will ever start rate hikes, as the fragmented European economy would simply push Italy into bankruptcy in the event of rate hikes.  This stalemate prevented rate hikes for years and weakened the Euro as a currency.\n\nThis changed last week. The ECB finally found a way to increase interest rates (by 0.5%, but promised aggressive hiking) and start QT without pushing Italy over the ledge. They can simply sell more German debt and even buy Italian papers until the sum of these transactions still decreases the ECB's pile of assets. Simply after a decade the EU found a way to increase interest rates without falling apart. More rate hikes are on the horizon, we have a decade to catch up on. \n\nThis is extremely dangerous for the FED. After a decade the ECB can finally increase base interest rate, most likely the EUR will strengthen while the USD will weaken. A weakening Dollar will re-ignite inflation in the US, all those imports will become much more expensive. Simply because us Europoors finally managed to sort out our shit. \n\nThe ECB's solution forced the FED to increase rates just to keep the Dollar's purchasing power. A long-dormant player entered the arena that can blow up inflation in the US. The only defense against the strong Euro is increasing interest rates in the US. The FED will not turn dovish until the ECB does, and we have a decade to catch up on.

THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS.\n\nLet's walk through their decision tree. The ultimate end action is the rate hike and the quantity of balance sheet roll off. The fed jawboning \"we aren't in recession\" has absolute no actual consequences, it just shows you how they are positioning for the hikes and the roll off.\n\nSo if they come out and say \"we are in a depression, society is collapsing\" what action comes after that? They drop back to zero percent rates. That's what the Fed being dovish looks like.\n\nBut they are saying \"the economy is rock solid and it doesn't need any help\". This is just positioning to keep railing on the rate hikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't read too much else into it. The Fed doesn't decide if we are actually in a recession, the NBER does.

(seriously, idk, why?)\n\nSome bearish things that come to my mind, idk how likely/unlikely:\n\n1) CCP collapses (no more embargos and trade wars), high-end production (chinese EVs) collapses, so **asian lithium miners look to offload anything/everything at low prices, thus flooding the west with cheap lithium** in 2025+. (It's easy to run a mine, much easier than making EVs).  \n\n2) Car manufacturers (and/or battery manufacturers) create a pseudo-cartel and refuse to pay high prices for lithium, and/or keep the produced EV/ev-battery numbers lower than expected (i.e. **the predicted EV boom doesn't happen**).\n\n3) Lithium based EVs start to explode / catch fire en masse in 2022/23, or require non-stop recalls, forcing companies to stop making EVs with lithium batteries. (again, lithium-EV boom doesn't happen)\n\n4) Increased lithium mining drives down the price of lithium so much, that nobody really profits much... Possible?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny of those four seem like possible/probable issues? Or is there something else that could realistically torpedo the lithium play?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I always appreciate a devil's advocate. Here's my thoughts:\n\n1.) If CCP collapses I think we've got bigger macro global economic problems to worry about. Everything would take a big hit, as much as the world might not want to admit it, we are highly dependent on Chinese production globally. So yes, I think everything across the board would take a hit purely because of the economic uncertainty that would come with such an event. For your bolded part of the point, there's really not any lithium surplus they could \"offload\". No one is sitting on a reserve of lithium right now to my knowledge. Sure it's not that difficult of a resource to mine once the facilities and processes are in place, but the demand has ramped up very quickly and we are in a huge demand shortage right now. With what lithium prices have done in the last 18 months there's no way companies aren't selling every metric ton they can produce already.\n\n2.) This has already kind of happened. Lithium prices were mooning so much, China literally put a cap on the maximum lithium spot price. That happened in March, when lithium prices topped out. That's one of the reasons we saw a retraction from the lithium stock boom in March this year. The point is, who knows how high lithium prices would have gone if they weren't artificially capped? Lithium spot prices have held pretty strong from their ATH in March and are only about 5% below that number. At the end of the day, I do think we will see a retraction in lithium spot prices, but most of these company's feasibility studies and profit guidance are based on lithium prices that are a fraction of current prices.\n\n3.) I think this one is pretty much proven out based on the last few years of lithium cars being on the road successfully. Sure, like anything, there can be a few outliers and random problems that can cause a set back. Tesla isn't perfect, they've had some issues, but they're selling more EVs than ever. I don't think we're going to suddenly discover some massive, industry killing problem with lithium. Lithium battery technology has been around for a long time, were only getting better at it.\n\n4.) Eventually, yes. Like I mentioned above, most new lithium mining operations take 5-7 years to come online. First a deposit needs to be identified, then tested, then planned, then permitted, then built, then put into production. It's a long drawn out process and there are different requirements for the different types of lithium \"mines\". They're not all open pit mines, there's also lithium brine evaporation, which is a lengthy process in itself. All this to say, there are more lithium juniors than ever because of this \"white gold rush\" so yes, eventually there will be enough production to start matching the demand, but it likely won't be until at least 2030, and maybe longer.\n\n5 (bonus).) Probably the biggest external threat that would disrupt the lithium boom would be the development of a superior battery technology that doesn't require lithium. Notable alternatives are fuel cell, dual carbon, and sodium-ion. While these are certainly worth noting and watching, they still have a ways to go before the cost-benefit exceeds current lithium-ion battery technology and cost, even with the price boom.\n\nAnyways, always a fun exercise to think through problems, thanks for your input!\n\nEdit: spelling", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34363389015197754}, {"body": "FWIW, Schlumberger is spinning up a Lithium fracking division in the American southwest.\n\n5 total plants planned", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23724494874477386}, {"body": "VALE Gang reunion  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06194180250167847}, {"body": "The electrical infrastructure needs a desperate upgrade before anything else.
