When the vast majority of their employees work at FCs. I worked at Amazon for a spell, and, yeah, it wasn't great. The IT side is just as hit by the \"Everyday is day 1 at Amazon\" shit...but the warehouse workers get it the absolute worst, from being micromanaged down to their piss breaks on over to not being compliant with some policy that just got handed down the day before and everyone just has to expect to change their workflows on a dime.\n\nLanding a gig at Microsoft is different than Amazon. For most people working at Amazon, the turn and burn thing doesn't mean the next day you get shitcanned, you can head over to MS or Google and land a job there, because they are, by and large, different skillsets.\n\nAmazon, first and foremost, isn't a tech company. I mean, AWS is small in absolute size (even if their revenue is an outsized portion), but Amazon is a logistics and retail company first. Without it, they can't plow money back into AWS to keep that operation alive. The labor pool that logistics companies draw from are -- and this is my commie jargon coming up -- the reserve army of labor. It's the part of the working class that is used to threaten and discipline the rest of the working class, so there's a functional reason they keep doing hiring drives, even if they're slowing down. They draw people in because it's a paycheck, but if you don't fall exactly in line, you lose your livelihood and it shows other workers to not do that.\n\nBut that's what it comes down to: for manual labor, there's a dearth of quality jobs. Amazon is kinda the last stop in a country that's been deindustrialized. In the absence of any major education push or training program, it's what people have until they're chewed up and spit out on the other side.\n\nYou are correct, though: this will hurt Amazon's ability to keep quality people because they keep firing them and locking them out of future opportunities across all amazon-owned brands. But their culture is very much one of present business and not too much forward thinking. That's why they have a chaotic internal culture, and it's definitely not the best of the best getting moved up.\n\nIt's a side effect of growth at all costs.

What is very very interesting about this CPI is that this is the HIGHEST level of CPI that the fed has predicted yet. Remember just two months ago they tried to tell us that CPI was peaked yet here we are with a prediction of 8.8%. \n\nMy thoughts are that with the Feds projecting CPI to be 0.5% higher than their last projection which usually misses by about 0.2% at times I suspect we are going to get a reading of 9% CPI. \n\nWhen we get this 9% CPI we are going to see the VIX massively spike which will cause us to dump hard af. We then will for the next 2 weeks while we wait for FOMC, earnings and GDP continue to dump (I made a post last night about going long on VIX/ UVXY calls I definitely recommend you read it as it adds to all of this too). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9jfishi47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ce646bbdfe5b81247539cc0abdb93511072043\n\nI will be SHOCKED if CPI is anything but 9% but I took profits on almost everything but my UVXY calls cause I don\u2019t trust this market or the fed lol. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drqk190j47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9b811ecb36df38de701e9ef660dc0f803812893\n\nOverall the daily looks clear as to where we are going\u2026 I mentioned last week we looked to be in a 370 to 390 channel and that is exactly what this week has played out as. I would be shocked if we don\u2019t see 370 tomorrow (-2.7% day). If we break through 370 and close under it this week I think we are going to be setting up for 340-350 by EOM. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaih33lj47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e429b5ba985120726ee44900f825a15aa780105\n\nMonday I called out the 3810 level for ES futures that I expected us to see. Here we are hitting it intraday today. PT for futures is 3675 by EOW (-4% from 3820). Overall we finally see a close below the daily 8ema on ES futures which we were waiting for to have confirmation of down trend. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvzov25k47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6fc1e00bc53da78f0f83ac0b9dff88277ab6ea\n\nThe one weird outlier today was the VIX. Even with that massive 1.3% sell off EOD today from 1pm to 345pm we never saw the vix break 28. Which tells me that the VIX (fear) did not lead this sell off but rather sheer volume. We had some pretty low sell pressure for how strong of a sell off we had though. We only saw -1.5 at the peak when most big dumps see -5 to -10. \n\nI am highly expecting the VIX to finally spike tomorrow when the market get rocked by a 9% CPI. A 25% vix day is likely and would put VIX near 35. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1x4agyk47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=12bd0b8710ab0331cc1f04d977c82cea0168bdca\n\nOverall the server had a great day today. We definitely took profits too early but hard to say no to 30% and 50% gainers! Great day overall for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ht4w0ol47b91.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=b47abe9addc123b95552ba8c4f433de0c3376af3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvcmcv2m47b91.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=733818a597f13c3debc2f3fef92a2ead5ef812a1\n\nMy plan WAS to carry some 5 otm puts overnight. However, I decided to take proifits on everything instead. I also wanted to hold those 3dte puts till Friday but I just couldn\u2019t say no to the gains. While I have high conviction we see a bad CPI and a big dump tomorrow im not chancing gains if I don\u2019t have to.   \n \n\nI decided to hold my UVXY calls as I still have not see the VIX spike that we are waiting for. The fear hasn\u2019t hit the market yet and tomorrow it will. And if im wrong then im wrong but with these UVXY calls in the off chance that CPI isn\u2019t too bad I should be able to get out still with a small loss. It was the smartest play. But if im right and Cpi is trash we are looking at vix 30-35 and UVXY 16-18.
