{"title": "Big Tech earnings are about to determine the direction of the market", "selftext": "Just five companies control nearly a quarter of the S&P 500 index\u2019s market cap, and they will all report earnings this week that could determine the direction of the market for weeks or months to come.\n\nAs Big Tech \u2014 Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% \u2014 prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch\u2019s Jon Swartz reported.\n\nAmazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the \u201cworst downturns that we\u2019ve seen in recent history,\u201d and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that \u201cpeople are going to freak out.\u201d\n\nAny big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group\u2019s earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.\n\nThis year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens \u2014 Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-earnings-are-about-to-determine-the-direction-of-the-market-11658769593?mod=newsviewer\\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-earnings-are-about-to-determine-the-direction-of-the-market-11658769593?mod=newsviewer_click)", "id": "w8eg5o", "created_utc": 1658824803.0, "score": 485, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "It's going to be a helluva a week.", "score": 272, "replies": [{"body": "Yes it is, Walmart already tanked yesterday in after hours so that doesn't bode well...\n\nStrap in gents the ride has just begun.\n\nSo will they still carry on with redefining what a recession is when everything comes out?", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "costco at a 40 P/E isn't very low the rest are just starting to have the pain of inflation, rising interest rates and reduce household disposable income which we just saw disclosed by walmart - we still likely have two more down legs to go could be three or four thou.

I am biased as an investor as I work in tech and see the reliance of technology on the economy. I think (and I very well could be wrong) people are looking at it wrong.

They positioned themselves as the top cloud provider and those bills are not cheap. Not to mention the innovation happening for different services.\n\nAlphabet - I think this is a longer hold but the work they are doing with AI will be what drives their growth. Recently there was news of a chatbot that convinced a worker it was sentient. I think we will see customer service roles being replaced with this technology as labor becomes more expensive due to population decline. Imagine being able to develop your own flavor, deal with common issues, and learn from each conversation without the investment in servers? Just a subscription fee. Nevermind military applications of their AI technology and the potential of becoming a key miltary contractor as their main source of revenue (forget the search engine).\n\nMicrosoft - They have a strangle hold on businesses, having significant investments into training for windows server, windows AD, and their entire offerings. Sure, linux is a competitor but large enterprise businesses will use linux for specific tasks and things like running lightweight containers. How many government departments and banks are running old windows programs they don't want to update to maintain? One value that windows offers is enterprise support whereas linux is community maintained, unless you go with something like redhat which is just as expensive and doesn't solve the issues of retraining entire tech departments. Their releases will evolve with the times and I haven't even mentioned their cloud services or many other markets like their growing strangle hold on gaming with xbox game pass.\n\nApple - Obvious. Trillion dollar market caps, they will continue to have stable income if nothing other than a luxury brand. \n\nMeta - I can see people being iffy on them. Personally, I don't invest in any social media because the nature of the game is they are only as valuable as they are trendy, and trends come and go. \n\nSo yeah, like with everything some companies will never recover after basing their entire evaluation on potential.

People here, such as myself, enjoy pointing out GM because they were presented as the 'leader' of the EV movement by Joe Biden. That's all there is to it. This is just banter more than anything else. Everyone here has already looked past GM and Ford. Very rarely do any of us mention BMW or Benz. Not because we dislike them but because we quite frankly don't see GM as a viable auto company. It has more to do with GM than BMW or Benz.\n\nSo it seems that because you don't like the results of GM vs Tesla, you want Tesla to be matched up against Benz or GM.\n\n1. Outside of Benz, Tesla is just slightly below them in terms of profit per vehicle sold for year 2021. They will surpass them this year. Third is BMW.\n2. I see you want to use operating margins. So that penalizes a company like Tesla from a financial reporting standpoint. Why? Because Tesla shares skyrocketed, which means operating expenses increased throughout that period. Also, R&D is a huge cost in operating expenses for Tesla for obvious reasons (EV innovation requires more spending than a mature ICE industry). So it's obvious from this standpoint that efficiency of creating the product, such as gross profit, is a more reliable measure as to the efficiency of the product.\n3. [https://stockdividendscreener.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tesla-operating-expenses-to-total-revenue-ratio-ttm.jpg](https://stockdividendscreener.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tesla-operating-expenses-to-total-revenue-ratio-ttm.jpg)The above chart shows that Tesla's operating expense as a % of revenue decreases as Tesla scales. Right now, Tesla is still at its infancy stage of scaling... Thus, operating expenses are going to affect a company, such as Tesla, in its growth stage more than it will affect a mature company such as Benz, Ford, GM, BMW, etc., Gross profit is a far more reliable measure because it is bare bones efficiency.\n4. Look, no one disagrees about BMW and Benz's margins. They're great. But what will their future be in ten years when they lag around and don't push EV vehicles out? What are their margins going to be when they go EV? Right now, there are EV leaders such as BYD, NIO, Geely, XPENG, LiAuto, etc., that will enter every auto market in the world because EV is the future of auto. They want the entire AUTO market share - not just EV. So what is BMW and Benz's projectory looking like? Hint: Not good. They are lagging behind with European labor and auto unions focused on ICE vehicles.\n5. You keep saying GM doesn't compete in the same market as Tesla. Yeah, because they can't. No one wants to pay $60k for a random GM vehicle. They do, however, want to pay $60-70k for a Tesla vehicle. And that is precisely the point: Tesla is able to record industry-leading gross margins for EV's when these other auto companies can't do that with ICE but some have been around for centuries.\n6. It seems you are so stuck on ICE. You know what sucks for these ICE companies? For every EV they sell, they are hurting their bottom line. That is why they are and have been dragging their feet. Imagine telling investors, some who strictly care about profit and won't be around to manage the company by the time EV's come to haunt them, that you have to spend billions to sell EV's at a loss. Good luck with that. ICE will be dead in the future. Any company still selling ICE want to be in Tesla's position. Why? Because Tesla's future is the brightest in this transition to EV's. No one comes close. If you believe so, now is your chance to present your case. But if all you can come up with is, \"But look at Benz's and BMW's margins for luxury ICE vehicles\", you've already failed to look at the bigger picture.\n7. Worth noting... Tesla will be the most profitable automaker in the U.S. by the end of this year. By 2025, they will be the most profitable auto company. This is a company that started mass scaling in 2018 (potential bankruptcy year) and seven years later, will be more profitable than auto companies that have existed for nearly a century.\n\nI'm not here to disparage Benz and BMW. But they are not in Tesla's league. The margins you are quoting is including the fact Tesla outspends them, as a % of revenue, in R&D because they are ramping up operations as well as including a shitload of money for stock-based compensation that has to be expensed in their SGA. The simple fact is, Tesla, at its infancy, is outperforming century old companies at their maturity.

We will not allow this company to put our members\u2019 hard-earned retirements in jeopardy.\u201d \n\n  \nBoeing negotiated and offered matched dollar-for-dollar up to 10% of worker\u2019s base and incentive pay towards 401(k) contributions. Boeing also offered to make a special contribution of 2% of workers\u2019 pay in 2023 and 2024, and to ***provide matches on student loan payments for workers\u2019 children***. \n\nThe proposed three-year agreement would have raised average wages by 7.2% in the first year of the contract in addition to giving workers a $1,000 cash bonus, according to a web site about the offer from the company. Workers would have received a 4% increase in the second year and a 3% raise in the third year, according to Boeing. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNaturally Boeing is announcing its earnings this week.

We used to have amazing benefits but during the last contract negotiation, after voting down a proposal that removed the fixed pension benefit, politicians began to worry that jobs might leave the state, so they began to cry, and Boeing offered a cash incentive for a yes vote (half up front, second half in 5 years, if you were still with the company). Held the vote the first day after Christmas shutdown knowing a lot of old timers would still be on vacation. Lots of younger employees voted for the quick cash, and voted away their pension. \n\nIt's still a good job, benefits are good, and I make very good money, but Boeing is not well managed and has issue with production, program management, and development of new aircraft. Couple that with getting played by Airbus on the A220 and factory in Alabama, not having the cash to seal the deal with Embraer so you have a competing product to counter the A220, a Max 10 program that is very late (and the CEO just threatened it's cancellation), a 777X program that's late, KC-46 with FOD and quality issues that are impacting deliveries and customer satisfaction (as well as a poorly designed synthetic vision system that Boeing must replace on it's own dime), slow 737Max production, and 787s parked all over the country that can't be delivered due to production quality issues...I think that's it..oh wait, a space program that is falling on it's face, and you have a company that's in deep trouble. Boeing doesn't make money building airplanes. They make money when they deliver, and right now there aren't a helluva lot of deliveries.\n\nMy first year with the company, we struck for 58 days.
