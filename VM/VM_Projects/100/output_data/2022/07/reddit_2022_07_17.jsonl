If IBKR doesn't like the position this puts your account in, they may start to liquidate whatever they want inside your account in order to bring down the risk.\n\nAn example of what \"could\" happen if you are wrong is that you agree to sell this call at 116 and the underlying goes up to 232.

{"title": "Car repossessions are surging \u2014 a troubling sign for the used car market", "selftext": "There's a troubling situation spreading among car owners that could portend an implosion of the used car industry, according to a new report.\u00a0\n\nRepossessions of vehicles are surging, and have even doubled among so-called \"prime\" borrowers, or people with good to excellent credit scores who are considered the least likely to default on their lows, Lisa Beilfuss Popeo, a senior writer for Barron's, told CBS News.\n\nRepossessions occur when a borrower falls behind on their car payments, giving the lender the right to seize the vehicle. The rise in repossessions comes after car prices surged during the pandemic, as auto manufacturers struggled to meet demand amid chip shortages and other issues. Used car prices rose particularly sharply, with the average used car price jumping almost\u00a017% in May\u00a0to more than $32,000.\u00a0\n\n\"You have used car prices skyrocketing and people having to borrow more and more to get their hands on a car,\" Beilfuss Popeo said.\u00a0\n\nUsed car market \"bubble\"\n\nAmericans had \"temporary pockets of income\" during the pandemic, thanks to stimulus checks, extra unemployment aid and Child Tax Credit payments, allowing them to pay up for pricier cars, she added.\u00a0\n\nThat's caused concerns among experts that the used car market is in a \"bubble,\" Beilfuss Popeo noted.\n\nBut those government supports have ended, and many families are now facing budget shortfalls given the\u00a0highest inflation in 40 years. As a result, more consumers are defaulting on their auto loans, with subprime repossessions up 11% since 2020,\u00a0according\u00a0to the auto-news site Jalopnik.\u00a0\n\nAnd repossessions among prime borrowers has doubled from 2% to 4% during the past two years, Beilfuss Popeo said.\u00a0\n\n\"One red flag is the rate of repossession for prime borrowers is starting to rise. It's not just subprime borrowers that are having problems,\" she noted.\n\nBut there is a bright spot, said Popeo, who believes the rapid rise in interest rates as a result of aggressive Fed hikes should cool the market as intended. \"Demand is cooling \u2014 it should lower prices for certain things, like cars.\"\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/used-car-bubble-market-repossessions-are-surging/", "id": "w0wqi7", "created_utc": 1658024748.0, "score": 230, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|98|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|30|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w0wqi7)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w0wqi7)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1254882514476776}, {"body": "Meanwhile the dealerships here are charging a minimum of $8000 ABOVE sticker price for any vehicle, \u201cdue to high demand and short supply \u201c", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "For now.

{"title": "You will own nothing: serfdom and the subscription economy (part 1)", "selftext": "If this gets some views I may follow up with a part 2, etc.\n\nIn between my days spent jerking off and watching twitch streams, I've been thinking about what \"you will own nothing and you will be happy\" really means. I think what is mentioned below is obvious but I have not seen anyone mention it in detail so I will write it down below.\n\n\"You will own nothing and you will be happy\" really means the below:\n\n1. A gradual move to a subscription based economy (i.e, you will own nothing and rent everything)\n\n2. A basic income for workers that no longer provide value (i.e, you will be happy because you no longer need to work)\n\n3. A gradual move from physical consumerism to digital content consumerism, with novelty and dopamine as the opioid for the masses (i.e, you will be happy spending your time consuming digital content, porn, tiktoks, youtube videos, streams, games, music, recreational drugs, etc)\n\n4. A decline in free speech through both media censorship and self censorship (i.e, you will be happy, because if you are not happy then there is something wrong with you and you need to be put on something).\n\n5. A return to historical norms, where 1% (and really the 1% of the 1%) controls most of the wealth and power of society), aka, a kind of tech based serfdom.\n\nLet's go into these in detail:\n\n1. A gradual move to a subscription based economy:\n\nWhen wages from labour no longer keep up with the price of assets, it means workers can no longer save enough income to buy financial assets in sufficient amounts to transition from labouring to capital class. This is straight forward, if you make a lot of money working for others, you can use that money to invest and then you no longer need to work for others. When the price of assets have increased dramatically more than wages, this becomes more difficult, which means if you are working now, you cannot retire, and are stuck in the labouring class. \n\nThe current changes to interest rates and asset prices will ultimate destroy what is left of the middle class, simply by:\n\n1. Print a lot of money/keep interest rates low and inflate asset prices after 2008. Most of the benefits of these policies are gained by the wealthy who are more financially knowledgeable and held onto their assets.\n\n2. Print even more money during COVID, causing the working class to FOMO in with their retirement savings. At the same time, the smart money started selling with the cover the Powell provided, and moved some money into cash.\n\n3. Powell does a rug pull, rises interest rates. Asset prices fall and the working people panic out of the market, losing a nice portion of their retirement. A nice recession ensures the working people don't get too \"uppity\" since they have been making too many demands lately (see antiwork, work from home, etc)\n\n4. The smart money buys back in, and after enough time to accumulate, Powell says he is surprised at how the economy has been decimated by the aggressive rise in interest rates, and lowers rates. Asset prices go back up again.\n\nCapitalism cannot exist without cheap labour to exploit, since labourers sell a finite asset (i.e, their life-time) for money, which they will only do if they do not have enough money in the first place. If everyone was a fucking hedge fund manager, who would work to generate return on investment? To discipline labour, sufficient fear is necessary, which can be done by first producing a state of confusion (2020), mania/FOMO (2021) followed by the panic and despair (2022/2023), thus ensuring the wagies go back to their cagies.\n\nWage stagnation means you can buy less of everything else, house, car, etc. This means you \"own\" less things.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. House -> mortgage -> rent\n\n2. Car -> lease -> ride share\n\n3. Utilities, internet, etc -> already subscription\n\n4. Entertainment/media -> subscription\n\n5. Phone/phone plan/internet -> subscription\n\n6. Consumables (food, gas, etc) -> consumed and have to buy again.\n\nThe goal is eventually to transition most people into a state where their money is spent either on subscription services OR consumables.  Once that state of reached, we can move to the next phase.\n\n2. A basic income for workers that no longer provide value\n\nSince the cost of living has increased, standard of living is in decline. Automation and other factors (globalization, etc) are making less workers necessary. As standards of living decreases, peoples' mental health decline, and people become desperate, which leads to a lot of the things we see on the news. In order to placate people, it is easier and cheaper for the government to provide a basic income to keep people from rioting and causing trouble.\n\nA basic income for the poor, is simply the government printing money and giving it to the rich in a roundabout way. Since people will just use their basic income either to pay off existing loans (profits to corporations/shareholders and taxes), or use to buy basic services/entertainment (which leads to salaries for workers and profits to corporations/shareholders and taxes). The salaries of workers are then used to buy goods and services (which means to profits to corporations/shareholders, etc). \n\nIf the government prints money and gives it to people, this eliminates the problem of inflation for the poor since if the cost of food goes up 10%, the government will just increase basic income by 10%. Of course, this fucks in the ass the middle class and wage workers or anyone that has savings in non capital assets.\n\nThe process is ultimately unsustainable in the longer term, but it will probably be good for another 10 years. In late 2019/early 2020 before COVID, the economy was not doing great, but it held on long enough for COVID to come along, and provided the perfect opportunity to take \"unprecedented\" action. This is called \"muddying the waters to hide the fish\". \n\nSimilarly, oil/gas prices were already high in late 2021/early 2022, but then Russia invaded Ukraine and everyone seems to forgot how high oil/gas prices worldwide are caused by half a decade of ESG bullshit, regulations, and lack of investment in the industry, etc. \n\nI will add this joke about climate change and solar/wind energy: global warming leads to more extreme weather, yes? extreme weather makes it harder for everyone to live, yes? so isn't it really fucking stupid to rip up our existing energy infrastructure to build another one that depends on the weather to work?\n\nAnyways, in the same way, eventually, the house of cards will fall apart due to variety of factors, but when that happens, chances are we will either have a civil war (between the white nationalist/supremacists, and the socialists), or a world war (west vs china, etc).\n\nIf this gets some replies/views, I can write down more for part 2.\n\nPositions: doggy.", "id": "w1d5nf", "created_utc": 1658080543.0, "score": 198, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w1d5nf)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w1d5nf)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11408726125955582}, {"body": "How much adderall", "score": 89, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cPositions: doggy,\u201d was that the giveaway?", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "I mean, I don't judge what position the DDer is getting railed in while they type long, self-aggrandizing, apocalypseporn to an amateur investing sub.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I was just being facetious  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07378123700618744}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11053986847400665}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.10692966729402542}, {"body": "Nah, this is the plan\u2026", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.003357822075486183}, {"body": "How much white supremacy up his nose?", "score": -6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14048397541046143}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0033064098097383976}, {"body": "So will I be able to afford avacados or not?", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Only in the metaverse (which I will write about in part 2)", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Goddamm millenials buying virtual avacado toast.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.009155153296887875}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11286146193742752}, {"body": "You can only rent them.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "You can have them back when I'm done with them.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.255471408367157}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18437302112579346}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16553761065006256}, {"body": "Mom!
