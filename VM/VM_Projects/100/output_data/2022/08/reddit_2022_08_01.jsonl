The idea is to sell an in the money covered call and then by a protective put at the same strike price. The profit in this strategy is the extrinsic value collected from the call minus the cost of the protective put. If my thinking is right there is not any risk from the stock going up because the call is covered and there is no risk from the stock going down because you have protection from the intrinsic value sold down to the strike price and then protection from the put below the strike price. I\u2019m I missing something is there some other risk I would be exposed to with this strategy?\n\nExample, I own 100 shares of AAPL I sell the AUG 12 160 call for $6.00 this gives $1.10 is extrinsic value. I then by the 160 put for $0.70. This means my profit is $40.

You either sell to open or buy to open. If you sell to open, you are short. If you buy to open, you are long.\n\nSell to open a put is a bullish play, because you make money if the underlying goes up (sell high, buy back low).\n\nSell to open a call is a bearish play, because you make money if the underlying goes down (sell high, buy back low).\n\n>My other side of the question is what is actually happening when I decide to short call? Am I obliged to have 100 shares of WE stock to sell the option (so for instance its trading \\~5$ do I need 500$ in margin to be able to selling the options contract?)\n\nThat is two separate issues. First, if you sell to open a call short, your broker will either require that you secure that short fully or partially. How much you must secure depends on various factors, like your option approval level and the type of account. If you must secure the short call fully, for 100% of it's assignment value, you can do so either with long shares or with cash. However, securing with cash alone requires the highest level of option approval which almost no one gets, so you likely will have to secure with shares and only shares. You won't even be able to submit the order to sell to open the call unless you have enough long shares.\n\nWhether you have margin or not matters less than whether you have shares to cover or cash to cover.\n\n>and lastly, if I'm buying a short call/put do I want to hold it past expiry (granted WE is ATM/OTM)? What happens if I sell it before its expiry?\n\nAgain, you can only sell to open a short call/put, not buy.\n\nNo, you should not hold any options, long or short, puts or calls, to expiration.\n\nClosing (which means *buying to close* for a short, not selling) is how most traders make money.

When the order is filled, you end up with:\n\n* 100 shares of XYZ that you bought years ago for $80/share\n* $0 cash, because you spent it all buying the call\n* A long call (1 XYZ 91c Sep for $10)\n\nA couple of weeks later, if XYZ goes up, to say $109, your call also goes up in value, let's say to $18, so you would make a profit if you sold to close (bought low at $10, sold to close high at $18) of $18 - $10 = $8/share profit, which is $800 total.\n\nIf instead XYZ went from $100 to $90, the call might fall in value to only $1, so you would would lose $1 - $10 = -$9/share, which is -$900 total.\n\nSo that covers what you already know.

The strikes are not equal in a vertical spread, so they can't cancel each other out entirely. The difference is the spread width. So if one strike is $100 and the other is $105, the spread width is $5 and that difference is left over after everything else cancels out.\n\nAnd spread width canceling **only happens at expiration**. If you get assigned early on the short leg, the cancelation doesn't happen for the spread width, it will be for some other value. Because there will still be time value in one or both legs and that is extra money above and beyond the spread width. This is why the max profit and max loss numbers of a vertical spread only apply at expiration. If you close the spread early, like due to early assignment, you may make more than max profit or lose more than max loss.\n\n>  I shouldn't worry about assignment, as if I get assigned, it automatically gets closed with my long call, right?\n\nRight, but for the wrong reason. Nothing is *guaranteed* to happen automatically for spreads, particularly before expiration. If your short leg is assigned early you should sell to close your long leg yourself, your broker *may not do it for you* (some do, some don't, and it sometimes depends on the type of spread). Note that I said sell to close, not exercise, because you should, as a beginner's simplification, never exercise early.\n\nYou shouldn't worry about early assignment because it rarely happens, as long as the short leg still has substantial time value. Time value is lost when you exercise, which by the way is why the simple rule is never exercise early. You can start worrying about early assignment when your time value gets very small or hits zero, like when the call goes deep ITM.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">The strikes are not equal in a vertical spread, so they can't cancel each other out entirely.\n\nYeah, that's understood, sorry for not being clear.

It's not so much about \"goes above the short call strike price\", it's more about how much money you gain/lose by closing. You can make a huge profit without going anywhere near the short call strike, or you can have huge loss without going anywhere near the short call strike.

For example, if one has strikes that are $1 apart and the other has strikes that are $5 apart, those may be radically different delta values. The way to compare contracts is by delta value. So you want two contracts with delta values that are as close to equal as possible. That could make one be 1 strike from the money and the other 3 strikes from the money.\n\n>Since TSLA tends to swing more aggressively than SPY, odds of profit/loss would be higher correct?\n\nHigh volatility means the chance that the final value is far above the profit target is higher, as well as far below the loss level. It means more outcomes far from the mean. The bell curve distribution gets squatter and fatter, with longer tails on either end.\n\n>In short, when trading volatility, best bet is to trade an equity with a higher % swing? Or would there be a case where SPY may not swing much, but it's contract will?\n\nThere's no \"best bet\". It's all trade-offs when it comes to options trading.

[Read up on the volatility smile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatilitysmile.asp).\n* Play for reversion to the mean. This is based on the assumption that when current volatility is high relative to its long term average, it will eventually fall back to the average, or if it is low relative to its long term average, it will rise back to the average.\n* Play for mis-pricing, such as when sellers are overcompensated for volatility today that realizes to a lower that expected level in the future. If you have to pay a higher premium for an IV of 100% today, but in 30 days the realized volatility ends up being only 50%, you overpaid for that contract. That's an opportunity for sellers.

Obviously this doesn\u2019t happen, or all ITM calls would have a 1 delta. What\u2019s the reason?\n\nFor example: Imagine you had 100 shares of a stock and sold a covered call on it with a small DTE,  then bought a call with the same strike price but with longer DTE. If the share price increases beyond your strike price, you \u201close\u201d $100 on your shares/covered call per $1 increase in the share price past your strike, but you don\u2019t gain $100 on the long call per $1 increase in the underlying, you only gain the delta. Right? Or am I misunderstanding something?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">it would seem intuitive to me that extrinsic value would remain the same (assuming the $1 price change happened instantaneously) while the option becomes intrinsically worth $1 more.\n\nIt's useful to compare an ITM call's premium value (intrinsic + extrinsic) to the call's exercise value (stock price - strike price). Let's call the latter the \"parity value\".\n\nAs a simplifying assumption, first think about European-style options. There is no early exercise for those options, therefore, you can't capture parity value in the instant that the stock goes $1 ITM unless it is just about to expire. This means the further the call is from expiration, the more uncertainty there is that you can capture parity value by exercising, ergo the call itself is less likely to have a delta of 1.0 (though this is dependent on the standard deviation of the underlying -- if it's std dev is only $0.23, a $1 move over the money might in fact make it delta 1.0).\n\nOkay, so what about American-style options? Well, you can think of American-style exercise as a kind of \"sliding scale\" version of the European-style expiration-only exercise. The same rule for European-style has to apply -- the more time to expiration, the less certainty about the contract delivering parity value -- so that has to be reflected in the premium of the call. Buyers will not want to pay full parity value for a call that is expiring in 30 days, because they can't be sure the call will actually deliver that value if they hold it the entire 30 days. Most of that uncertainty is reflected in the extrinsic value, but some of it would be *discounted into the* intrinsic value as well, since all extrinsic value is lost upon exercise. If every ITM call was worth parity value + non-zero extrinsic value every day before expiration, sellers would be ecstatic, because the buyer would be taking on 100% of the risk of the contract by paying for it as if it was expiring the same day.\n\nPut another way, if we accept your assumption, that would require accelerating the expiration date of every call to today. Nevermind that it was originally 2 years out, if it is delivering parity value in premium (delta of 1.0) today, the only way it can do that is if buyers insist it expire today also. Otherwise sellers are being overcompensated for the intrinsic value of the call. Again, assuming the stock price move is much less than the volatility of the underlying. After all, you can find deep ITM call contracts that have a delta of 1.0 far before expiration, because the stock price is so far above the strike price that buyers can be nearly certain they will deliver parity value if they hold to expiration.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, this is really helpful.
