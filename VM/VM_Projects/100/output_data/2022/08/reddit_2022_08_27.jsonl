{"title": "Why the Fed can't solve inflation, and will actually make it worse", "selftext": "Hello fellow retards! Lets jump right into it  \n\n\n**Why the Fed can't solve inflation**  \n\n\nThe current theory on inflation goes something like this:  \n1. Money printer go brrr  \n2. More money but same stuff  \n3. Stuff price go higher  \n4. Money printer not go brrr anymore  \n5. Stuff price not go higher (note: price never come down)  \n\n\nAnd most folks here think the fed doing step 4 will solve inflation.  \n\n\nBut I beg to differ.  \n\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.bls.gov\\/news.release\\/pdf\\/cpi.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/tghilwkshbk91.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=99b554fa36d7262b1bb0b4c0e6232d5fc2ad96b1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee, the price rise is not actually due to demand rising. The biggest components of inflation are energy and food. And stimmys didn't actually cause people to start eating 20 hamburgers and drink gasoline everyday.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.statista.com\\/statistics\\/271823\\/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006\\/](https://preview.redd.it/arqldzw4ibk91.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e7e3e203b1cc149c38c193041954b9af5d4439)\n\n  \nIt's actually the supply  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/yearbook.enerdata.net\\/crude-oil\\/world-production-statistics.html](https://preview.redd.it/k4pyauesibk91.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a656180fa9d3036a747c9fb3f76a00437ba233)\n\nGlobal crude oil production fell by 7.5% in 2020 and is basically the same as 2012, yet the demand is up 10% in the same time period.  \n\n\nUnless JPow can also print oil, the only way to solve oil prices is to \"drill, baby, drill\", which goes opposite to the current administration's priorities  \n\n\n**Why the Fed will actually make inflation worse**\n\nWhat happens when prices of any commodity goes up:  \n\n\n1. Company makes 10 units of commodity and sells for $30 each\n2. Price rises to $100\n3. Company gets greedy\n4. Company doubles output\n5. Extra supply enters market\n6. Prices go down back to $30\n\nSo step 4 by companies is actually what controls prices. Making it easy for companies to do this is perhaps the best way to solve inflation.  \n\n\n*Yet Fed's actions will have the opposite effect.*\n\nOil exploration and production is actually a high-risk, high-reward business. Companies pump in millions of dollars in buying land and equipment to survey that land. Often they dont find meaningful quantity/quality of oil there. When they do, they now have to invest hundreds of millions to even billions in creating the infrastructure to actually get that oil into the market - rigs, pipelines etc.  \n\n\nOil companies have to spend billions before a single drop of oil is produced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important raw material to produce oil is actually capital.  \n\n\nAnd Fed raising rates makes it harder to get.  \n\n\nThis is likely to create a feedback loop of more prices, leading to higher rates, leading to less investment in expanding supply, leading to more prices, leading to....  \n\n\nTL;DR: Buy long term LEAP puts, probably March 2024", "id": "wzdk4r", "created_utc": 1661634481.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wzdk4r)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wzdk4r)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03850333392620087}, {"body": "You make the perfect case to buy oil related shares/calls and then you decide to go full retard and recomend puts\u2026", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, this reads like someone who doesn\u2019t know economics.

The central bank agrees to loan you the money,  but you have to pay back the loan with 2 dollars of intrest.  The trick is, that the central bank is the only source to get the money, and only 10 dollars of money exists in the system. So then you ask the central bank for another loan, but this time you ask for 24 dollars. 12 to pay back the loan, and then the 10 you still need to function in the system.  Then you go back to the central bank and have to ask them for 36 bucks, but this time you cant pay the loan back in full, because now the system needs 12 dolalrs to work. So you pay 22 back on the portion of the loan, an you keep the 12 that you need to function in the system, while carrying over that additional 2 dollars of debt, making you 4 dollars in the hole.

Clearly those hikes didnt work.  \n\n\n\"The issue was that the US specifically disincentivized US producers and importers. Ronald Reagan signed an Executive Order in January of 1981 to eliminate oil price controls and then removed Jimmy Carter\u2019s idiotic Windfall Profits Tax a few years later. As expected, global production expanded rapidly and with the removal of price controls, that production flooded into the US. By the middle of the decade, despite repeated production cuts by OPEC, there was a global glut of oil and by 1985, oil had collapsed all the way to $7. It wasn\u2019t interest rates that made oil decline, it was government policy on the deregulation side, along with rapid production increases from non-OPEC countries.  \n\\-President Reagan\u2019s Economic Recovery Tax Act was signed into law in August of 1981, designed to reduce tax rates and incentivize investment by rewarding risk-taking by businesses. In particular, the Accelerated Cost Recovery System served to accelerate depreciation, reducing taxes for those that invested in productive capacity. Once again, government policy, not interest rates led to an increase in investment and ultimately supply, helping to tame inflation.  \n\\-It wasn\u2019t just Reagan working on de-regulation; The Staggers Act of October 1980, deregulated the railroads, The Motor Carrier Act of July 1980, deregulated the trucking industry, and the Airline Deregulation Act of October 1978 effectively deregulated transport industries. The net effect was dramatic price competition, better ability to invest and innovate, and the ability to eliminate unprofitable business that was funded by profitable business. Almost immediately after passage, pricing for transport services collapsed and the ease of transporting goods expanded.\"  \n\n\nSource: https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2022/06/13/volcker-and-inflation/", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "And then everything fell apart for like a decade.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13261596858501434}], "tickers": ["recovery", "inflation", "de"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Fee can never do a Volcker anymore, too much debt, trade deficit too high.
