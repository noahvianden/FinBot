All short options have risk. Any stock could suddenly drop 50%, due to some black swan event. So like with all stocks you have to size the trade correctly and be ready with cash for a black swan margin call. If you\u2019ve done that, a covered strangle on TSLA is a great income producing strategy. Over time you go deep ITM on each side for awhile, but as long as you keep rolling (up/down/out) and receive a net credit, you are lowering cost basis (and making money). TSLA is a great stock to trade because it has decently high IV and the liquidity is superb. In three years of trading covered strangles, I have never been assigned on either side (call or put), even when deep in the money. There is almost always lots of excess premium no matter how few days to expiration and no dividends, so hard to get assigned if you actively manage and don\u2019t wait until an hour before expiration. (Not that I would mind getting assigned, I just want to avoid a large capital gain tax.) In the beginning I was anxious to close options quickly when I made 20-25% (scalping), but now I usually just treat the covered strangle as an endless rolling trade, to generate income and hold onto the shares as long as possible. I\u2019m obviously bullish on TSLA, but I like selling the call as well as the put to protect the downside a bit, and I also skew strangles depending on my short term view, and occasionally I sell extra calls to buy some OTM puts when I\u2019m worried about a price drop. This \u201cinsurance\u201d usually is wasted, but it does increase my buying power (portfolio margin account) so it is worth it for portfolio risk management. \n\nSo many people get obsessed about the sure thing trade with no risk. Those trades don\u2019t really exist and if they do, they\u2019re not going to be very profitable or capital efficient. There is no way to predict a stock\u2019s share price movement, you just play both sides, manage risk, and do the best you can. Most of the time you are profitable 4-8% vs just holding shares, sometimes you are lucky and earn more, while 10-15% of the time you are deep ITM and playing defense and flat to slightly unprofitable vs just holding shares over time. It\u2019s a random cycle and you just manage your size and play the probabilities the best you can. No reason to trade in fear or get obsessed about max profit perfection.
