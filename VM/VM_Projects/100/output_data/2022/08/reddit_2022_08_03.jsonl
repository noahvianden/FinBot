And I don't think there's a correct formula to determine what's neutral - it's entirely dependent on the assumptions you plug in.  As Summers points out, assuming the worst is over is the same class of wishful thinking that led to the \"transitory\" debacle (and in my 2 cents the utter miss on subprime in '07).  Any model that relies exclusively on the best case scenario, IMO, is not a good model. \n\nThis is a Fed that kept their foot on the gas too long despite warnings to the contrary, and now starts talking about \"neutral\" and stops issuing forward guidance at the first sign of economic distress.  It's easy to be a dove - nobody likes to inflict pain. 2.5% in 9% inflation is not strong, committed action, and I think everyone knows that (ie the market) except the Fed.\n\nBesides, I'm a teacher.  If all your students fail an exam you don't say \"geez, my students suck\".  No, you try to figure out where you went wrong as a teacher.  But not so with the Fed - according to Fed logic, if the market doesn't get the message, it's the market's fault.\n\nAnyway, I could be wrong, I hope they have it all under control and everything turns out smoothly.  But at this stage of the game IMO it's starting to become clear that they've lost all credibility.  What's shocking to me is that people (including they themselves) aren't aware of it.

We'll never know.\n\nYou don't have to be a genius to realize 9% is temporary and is not gonna stay that way for the next 10 years. It's obvious that 2.5% is gonna go up, and that 9% is gonna go down and both will meet together at some level, at some point. Might be 3.5, 4, or 5%. Also about the neutral claim, I suspect Summers usage of the word and Powell's usage is probably different. \n\nStopping to issue guidance is not a hawkish turn at all, especially after the WSJ guidance leak fiasco. And because of how volatile the data comes in, issuing guidance ahead of time only restrict them more in a time where they need to be nimble. \n\nAs far as \"explaining to the market\", the market is not one entity that the Fed can ask questions. Multiple Fed officials already stated there was no pivot and their rate hike expectations, which was the same as the June projection, so theoretically nothing's new. In fact, most economists don't understand why the market interpreted the interview as a pivot. If you want to represent the market and let the Fed know, go ahead.\n\nAs far as credibility, 5 yr and 10 yr breakevens are still stable around 2.5-2.7%, UMich inflation expectation still around 3%.
