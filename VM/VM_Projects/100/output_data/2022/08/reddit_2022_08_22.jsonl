{"title": "Is WallStreetBets Biased in its BBBY Stickies? [Data]", "selftext": "#TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you think.\n\n**Over the past two weeks, WSB tends to sticky more bullish posts than bearish posts. Both in general, and for BBBY.**\n\n---\n\nAs a mod, I'm constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. \n\nAs of late, the main complaint seems to be that I \"only\" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. \n\nSo let's take a look at everything that's been stickied since August 5th, and see if that's true!\n\n#FAQ:\n\nQ: Why since August 5th? \n\nA: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. \n\nQ: (I don't know, I'll add some more questions from the comments when they come)\n\n---\n\n#Methodology:\n\nI took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.\n\nI don't think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I've included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.\n\n---\n\n#Results!\n\nOverall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.\n\n**BBBY Specific - Summarized**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull|7|\n|Neutral|2|\n|Bear|5|\n|Other|56|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n**BBBY Specific - Detail**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull Serious|6|\n|Bull Shitpost|1|\n|Neutral Shitpost|2|\n|Bear Serious|3|\n|Bear Shitpost|2|\n|Daily Thread|32|\n|Unrelated|24|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n\nWhat about those nebulous \"Daily Thread\" and \"Unrelated / Other\" categories?\n\n**Daily Threads**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull BBBY|5|\n|Bear BBBY|1|\n|Daily|22|\n|Earnings|1|\n|Trash|1|\n|Weekend|2|\n|***Total***|***32***|\n\n**Unrelated**\n\n|**Topic**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bear AMC|1|\n|Bear GME|1|\n|Bear TSLA|1|\n|*Bear Total*|*3*|\n|Bull AMC|2|\n|Bull GME|1|\n|Bull OXY|1|\n|Bull SPY|5|\n|Bull SQ|1|\n|Bull TSLA|1|\n|*Bull Total*|*11*|\n|Education|1|\n|Legendary Post|2|\n|Meme|1|\n|Neutral Wind|1|\n|News|1|\n|Shitpost|2|\n|Tattoo|2|\n|***Total***|***24***|\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThis was fun to put together and only took about an hour. \n\nI was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. \n\nI'm curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.\n\nThere are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. \n\nThis is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)\n\nAnother limitation is timing. I think it's fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.\n\n---\n\n||Category|BBBY Daily?|Topic|Is Dupe|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|[\"Buying more BBBY puts Monday lfg\" by thisismyname2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuab08/buying_more_bbby_puts_monday_lfg/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"I don\u2019t want bbby to go bankrupt so I just pulled ...\" by MrSingh_Entrepreneur](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wub13h/i_dont_want_bbby_to_go_bankrupt_so_i_just_pulled/)|Bear Shitpost| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, August 22, 2022\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wu8ppj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_august_22_2022/)|Daily Thread|Daily||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Ryan Cohen was an insider when selling his shares....\" by DatSlattSlimeBooBong](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtju81/ryan_cohen_was_an_insider_when_selling_his_shares/)|Bull Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial...\" by obiwanjustblowme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtnust/why_the_baby_acquisition_premise_is/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Aswath Damodaran - Session 1: Intro to Valuation\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wte3eu/aswath_damodaran_session_1_intro_to_valuation/)|Unrelated| |Education|Not Dupe|\n|[\"Lambo Wen?\" by doublejeopardyalex](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wt7agl/lambo_wen/)|Unrelated| |Bear TSLA|Not Dupe|\n|[\"675% gains on 2 BBBY options.

The last stickied post was the same content as mine, albeit a much higher yolo. \n\nWe have a HUGE community now, and a LOT of the people browsing, lurking and commenting have never been exposed to trading before. They had a friend tell them to download Robinhood, or they saw the news with GME and decided to jump in on bbby. \n\nYou're highlighting the entire point of investing with a lot of these pinned posts; MAKING MONEY. Taking gains should NEVER be shamed, it's a poisonous line of thinking that serves only to amplify the \"Ape mentality\" of hold forever in the event that a stock soars to GME levels again. Like a deep seated FOMO, something that many a person stuck in the rat race, living hand to mouth sees as their ticket out. \n\nThese people delude themselves in to believing that everyone else feels the same, and if we just stick together, we all get rich. That's not how any of this works in practice, and for EVERY pump there will always be people holding the bags. Someone has to buy your shares of GME at 400. \n\nThere is no war, there is no boogeyman. There is only you, and the thousands of other hungry people who promise that they would NEVER sell. That is of course until their portfolio value reaches a level that they feel will pull them out of whatever hole they're currently in. And guess what? They hit that sell button without a second thought. \n\nI sold for a huge profit on my initial bbby play, and I will almost certainly buy some more on Monday. The difference? I'll be buying those shares after already paying rent and all my other bills for the month, so anything else is just icing.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You bet that if you bought stock about a company you know little about, it would increase in price. It didn't.\n\nInvesting, on the other hand, is usually long term. And even then, it's not guaranteed to be safe. You find a company with good fundamentals and potential and put your money in it. \n\nNow, is Apple that company? It really depends on what YOU want. Apple's the biggest strength (and weakness) is that it's almost a cult. Just like Coke VS Pepsi, people decide that Apple is better and are willing to spend much more than they would otherwise for a comparable product.\n\nAnd there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. All brands based on luxury and upscaling do it. Starbucks, Tesla, Dom Perignon, Armani, Rolex, Bose.. they are all good, some really good, but not as good as the price reflects. There are comparable products for a fraction of the price.\n\nSo that strategy is great. While people have extra money to spend. In times when the economy isn't doing so well, people are concerned about rent, gas and groceries and not about the phone that will make you look wealthy. \n\nSo Apple doesn't have the brightest near future but it still is a very solid company. A  recession is looming and inflation is starting to take a toll. Any company that offers over-inflated products won't do well for a while.\n\nSo if you want to consider it an investment that in the short-term isn't doing well, it's your choice. But you're going to have to hand in there until the market changes. Think years. And embrace the risk. It might never go back to where it was (personally I think it will, in a few years).\n\nOn the other hand,  you can just call it a bad gamble, sell the position and go home, just like you would at a casino.
