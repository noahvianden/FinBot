Don't try to read Esoteric letter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Unfortunately due to housing recession data i'm having my doubts about even a small bull trap rally now. These markets will drive me insane.\ud83e\udd23\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Respected Traders and Investors**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really do hope my Season 1 letters are helping you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2008 vs 2022](https://preview.redd.it/qy8i83s82hj91.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2ba1807b5db1ea44730c2e3f330043ce5b69854)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stars have finally aligned themselves but the billionaires don't want you bears to make profits. Hi ha ha. They think they can outsmart us. Haha. They don't know that we know what they too know. Am i going crazy. Probably yeah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooks like all road is leading to Jackson hole for an imminent collapse to the lower low we made in June 16. ( Read the Ws-10 before this for context ) As you can see from the above charts what is going to happen is we are gonna drop after Jackson hole to Fed Fomc in sept 20 where we will be taking our position there. Now i'm not gonna spoon feed you but i'll probably do it coz literally no one should make a loss in this community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But first i need to apologize :**\n\nVXX : Is such a sh9tty Etf. I didn't know that it broke on March 2022. Hence i was wondering why didn't go up. Therefore $VIXY and $UVXY are your best etf for vix calls. They have good volume but Vxx don't. So i sold the Vxx today. Thanks for pointing that out man in today's stream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So back to SPX analysis.**\n\nYou can use it on SPY yourself. ( Cmon, guys a lil effort. )\n\n\\- Stochastic RSI : same reading with diff 19.\n\n\\- Pvto : Red in daily will move up after accumulating for a little while to trap late bears.\n\n\\- We are sitting on last red candle day by my Ketlner RGB lights that have guided us through this journey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Levels you need to memorize.**\n\n38.2% :\n\n50% :\n\n61.8% ( could come but low probability ) :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Dude wtf you didn't write the numbers\" Well folks i don't today's bottom. So depending on that number will change. Got it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* Full disclosure i got out of my positions and now will short the 0.50-0.618 in upcoming days. You don't have to do this coz imma market timer. Please i'm telling you. Do not follow my technique. It's very hard. You will get rekt. But if you do wanna do this well then you really have to be smart ass to understand above stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you\n\nRegards\n\nUchiha", "id": "wvqkja", "created_utc": 1661265623.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|54|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1565|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wvqkja/bull_trap_rally_is_coming_are_you_prepared_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wdgxh7/wall_street_newsletter_10_i_told_you_so_some_of/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wkwnv1/stock_market_is_about_to_collapse_in_47_days/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wu40cy/wall_street_newsletter_11_final_chapter_season/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wvqkja)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wvqkja)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3899186849594116}, {"body": "I'm ready for your Jackson hole", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11904874444007874}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3401603102684021}, {"body": "Where the fuck is TLDR?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Levels you need to memorize or just observe the chart and read nothing else.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.01032345462590456}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06709793210029602}, {"body": "for those who don't know, the 50, 61.8 level are referring to the Fibonacci retracement levels (if I am not mistaken), you can draw them on the chart to see the numbers.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Finally someone understood what i'm trynna say. \ud83d\ude05 \n\np.s.\nBtw you forgot to add the wall street newsletter 10 link which was basically the technical aspect of \"S. theory\".\ud83e\udd23", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22818224132061005}, {"body": "Ok young bo", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.016325222328305244}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27041110396385193}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "&#x200B;\n\n>Any good short strategies one recommends ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy puts on TQQQ or calls on SQQQ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Why not both?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "They both have the exact same but inversed responses to the NASDAQ.\n\nGetting into both of them is just making your overall short position unnecessarily complex. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would just pick one and build your position if you want to short the NASDAQ.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19968445599079132}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0980580523610115}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.018390726298093796}, {"body": "When are they going into Jackson's Hole?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Skip to 05:38", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2201506495475769}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07626821100711823}, {"body": "Amazon puts, huge gap starting at $132.4 and no support until $123 or so.
