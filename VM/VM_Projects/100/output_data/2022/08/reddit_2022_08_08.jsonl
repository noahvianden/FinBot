{"title": "Buying the Nvidia dip? Reminder: During the crypto crash in 2018, Nvidia had 4 straight quarters of negative YoY revenue growth", "selftext": "**I wrote this 2 months ago and posted it here. I predicted the bad quarter. I wonder why Wallstreet didn't?**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vb52k4/during\\_the\\_crypto\\_crash\\_in\\_2018\\_nvidia\\_had\\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vb52k4/during_the_crypto_crash_in_2018_nvidia_had_4/)\n\n\\-----------Original post below-----------\n\n* \\-24% in Q1 2019\n* \\-30% in Q2 2019\n* \\-17% in Q3 2019\n* \\-5% in Q4 2019\n\nNvidia's stock price dropped by about 53% during this period. It didn't recover until the pandemic-fueled boom.\n\nThis is because when crypto crashes, miners will flood the market with used GPUs, giving bargain prices to gamers. MSRP prices for gaming GPUs doubled during the boom. What happens when GPU prices drop to half of MSRP?\n\nIn the last 3 months, ETH mining profitability has dropped by 50%. 70% in the last 6 months. This doesn't even account for electricity cost inflation.\n\nETH itself is down 30% in the last 7 days.\n\n**Nvidia does not break out its gaming and crypto sales. (Comment: Nvidia \"gaming\" revenue fell short by $1b)** They lump both categories into their gaming sales category. Therefore, no one can reliably model the impact. But if I have to guess, it won't be as bad as 2018 if crypto does not go back up because Nvidia's overall revenue has diversified a bit since 2018.\n\nHowever, 2018 is very different than 2022 for Nvidia. In 2018, Nvidia only faced the crypto crash. In 2022, Nvidia faces a triple whammy: **recession-risk** (GPUs are a non-essential good and expensive), **people going outside more** (less gaming), and **crypto crash** (mining). While some companies are facing one or two of these issues, very few are impacted by all three.\n\nLike most tech companies during the pandemic-boom, Nvidia also hired a ton of workers and started projects that don't either don't make any money or loses money. Nvidia's employee count went from \\~13,000 to \\~22,000 from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe question is, is Wallstreet ready for negative Nvidia revenue growth? Do you think Wallstreet has already priced this in? Right now, Nvidia's PE is still at a premium over the market. What happens when its growth is negative for 4 quarters?\n\nLong term, I still believe in Nvidia.

But I'm not buying at this level or recommending that anyone else do so. If there is a major further pullback in SP I may increase my position again.\n\nThe long-term growth story is mostly intact but is a little more questionable now. Datacenter is a 40% CAGR sector. I think only AMD is effectively competing with NVDA right now and there is a lot of growth to go around. The NVDA goal of monetizing software platforms I think warrants the risk of holding.

It's an industry on a long-term growth trend. The moat will take at least a couple years to overcome if AMD or Intel (hah) can do it at all. I'm watching closely.\n\nNo one should discount the possibility of another GPU-based mining supercycle as we've already had 3 that I can recall. I don't know if it's causation, coincidence, or conspiracy, but the last 3 crypto runs and GPU mining booms seem to coincide with major GPU performance leaps.

{"title": "Elon Musk challenges Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to a debate on bots", "selftext": "Centi-billionaire Elon Musk provoked Twitter and challenged the company\u2019s CEO Parag Agrawal to a \u201cpublic debate\u201d about fake accounts and spam in the midst of a contentious legal battle over a $44 billion acquisition.\n\nMusk filed a bid with the Securities and Exchange to acquire Twitter back in April this year. After the companies agreed to move ahead with a take-private deal, Musk said he was terminating his acquisition, and accused Twitter of presenting false numbers, including in its SEC filings, pertaining to the amount of monetizable daily active users, and the number of spam and bot accounts on the social network.\n\nTwitter then sued Musk in a Delaware chancery court to ensure the deal would go through as promised, and Musk filed counterclaims and a countersuit there on July 29.\n\nIn a series of tweets that Musk began posting just before 1 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 6, Musk interacted with a fan who had summarized his accusations about Twitter including that it was stonewalling him and giving him, \u201coutdated data,\u201d and \u201ca fake data set\u201d when he asked the company for details about how it tabulates mDAU, and estimates for spam and bot accounts.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO wrote, \u201cGood summary of the problem. If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they\u2019re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms. However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.\u201d\n\nBy just after 9 a.m. Saturday morning, Musk started a Twitter poll asking his followers to vote on whether \u201d\\[l\\]ess than 5% of Twitter daily users are fake/spam.\u201d Respondents to the informal poll could choose one of Musk\u2019s provided answers which read either \u201cYes\u201d followed by three robot emoji, or \u201cLmaooo no.\u201d (The slang abbreviation \u201clmao\u201d stands for \u201claughing my a-- off.)\n\nMusk also wrote Saturday morning: \u201cI hereby challenge u/paraga to a public debate about the Twitter bot percentage. Let him prove to the public that Twitter has <5% fake or spam daily users!\u201d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pc4fltiuhg91.jpg?width=1202&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f27f0b0cb950e14fdfd81530c90462f833e009b0\n\nA source close to the company says a debate is not going to happen outside of a pending trial.\n\nAttorneys for Musk did not respond to requests to comment on Saturday, and an attorney for Twitter declined to comment on Musk\u2019s Saturday tweets.\n\nTwitter\u2019s attorneys have argued in court filings that Musk gave the company just twenty-four hours to accept his offer before he would present it directly to Twitter shareholders, and waived due diligence including a chance to seek more information on false or spam accounts.\n\nThey wrote in court filings, \u201cMusk\u2019s repeated mischaracterizations of the merger agreement cannot change its plain words.\u201d\n\nAt an annual shareholder meeting for Tesla on Aug. 4, Musk was asked to speak about Twitter during a question-and-answer session that followed a proxy vote.\n\nHe said, drawing laughter from the audience in attendance, \u201cI obviously have to be a little careful what I say about Twitter because there\u2019s this lawsuit and stuff.\u201d He confirmed that the only two publicly traded securities he owns are Tesla and Twitter.\n\nAnd then he spoke as if he still wants to become the owner of the social networking company, a stark contrast to arguments made by Musk via his attorneys in legal filings in Delaware in which Musk argues he should not have to go through with the deal.\n\nAt the Tesla 2022 shareholders\u2019 meeting, Musk said: \u201cI think in the case of Twitter since I use it a lot, shoot myself in the foot a lot, you know, dig my grave, etc. I think it\u2019s \u2014 I do understand the product quite well, so I think I\u2019ve got a good sense of where to point the engineering team at Twitter to make it radically better.\u201d\n\nHe added that Twitter would \u201chelp accelerate\u201d a \u201cpretty grand vision\u201d he had to build a business he\u2019d been thinking about since his earliest years as a tech entrepreneur, [X.com](https://X.com) or X Corporation.\n\n\u201cObviously that could be started from scratch,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think Twitter would help accelerate that by three to five years. So it\u2019s kind of like something I\u2019ve thought would be quite useful for a long time. I know what to do. Don\u2019t have to have Twitter for that but, like I said, it\u2019s probably at least a three-year accelerant and I think it\u2019s something that will be very useful to the world.\u201d\n\nMusk didn\u2019t go into any further details at that meeting. However, he reportedly said during a town hall meeting with Twitter employees in June this year that he wanted to grow Twitter\u2019s user base to a billion people and saw Twitter as a platform that could evolve into an app like China\u2019s WeChat, a \u201csuper app,\u201d that incorporates everything from messaging, video and social media, to mobile and point-of-sales payments, with a robust app ecosystem.\n\nUnless they reach a settlement first, Twitter and Musk are headed for a five-day trial in Delaware that starts on Oct. 17. The judge ruling on the case is Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/06/elon-musk-challenges-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-to-a-debate-on-bots.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/06/elon-musk-challenges-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-to-a-debate-on-bots.html)\n\nElon Musk has challenged Twitter\u2019s CEO Parag Agrawal to a public debate about the percentage of bots on Twitter.

Average mDAU for a period represents the number of mDAU on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in mDAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active total accounts. To calculate the year-over-year change in mDAU, we subtract the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average mDAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Additionally, our calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our measures of mDAU growth and engagement may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology.\n\n\n> The numbers of mDAU presented in our earnings materials are based on internal company data. While\nthese numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement across our large\nnumber of total accounts around the world. Furthermore, our metrics may be impacted by our information\nquality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam,\nmalicious automation, and fake accounts. For example, there are a number of false or spam accounts in\nexistence on our platform. We have performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimate\nthat the average of false or spam accounts during the second quarter of 2022 represented fewer than 5%\nof our mDAU during the quarter. The false or spam accounts for a period represents the average of false\nor spam accounts in the samples during each monthly analysis period during the quarter. In making this\ndetermination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not\naccurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam\naccounts could be higher than we have estimated. We are continually seeking to improve our ability to\nestimate the total number of spam accounts and eliminate them from the calculation of our mDAU, and\nhave made improvements in our spam detection capabilities that have resulted in the suspension of a\nlarge number of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts. We intend to continue to make such\nimprovements. After we determine an account is spam, malicious automation, or fake, we stop counting it\nin our mDAU, or other related metrics. We also treat multiple accounts held by a single person or\norganization as multiple mDAU because we permit people and organizations to have more than one\naccount.
