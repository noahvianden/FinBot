{"title": "Buying the Nvidia dip? Reminder: During the crypto crash in 2018, Nvidia had 4 straight quarters of negative YoY revenue growth", "selftext": "**I wrote this 2 months ago and posted it here. I predicted the bad quarter. I wonder why Wallstreet didn't?**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vb52k4/during\\_the\\_crypto\\_crash\\_in\\_2018\\_nvidia\\_had\\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vb52k4/during_the_crypto_crash_in_2018_nvidia_had_4/)\n\n\\-----------Original post below-----------\n\n* \\-24% in Q1 2019\n* \\-30% in Q2 2019\n* \\-17% in Q3 2019\n* \\-5% in Q4 2019\n\nNvidia's stock price dropped by about 53% during this period. It didn't recover until the pandemic-fueled boom.\n\nThis is because when crypto crashes, miners will flood the market with used GPUs, giving bargain prices to gamers. MSRP prices for gaming GPUs doubled during the boom. What happens when GPU prices drop to half of MSRP?\n\nIn the last 3 months, ETH mining profitability has dropped by 50%. 70% in the last 6 months. This doesn't even account for electricity cost inflation.\n\nETH itself is down 30% in the last 7 days.\n\n**Nvidia does not break out its gaming and crypto sales. (Comment: Nvidia \"gaming\" revenue fell short by $1b)** They lump both categories into their gaming sales category. Therefore, no one can reliably model the impact. But if I have to guess, it won't be as bad as 2018 if crypto does not go back up because Nvidia's overall revenue has diversified a bit since 2018.\n\nHowever, 2018 is very different than 2022 for Nvidia. In 2018, Nvidia only faced the crypto crash. In 2022, Nvidia faces a triple whammy: **recession-risk** (GPUs are a non-essential good and expensive), **people going outside more** (less gaming), and **crypto crash** (mining). While some companies are facing one or two of these issues, very few are impacted by all three.\n\nLike most tech companies during the pandemic-boom, Nvidia also hired a ton of workers and started projects that don't either don't make any money or loses money. Nvidia's employee count went from \\~13,000 to \\~22,000 from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe question is, is Wallstreet ready for negative Nvidia revenue growth? Do you think Wallstreet has already priced this in? Right now, Nvidia's PE is still at a premium over the market. What happens when its growth is negative for 4 quarters?\n\nLong term, I still believe in Nvidia.

But I'm not buying at this level or recommending that anyone else do so. If there is a major further pullback in SP I may increase my position again.\n\nThe long-term growth story is mostly intact but is a little more questionable now. Datacenter is a 40% CAGR sector. I think only AMD is effectively competing with NVDA right now and there is a lot of growth to go around. The NVDA goal of monetizing software platforms I think warrants the risk of holding.

Nvidia *maybe* has what it takes to be the next Apple; AMD, Qualcomm I just can't imagine it.\n\nGaming and mining are coming off of a supercycle, but there will be another gaming supercycle (maybe the upcoming gen, maybe later) and Nvidia is still ridiculously entrenched there. It's an industry on a long-term growth trend. The moat will take at least a couple years to overcome if AMD or Intel (hah) can do it at all. I'm watching closely.\n\nNo one should discount the possibility of another GPU-based mining supercycle as we've already had 3 that I can recall. I don't know if it's causation, coincidence, or conspiracy, but the last 3 crypto runs and GPU mining booms seem to coincide with major GPU performance leaps.
