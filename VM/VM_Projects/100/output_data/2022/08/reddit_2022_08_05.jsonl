{"title": "Tesla Shareholders Approved a 3:1 Stock Split", "selftext": " Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world\u2019s most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.\n\nIn a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company\u2019s proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.\n\nTesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today\u2019s closing price the new share price would be around $308.\n\nThough the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don\u2019t impact a company\u2019s market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.\n\nTesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla\u2019s 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.\n\nSeveral other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet\u2019s split 20:1 in February and Amazon\u2019s stock split 20:1 split one month later.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2)\n\nTesla TSLA shareholders approved a 3-for1 stock split. This means that for every TSLA share you own, you will receive 2 additional shares. Elon Musk added that buybacks are on the table depending on future cash flow.\n\nDo you think $TSLA will rally leading up to the stock split?", "id": "wgxjoc", "created_utc": 1659711305.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Lol he's just going to keep splitting", "score": 184, "replies": [{"body": "Yup it\u2019ll split again by 2025", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Spring 2023 bet?", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40697041153907776}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5172486901283264}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3273739516735077}, {"body": "What everybody in a splitting mood", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "2023 depression", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Push every share price to 5\u00a2.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "what would that really do ? honest question", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "/s (many, many splits + recession = 5\u00a2 share price)", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Delist Tesla?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2915092706680298}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13929995894432068}, {"body": "Everything will be penny stocks after the dip", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25450289249420166}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24703934788703918}, {"body": "Split via dividend.\n\nLike stick a wrench in the short bicycle.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29822075366973877}, {"body": "To get in on the meme bullshit.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12702500820159912}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.290550172328949}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Yea, with the correction it is still up 25% this month.
