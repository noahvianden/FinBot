The cost of the 1% tax on buybacks will be borne by companies like [**Apple**](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) ([**AAPL**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which added $90 billion to its share repurchase plan in April.\n\nBuyback Tax Impact On Apple, S&P 500 Earnings\n\nThe tax on such a massive Apple stock buyback could amount to as much as $900 million a year, once the tax takes effect in 2023.\n\nConsider what that might mean if the tax were in effect now: A $90-billion stock buyback would raise Apple earnings per share by about 3.5% thanks to a lower share count. However, a $900 million tax would shrink the buyback's boost to EPS to about 2.5%.", "id": "wk1fbx", "created_utc": 1660046250.0, "score": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "Is that math correct?

{"title": "The red flag that preceded a halving of global equities in 2000 and 2007 is back, warns Citi", "selftext": "Buzz is already starting for a 1% fed rate hike...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-red-flag-that-preceded-a-halving-of-global-equities-in-2000-and-2007-is-back-warns-citi/ar-AA10tfCk?cvid=2e001f5bc9ac428bd7d225938a590cb5)\n\n \n\nWe are a day away from data that could prove a turning point for markets.\n\nIf Wednesday\u2019s CPI doesn\u2019t reveal some slowing in prices, expectations will rise for a bigger Fed rate hike in September, possibly knocking stocks. But if it swings the other way, especially after surprisingly good jobs data, the view that things aren\u2019t as bad as feared/Fed hikes may be done soon, could prevail.\n\n Wall Street does seem to be at pains lately to advise treading carefully with optimism that has the S&P 500 set to break two-straight quarters of losses \u2014 up 9.3% in the third quarter so far.\n\n\u201cThe central challenge to the notion that there will be a more meaningful Fed pivot is that the near-term inflation picture is likely to remain uncomfortably high,\u201d said Goldman Sachs strategists Dominic Wilson and Vicki Chang in a late Monday note.\n\nBut amid the caution, there\u2019s still plenty of stock buying recommendations out there from the sell side, that is the brokerages and investment banks. And that\u2019s a fat red flag investors may want to heed, warns our **call of the day** from Citigroup.\n\n\u201cOur index of global sell-side recommendations is back to peak bullishness levels reached in 2000 and 2007, after which global equities halved,\u201d noted a team led by chief global equity strategist, Robert Buckland.\n\n\u201cAnalysts are net buyers of every sector in every region, but then they usually are,\u201d he said, noting specific concentration on U.S. and emerging markets. \u201cThey are still bullish on cyclical sectors suggesting few fears of oncoming global recession.\u201d\n\nCiti calculates its index of global sell-side calls by aggregating those on all stocks in MSCI indexes, ranging from 5, a strong buy, to 1, a strong sell. Their index is above three almost everywhere. They note that analysts are never net sellers of their stocks, even in the case of bear markets. While it seems analysts get more bullish as equities rise, it could also be that the \u201cmarket rises because they are getting more bullish.\u201d\n\nIn any case, that \u201canalyst herding\u201d has triggered a red flag in Citi\u2019s bear market checklist, which has eased to 6 from a potential 18 flags. Note, this particular flag gave a false sell signal in 2012, when global stocks were flat for the following 12 months. But still, what happened in 2000 and 2007 makes it worth noting they say.\n\nBuckland and the team say analysts tend to get the start of bear markets wrong, by turning even more bullish when they should be growing cautious. \u201cEven though they are starting to revise down earnings forecasts, falling share prices and cheapening valuations keep them positive. They eventually do turn more cautious as earnings forecasts fall further, but it is a slow process.\u201d", "id": "wk0zp2", "created_utc": 1660044861.0, "score": 575, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "\u201cStocks might go down but they also might go up.

{"title": "Market timers, this post is for you: the relative cheapness of value stocks is at historic levels, across the world. History says to buy!", "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Value stocks are calling out for your attention. The value spread is at historically favorable levels (for value stocks), and this predicts strong future earnings relative to growth.\n\nNot since the Dot Com era have we seen value stocks spreading themselves so enticingly.\n\nWhat is the value spread? Definitions abound, but in general, it measures the relative cheapness of value stocks to growth stocks. For example, one might compare the E/P of value stocks to E/P of growth stocks (the inverse of the P/E ratio). More complex frameworks include metrics such as book/price, forecasted earnings to price, etc. \n\nBut value stocks are cheap for a reason, you say. The literature comes to the rescue: there have been numerous empirical studies verifying that periods of outperformance follow relatively cheap periods. Much as heightened values of the Shiller P/E ratio tends to forecast poor returns, historically cheap value stocks forecast great returns. This phenomenon is pronounced for small cap value.\n\nIn fact, simple mean reversion implies large premiums:\n\n> Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.\n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/e3fb3c34-b982-4827-9762-f5b9a8d33dc5)\n\nLet's now present some graphs. From AQR capital, a normalized value spread measure the last few decades: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/PzKHi5Q.png). Here higher is cheaper value. They use a complex mixture to compute valuation, described in their [blog posts](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead).\n\nFrom the FT, a simpler graph of price/earnings: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/nz83cmC.png). Note that here 'lower' is cheaper since they use P/E instead of E/P.\n\nThis phenomenon is robust across the world: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/ytkZewM.png). In fact, the cheapness is even more extreme than Europe: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/P3nudFF.png). An [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/a841583e-4ea7-4ff6-b673-ece22b72f100) explains just how remarkable this is:\n\n> Arnold also writes \u201cvalue stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they\u2019ve actually de-rated over the last five years.\u201d\n\n> On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: \u201cThe Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!\u201d\n> \n> Finally, Arnold writes that \u201cover the last five years Europe\u2019s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts . . . so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!\u201d \n\n\nGrowth has been impressive the past decade, as [Larry Swedroe writes](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/is-small-cap-value-dead/), both in returns and fundamentals. But value stocks has done well for itself, fundamentally.\n\n> While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks \u2014 Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks \u2014 the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.\n\nSwedroe gives a short literature review on the evidence that this spread predicts returns.  For example,\n\n> Adam Zaremba and Mehmet Umutlu, authors of the March 2019 study Strategies Can Be Expensive Too! The Value Spread and Asset Allocation in Global Equity Markets, examined whether the value spread (the difference in valuation ratios between the long and the short sides of the trade) was useful for forecasting returns on quantitative equity strategies for country selection. To test this, they examined a sample of 120 country-level equity strategies replicated within 72 stock markets for the years 1996 through 2017.\n\n> They found: \u201cThe breadth of the value spread can predict the future returns in the cross-section. We show that equity strategies with a wide value spread markedly outperform strategies with a narrow value spread. In other words, if you wonder which strategy might produce decent payoffs in the future, pay attention to the value spread.\u201d\n\nMean reversion alone predicts strong outperformance, but it is comforting to have empirical evidence across the world verifying that this mean reversion will probably happen.\n\nThis cheapness won't last forever, if history is to repeat itself. Eventually, money will flows into such unappreciated value, with strong fundamentals. The time to sin a little and market time is now. Thus, I conclude with a recommendation to buy small cap value ETFs, where the premiums are even higher.", "id": "wk4aa5", "created_utc": 1660054167.0, "score": 172, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Interesting, thanks for sharing.

This is not unexpected: the growth part is higher than the average and the value part is less than the average.\n\nNow, it could be the case that value is in absolute terms expensive. That could imply trying to market time being in equities versus bonds. But the problem is that's even harder to time. The literature on this shows that the Shiller PE can trend upwards or downwards for periods spanning 50 years. Trying to time the Shiller PE is futile if it spans your entire investing horizon!\n\nThus, the interpretation of my post is, if you want to hold equities for the long term, there is a case to be made to overweight value relative to the market.\n\n> Also RE European value being at a discount, is that influenced by energy prices perhaps?\n\nLess to do with energy prices I think and more to do with the massive appreciation of the USD.

With Tesla, the line between Level 4 and 5 will become blurry as time goes. And it won't even matter because the car will be liable.
