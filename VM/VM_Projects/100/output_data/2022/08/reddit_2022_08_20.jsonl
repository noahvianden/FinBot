Maybe he just doesn\u2019t have one, which I could understand due to the difficulty of predicting anything with accuracy very far out.  It is also good that he doesn\u2019t put out crazy predictions without much basis behind them like some others, e.g. $10k by 2025 etc.\n\nDoes anyone know if Rob has given an indication of what he sees the market cap being in the shorter term, like the next couple of years or maybe longer term like by 2030?  I know market cap is very much at the mercy of macro sentiment, so perhaps if he has given an indication of profit levels by a certain year that might be a better way to look at it, so you can put whatever PE on it you think is likely.\n\nIf Rob happens to look at this sub and sees this, thanks for all the hard work - it is appreciated.", "id": "wtg7bx", "created_utc": 1661026051.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Don\u2019t think he\u2019s made any that I can remember. \n\nHere\u2019s a list price targets from various sources \n\nhttps://teslapricetargets.com", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Been awhile since I have looked at this.

There is so much upside potential. Elon even says when you try to calculate the value of FSD it's nutty. The fleet should be around 100 million cars by then, and with full autonomy they're a goldmine for monthly subscriptions. How much would users spend for FSD and entertainment each month? Who knows. But any number x100m is a lot of easy profit which pushes up the price target.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Assuming a mere 25% of the total fleet size and the $199/mo sub for FSD, that's a monthly revenue of $4.975Bn or annual revenue of $59.7Bn, which is nutty already. 3x-ing that for the theoretical 75M vehicles in the market and you're looking (I'd assume on average that 25M vehicles at any given time won't have FSD due to cost or some other factors or say for margin of error), and you get $179.1Bn/yr from vehicles.\n\n\nBy 2030-2035, we should have CT adding to S3XY revenue, Semi adding to that revenue, megapacks, solar roof, and powerwalls with autobidder managed VPP adding to that revenue, the stated but long term HVAC adding to those revenue, and the supercharger network shared between Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles adding to that revenue.\n\nAll in all, it would then be reasonable to *assume* that Tesla between 2030 and 2035, could be hitting $500Bn in annual revenue. Then when you factor in the bot which you can run 24/7, 365 and whose cost (over time) vs output of value is probably 2-3x initially, 3-5x midterm and 5-10x optimized of FSD revenues (as economies of scale would drive margins through the roof as you'd no longer be labor constrained), then you'd be looking at ~$447.75Bn ~2035 for Bot *alone* for a 2.5x factor of FSD initial, $716.4Bn mid-term factor (4x average) and 7.5x long term (optimized) of $1.12Tn.\n\nMeans that adding everything together, it's theoretically possible that Tesla could hit $1.5Tn in annual revenues. Apple is worth $2.8Tn at ~$365Bn in annual revenues. So applying that to Tesla in 2035 with such numbers (theoretical) means Tesla is $2.8 * 4.11 (1.5T/365B) = $11.5Tn in 2035 valuation +/- $500Bn.\n\nSo, Napkin Mathology then would be a 10x on stock price value aka $8,897/share (post split) assuming no other stock splits take place between now and then. Pre-split price for all the 2010 investors who are still HODLING would be that x15 for a price of $133,455. Which will make most original investors basically billionaires. \n\nThis is pure napkin math and highly speculative. It'll either be somewhere in this ballpark or it's actually *more nutty than this and I'm off by 3-5x.*\n\n[Edit]\n\nWhat gets more batshit from here is that all this Artificial Basic Intelligence (car) and Artificial Synthetic Intelligence (bot) at 100M+ unit scales over the next 15-20 years means is that it is going to give Tesla sovereign class access to intelligence behavioral data and would put them on the forefront of unlocking the door to AGI.\n\nAnd unlocking AGI would 100-1000x the value of the stock from 2035.
