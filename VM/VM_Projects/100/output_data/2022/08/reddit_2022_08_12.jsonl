{"title": "Ford CEO Jim Farley: \"Take that, Elon Musk.\"", "selftext": " Jim Farley, president of the Ford motor company, announced the Ford F-150 Lightning as the leader of all EV pick-up trucks, saying \"Take that, Elon Musk.\" The Lightning has sold 2,296 units so far, with June 2022 being its first full month on the market. The F-150 Lightning was announced after Tesla made its splashy reveal of its Cybertruck pickup, but Tesla has yet to deliver a single truck, with the first one due to roll off the production line in 2023. Ford has amassed 200,000 orders for its all-electric pickup. Tesla is thought to have 1.5 million reservations on the books for its Cybertruck.\n\nFARLEY: We're really on a mission at Ford to lead an electric and digital Revolution for many not few. And I have to say The Shining Light for us at Ford is this beautiful lightning made right down the road. In Dearborn, right here in the state of Michigan already. The leader of all EV pickup trucks in our industry in the United States. Take that Elon Musk\n\nSource: [https://news.yahoo.com/ford-pres-jim-farley-announces-173409438.html](https://news.yahoo.com/ford-pres-jim-farley-announces-173409438.html)\n\n\"Take that, Elon Musk.\" \u2014 Ford CEO Jim Farley after announcing the F-150 Lightning is the leader of all electric pickup trucks.

{"title": "Tiger 21, an exclusive club of investors, says the ultra rich are doubling down on stocks", "selftext": "The members of Tiger 21 \u2013 a peer network of ultra-high net worth entrepreneurs and investors \u2013 are putting most of their money to work in the stock market for the first time.\n\nTiger 21 consists of 1,200 members with a cumulative $140 billion in assets, and individuals must have at least $20 million in liquid assets to qualify for membership.\n\nIts founder and chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt, told CNBC on Thursday that although real estate had historically been the most popular destination for members\u2019 money, they were now seeing some \u201creal bargains\u201d in the stock markets.\n\nThis has, in part, pushed public equities to the No. 1 spot for Tiger 21 for the first time since the network\u2019s inception.\n\nSonnenfeldt said members are not focused on stock picking for the most part, so much of the equity investment is channeled into ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and index trackers, while technology has been among the most popular sectors. Public equities now constitute 27% of the membership\u2019s overall asset allocation.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of the FAANGs that have come in from much higher prices \u2014 they are thinking there is a lot of benefit there, and obviously one of the big areas is energy, not only on the oil and gas side, but much bigger growing interest in renewables and how to play the solar opportunities, the wind opportunities,\u201d Sonnenfeldt told CNBC\u2019s \u201cStreet Signs Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know this is the biggest investment theme perhaps in human history, and it is getting a lot of their attention.\u201d\n\nAfter a dismal first half of the year on the back of soaring inflation, tightening monetary policy and recession fears, stock markets have staged a relief rally in recent weeks, and received a further boost Wednesday after U.S. inflation was shown to have cooled in July on the back of a fall in oil prices.\n\nMany investors have increased their cash holdings to weather a likely recession. Sonnenfeldt said the cash allocation of Tiger 21 members has historically held solid at an unusually high 12%.\n\nThis is because they are primarily \u201cwealth preservers\u201d who have sold businesses and live on roughly 2% of their net worth, and therefore use cash reserves to shore up around five years of living expenses, he said.\n\nIn the short term, Tiger 21 noted that members are using their ample cash to look for deals and inflation hedges.\n\n\u201cBut they also want resources to pounce on an opportunity and they have been seeing them in increasing numbers, so their cash actually just ticked down from 12% to 11%. It may sound like a small amount, but it probably suggests that members are quite bullish over the long term,\u201d Sonnenfeldt said.\n\n\u201cThey have recession fears \u2014 a majority of our members think that we are going into recession \u2014 and still between real estate, public equity and private equity, it is a 76% allocation, so that is pretty confident in the long term.\u201d", "id": "wmgje9", "created_utc": 1660295008.0, "score": 352, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Okay two questions:\n\n1.

So, unless you are ok with the risk of naked short, I wouldn't do it. However you can always add an OTM call to cut the upside risk, especially if call premium is less than your short put premium. In case when stock stays below the short put strike you reduce your loss, compared to just buying back the put.\n\nSame applies on the call side, except your loss is no longer unlimited. Worst case you buy the underlying and it tanks. Then your short call expires worthless and makes you money, but you could loose quite a bit on your long stock.

The market moves proportionally, not linearly.  By your logic, the 1929 crash in which the Dow lost 320 points was miniscule notionally compared to it's current level of 33,761.  What were they so worried about, those doomsayers?!  But a 320 pt fall from its 1929 peak of 381 is massive.\n\nDo yourself a favour, and switch your charts to semi-log scale.  That is far more representative of how the market moves.\n\n\n>There is also a bit of froth from meme stocks like HKD going up 1000x or BBBY tripling from 4 to 12.\n\nI agree with you that there is more of that sort of thing occurring now than in other times, but it's not unusual over much longer timeframes.  We've just given them a new name these days by calling them \"meme stocks\".  A new name doesn't make something new.  Take a look at stocks like MSTR leading up to the 2000 crash, which went from $7 to $330 in a year (and then crashed, predictably), or RCA in the 1920s, which had a >10-fold increase in a year (which of course also crashed, predictably).  There are many many examples of these occurring both in recent times and in markets going back centuries.  Tulips, anyone?\n\n\n>The algos just flip a switch and it's only up or only down.\n\nPeople credit algos far too much for how the market moves.  They have changed the market, without question, but it's more in the intra-day moves that you see these effects, not so much the big multi-day or multi-week moves.  The big moves are still very much human-driven.  \n\nFinal word: The market isn't some cabal of evil overlords with a big \"up\" and a big \"down\" button just waiting to fuck everyone over.  No entity or algo has control over it.  It's a dynamic, somewhat chaos-driven, near-organic cluster of many many humans and human-controlled systems.  It is intertwined with currency markets, bond markets (which are much bigger than stocks, btw), political actions, natural events, religion, moon phases, and tea leaves.  It's been like that for a long long time, and what we see today is really not all that different to similar cycles that have occurred time and again over the long term.
