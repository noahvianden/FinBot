{"title": "Peloton fundamental analysis and valuation - The market is irrational!", "selftext": "Peloton has been a public company for less than 3 years and its share price has been all over the place. It is now down over 90% since its all-time high back at the end of December 2022 and the volatility has been crazy.\n\nThe goal of this post is to analyze the company's fundamentals, lay down some assumptions about the future, and value the company as a whole.\n\nFeedback is always welcomed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Peloton?**\n\nIn a nutshell, it is a company that's making money by offering:\n\n\\- Connected fitness products - Exercise equipment (bikes, treads, and soon rowing machines)\n\n\\- Subscriptions - Media content related to fitness (pilates, strength training, stretching, yoga, meditation)\n\n\\- Fitness apparel (insignificant in terms of revenue at this very moment)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The hype**\n\nAs we all know, the pandemic caused this company's share price to go through the roof. The demand for their products skyrocketed thanks to the lockdown and the media coverage of their products.\n\n***Connected fitness products***\n\nThe revenue of their connected fitness products grew from $734m in 2019 to $1,5b in 2020 (99% growth) to $3,2b in 2021 (115% growth).\n\n*\\*Note - Their fiscal year ends 30 June, hence, 2021 is the year starting July 1st, 2020 to June 30th, 2021.*\n\nHowever, these products are generally considered more premium/luxury. For the same amount of money, one can subscribe to a budget-level gym for roughly 10 years and have access to a lot more equipment.\n\nDuring this period, the gross margin that they had on these products was around 40%, which is quite high for a company in this industry, but the increased demand did its job well.\n\nUntil 2022 started and the growth was nowhere to be found. The revenue declined to $2,2b (-31%) and the decline was over 50% if the last quarter was to be compared year over year.\n\nNot only that, but the gross margin was -11%. No, it is not a typo, they lost money on the sale of these products.\n\nWhen there's a huge decline in the level of demand, it has a huge impact on the prices (Economics 101). Of course, the tough part was to estimate the level of demand for the coming period with all the uncertainty.\n\nIn 2022, the management put a lot of capital into inventory to meet the demand, which wasn't as high as before. So, at the end of 2022 (As of June 30th), there's roughly $1.1b in inventory. That's roughly 50% of all the sales they made in the entire last year. As the prices decline, they had to take impairment for some of these products.\n\n***Subscriptions***\n\nThis, in my opinion, is their cash cow segment. It has been growing from $181m in 2019 to $364m in 2020 (101%) to $872m in 2021 (140%) to $1,4b in 2022 (60%).\n\nThe gross margin improved from 43% to 68% during the same period.\n\nIt seems that the company is more focused on selling connected fitness products as a way to reach out to its target customers and actually make money on the subscriptions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The other operating costs**\n\nIf we combine both revenue sources together, the total revenue for the last 12 months was $3,6b with a thin gross margin of 19% (gross margin of close to $700m).\n\nEvery young company is known for incurring losses due to heavy spending on Research & Development and Sales & Marketing that would allow them to grow fast. In that respect, Peloton is no different.\n\nIn 2022, the spendings were as follows:\n\n1. Sales & Marketing - $1b\n2. General & Administrative - $1b\n3. Research & Development - $360m\n\nIt is quite clear that the gross profit of $700m is not sufficient to cover these main operating expenses. Peloton lost over $1.6b from its operations (-46% operating margin). This is not that surprising as the majority of the high-growth companies are losing money due to the higher than average spending on Sales & Marketing and Research & Development. However, when the growth is no longer there, that's when it becomes ugly. In addition, I was not impressed by the level of R&D spending as Peloton's long-term success is highly dependent on its innovation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that's not all. They had 3 \"one-time expenses\" during the year:\n\n1. Impairments - $562m - Mainly related to goodwill, part as mentioned above to inventories\n2. Supplier settlements - $338m - Based on the information available, it relates to the settlement of litigation with iFIT\n3. Restructuring - $181m - As the demand falls, the number of employees is reduced\n\nIt could be argued that these are one-time expenses (as they were non-existent in the past), however, as the demand is falling and their inventory levels are high, it would not be surprising if there are further impairments, further restructuring, and who knows whether there will be further supplier settlements. If we take all of this into account, the operating loss of the company was -2,7b (-76% operating margin).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The balance sheet**\n\nOn the balance sheet, apart from the high inventory levels mentioned above, there's around $1.3b in cash. Although on its own is a big number, it doesn't seem so big when we take into account the last year's losses company had. If the margins don't improve dramatically, they will be raising capital during the next 6-12 months.\n\nThey already have a debt of $2,4b (for comparison purposes, their market cap is $3,6b) so they're in a tough position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Striking deal with Amazon**\n\nIn the last 7 days, there were 2 huge headlines. The first one was the deal that Peloton announced that part of their products will be available for purchase in Amazon US stores.\n\nThe share price went up around 20%.\n\nOnly a few days later, they shared the 2022 earnings and the share price returned to the same levels.\n\nThis is a great example of how short-sighted the market can be at times. The deal with Amazon could be a great way to dispose of a large portion of the inventory that's just sitting there, but Amazon will take its share. That means Peloton's margins are not going to be as high (let's not forget, they're already losing money on their connected fitness products).\n\nThe more important question is, is there going to be increased demand for their products, regardless of whether they're being sold through Amazon or direct to the final consumer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The key assumptions about the future & valuation**\n\nIf we take a look at the analysts' expectations regarding next year's revenue, it ranges from $2,29b for the entire year (-36% compared to 2022) to $5,82b (+63% compared to 2022). This huge expectations gap shows the uncertainty around the company.\n\nMy personal views are that the Amazon deal will help their connected fitness products to not have a significant revenue decline, while the subscription revenue is still growing strong. However, I don't expect their operating margin to improve significantly in the next year.\n\nHence, my assumptions are as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||2023|2024 to 2027|2028 to 2032|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|\\-5% decline|5% growth / year|3% growth / year|\n|Operating margin|\\-20%|slowly improve to 5%|slowly improve to 15%|\n\nMy expectations are that the company has to focus more on cost-cutting and less on significantly growing revenue (other than their subscription revenue)\n\nDiscount rate: 8% today, increasing to 8.8% in 10 years\n\nBased on those assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to $1,2b (**$3.48/share)**\n\nThe current market cap is $3,58b ($10,61/share)\n\n*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.*\n\n**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**\n\nBased on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 39% in 10 years and the operating margin will be 15%.\n\nI am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|10%|15%|20%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|24% ($4,4b)|\\-$1.9|$2.7|$7.2|\n|39% ($5,0)|\\-$1.6|$3.5|$8.5|\n|192% ($10,5b)|$1.3|$11.3|$21.4|\n|300% ($14,3b)|$3.2|$16.7|$30.3|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis table illustrates well how important it is for Peloton to cut costs and improve margin. In some cases, the fair value of the company is even negative, meaning it's not worth anything! Of course, one can argue that those assumptions are too pessimistic, but there is a chance that it plays out.\n\nOf course, if they manage to grow 300% in the next 10 years (which is the assumption of the most optimistic analyst) and on top they improve the operating margin to 20%, there's 3x upside.\n\nHowever, that means Peloton will need to bring $14,3b in revenue in 10 years. Just for comparison purposes, the total gym revenue in the US is $32b/year. This is a mature market, so growth is not expected.\n\nLet's not forget that the share price at the peak of the hype was over $160/share. If that seems crazy, it is only because it was crazy! To justify a price of $160/share, Peloton needs to bring in 2x the revenue of all US gyms combined and have a higher operating margin than 25%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Peloton as a company?\n\nAlso, feel free to provide feedback regarding the analysis, that is always appreciated!", "id": "wzxsdz", "created_utc": 1661699507.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "I think your assumptions were, if anything, generous.

Nothing was rational.  This is sort of the correction, and we're just barely starting to settle.\n\nPeloton came in at a hot time in the market.  They had massive growth due to good marketing and a lot of people at home.  They did not handle the growth very well and had problems with manufacturing.\n\nThere's not really anything majorly wrong with the company, but how well they do depends on what steps they take.  They were a 200 million company before the pandemic and than rapidly rose to 6x that in like a year.  The company has to be really well managed to take that on smartly.  And then this whole last year has been massive supply chain issues and huge increases in steel costs, shipping costs, transport delays, and a whole host of messes that extremely hindered lots of companies.  It has been so bad that if you managed to survive it, you did pretty good.\n\nThe biggest question right now is what is Peloton's stable revenue point?  What is their actual normal market share?  And at this point, how profitable are they?  That's the problem right now.  They need to actually get to an equilibrium, stop bleeding money, and become profitable right now.  And for most manufacturers, the method to get here in the Covid affected market place is to raise prices...a LOT.  Materials cost a lot more.  Shipping costs a lot more.  A company doesn't survive without transferring this cost to the customer.  The customer HAS to pay 40%, 60%, or 80% more per product in order for companies to survive.  No buying means a dead company.  And the company simply can't eat that cost for several years trying to wait for the market to rebalance.  It might take 5 years to get the market to be near normal again. Looking at Pelotons price increases for their products, they are WAY under pricing them for the huge increase in costs they're incurring in this market space.  A 20% bump won't cut it.  They're just going to eat losses until they die.  And yeah, it's shit to dump like an 80% price bump to customers, customers who do NOT understand why things got so expensive.  Most folks just think companies are price gouging.  Nope.  They're just trying to survive in a market where the cost of things like steel went up 3x, 4x, or higher, and your product is made out of that steel.  Even right now when prices have gone back down some, steel is still 2x what it should be, and it's only 2x if you buy in bulk which ties up a pile of your capital in inventory for months.  Materials are just really expensive, period.  And Peloton just needs to ask for the dollar amount they need in order to be functional, or they're going to bleed themselves out.\n\nThe problem right now is they're doing as bad as they ever have, and they currently are not doing what they need to to change course.  They need price increases, big price increases.  They also have to understand that their competitors are in the same exact boat as them and taking the same cost hit as them.  Everyone's in the same boat.  All you can do is run the business correctly to stay alive.  Want to be in an advantageous place versus your competitors?  Optimize the product for the market.
