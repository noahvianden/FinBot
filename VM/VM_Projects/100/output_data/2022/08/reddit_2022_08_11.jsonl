I just want to rub it in all your stupid faces that once again, America proved you wrong, ate your lunch and shit in your bed.   \n\n\nSo many anti-American fools kept spouting all this absurd FUD about the dollar collapsing, that America was finished, and China was sure to supplant the Untied States as the greatest force on the planet. \n\nIn the middle of this inflation debacle, so many people kept howling that America's time was up, China was going to run shit, the dollar would be dumped as a reserve currency. I'm also going to guess none of those people bothered to listen to the conference calls of American CEO's, some of the smartest and greediest fuckers on the planet. \n\nIn the middle of the worst pandemic since the early 1900's, the American system once again proved that it was the most formidable socioeconomic system on the planet. China destroyed its status as the world's go-to factory floor by refusing American vaccines and shutting down. China also ruined all hopes of being a reserve currency that the world can trust by declaring a war on capitalism that began with the arrest and torture of Jack Ma. Russia humiliated itself on the world stage by invading a smaller, weaker country and getting it's ass handed to it.   \n\n\nAnd where is America in all of this? Coming off GDP growing at a breakneck pace with just a couple quarters of slightly negative growth in exchange for huge decreases in inflation. Stack on top of that huge gains in productivity, wages, and job growth. Oh, and the United States revived commitments the world over to the American-led global system in the wake of Russia's Ukraine invasion. \n\nThe United States is about to enter a major bull market as supply chains adjust and supply catches up with demand. American corporations reporting robust earnings in one of the toughest environments was a marvel to behold. Despite all odds, corporations generally met or beat expections. If you think the bull is running fast now, just wait until those corporations report a quarter where wages have risen and prices have fallen.", "id": "wlfavc", "created_utc": 1660183128.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\u201cDespite all odds, corporations generally met or beat expectations.\u201d \n\nYou seem to be missing the part where EVERY company massively _lowered_ their expectations for this quarter.

But none of these things are permanent problems.

The line segments span 12 month time periods, and depict the year over year measurements we report as say 8.5% CPI increase year over year.\n\nThe *actual* inflation is the instantaneous slope, or derivative, of the yellow price curve (see dotted red line). What the CPI aims to do is estimate that slope, using say month over month changes (not pictured) or year over year changes.\n\nAs you see toward the right, although inflation starts to fall (i.e., the slope becomes flatter, but *still* positive), the year over year estimates, or slopes, are much steeper. Compare the second blue line to the dotted red one: this shows that even at the most recent dot, the measured year over year change is actually what inflation was 3 months back!\n\nTo best capture the slope of the yellow curve, i.e. inflation, month over month is more helpful. Year over year tells us how bad the entire last year has been. If you wish to stress how bad this year has been for consumers, look at year over year, but if you wish to analyze the future of the market/economy and what consumers are seeing on the ground *now*, month over month is more useful.

They started accounting for \u201clow level substitution\u201d which is basically a switch between different brands of roughly\nthe same product. So organic brand name ribeye to store brand ribeye would be accounted for, but ribeye to Big Mac would not, as these are upper level substitutions. So if the brand name was 10 and the store brand was 9, then they both tripled, and the person switched to store brand, there\u2019d be a very minor downward bias in that it would show prices increased to 27 instead of 30. But even that\u2019s not true as some people still buy brand name and others always bought store brand. The actual difference would be even less.\n\nA few other things: \n\n1. Even if this upper level substitution was captured (it is in the chained CPI), then you\u2019d still be over simplifying bc some people would have always been buying Big Macs and some people would still be buying ribeyes, so the inflation would still show, just less than if it didn\u2019t. But arguments can be made about which is actually correct.\n\n2. The low level substitution capture impacts CPI inflation by about .25%, not a huge number.\n\n3.

Lucid went public via a different method that does not require vetting by any investment bank and this method is only used by less respected companies (I'd use the word for the method but it is banned by automods in this sub and using it would make this post disappear).  Companies using this method can say anything they want during the pre-merger period, and as a consequence they frequently miss their projections by a large margin as Lucid has done in recent weeks\n\n\\- During its most recent earnings call, Rivian kept its future vehicle production guidance the same for the remainder of this year. During its most recent earnings call, Lucid reduced its vehicle production guidance for the remainder of this year by 50%!\n\n\\- Rivian has Amazon as its customer;\n\n\\- Rivian has a 2.5x greater vehicle backlog in units versus Lucid, with an initial deposit requirement 6x as as high relative the vehicle invoice price.  Lucid's deposit for a $160,000 reservation is only $300!   Not much commitment required on the customer's part to reserve a car.
