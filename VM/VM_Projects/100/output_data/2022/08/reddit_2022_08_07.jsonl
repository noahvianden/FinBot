That one default went on to take seven other countries with it and caused a loss of faith that set the stage for the Russian default in 98. Now to the more familiar 06-08 collateralized mortgage obligation, CMO, situation. That financial crisis closed 25 banks, lost millions in retail deposits, tightened up lending to the point large corporations (auto manufacturers not the least of which) sought bail outs, and the Fed began their policies of infinite money printers. Now in hindsight history tells up most of the bail outs were not needed. This should however give a pretty clear picture of how things can spread. First the local industries will suffer for lack of credit > Then other financial institutions that were lending or buying packaged loans will suffer and tighten their credit > Industries working with those banks will suffer > and so on. This will spread as far as the lending network goes.
