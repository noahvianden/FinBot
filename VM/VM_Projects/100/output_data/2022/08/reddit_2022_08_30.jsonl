There\u2019s a real strong argument that many major fast food tickers could really slip to new all time lows. First you have the value vs. price reality given by OP, then you take into consideration the labor issue in those employment categories and the necessity to drastically increase wages. Then major supply side price and availability issues, like meat. The cost of fertilizer is at all time highs and so growing the crops that feed chickens and cows has such a high cost, that feed is at all time highs and now so is meat. Add to that all the other overhead increases and you have a recipe (pun intended) for a real fast food disaster.
