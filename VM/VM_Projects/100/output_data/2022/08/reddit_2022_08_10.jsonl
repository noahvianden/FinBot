They will dramatically pivot based off this or next quarters numbers; while Disney, Netflix, amazon and apple seem to be sticking to a much longer game. Will see though the SVOD space will see a ton of change in next couple years given the heightened focus on cash flow and profitability in that segement", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not sure why you dont like their sub model. Im buying them precisely because of that. In terms of IP I rank them as #2 for kids content behind only Disney, and #1 for adult content by a fairly large margin.\n\nObviously there is management risk. What we do know is the old discovery folks actually did a good job with the little they had and we know that the ATT guys were always behind the curve rather than ahead, on the tech side. The ATT folks were terrible at media management. Still lots of moving parts post merger so ill be watching the closely for a while.\n\nTo me the biggest obstacle is that debt and readjusting their content creation. They already stated that this is their focus so at this point im happy with the game plan. Get that debt under control, and reign in your bad content. Imho HBO they eventually surpass Netflix. Its just a matter of time.\n\nI also think the entire SVOD scene is about to become a lot more profitable. We are going to see ads like old TV days and we are going to start seeing time based memberships. Amazon already does that naturally with Prime. I think we will start seeing a move away from the monthly model to yearly and of course, the tightening of how many streams each member can get. Netflix already started doing it and others will follow. Customers will complain but hopefully the price of broadband will come down to compensate. Im hoping satellite will put pressure on the local monopolies. In many ways what we are seeing is a repeat of how TV expanded between the 70s to 2000s except without the bundling but the addition of internet.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I interpreted things a bit differently. Ceo bashed the DTC model, and praised the traditional model of years past. That\u2019s mainly what I don\u2019t like about their long term plan, I got the sense they have all but given up on SVOD and will eventually commit to FAST like Pluto TV or something. Not bad persay but again they didn\u2019t say for sure and frankly I don\u2019t think they know either; they will react quarter to quarter based on cash flow. And currently the SVOD is a big money pit; project break even in UCAN by 2024, any hiccup to that trend and I see some reactionary moves. Debt load is high; if they hit their new heavily lowered guidance it\u2019s still manageable and as long as they even trend towards it I think short term the stock will pop. But taking down that debt over the next few years will be really tough (imo) with a contracting legacy cable business and a movie theater industry that I think is also in contraction; both areas he wants to heavily focus on again. As far as IP I think that is wayyyyy overblown. Their is literally a metric shit ton of content in the world with more and more created each day. I mean it\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about technology based IP, it\u2019s stories. What Disney did  with marvel was awesome but it\u2019s not the only way, personally I\u2019m tired out of the marvel and Star Wars stuff and some recent reports show the same sentiment ( although the people that do still like was a large %, so not exactly a dead horse either ). It\u2019s hard not to let personal bias weigh on the stock decisions since more than likely every investor retail or not uses these services in some form; for us to rank content is fruitless imo.

Prosecutors presented evidence that included detailed trading records, chat logs and testimony by former co-workers who \u201cpulled back the curtain\u201d on how Nowak and Smith moved precious-metals prices up and down for profit from 2008 to 2016. \n\nA salesman on the desk, Jeffrey Ruffo, was acquitted of charges he participated in the conspiracy.\n\nThe case was the biggest yet by the US Justice Department, which alleged the precious-metals business at JPMorgan was run as a criminal enterprise. Nowak, the managing director in charge of the desk, and Smith, its top trader, were convicted of fraud, spoofing, market manipulation. \n\n\u201cThey had the power to move the market, the power to manipulate the worldwide price of gold,\u201d prosecutor Avi Perry said during closing arguments.\n\nRead More: JPMorgan Trader Spoofed So Fast Colleagues Urged Ice on Fingers\n\nUS District Court Judge Edmond Chang said Nowak and Smith will be sentenced next year. Each faces decades in prison, though it may be far less. Two Deutsche Bank AG traders convicted of spoofing in 2020 were each sentenced to a year in prison.\n\n[Bloomberg Article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-10/jpmorgan-precious-metals-traders-found-guilty-in-spoofing-trial)\n\n\n\nTLDR - BBBY Jan 20 $80 Calls (Inverse Cramer)", "id": "wlc10o", "created_utc": 1660173764.0, "score": 2666, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|35|**First Seen In WSB**|5 years ago\n**Total Comments**|918|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wlc10o)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wlc10o)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2750207781791687}, {"body": "Wonder how much money these fucks lost for investors.\n\nPrison 4 life.", "score": 491, "replies": [{"body": "Not more than this Sub can lose in a week", "score": 403, "replies": [{"body": "A week?
