{"title": "Why BlackRock says the stock market\u2019s big summer rally isn\u2019t worth chasing ....", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nWith U.S. stocks briefly sputtering to start the new week, strategists at the research arm of the world\u2019s largest money manager are weighing in with words of caution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a note released on Monday by the BlackRock Investment Institute, they said they expect U.S. company earnings to deteriorate and the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates to a level that will \u201cstall the economic restart,\u201d given persistent inflation that\u2019s likely to settle above pre-COVID levels. They also called the stock market\u2019s rally off the mid-June lows unsustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEquities were slightly higher at midday Monday, taking back modest loses seen after U.S. data missed forecasts and China\u2019s unexpected signs of slowing growth damped investor sentiment. Financial markets have been shifting back and forth between two narratives \u2014 one in which easing inflation and slowing growth give the Fed room to back off aggressive rate hikes, the other in which persistently high price gains coupled with a robust labor market compel policy makers to continue lifting borrowing costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJuly\u2019s downside surprise in the consumer-price index gave equities a boost and helped send the S&P 500 SPX, 0.40% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, 0.62% to their fourth straight week of gains on Friday. The S&P 500 has surged more than 16% from its June low and retraced more than 50% of its bear-market drop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead: Inflation surge cools in July. Should you still play defense with your portfolio?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the equity bounce is worth chasing,\u201d said strategists Wei Li, Beata Harasim and Tara Sharma, along with BlackRock Investment Institute\u2019s Deputy Head Alex Brazier. \u201cWe believe the Fed will remain susceptible to \u2018the politics of inflation,\u2019 a chorus of voices demanding it tame inflation. Our bottom line: The latest inflation reading isn\u2019t enough to spur the Fed pivot we\u2019ve been waiting for to lean back into stocks.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they said, consumer spending is in the process of shifting toward services and away from goods, the category which benefited from the stay-at-home stage of the pandemic. That shift \u201ccould hit stocks,\u201d according to the BlackRock strategists: They note that earnings tied to goods are expected to make up 62% of the S&P 500\u2019s profits this year, versus 38% for services, as shown in the chart below. A boom in services would power the economy more than it would S&P 500 earnings.", "id": "wp9kfb", "created_utc": 1660594293.0, "score": 249, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "I exhausted my cash positions during the downturn from q1-2 so I\u2019m somewhat neutral on the rally.

Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. \n\nWhen earnings were released, Musk said the company had been in \u201csupply-chain hell for several years,\u201d but barring a surprise, \u201cwe have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.\u201d \n\nIn that report, Tesla said the Shanghai factory achieved \u201cthe highest vehicle production month in our history\u201d in June.

This is gonna become less and less of a problem as time goes by and eventually charging infrastructure becomes ubiquitous\n\nI also wanna point out that swapping stations are massive and easily take up the same space as 2\u00bd-3 or more parking spots. And probably cost the same as 10 charging stations to setup and maintain. So for every swapping station, that's a lot of extra parking spots and charging stations that could be set up instead, which would help alleviate the issues you describe. \n\nAnd while I would argue that battery degradation isn't really an issue in general. If that is something you're worried about (as I assume it is since you bring it up) I really don't see how that's not something you'd worry about when using swapping stations. Right now you might not be getting 10 year old battery packs that's been passed around between hundreds of cars, but that's obviously gonna change over time, and eventually very well used battery packs are absolutely gonna be swapped into your car regularly. And personally I'd worry a lot more about degradation when I'm getting swapped in decade old packs that's been in a 100+ cars, than a non swappable battery in my own car that I know has been treated well\n\nSwapping to a bigger pack if needed does sound neat I'll admit (though pretty limited in it's use case). And again, allowing for battery swaps, especially if different sized packs have to all fit in the same cars and work in all future cars so each swapping station will be future proof for at least a decade or more, means that *a lot* of compromises have to be made in terms of cost, complexity and efficiencies.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "For what it\u2019s worth, I like driving teslas and I think they are fun cars. Have nothing against tesla and I\u2019ve made a lot of money with their stock. I prefer NIO vehicles because I think they are better cars, especially for the price vs what you get with a tesla. I suppose this makes me biased in some peoples view but I\u2019ll try to be impartial.\n\nThe swap stations take up 3 parking spots and can theoretically fully charge about 12-13 cars per hour (from x% to 93% charged). 3 supercharger spots can\u2019t do that. So they take up less room than most tesla supercharger stations if you are concerned about the footprint. Yes most people probably don\u2019t charge to 90% though because Tesla does do a good job of telling you how much you should charge to optimize your time. Yes as charging tech improves then swapping becomes less necessary perhaps, but swap speeds can also improve. Swapping also has the benefit of charging batteries off peak hours, monitoring battery health, getting poor or damaged batteries out of circulation, etc.\n\nI personally don\u2019t care about battery degradation but I know a lot of people online seem to, that\u2019s why I brought it up. I think it\u2019s an overblown worry. \n\nSwapping to a bigger pack is limited use I suppose, but it addresses a big complaint of people online which is lack of range or range anxiety. If you wanted to tow something (another issue brought up often online) or do a road trip, and your car today has a 75kwh pack and you can double that with 150kwh for your road trip and tow your camper, that seems to me to be ideal to solve one of the issues that people without EVs constantly moan about. If by limited use case you mean road trips are rare, yeah probably right, but it doesn\u2019t stop the loudest people from complaining about lack of range. I think we shouldn\u2019t cater to the loudest, dumbest amongst us, but hey, one less excuse for them to avoid an EV is probably a good thing imo. Paying 100 bucks or whatever to upgrade your battery for a week or two is something that a lot of NIO owners I know have taken advantage of and been happy with. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is any worry about battery packs no fitting into the cars in the future\u2026 it would be insane for them to create different sized packs and multiple incompatible swap stations. The tech improves and energy density improves, but they still stick em in the same size pack and slot it into your car. NIO currently has 70, 75, and 100kwh packs in circulation. Soon they\u2019ll have 150kwh. Every NIO can use every battery. \n\nAlso chargers are everywhere in China, and you still end up waiting at times for a charge. As chargers become ubiquitous, so do EVs.

The stock price just keeps going up, and up, and up. Let's find out why.\r  \n**Stock Buybacks**\r  \nFinancial engineering has a bad reputation because of the implication that it's used to hide flaws in a business. Now, that being said, perhaps something \"dark\" and manipulative is happening with AAPL stock with relation to financial engineering. Here is what **CNBC** said in 2019:\r  \n*Apple's aggressive use of its copious cash resources to repurchase its shares at modest valuations in recent years has shown the power of buybacks for a maturing company that is clearly in a growth lull. And, Apple is not a typical company, long-term shareholders view it more as a financial asset, and have directly benefited from the company's spending on capital investment.*\r  \nWhile this may slander AAPL reputation, the fact is that AAPL is openly manipulating its own stock in a manner that could be described as self-dealing. The company is using its cash to proactively pander to large financial institutions and smart money investors. But the AAPL stock buybacks are at least rational given the valuation. \r  \nThe slowdown in iPhone unit sales in the past few years has slowed Apple's overall growth since its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2015. In fact, net income this fiscal year is projected to be almost exactly equal to what Apple booked several years earlier.\r  \n**Global Central Banks**\r  \nSince 2020, Global central banks have been pumping $834 million into the financial markets every 60 minutes\u2026 and every 60 minutes the market cap of global tech stocks has risen $780 million.\r  \nSo, an insane amount of money is being printed and pumped into the financial system, which increases demand for financial assets, and then that added money pours into AAPL stock itself. That is, investors buy the stock because the price of the stock keeps going up. \r  \nWhen you increase the money supply, smart money people use that money to chase after financial assets, assets like AAPL stock. In other words, increases the money supply inflates the price of a stock itself. In effect, when M2 increases, you get inflation in the real world, but you also get asset inflation in the price of stocks, like AAPL.\r  \nAlthough AAPL is getting more and more mature, it's still a growth stock. I mean that in terms of products and services, AAPL is no longer a growth stock, but in terms of stock price, AAPL still moves like a growth stock. And, as its stock price grows, it's actually acting like a battery, holding financial energy. As the M2 money supply increases at a fast pace, AAPL is the kind of company that can roughly keep pace with inflation, because of investor demand.\r  \nIn plain terms, inflation is driving up prices. Because of investor demand, AAPL stock price increases, which causes it to capture more of that money, even if each dollar is worth a bit less. Furthermore, AAPL stock continues to appreciate, holding the value of previously invested money so that purchasing power holds.\r  \nFor many investors, it's far better to hold AAPL as an asset than cash. As the money supply increases, every unit of \"money value\" decreases. However, if your assets can keep pace, or do better, then you can keep racing ahead of that inflation curve. Again, AAPL is a financial battery, because it holds value.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "inflation", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Everyone who buys VOO,SPY etc is pumping up apples value though, people invest indirectly", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "SP500 also just weight more heavy into AAPL as well. \n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-sp500-weighting-51660238751", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "I think VOO and SPY etc are overvaluing a lot of companies, its just all hype, imagine the stock prices without ETFs\n\n\nThat being said, VOO is the best thing to buy regardless", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Have you seen VUG?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.290454626083374}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35129526257514954}], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3993319272994995}, {"body": "Cramer says don\u2019t trade AAPL lol.
