{"title": "Why BlackRock says the stock market\u2019s big summer rally isn\u2019t worth chasing ....", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nWith U.S. stocks briefly sputtering to start the new week, strategists at the research arm of the world\u2019s largest money manager are weighing in with words of caution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a note released on Monday by the BlackRock Investment Institute, they said they expect U.S. company earnings to deteriorate and the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates to a level that will \u201cstall the economic restart,\u201d given persistent inflation that\u2019s likely to settle above pre-COVID levels. They also called the stock market\u2019s rally off the mid-June lows unsustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEquities were slightly higher at midday Monday, taking back modest loses seen after U.S. data missed forecasts and China\u2019s unexpected signs of slowing growth damped investor sentiment. Financial markets have been shifting back and forth between two narratives \u2014 one in which easing inflation and slowing growth give the Fed room to back off aggressive rate hikes, the other in which persistently high price gains coupled with a robust labor market compel policy makers to continue lifting borrowing costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJuly\u2019s downside surprise in the consumer-price index gave equities a boost and helped send the S&P 500 SPX, 0.40% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, 0.62% to their fourth straight week of gains on Friday. The S&P 500 has surged more than 16% from its June low and retraced more than 50% of its bear-market drop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead: Inflation surge cools in July. Should you still play defense with your portfolio?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the equity bounce is worth chasing,\u201d said strategists Wei Li, Beata Harasim and Tara Sharma, along with BlackRock Investment Institute\u2019s Deputy Head Alex Brazier. \u201cWe believe the Fed will remain susceptible to \u2018the politics of inflation,\u2019 a chorus of voices demanding it tame inflation. Our bottom line: The latest inflation reading isn\u2019t enough to spur the Fed pivot we\u2019ve been waiting for to lean back into stocks.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they said, consumer spending is in the process of shifting toward services and away from goods, the category which benefited from the stay-at-home stage of the pandemic. That shift \u201ccould hit stocks,\u201d according to the BlackRock strategists: They note that earnings tied to goods are expected to make up 62% of the S&P 500\u2019s profits this year, versus 38% for services, as shown in the chart below. A boom in services would power the economy more than it would S&P 500 earnings.", "id": "wp9kfb", "created_utc": 1660594293.0, "score": 249, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "I exhausted my cash positions during the downturn from q1-2 so I\u2019m somewhat neutral on the rally.
