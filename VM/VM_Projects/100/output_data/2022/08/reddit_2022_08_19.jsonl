We don\u2019t need the help of the same people we are trying to fight if anything this just proved that Ryan is not who we thought he was and we should use this opportunity to short $GME and crash the stock no point in helping someone who won\u2019t help us.

When gme, amc and Nokia were pumping last year did any of y\u2019all know who the fuck Ryan Cohen was? Hell nah we the people chose gme as a short squeeze and that made Ryan Cohen who he is today. During the short squeeze last year no one gave a fuck about Ryan Cohen we all just liked the stock and decided to give a big middle finger to Wall Street and it worked. Ryan took advantage of that to make it seem like he was on our side and planned it all along trying to seem like the leader of wsb when in reality he is a nobody rich fuck who only cares about his own self interest. \n\n\n\nLong story short WE HAVE THE FUCKING POWER not Ryan Cohen.
