{"title": "Market jump after Fed rate hike is a \u2018trap,\u2019 Morgan Stanley\u2019s Mike Wilson warns investors", "selftext": " [Morgan Stanley](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS) is urging investors to resist putting their money to work in stocks despite the market\u2019s post-Fed-decision jump.\n\nMike Wilson, the firm\u2019s chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer, said he believes Wall Street\u2019s excitement over [the idea that interest rate hikes may slow sooner than expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html) is premature and problematic.\n\n\u201cThe market always rallies once the Fed stops hiking until the recession begins. \u2026 \\[But\\] it\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s going to be much of a gap this time between the end of the Fed hiking campaign and the recession,**\u2033** he told CNBC\u2019s \u201c[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fast-money/)\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cUltimately, this will be a trap.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wilson, the most pressing issues are the effect the economic slowdown will have on corporate earnings and the risk of the Federal Reserve over-tightening.\n\n\u201cThe market has been a bit stronger than you would have thought given the growth signals have been consistently negative,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the bond market is now starting to buy into the fact that the Fed is probably going to go too far and drive us into recession.\u201d\n\n## \u2018Close to the end\u2019\n\nWilson has a 3,900 year-end price target on the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX), one of the lowest on Wall Street. That implies a [3% dip from Wednesday\u2019s close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/stock-futures-tick-up-ahead-of-key-fed-decision.html) and a 19% drop from the index\u2019s closing high hit in January.\n\nHis forecast also includes a call for the market to take another leg lower before getting to the year-end target. Wilson is bracing for the S&P to fall below 3,636, the 52-week low hit last month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting close to the end. I mean this bear market has been going on for a while,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut the problem is it won\u2019t quit, and we need to have that final move, and I don\u2019t think the June low is the final move.\u201d\n\nWilson believes the S&P 500 could fall as low as 3,000 in a 2022 recession scenario.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to frame every investment in terms of \u2018What is your upside versus your downside,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a lot of risk here to achieve whatever is left on the table. And, to me, that\u2019s not investing.\u201d\n\nWilson considers himself [conservatively positioned](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/bear-market-rally-setting-stage-for-correction-morgan-stanley-warns.html) \u2014 noting he\u2019s underweight stocks and likes defensive plays including [health care](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLV), [REITs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IYR), [consumer staples](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLP) and [utilities](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLU). He also sees the merits of holding extra [cash](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DXY) and [bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y) at the moment.\n\nAnd, he\u2019s not in a rush to put money to work and has been \u201changing out\u201d until there are signs of a trough in stocks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give them \\[clients\\] a good risk-reward. Right now, the risk-reward, I would say, is about 10 to one negative,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not great.\u201d", "id": "wodx1z", "created_utc": 1660503725.0, "score": 1333, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 311, "comments": [{"body": "Wow Morgan Stanley looking out for the little guy how nice of them to ask us not to buy stocks", "score": 1099, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s for our own good!", "score": 321, "replies": [{"body": "They may even go an extra mile and buy the stocks to show us how it's done.
