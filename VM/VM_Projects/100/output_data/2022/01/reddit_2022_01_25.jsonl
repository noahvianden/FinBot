Aggressive FED hiking + economic slowdown can take the market down much further. You need to keep in mind that even after all this selling the S&P500 still doesn't seem cheap. When sentiment turns this negative you generally need stocks to start looking relatively attractive from a valuation perspective to get investors to look passed their concerns.\n\nWhat worries me is that when I look at a company like AAPL I see a stock that could quite easily half if it misses earnings in 2022 in tandem to FED rate hikes. I'm not invested in AAPL but given it's weighting that should worry anyone in the market generally right now. A lot of tech is in a similar position too... A stock like NVDA is trading at a 2-3x higher valuation than it was just a few years ago... While I think fundamentally the overall market is fine, and that you could argue that stocks like AAPL or NVDA are worth their high valuations, when market sentiment is this negative it's probably not going to be enough for the market to just look reasonably valued.\n\nBack in 2018 when the FED announced rate hikes would be on autopilot the market panicked and the S&P500 dropped down to a very attractive valuation of about 19 PE. Today, even after all the selling this last month, we're trading at a 24.5 PE. So if this ends up like 2018 a 25% drop just on the S&P500 is potentially on the table, and that's assuming earnings hold up... The market needs some narrative to justify valuations, whether that's strong earnings or a dovish FED. Until we get one of those, I don't see how this ends.
