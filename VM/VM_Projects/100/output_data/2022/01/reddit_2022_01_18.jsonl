{"title": "Meme stocks are shorts", "selftext": "Here's the real, non-echo chamber take from someone who actually knows what they're talking about. So many echo chamber-deluded apes spit out all of these qualitative factors to claim that these meme stocks are a buy, e.g. \"NFTS!\" or \"they restructured their leases!\" or \"they have a lot of cash now so they're not going bankrupt!\" This is nonsense - a company doesn't have to go bankrupt for you to lose a massive amount of money.\n\n**Intrinsic Value: about $5 per share:** A company's intrinsic value is the present value of its future cash flows. While the market valuation of a public company can gyrate wildly around this intrinsic value in the short term, history shows us that companies' share prices will always ultimately return to this true fair price. The problem with this \"present value of future cash flows\" calculation is it's too theoretical and subjective to be meaningful, and putting forth projections here would leave me susceptible to all kinds of uneducated retorts. However, earnings multiples are a useful shorthand tool for rough valuation analysis when used in the context of other public companies' similar metrics. \n\nLet's say hypothetically that AMC stock drops about 50%, to $10 per share. This would give AMC a market cap of about $5B, which would put its enterprise value at roughly $14B. Wall street believes that AMC will generate about $435M (consensus) of EBITDA next year. This means that at this hypothetical $10 per share, or $14B of enterprise value, AMC would be trading at 32 times next year's EBITDA. Turns out, that is exactly the same EV/EBITDA multiple that Enphase (ENPH) currently trades at - and Enphase is a phenomenal business with solid IP, a wide moat, market share leadership, and phenomenal earnings power in a super high-growth, underpenetrated market (resi/commercial solar) - all of which are extremely attractive investment features (none of which are encompassed by AMC). I promise you, even at $10 per share (32X EBITDA), AMC would still be far overvalued. AMC's closest publicly traded peer, Cineplex, trades at about 8x 2022 EBITDA (imperfect, I know). \n\nIn reality, AMC is probably worth closer to $5 per share. I say this because just prior to COVID hitting, AMC was hanging out in the $7ish range, and it's a reasonably conservative to assume that the equity is worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID. Why do I say it's worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID? Because I'm assuming the massive shift towards at-home streaming (see NFLX, Disney+, etc. subscriber growth surge) permanently impaired AMC's future attendance by 25% (probably conservative). The $2.5B permanent impairment charge they took against goodwill and intangibles in 2020 provides support for this assumption: that impairment chargewas about 25% of their pre-impairment total asset balance. This is the company secretly admitting the future of their business is 25% more bleak than it was before COVID.\n\nIt's totally fine to be an ape and buy the stock in solidarity with your ape brethren and because you believe there will be a short squeeze, but don't fool yourself into believing you hold the stock based on fundamentals.\n\nOn the topic of that short squeeze - it's not gonna happen, and there is no mass hedgie conspiracy against the apes. I work as an investment analyst at a long/short equity hedge fund and I promise you that the short interest you see on yahoo finance is in fact pretty close to the real number. I have confirmed with multiple major wall street brokers (think Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc.) that there are plenty of shares available to borrow, and the interest rate is about what i would expect for a stock with roughly 20% short interest.\n\nAnother way to think about the viability of a conspiracy theory like this is to think about what would motivate the alleged conspirers to engage in this type of scheme. In the hedge fund world, everyone is motivated by getting a fat year-end bonus. As an industry, we get paid our year-end bonus when the fund as a whole outperforms its benchmark (for example, benchmark might be the S&P 500). Typically the bonus payment is 20% of excess return... e.g. if if my fund had $1B of assets under management, and we returned 30% last year vs. the S&P's 20% return, our bonus payment would be (30%-20%) x $1B x our 20% take = $20m of bonus pool to be split amongst the investment professionals, back office people, etc. $1B of assets at a single-portfolio manager hedge fund can easily be handled by 5 to 10 total staff, so you can see how the economics on a per-person basis can be quite motivating.\n\nNow, this is a double edged sword, and this is where AMC/GME come into play. There is something called a high water mark. If a hedge fund underperforms their benchmark, they would not get a bonus payment for the year, and they will never get another bonus payment until they recoup that underperformance (and tack on additional outperformance). If it seems hopeless for a fund to ever make up that shortfall, the fund will usually shut down - brain drain is inevitable at this point, as talented investment professionals will jump to another fund where the possibility of a fat bonus is on the table. Now, imagine what being short AMC last year and not exiting prior to year end would do to a fund - the stock rose roughly 13x from beginning to end of the year. Even if that was a hypothetical small 3% of the portfolio, that 3% position losing 1300% would create about a ~40% loss for the fund as a whole. That fund would shut down, guaranteed (e.g. Melvin capital) - no one sticks around at a fund that's down that much - the likelihood of ever getting a year-end bonus again is too slim. The majority of people I know at other funds who were shorting the stock for fundamental reasons prior to the WSB meme stock movement got out long before the big price spike in May - prior to that surge, the stock was already up roughly 5x from the beginning of the year, which is far too large of a loss to stomach for a hedge fund already.\n\n**TLDR:** AMC is \"fundamentally\" worth <$5 per share, and no squeeze is coming.", "id": "s77vpg", "created_utc": 1642539955.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "Apes can\u2019t read", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know what this says but it made me angry", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2505929470062256}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.013591818511486053}, {"body": "This FUD has too much logic in it for wsb.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Well played, I see what you did there \ud83d\ude02", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14150379598140717}, {"body": "Agree", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18528755009174347}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11865542829036713}, {"body": "I'm not reading all that shit.

For example, with ZM/Pton/DOCU/ etc, these algos picked up on the fact that the market was loving these stocks and was starting to buy stocks of all Covid winners on a favorable earnings release from another unrelated Covid winner\u2026and that drove an exploitable inefficiency\u2026 by quickly buying (high-frequency trading) all Covid winner stocks when, for example, PTON had a good quarter, the algos stand to profit from other human participants inevitably buying some shares of unrelated Covid winners as well. This is exactly what\u2019s happening with the meme stocks; the algos picked up early on that the meme stocks like GME, AMC, BB, etc all started to rip on retail euphoria, the model quickly adjusted to buy and sell shares of all meme stocks based on movements in other meme stocks. What this does after a long time of this pattern continuing (and more algo capital piling in) is essentially exploits  the similarity to such an extent that it actually exaggerates the similarity - and as long as it continues ti be profitable for the algos (ie as long as retail investors keep piling into these stocks when they go up and selling when they go down), this will continue to be practically free money for the algos.

Believe it or not, I evaluated GME as a potential fundamental short around December of 2019, but decided the risk of short squeeze was too high - lol. It was nice to be proven right on that, and it was awesome to see retail investors (who are extremely disadvantaged in selecting stocks) take home a big W.

Agree, the whole Robinhood debacle was absolute bullshit and was completely unfair... However, there have always been major questions about the ethics of Robinhood (aka how those \"free\" trade commissions are actually completely ripping off unsuspecting retail investors); I wasn't all that surprised to find out a shady firm like that would not be properly capitalized.\n\nOn the FUD thing, I'm not so sure that's part of any conspiracy, I think that's just the general media doing what they do. They tend to go for negative headlines because they know that generates more clicks/ad revenue, and they target this meme stock topic because there is a ton of interest by the general public. It's tough to discern that media bias when it's focused on something you feel strongly about...

He owns too much of GME for selling right now to even make economic sense. He owns, I think, 12% of the company (not at my terminal). That\u2019s about a $1B of total ownership. Now, GME on an average day trades about $300m worth of shares (daily volume about 300k shares x ~$100 stock price currently. That means, in order for cohen to dump his shares, he\u2019d have to do it fairly slowly\u2026 with a stock that trades $300mm a day, trying to sell even $30m in a single day on the open market is risky, it would push the market price down too much.  But say for the sake of argument he did sell $30m in a day - great, $30m sold, only $970 million left to unload! The problem is, he has to notify the market via form 4 that he has sold stock. What do you think it would do to GME\u2019s stock price if that news came out? Pretend it makes GME go down 10%, which is definitely conservative. Suddenly, that $30m he sold just cost him $97m of net worth (his remaining shares lost 10% of their value). That sucks, he says in this hypothetical scenario\u2026 but then he says f it, I\u2019m gonna sell another $30m of shares.. sends the stock down another 10%, destroys more value for him than it creates once again, rinse and repeat. This is why, for someone with this large of a stake that\u2019s under this big of a microscope, selling is economically impossible. Also, selling now would trigger a massive tax bill, we all know the rich prefer to keep their assets invested to avoid the tax man.\n\nIs the fact that the chairman has a huge financial incentive to make this company successful a great thing for a company? Yes. Does lack of selling by this chairman indicate that the stock price can\u2019t plummet from here? Absolutely not.\n\nAlso, cohen clearly has an ironclad grip on his board of directors since he\u2019s not only their boss from a title standpoint but also one of the largest shareholders of the company, making him their double boss (the board works for shareholders).

Every single time. Everyone always repeats the age-old cliches about greed and fear, but when shit hits the fan, there is so much panic. Ever single time.\n\nI don't really care about these short term movements. I invest for years, ideally decades and unless something fundamentally changes, I almost never sell (I do sometimes change my allocation or take some profits, but I won't sell an entire position for that). Following the sentiment on Reddit is a recipe for underperformance. \n\nI usually stick to my allocation and buy every month when I get my pay, but if I see some serious discounts, I'm buying.\n\nI bought a load of MA and V early December. I bought a lot of AAPL in Jan 2019. I bought a ton of growth stocks (SQ, SE, TTD, ISRG) in March 2020, and some blue chips as well (MCD, BAC, JPM, MSFT). This time, I've been buying loads of SE and SQ, again. Those might underperform this year, but I don't care that much. I'm buying those stocks for at least a decade. Time and time again, it has paid off massively to go against the sentiment I see on public forums.\n\nI (or anyone else on this sub) will never be able to time the performance of single stocks or even sectors. I don't buy depending on what I think will do well this year, I buy companies I think will do great in the next 10, 15 years (ideally even more). All this is just noise.\n\nI definitely try to not overextend myself on growth stocks, which is why I have significatn positions in blue chip stocks, too. Right now, BAC is my best performer. Several months ago, it was growth stocks. I wouldn't be able to predict this, so I don't regret not selling those and buying more BAC instead. I'm glad I'm diversified enough that these short term movements don't bother me. I see this as an opportunity to increase my share in companies I believe in long term.\n\nPeople who were buying up reddit darlings at double their current prices are shitting on them now. Some of those are stocks that haven't had any fundamental news or earning reports since then. Sure, the macro environment will have a significant impact, but I only invest in companies I believe in long term and I make sure they have significant cash on hand (almost always way more than debt) and are either growing their earnings or have a path to profitability.

The emergency created panic and resulted in the giant fiscal and monetary stimulus that turned things around quickly.\n\nCircumstances have changed. The federal government looks increasingly deadlocked, and the Fed is displaying its monolithic tendencies by committing to numerous rate hikes and to monetary tightening in the face of an economic slowdown. The slowdown is apparent in the most recent economic data and in the simple fact that there was a significant consumption binge even during the pandemic despite supply constraints and the resulting high prices. Once the binge cools off, slowdown begins. That time is now.\n\nIt's an easy 20-30% down from here if the Fed carries through with its plan and proceeds with rate hikes in the face of a slowing economy. China has sensed this and warned against excessively tight policy in the West, since any resulting recession will shrink export demand while China itself is struggling economically.\n\nI'd expect the Fed to reverse policy quickly once it realizes its mistake, I would guess after about six months or so. But, before that, I'm expecting a sudden economic contraction and financial market chaos similar to what happened in 1920, after the last great pandemic and the end of the first world war.\n\nIf you think the bubble/tech/meme stocks are cheap now, expect some major bargains should this scenario come to pass.\n\nFor now, my suggestions: dollars, gold, eventually bonds, consumer staples and utilities for short-term trades on dips.
