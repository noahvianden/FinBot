{"title": "History of Stock Market Crashes", "selftext": "With a correction happening at the moment, I thought I would post a history of all stock market crashes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Tulip mania** \\- Happened around 1634-1637 in Dutch, which some single tulip bulbs allegedly sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled artisan, is often considered to be the first recorded economic bubble. \n* **Panic of 1907** \\- In 1907 and in 1908, stock prices fell by nearly 50% due to a variety of factors, led by the manipulation of copper stocks by the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Shares of United Copper rose gradually up to October, and thereafter crashed, leading to panic. Several investment trusts and banks that had invested their money in the stock market fell and started to close down. Further bank runs were prevented due to the intervention of J. P. Morgan. The panic continued to 1908 and led to the formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913. \n* **Wall Street Crash of 1929** \\- The most famous and the most devasting one. It was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States, when taking into consideration the full extent and duration of its aftereffects. The Great Crash is mostly associated with October 24, 1929, called *Black Thursday*, the day of the largest sell-off of shares in U.S. history, and October 29, 1929, called *Black Tuesday*, when investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. The crash, which followed the London Stock Exchange's crash of September, signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. \n* **Black Monday(1987)** \\- All of the twenty-three major world markets experienced a sharp decline in October 1987. When measured in United States dollars, eight markets declined by 20 to 29%, three by 30 to 39% (Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand), and three by more than 40% (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore). The least affected was Austria (a fall of 11.4%) while the most affected was Hong Kong with a drop of 45.8%. Out of twenty-three major industrial countries, nineteen had a decline greater than 20%. Worldwide losses were estimated at US$1.71 trillion. The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability or even a reprise of the Great Depression.\n* **Asian financial crash -** The financial crisis that swept Asia began in Thailand on July 2, 1997: After exhausting its foreign currency reserves, Thailand devalued its currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The financial problems spread to equities and real estate. \u200b\u200bCurrencies in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia also weakened; South Korea came close to default; and some countries found themselves in recessions. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argued that although the countries had shown strong growth before the crisis, their financial institutions had made poor loans, and their domestic economies and real estate markets were overheated. Others pointed to the problems of crony capitalism. Governments and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank provided financial support, but they also required reforms.  \n*  **Dot-com bubble burst** \\- The so-called \u201cdot-com\u201d bubble burst on March 10, 2000, when a period of enthusiastic investment in technology stocks came to an end. With the internet taking off at the time, investors were lured by marketing and rapid growth of startups but had an unrealistic time frame for online companies to succeed. Some of the companies had no business plans or earnings at all. The Nasdaq composite rose more than 500% between 1995 and March 2000, then it fell to a low in October 2002. Amazon survived the bubble burst and two decades later, in the first quarter of 2021, reported $8.1 billion in profit, up 220% from the previous year. Driving sales was the coronavirus pandemic. \n* **Financial crisis of 2007/2008 -** It was the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions, and the bursting of the United States housing bubble culminated in a \"perfect storm.\" Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of derivatives linked to those MBS, collapsed in value. Financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, reaching a climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and a subsequent international banking crisis.\n* **2010 flash crash -** On May 6, 2010, stock market indices in the U.S. fell 9% within a few minutes primarily as a result of automated high-frequency traders. \n* **2015\u201316 Chinese stock market turbulence -** In July 2015, most stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell 30% within a few weeks due to concerns about a slowing economy. \n* **2020 coronavirus stock market crash -** During the week of February 24\u201328, 2020, stock markets dropped as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally. The FTSE 100 dropped 13%, while the DJIA and S&P 500 Index dropped 11-12% in the biggest downward weekly drop since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.", "id": "sb9hpi", "created_utc": 1642987077.0, "score": 284, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Neat.

The meme stocks and making endless money on stupid crap is done.  \n\n\nYou see, what most of you autists do not realize is that we have been in an era of endless money creation fueling the stock market.  Most of you guys are not good investors and never have been.  You never understood fundamentals.  You simply jumped on the money printing  bandwagon and thought you were experts making all sorts of money.  The ones that lost money were even dumber.\n\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, all the money printing and near 0% rates did NOTHING to inflation.  We tapered, then hit with a pandemic, then printed a lot fuckin more.  No one expected inflation to rise at the Fed, or any amateur investor.  It didn't, and with bond yields so low, the equity market took off increasing values fictitiously of companies.  Now it's at an end.\n\n\nCentral banks main purpose is control of inflation.  They caused this mess. They didn't think it'd happen.  It did and it's worse than ever.  The only solution is to play a catch up game by raising rates....and the more catch up, the quicker and more drastic rate rises will need to be.\n\n\nWhat you guys thought was that the stock market is a hedge against inflation...it's not.  Why? Because with inflation comes increased costs of doing business, then increased interest rates.  Increasing rates on record corporate debt is a BAD thing.  Watch what happens with this corporate debt and junk corporate bonds....Furthermore, increasing rates devalues the equity market.  Just a 1% increase could move enough money to risk free investments to affect equity valuations by 20%.\n\n\nGive your heads a shake cause this game is officially over and lots of you will suffer.  There are only 2 ways the market will go.  Either a drastic short-term reduction or a long term decline much like after 2000.\n\n\nAdvice?  Invest based on real values, not lunacy, not memes.

Conflict of interest when those who manage money want the value of their portfolio to increase, so they leave Fed interest at historic bottom rates.\n3. No regulation around leverage. No institution should be able to leverage themselves with the total liabilities greater than the value of owned assets. 100:1, 20:1 leverage is dangerous. \n4.

The entire system of having retirement accounts invested in the stock market is stupid, because people get fucked when the market crashes.

This was a retail shakeout and when prices hit bottom all the institutions that have raised money since Christmas used the liquidity of the retail investor to add to their portfolios. Used to be penny stocks over the phone and now it's payment for order flow that is taking from the poor and giving to the rich. It takes years of education to be up to speed in financial markets and retail investors are lead to believe that they know what they are doing and are even given sophisticated tools like options to trade with. The system continues to benefit the rich and everyone on WSB thinks the game of losing money is funny. It speaks to the true value of FIAT currency and the stupidity of the retail investor. The only way to create wealth is to invest the difference between your income and expenses in an uncorrelated and diversified portfolio with a longer time horizon. Buying call options priced priced based on implied volatility hoping that the option moves into the money is the dumbest thing a retail trader could do. If all options expire worthless than your option is as good as a lottery ticket. WSB is now the best platform to talk about how your lottery ticket wasn't a winner.
