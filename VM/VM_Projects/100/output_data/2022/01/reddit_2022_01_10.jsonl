{"title": "$465/$466 SPY Call Debit Spreads - Expiry 1/21/22", "selftext": "Hey guys! It's your favorite (or least favorite) lunar phase trader here. At 8:32 AM today, I had placed and filled 5 Call Debit Spreads on SPY @0.50 each ($250 total). Now to get some things straight, I had lost on my previous trade due to my stop loss triggering at -70%, and figured my first lunar trade was a bust, however, before the phase change my contracts were actually in the money a few days later. For accurate research purposes I am now keeping a log of trades that lose simply becauase of a stop loss trigger, and a log for trades that win on expiry. Anyways, the summary of this trading strategy is that the moon and the markets synchronize, and I am here to put my money where my mouth is to prove it, or unfortunately for my wallet, disprove it. I have made some alterations to my strategy to allow for a range of days before and after phase changes to avoid situations where I am one day off from absolute success, this comes with increased costs to trade since further expiry options are more expensive, but it naturally makes my bets a little safer. Backtesting, I have found that a majority of dips and rallies are not on the exact day of a lunar phase change, and most happen between phases changes, during the waxing/waning periods.\n\nCurrently, we are halfway through the 'Waxing Gibbous' phase and have already expierienced a pretty large dip with SPY. Considering this, sometime before or after January 17th (The Full Moon/End of Waxing Phase), we should be above support and breakthrough, if this strategy is proving right. This is my reasoning for placing these Call Debit Spreads for expiration January 21st.\n\n\n1/10/22 2:42 PM Edit: Link to previous post for reference, will not reply to new comments on it: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/rqqniy/jan_3rd_2022_475_spy_puts/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n\n*This is not financial advice nor a recommendation.There is no guarantee the moon can make you rich.

So, don't discount the possibility that if lunar phases seem influential to you, perhaps what's being influenced is your mind's perceptiveness in sifting all of the relevant factors.  That, if it bears out, would make you a prophet of sorts!\n\nIn your initial foray, you had the event happening in roughly the right timeframe and in the right direction.  You didn't make money in this instance because you didn't allow enough time.  That can be a function of stop loss or the expiration you chose in the first place.  Had you chosen Feb 18 expiration, for example, you would have made money.  So, perhaps it's too much to ask of the fledgling model that it give you both the direction of the move and the stop-on-a-dime optimal expiration date.

{"title": "Goldman predicts the Fed will hike rates four times this year, more than previously expected", "selftext": "Persistently high inflation combined with a labor market near full employment will push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than expected this year, according to the latest forecast from Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street firm\u2019s chief economist, Jan Hatzius, said in a note Sunday that he now figures the Fed to enact four quarter-percentage point rate hikes in 2022, representing an even more aggressive path than the central bank\u2019s indications of just a month ago. The Fed\u2019s benchmark overnight borrowing rate is currently anchored in a range between 0%-0.25%, most recently around 0.08%. \u201cDeclining labor market slack has made Fed officials more sensitive to upside inflation risks and less sensitive to downside growth risks,\u201d Hatzius wrote. \u201cWe continue to see hikes in March, June, and September, and have now added a hike in December for a total of four in 2022.\u201d\n\nGoldman had previously forecast three hikes, in line with the level Fed officials had penciled in following their December meeting. The firm\u2019s outlook for a more hawkish Fed comes just a few days ahead of key inflation readings this week that are expected to show prices rising at their fastest pace in nearly 40 years. If the Dow Jones estimate of 7.1% year-over-year consumer price index growth in December is correct, that would be the sharpest gain since June 1982. That figure is due out Wednesday. At the same time, Hatzius and other economists do not expect the Fed to be deterred by declining job growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 199,000 in December, well below the 422,000 estimate and the second month in a row of a report that was well below consensus. However, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% at a time when employment openings far exceed those looking for work, reflecting a rapidly tightening jobs market.\n\nHatzius thinks those converging factors will cause the Fed not only to raise rates a full percentage point, or 100 basis points, this year but also to start shrinking the size of its $8.8 trillion balance sheet. He pointed specifically to a statement last week from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said she could see the Fed starting to shed some assets after the first or second hike. \u201cWe are therefore pulling forward our runoff forecast from December to July, with risks tilted to the even earlier side,\u201d Hatzius wrote. \u201cWith inflation probably still far above target at that point, we no longer think that the start to runoff will substitute for a quarterly rate hike.\u201d Goldman\u2019s forecast is in line with market pricing, which sees a nearly 80% chance of the first pandemic-era rate hike coming in March and close to a 50-50 probability of a fourth increase by December, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rates-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html", "id": "s0m51f", "created_utc": 1641827318.0, "score": 659, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "Haven't all their public predictions been anti signals for the think they warn about?", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "if you want to make money do exactly the opposite Goldman Sacks says you should do.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Actually no you don't.

This is what investors do, anyhow. Buying a value stock at a bad price is not much different than buying a growth stock at a bad price. For instance, buying the bank stocks now at 52w highs isn\u2019t going to pay as much long term returns than if you had bought them 3 months ago before everyone suddenly wanted them. And \u201csmart money\u201d already saw the signs and went here, as evidenced by the prices rising.
