The largest funded of these companies is TAE technologies. \n\nEven though these companies don't have ticker symbols, these companies do need fuel; suppliers that do have ticker symbols.\n\nNuclear Fusion requires lithium to fuel the reactors.

{"title": "Spotify could be undervalued ($SPOT)", "selftext": "Spotify had huge volatility in the share price in the last 1.5 years, so I decided to take a look at the business, understand how they make money, analyze their historical performance, and lay down some assumptions to assess its intrinsic value.\n\nBelow are the outcomes:\n\nSpotify adds value to the users by providing content in the form of music/podcasts and it is definitely a disruptive platform. Fundamentally, they have two types of users:\n\n1. Ad-supported users - those that are paying for the content with their time (by occasionally having their content interrupted by an audio/video advertisement). In this case, Spotify gets advertisement revenue, but this represents only 10% of the total revenue. Of course, as the users get access to the content, 90% of all of this revenue goes to the owners of the music/podcast, so Spotify is left with a gross margin of 10%. In fact, this segment of their business is not profitable, but it serves as a stepping stone as it targets a wider audience and if they're happy with the platform and decide that it adds value, they can become premium users.\n2. Premium users - those that do not want their music/podcast to be interrupted and are willing to pay a monthly subscription for that. This is 90% of their revenue and the gross margin is at around 29%. Same as in the previous case, the cost of the revenue is the royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming that is paid to certain record labels, music publishers, and other right holders, for the right to stream music to the users. This is the part that is key for their business.\n\nThe revenue growth in 2017 was close to 40%, then in 2018 and 2019 it was close to 30%, now it is close to 20%. Even though the company is growing the total revenue, these are declining growth rates.\n\nThe # of premium users has increased from 71m in 2017 to 172m reported in the last quarter (Q3-2021). However, the average monthly revenue per user has been declining from \u20ac5.32 to \u20ac4.25 in the same period. Is it worrying? It depends. I see two reasons that can justify this decline in the average revenue per user:\n\n1. The plan chosen by the users - Spotify offers many different plans (Student plan, standard plan, duo plan, family plan...). The plans that involve more users are more expensive on an absolute basis but are cheaper per user. If more users opt for group plans, then it is not a surprise that the average revenue drops.\n2. Expansion in lower-rate markets - Same as Netflix, the pricing differs between countries. If Spotify is expanding in LATAM, then the marginal revenue is lower than the average revenue.\n\nSo, we have two types of users that bring revenue to the company and a gross margin that's at around 27%. Once they cover the cost of the content, they need to cover the SG&A, R&D, and Sales/marketing expenses. Currently, they're at a point where they're covering that and they have an operating margin of close to 0%. So, looking into the future, as the economy of scale kicks in, I expect them to have a positive operating margin. How high? My assumption is 13% and here's why:\n\nI can see them improve the gross margin and get it as high as 30% and over time, the Sales/marketing expenses and SG&A should be lower as % of the revenue. For the R&D, it could be that they remain to pour funds into that for a longer period. Of course, if you disagree with me on this assumption, at the end of this post I have a table that shows the valuation based on different scenarios (revenue growth / operating margin)\n\nFrom a balance sheet point of view, there's nothing worrying. About 60% of the balance sheet (amounting to \u20ac4.3bn) is cash/cash-equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments. They have only \u20ac1.2bn in long-term debt and about \u20ac600m in capital leases.\n\nIf you are confused about why I am using Euros, Spotify is a company based in Sweden and it reports all the financial numbers in Euros. So, I'll be valuing the company in the same currency and once I have the value, I'll convert that to USD to compare it with the market price.\n\nSo, here are my assumptions about the future:\n\nRevenue growth - 20% in the next year, then 17% for the following 4 years and then slowly declining to the euros risk-free rate.\n\nOperating margin - 0% for the next year, then improving overtime to get to the 13% in the next 6 years\n\nReinvestment ratio - 4 (Sales to capital) - Mainly in acquisitions as they have a lot of cash that they need to put in use and possible opening a few more offices around the world\n\nTax rate - 25% - although as they have \u20ac2.2bn in tax credits, they won't be paying any for quite some years.\n\nWACC - 9.5%\n\nBased on these assumptions, with a DCF model, the outcome is **\u20ac174.26 or in USD - $193.43**\n\nI personally didn't see any fundamental change in what they've been doing or how they were growing over time that justifies the share price increase in the last 1.5 years so the decline was pretty much expected from a fundamental point of view.\n\nBelow is an overview of the value of the company based on different assumptions related to revenue growth (in 10 years) and operating margin:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|10%|13%|15%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|180% (\u20ac25.7b)|$121.6|$158.7|$183.3|\n|214% (\u20ac28.8b)|$133.1|**$193.4**|$201.7|\n|250% (\u20ac32.0b)|$145.3|$190.9|$221.4|\n|300% (\u20ac36.7b)|$161.6|$213.1|$247.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd like to get your thoughts on the company and see if there's anything significant that I'm missing from my assumptions.", "id": "sgh1h3", "created_utc": 1643571744.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "You're missing a massive piece of DD\n\nSpotify and all music streamers are at war with musicians and the National Music Publishers Association over royalty rates.\n\nI wouldn't buy this company until the copyright royalty board, NMPA, and Spotify come to an agreement.

{"title": "On the Tesla Bot (Optimus Subprime)", "selftext": "TL;DR: bots are coming sooner than most people think. $$$\n\nThe problem of machine learning is a function of four things: sensor suite, code stack, compute power and sufficient data.\n\nSomething happened on Tesla's AI day that blew my mind that didn't seem to get picked up by this sub or any Tesla analysts that I pay attention to. It wasn't the code stack that Andre presented, it wasn't the new AI chips that they are developing, it wasn't the robot iteself nor was it mention of the sensor suite. It was the photo-realistic simulator they have developed internally that allows them to gain sufficient data for edge cases. I think this was the best innovation of the entire presentation. Allow me to explain.\n\nThey showed videos of their simulator in action that I thought were just regular video reel until they mentioned that they were actually computer generated imagery. The way that they presented foliage, shadows, reflections, etc. were so convincing that I was blown away. My jaw literally dropped. They talked about how these photo-realistic simulators were important because their sensor suite is vision-based and so if they want to train the neural net in a simulator it needs to be so realistic that when it runs into the same situation in the real world that it can recognize the situation from the simulator. If the simulator wasn't photo-realistic then the vision-based system would likely not recognize it. As good as it is, we can all tell that Grand Theft Auto is a video game.\n\nSo how does this relate to Optimus? Think about the first tasks that Optimus will be doing. Obviously it's going to be simple tasks and it's going to start with tasks in their factory. They will want Optimus to perform tasks that are repetitive and boring but are not suitable for robots because maybe they take dexterity or some kind of real-time decision making based on real-world physics. Think putting a cord through a tiny hole or buffing out some imperfections.\n\nThis is where the simulator comes in. Simulating a factory floor is many many times easier than simulating the real-world. You don't have blizzards, kids running onto the road, night time, the sun shining in your eyes, fallen trees, goats riding goats, etc.. The real-world is insanely complex compared to the controlled environment of a factory floor. Tesla could recreate their factory floor in their simulation and have the robots perform their simple tasks inside of the simulation. Throw in some \"factory chaos\" like other bots walking around, fork lifts moving around, etc. and boom, you're done. Easy peasy compared to the craziness of the real world.\n\nOnce that's done, do the same thing for Starbucks baristas, cashiers, baggers at grocery stores, shelve stockers, you name it. I foresee a product where one of these companies hires Tesla to recreate their business in a simulator and train their bots to do their basic tasks. Imagine the cost savings of Starbucks eliminating 80% of their baristas. What would that be worth?\n\nI am absolutely convinced that Optimus is going to be a much easier problem to solve than most people think. I think that by mid-2023, at the latest, we're going to start to see them operating on their factory floor replacing salaries and juicing up their margins. Things are going to get \"nutty\", as Elon puts it. I love the bots.\n\nEdit: it's clear to me that a lot of people here aren't understanding that when I say early 2023 is when we'll see the first bots hit the factory floor that I'm talking about prototypes doing very basic tasks. I'm not talking about a bot being able to do brain surgery. I'm also not talking about replacing thousands of their workers. I'm talking about a handful of bots doing tasks like stocking shelves or moving supplies from point A to point B. Enough to allow them to iterate on the bots and the software.

Fundamentally, all the FSD AI is doing is identifying objects, estimating their size and position relative to the car, then feeding that data into a path planning algorithm that figures out a path to avoid them. Elon said during AI Day that the goal is that if a UFO lands in the middle of the road the car can avoid it, but what the object is doesn't really matter because the AI just needs to recognize it as an obstacle and estimate its size/position.\n\nWhen you need to interact with something though, the problem becomes much, much more complicated. Take the simple situation of a robot taking an untied plastic bag and drop it in a trash can with a lid. The robot needs to know fairly precisely where the plastic bag is in relation to itself so that it can pick it up without missing it. It also needs to recognize that a plastic bag is malleable when picked up, so it needs to know where to grab it so that the contents don't spill out when lifted up. It also needs to know how much pressure to apply so as to not destroy the plastic bag, but also not drop it. Then it needs to know how to balance itself while walking to the trash can without falling over, with additional weight in its hand. Then once it gets to the trash can, it needs to open the lid, so it needs to identify where the handle is and how it's hinged so that it can apply the proper movements and force to open it. Then it needs to know how much the lid needs to be opened so that it can drop the bag into it, recognize when the bag has dropped into the trash can, and then how much it needs to close the lid and when it can release the handle.\n\nAnd that's not even factoring in the hardware side of things. Even if the AI is able to perfectly identify the object and know exactly what movements need to be done to interact with it, actually controlling the motors to be able to replicate the intended movements is another matter altogether. This doesn't matter so much for a car; if it overshoots it can easily correct that movement, and it doesn't need to be all that precise. But interacting with objects requires precision, or else you'll either miss the object, push it or knock it over, or destroy it.\n\nThere's a lot of people here who are hand-waving it away with \"AI will solve it\" without understanding the problem on any sort of technical level, assuming that once the software side is done the hardware challenges will magically solve themselves. People have been [building self-driving cars since at least 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge_(2004\\)); the challenge is not in making a car that can drive itself, but being able to identify obstacles reliably enough to avoid them, and yet despite this much simpler problem, not even Tesla has been able to figure it out despite Elon saying [every year since 2014 that driverless FSD will be coming next year](https://jalopnik.com/elon-musk-promises-full-self-driving-next-year-for-th-1848432496). But when it comes to a general-purpose robot, the very best we have now are [proof-of-concept tech demos of claw-based robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zbhvaac68Y) interacting with items at the speed of a geriatric grandma with a heavy case of arthritis.

They often need heavy tweaking and manual adjustment of forces to get things to behave like how they would in real life, but even that's not enough sometimes. We're all familiar with game physics engines breaking, causing objects to tweak out or the player to drop through the floor. Speed-running in physics-based games is basically a contest to see who can break the engine the most. Saying that physics problems are solved because physics-based gaming engines exist is like saying that because you can do something in a video game, it's possible to do the same in real life. This is why you never hear about someone using a physics-based game engine to solve a real-world physics problem.\n\n>I'm sure they will be able to code that easily.\n\nBased on what? What makes you think adding it is easy? In reality it's quite hard for game engines to simulate things that stretch. At most you'll see cloth physics for things like flags and capes (simple because it's a 2D plane that flexes), but in most games stretchy things are either absent or pre-programmed animations. Even if something does stretch, there needs to be a lot of manual rigging and hinting built into the model to tell it how to stretch; you can't just tell it that something is plastic and expect it handle it correctly when stretched, because game engines typically don't have a concept of how materials would respond to deformities.\n\n>On the robotics front, if Boston Dynamics can create those robots then I think Tesla will be able to do it better.\n\nOnce again, based on what? Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 and has focused solely on building robots, yet they only have one commercial product which is basically a car with legs instead of wheels, a bunch of prototypes, are still working on perfecting bipedal movement, and have only just started researching robots that can grab things.

I wish I could post it here, but it\u2019s not my work to post. \n\nEssentially they said there are stretched areas of the capital markets, (crypto, meme, etc) but the bulk of capital markets are not in those same hyped valuations.\n\nEdit: Ahh, heck, here\u2019s an excerpt. All credit to Northern Trust.\n\n\nDon\u2019t ever agree to a debate with Jeremy Grantham. One of the most uncomfortable professional experiences we have ever had was watching him eviscerate Jeremy Siegel of Wharton (Stocks for the Long Run) in a debate. Jeremy Grantham won the debate, but the performance of stocks has probably resembled more closely the long-term expectations of Jeremy Siegel.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t see Jeremy Grantham\u2019s press appearances last week, he is predicting that we are at the end of a superbubble in stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities. He asserts that we are facing the largest markdown of wealth in history (likely in nominal terms, not percentages, but the former makes a better headline). This is based on a return of valuations two-thirds of the way back toward norms.\n\n \n\nWe don\u2019t debate his conclusion that there has been bubble-type behavior in markets since the pandemic. But we would describe them as occurring more in sub-asset classes than in the broad markets. Areas such as money-losing IPOs, meme stocks, cryptocurrencies (e.g., those created as a joke and gaining billion-dollar-plus market caps) and high growth speculative stocks have all inflated and then had rolling deflations. As noted in the equity commentary above, the broad technology sector doesn\u2019t appear to be in a bubble. For the broad stock market to be in a bubble that will deflate like Jeremy G. predicts, one or two things will likely need to occur: (1) A crash in the economy; or (2) A big jump in interest rates. We don\u2019t see either across the tactical (12-month) or strategic (5-year) horizon.
