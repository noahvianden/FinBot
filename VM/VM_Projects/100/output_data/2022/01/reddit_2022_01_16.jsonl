No software or anything else. That\u2019s $80b profit using half the number of cars Tesla aims to be selling, with a margin that is significantly lower than where they are now, and an ASP that is arguably ridiculous when inflation is taken into account. $80b in earnings at Apple\u2019s P/E multiple of 30 gives a valuation of $2.4t. The only thing insane about this number is just how insanely conservative the assumptions are, particularly on margin. \n\nThe reason Toyota can\u2019t touch this valuation is because of a few reasons: their margins are drastically lower, their growth potential is much lower than Tesla\u2019s, their customer base is quite different.

However, the real achievement Tesla has is not the cars themselves but it\u2019s manufacturing prowess to make and develop them so efficiently. The real advantage that Tesla has over its competitors is largely invisible to the common observer. It is not easy to replicate what Tesla has achieved. There are significant cultural and technological aspects to the manufacturing advantage it has built for itself. Can other companies get to where Tesla is now at some point in the future? Sure, possibly for some, definitely no for others. However, keep in mind that Tesla will still be moving ahead during that time and will still be ahead. It\u2019s not simply a function of being electric.\n\nOther car companies come into this industry shakeup with a lot of baggage: debt laden balance sheets; dealerships; unionized workforces and legacy pension obligations. They function as an anchor and are a massive disadvantage compared to new companies entering the space. Calling existing companies undervalued is a massive stretch. VW is arguably well placed compared to other legacy makers in relative terms. However, in absolute terms, VW has a big battle on its hands. It is not doing well in China with its electric offerings, and Tesla is about to get Berlin going, which will impact VW on its home turf. It is indeed possible that VW maintains its share by virtue of beating other legacy makers and taking sales from them. However, in terms of competition with Tesla, VW is solidly on the back foot in that battle. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Tesla eclipse VW within the decade in terms of global unit sales.

Both in the long run will be even playing fields. Tesla will suffer the same issues as everyone else with unions. Dealerships will also evolve, manufacturers won\u2019t sit back and let someone else benefit from a new business model. \n\nLook at the software world. Everyone now does X as a service. Monthly fees.

In 10 years these companies will have similar gross margins, unless Tesla can remain a luxury player, which I doubt. \nMercedes and BMW will likely eat up that slot. \n\nYeah you\u2019re right I was using old metrics. They\u2019re at 30%. But again. The lowering of ASP in coming years in order to her Toyotas type of volume means their margins will decrease a lot and settle likely in the mid 20s. \n\nAll I am saying is that The world will learn from teslas innovations. And in 10 years the playing field will be much more level. And what is Tesla going to offer to magically own the giant share of the pie ? \nNot to mention when apple enters they can easily take the lead as the most popular and take 15% share. Leaving others with 5-6% to share, including Tesla. My bet is Tesla owns 8% market share of EVs in 2032. \n\nI think Tesla could easily be worth 3T in 5 years simply based on the stock market growing and hype. But not based on any numbers that make sense.
