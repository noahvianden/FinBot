As Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google were marshaling their Washington resources to beat back competition legislation up for debate on Capitol Hill this week, Microsoft smoothly announced one of the largest acquisitions in the history of the tech industry.\n\nThe lack of scrutiny could be in part due to Microsoft\u2019s reputation as an enterprise tech business, which does not necessarily generate the same headlines as social media, smartphones or e-commerce, according to Harry First, co-director of Competition, Innovation and Information Law program at New York University.\n\nMicrosoft is also less exposed to the content moderation controversies that have enveloped Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube, which have faced political blowback for their controversial handling of incendiary and harmful posts. As gatekeepers to digital marketplaces, Apple and Amazon have been pulled into political controversies; for instance, when they pulled support for the conservative social network Parler in the fallout of the Jan. 6 attacks.

Her argument that she's looking at a longer timeline is a cop out. That's what an index is for. Actively managed funds can shift back into these \"future gainers\" as they show signs of life.

An actively managed fund is in theory supposed to outperform the benchmark it's linked to or the \"market\" whichever SP500, NASDAQ100, Russell 2000, total stock market index, etc that's most similar. If ARK was simply going to buy x, y, z stocks and hold those no matter what long term to be like SP500 (as you're suggesting) then the only fee you would expect to pay is a 0.015-0.03 expense ratio like FXAIX and VOO charge.
