I studied companies that are not profitable or had a P/E ratio greater than 45.  Weight-adjusted, the companies lost an average of -15.3%.  The remaining components, those that were profitable and had more reasonable valuations lost an average of -3.59%.\n\nNone of this is surprising.  The higher quality companies have averaged a better annual return, than the rest by a huge margin (15.84% v. 10.44%) since 1999.  For the worst periods since 2000, the story is more telling.\n\nDuring the Tech Bubble (2000-2002), the higher quality companies averaged a loss of -9.12% per year.  The less attractive companies average a loss of -36.86% per year.\n\nA similar story can be told during The Great Recession.  When the financial crisis started on October 9, 2007, the less attractive companies averaged a total loss of -63.92%, while the more reasonably priced companies limited their total losses to -52.11%.  Note:  For those who don't remember, The Great Recession was a total washout for many.\n\nThe point I am making is that if one wants to limit their losses and increase their opportunities to earn a profit, they should invest in quality companies, and stay away from overpriced garbage.", "id": "s8uh6w", "created_utc": 1642716865.0, "score": 180, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "\\> During the Tech Bubble (2000-2002), the higher quality companies averaged a loss of -9.12% per year.

Historically it has crossed that daily 200 EMA back in 2018 where it lost 50% of it's stock value at the time.

If people were spamming Apple or Amazon all the time as holds they'd get equal amount of hate too. I want to see massive losses (or gains sometimes too) and GME until recently just doesn't have that because it's been flat for a year before the SPY selloff.

This hate makes sense and I think you are right in part of the hate. \n\nMy counter to that sentiment  would be one the options plays I had in January right before the bust made me over 30k. (I also had multiple option loss on GME to theta gang RIP that money but that was only a few grand) In addition if you looked at the GME Yearlt chart, Almost in a complete pattern there is a major spike pumped each 90 or so days (hmmm right around monthly options and swaps rebalancing\ud83e\udd14) so it is a good time to day trade and run options plays. Coincidentally we are about at that time where it pumps again and the one year anniversary is a week away (which likely means price suppression to keep fomo to a minimum) but HUGE price movement due to failure to delivers in February. The main reason for this would be due to an INSANELY large amount of 5 dollar puts that are obviously just used to fudge failure to deliver numbers and suppress price are expiring on Friday. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t believe in GME, this is a great OG WSB play in terms of a gamble with huge potential for moon with options, I would honestly recommend the Feb 18/March options if that is what you are looking for.

The only competitive advantage I give Netflix is their user experience is the best hands down, but I will gladly navigate a clunky UI if the service actually has stuff I want to watch. The other big advantage they have is international presence. They are already in a lot more countries that HBO which is still beholden to old licensing deals with legacy cable companies in places like the UK and Australia. \n\n\nIMO Netflix needs a big pivot in their production strategy. When they broke into the streaming game their product was seen as a better cheaper alternative to Cable. This was true mostly because the cable companies hadn\u2019t realized the full value of their existing IP. They saw Netflix as just as another form of syndication. Netflix actually anticipated the cable companies next move quite well, they understood that they would eventually pull their best IP (or raise the licensing price significantly, $500 million for *Seinfeld*) and they went hard developing their own IP or acquiring distribution rights. \n\nBut the mistake they made IMO, is that they created their content with the idea of attracting cord cutters not making the best content. So they went in hard on replicating the variety of a cable subscription, reality shows, cooking shows, travel shows, teen shows, action, comedies, fantasy, sci fi. Instead of trying to make the best content they settled for producing the most. With the idea being that they needed to fill their catalogue ASAP to replace all of the licensed content that would be leaving. They forewent quality for quantity. Its hard for me to justify paying $20/mo for the one show that Netflix produces that might be good and tbh piracy readily fills that hole. The Witcher was the third most pirated show of 2021.\n\nLuckily they have oodles of cash, the best streaming technology, but as a tech first company it\u2019s glaringly obvious that their weakness lies in their content production. Just because you can poach people from other networks with your big salaries and loaded stock options doesn\u2019t mean you have the expertise.\n\nNetflix IMO is still in the lead, but that lead has been cut dramatically from what it was just three years ago.", "score": -5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Good riddens nflx!
