I studied companies that are not profitable or had a P/E ratio greater than 45.  Weight-adjusted, the companies lost an average of -15.3%.  The remaining components, those that were profitable and had more reasonable valuations lost an average of -3.59%.\n\nNone of this is surprising.  The higher quality companies have averaged a better annual return, than the rest by a huge margin (15.84% v. 10.44%) since 1999.  For the worst periods since 2000, the story is more telling.\n\nDuring the Tech Bubble (2000-2002), the higher quality companies averaged a loss of -9.12% per year.  The less attractive companies average a loss of -36.86% per year.\n\nA similar story can be told during The Great Recession.  When the financial crisis started on October 9, 2007, the less attractive companies averaged a total loss of -63.92%, while the more reasonably priced companies limited their total losses to -52.11%.  Note:  For those who don't remember, The Great Recession was a total washout for many.\n\nThe point I am making is that if one wants to limit their losses and increase their opportunities to earn a profit, they should invest in quality companies, and stay away from overpriced garbage.", "id": "s8uh6w", "created_utc": 1642716865.0, "score": 180, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "\\> During the Tech Bubble (2000-2002), the higher quality companies averaged a loss of -9.12% per year.

Historically it has crossed that daily 200 EMA back in 2018 where it lost 50% of it's stock value at the time.

If people were spamming Apple or Amazon all the time as holds they'd get equal amount of hate too. I want to see massive losses (or gains sometimes too) and GME until recently just doesn't have that because it's been flat for a year before the SPY selloff.

This hate makes sense and I think you are right in part of the hate. \n\nMy counter to that sentiment  would be one the options plays I had in January right before the bust made me over 30k. (I also had multiple option loss on GME to theta gang RIP that money but that was only a few grand) In addition if you looked at the GME Yearlt chart, Almost in a complete pattern there is a major spike pumped each 90 or so days (hmmm right around monthly options and swaps rebalancing\ud83e\udd14) so it is a good time to day trade and run options plays. Coincidentally we are about at that time where it pumps again and the one year anniversary is a week away (which likely means price suppression to keep fomo to a minimum) but HUGE price movement due to failure to delivers in February. The main reason for this would be due to an INSANELY large amount of 5 dollar puts that are obviously just used to fudge failure to deliver numbers and suppress price are expiring on Friday. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t believe in GME, this is a great OG WSB play in terms of a gamble with huge potential for moon with options, I would honestly recommend the Feb 18/March options if that is what you are looking for.
