{"title": "Going short on RIVN", "selftext": "I know this seems to be a provocative title, but I've finally decided to short, or buy puts on, Rivian (\\*RIVN) next week. More likely one year puts, tbh, as they have capped downside.\n\nNow I know that some of you EV fanboys out there think that there's something wrong with me in the head. But, as stupid as I am sometimes, I do think that nobody can ever justify the ridiculously bad fundamentals of RIVN. Sure, the company has enormous potential and might be a great supplier of EV pickup trucks around the globe, but that's all in the future 5+ years. However, I want to focus on 2022 right now.\n\nFundamentally speaking, the company is garbage right now. No earnings, so no P/E ratio. $1 million in total revenue (TTM) with a $78 billion market cap; that's a 78,000 P/S ratio, which is absolutely ridiculous. Return on equity and assets are non-existent, so is cash flow. Rivian does have more assets than liabilities, but that's not saying much. I can't believe the company IPO'ed at $106 a share and people still bought in. Gambling mindset at its best.\n\nTechnically speaking, RIVN is down more than half (\\~50%) from ATH as of now, but I strongly believe it will halve again, and maybe again. There might be a few dead cat bounces along the way, but those cannot prevent the big picture of RIVN stock this year. The Fed's monetary tightening policies are not helping either.\n\n(FYI, Tesla IPO'ed with $93 million total revenue and a valuation of $1.7 billion (P/S=18). I know that the EV craze wasn't there yet when Tesla IPO'ed, but that still doesn't justify Rivian's fundamentals. 2020 and 2021 were the years when fundamentals didn't matter, but 2022 will be different.)\n\nThanks for hearing me out.

After the summary of the Fed meeting in December, people were cautiously optimistic that they would ease into the rate hikes and adjust according to the economic situation rather than committing to hard deadlines. It was also expected that the rate hikes would occur in 2022, and the Fed shrinking their balance sheet wouldn't start until 2023.\n\nOn Wednesday though, the meeting minutes were released, which had two nasty surprises that weren't revealed in the summary back in December:\n\n1. They discussed when they should start shrinking the balance sheet, and agreed that it should be sometime soon after the first rate hike. This means that it might start happening in 2022 instead of 2023 as everyone expected.\n\n2. They expressed their view that the job market is near full employment. This means that they have more incentive to start the rate hikes earlier than later.\n\nPrior to the meeting minutes release, people were 50/50 split on whether the rate hike would start in March or sometime after, but now the consensus is that a March rate hike is definitely happening.\n\nIn short, people were expecting the Fed to be pretty lax throughout this year, but the meeting minutes showed that they're thinking more aggressively, which came as a surprise, and the market does not like surprises.\n\nPersonally, I think there was an overreaction, and with the weekend for people to cool off and think more rationally, there will be a correction upwards. However, the downward pressure from the rate hikes will remain a constant throughout this year, because after the March rate hike people will be thinking about the next one, all the way until the Fed says they're done.\n\nFrom now until the Q4 earnings report, I believe that Tesla will hit a low of around high $900's to low $1000's, and will slowly trend upwards or stay around the same. There's a ton of resistance around $1000, and absent of any horrible news I don't think it will be broken, even considering the macro situation. There's also a general expectation that they will have a blowout earnings report, as well as potential for some unexpected good surprises based on what they announce in the product development update.\n\nAfter earnings, I predict a sharp increase up followed by an immediate down as people FOMO in and then take profit, just like what happened this past Monday and Tuesday. The problem is that there's a lot of fear right now in the market, which has stirred up concerns about valuations and future growth. It's not that Tesla is no longer a good company, but that people are skeptical that it will continue its crazy growth that drove the price this high in the first place, and therefore are taking profits and looking for opportunities elsewhere.

{"title": "What can be the fundamental reason(s) for the market crash in 2022? What this scenario might look like?", "selftext": "I think a lot of us on this subreddit are concerned about what will happen to the market in 2022 or will there be a market crash due to \"the everything bubble\"? I've read a number of posts and watched a greater number of videos dedicated to this topic and, I guess, I haven't found a good fundamental reason to \"why market might crash in 2022\".  \n\n\nUsually when dicussing this topic, experts talk about the indicators that can tell you that there is a bubble about to burst. That includes a number of things:\n\n* insanely high P/E ratios and market cap, overvalued companies that only promise to make money in the future\n* growing popularity of investing, which leads to the emergance of a large number of new investors who trade rather irresponsible and stick to momentum trading strategy\n* price growth, high inflation and federal reserve printing a lot of money\n\nthe list goes on...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut can someone tell me what might be the fundamental reason for a market crash? For example, if we look at year 2008, we can say that the reason was people not being able to pay their mortgage. After the floating rates came into force, the whole market went down. So what might be the \"2022 market crash\" scenario?
