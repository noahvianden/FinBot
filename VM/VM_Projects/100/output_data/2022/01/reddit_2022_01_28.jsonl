{"title": "Anyone else not worried about the markets?", "selftext": "The way I see it the market is reacting emotionally to fears of inflation, the fed, and world politics. But the labor markets are historically well off, GDP growth is high, covid cases are going down - and really can only improve from here, supply chains are slowly unwinding, and inflation is peaking. \n\nImagine covid being a long hike up a mountain with chances of slipping from lockdowns, liquidity drying up , bank runs, tangled supply chains etc etc. We've gone up that mountain and now we can finally start hiking back down. We see unemployment at pre-pandemic levels and our society is learning how to transition from a pandemic response to an endemic response. Of course this descent back down the mountain does require us to keep our footing. I personally have faith in J Powell in taking the safe, conservative approach of predictable, incremental, and slow rate hikes/ quantitative tightening to give a chance to see how improving supply chains decelerate inflation. I personally think Russia is mostly posturing and no real conflict will come of this. I personally think covid has accelerated technological advancement in many ways. And as soon as omicron cases start to dissipate near spring, consumers will begin to use their purchasing power on more industries, specifically hospitality/ travel. As EVs and clean energy continue to come online, less reliance on oil will continue, and not just in the US but globally. \n\nI really don't see much downside risk after this recent correction. You could say any slips and falls going down the mountain have been mostly priced in by now. I mean we have room to breathe. I think now is one of the rare times during a correction where you can feel comfortable about \"buying the dip\". Think about all the other market corrections/ crashes. In '08, when banks were going out of business and houses lost half their price, things were A LOT more uncertain. When unemployment rose at a faster pace than any other time in history and peaked at a figure not seen since the 50s, no one knew how long it would last and many thought this was going to lead to a second Great Depression. Now, markets are almost 10% down on the S&P500 and over 15% down in the NASDAQ. We have to ask ourselves are times really this uncertain? I think many of you may be in for a surprise to see how quickly inflation will taper off and how quickly supply chains will fix themselves. I am personally very bullish about the future in the US and globally.", "id": "seiwji", "created_utc": 1643346732.0, "score": 176, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "I think the short term is gonna be rocky, but it\u2019s fine.

The assumption seems to be that there are lots of cases where someone paying $100 a month actually has an average expected claims expenditure of say $20 a month, and Tesla can charge that person $60, thereby undercutting rivals and still making 50% margin (assume $10 in admin expense). I do not believe there are a lot of people who actually have a projected expenditure of $20 a month long term based on their driving style, unless maybe Tesla also starts tracking eye movements along with hard breaking, close following, etc. That would be getting more Orwellian than I think Telsa wants to get, and even then Tesla will only be able to cherry pick the very safest drivers at such high margins as long as rivals can't match.

I have not seen 40% profit levels in a repeatable way except for some very shady products (like min-med and short-term health insurance products, which aren't really insurance in my book). \n\nThink of it like this: there are three representative drivers: safe, average and risky. \"Safe\" has $20 in expected claims per month, \"average\" has $70 and \"risky\" has $120. To make 50% margin, Tesla has to pursue only the \"safe\" drivers because it can't charge \"average\" drivers $150 per month while competitors lump everyone together and charge the average folks $100 per month. That substantially limits Tesla's market share to start.\n\nHowever, if Tesla succeeds at this while others fail, it means more average and above average risk are covered by the others, which means they have to raise the rates in their pool. The least risky of the \"average\" drivers will now find Tesla insurance attractive, and on it goes. However, Teslas will only be about 1% of cars on the road this year.

It would have to be charging 50% more to do that!

{"title": "Boomers cause Stock Market Crash of 2022", "selftext": "Feel free to quote me. \n\nFor the smooth brain PermaBulls saying the rich won\u2019t let this market fail. Guess what?\n\n\nBillionaires are CASH GANG right now or BUYING PUTS. The rich will most certainly be making money in a crash slow or fast. You\u2019ve got U.S. senators buying Puts, you\u2019ve got Burry CASH GANG & buying Lockheed Martin back in Nov. (that man knows we\u2019re going to war) you\u2019ve got Goldman Sachs Partners getting a one time UNUSUAL PAYMENT (reward) for their efforts in 2021 (biggest Bull trap ever) if you can\u2019t see the rich have already exited their positions, there\u2019s no hope for you. YOUR WENDY\u2019S PAYCHECK CAN\u2019T BUY THE DIP FASTER THAN THEY CAN SELL. \n\nThis crap market started Jan. 5th (probably right when the wage slave algo workers came back from their vacations and tweaked the algos).  It\u2019s clear as day the tech sell off and slow rotation to value stocks are an effort to preserve Boomers retirement funds. The media is labeling it a correction because that\u2019s the only label they can say to not spook the boomers. The media and the markets are trying so damn hard to pump the news. Guess who has the most wealth tied up in the market? Boomers. Guess who isn\u2019t buying the dip? Boomers. Guess whose not here on WSB in big numbers? Boomers once again. Most of the people on Reddit are millennials/Gen Z and maybe some Gen X. \n\nThere are so many boomers retiring from 2020-2022 because they don\u2019t want to deal with Covid or the changing workforce. That\u2019s why the labor rates is so high, their is a massive imbalance from Boomers to the rest of the generations and already their are articles shaming Gen X & millennials for not pushing out enough Gen Z children to keep this gravy train rolling.  \n\nSo how will the crash happen? Boomers are going to want to lock-in their profits so they can stay retired. How much longer of a market downturn are they going to be able to stomach? Boomers listen to Boomer Media so they\u2019ll fall for whatever the talking heads on the media are saying. Cramer saying \u201cdon\u2019t sell it won\u2019t feel good\u201d (always inverse Cramer, don\u2019t forget 08 Lehman Brother\u2019s is a buy, then very shortly later bankruptcy) Big Media pushing out Bull centric articles saying \u201cbe unemotional, don\u2019t look at your portfolio\u201d. It\u2019s all to keep them from noticing. If you\u2019re a millennial or Gen Z go ask your parents right now if they think this is a crash. They\u2019ll just repeat the talking points the media is telling them.\n\n\nAlso I bet there\u2019s a few boomers on this sub reading this. You\u2019ve lived through 2008 and saw older co-workers that were going to retire and then saw the same co-workers back at work because they couldn\u2019t afford retirement because their life savings tanked! You Boomers reading this know that 401ks at the end of the day are still Unrealized gains. Interest rates are going up so it\u2019s not like you  can switch to bonds to try and preserve your net worth either. The only way a boomer can preserve their money right now is going cash like back in Nov. 2021. The 2nd best time is now.  \n\nNow back to the smooth brained permabulls who have only ever known Stonks going up. Ask yourself, do you think Boomers want to ride out a volatile stock market in retirement (media coined it kangaroo market to explain it to them) Boomers have low risk appetite and this market has them spooked. \n\nBut guess what a lot of boomers are going to realize soon if you\u2019re first to sell you\u2019re gonna be alright and make out ok. (The billionaires realized that in Nov. 2021)\n\nNow let use a scenario all of you smooth brains PermaBulls will understand.  Look no further than the whole GME situation. Folks who sold at $300 and locked in the gains were fine and moved on with their lives. Right now there are still bag holders still to this day waiting for whatever their \u201cplan\u201d is. The same way the boomers and their 401k\u2019s are just listening to the media. However the boomers aren\u2019t like the smooth brains holding GME, they\u2019re looking at their LIFE SAVINGS and are going to realize I\u2019m not going to get caught holding bags like people I knew in 2008. \n\n\nTL;DR\nMarket Crash will happen because the talk of it is here and no Boomers are going to continue to hold their investments once they get spooked. Media is keeping things calm because they don\u2019t want a sharp sell off.\n\nDD (Literally everyone\u2019s boomer Mom & Dad) go ask them and watch the same things I just mentioned above come out of their mouths. \n\nDisclaimer I\u2019m holding March puts on anything cheap. Best of luck to everyone\u2019s Boomer parents, I hope they\u2019re able to salvage what they can of their 30 years of gains.

Costly trucks that idle all summer to keep the driver cool in his cab, wasting millions in diesel every day across the fleet. A robot doesn\u2019t eat, sleep, need a DOT required 10 hour break, require air conditioning or paychecks\u2026. Automation will eventually replace us all, and we will eventually have to give up old notions of money and jobs. Jobs won\u2019t exist, the dept of labor already published a study which estimates 52% of the workforce will be automated in the next few decades. Even troubleshooting computer issues can be automated and my new career field isn\u2019t safe.(I write scripts already from Bash and Batch and Python, which automate tasks that used to waste valuable time for me at work.) so I think Universal Income will be an an absolute must because of this. And that when jobs become obsolete we as a species will need to re-think what we value in life. Money will no longer have meaning because the labor aspect is gone. To keep it is to allow the one who has more robots and manufacturing to become our new lords and masters, while the rest of us barely survive in a new feudalistic society. The difference will likely be close to Europe vs Africa.  Where the worlds peasants and common folk have everything taken away and the \u201c1st world-ers\u201d will have all the luxury, land and farms they could dream of, we will work indentured lives in order to have a home, social mobility will die as there is no means to rise above. But by disengaging from the fantasy of money and wealth, people could lead very different lives, where all those automated farms and resources collected my machines could be used to live equally, enjoy your family, pick up that instrument you always wanted to learn. In other words, find new meaning in life away from work and as a result all the time lost away from the things that matter to you. Future generations would never have to know the suffering caused by money and power.\n\nOr maybe I just think about this too much lol", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5484777092933655}], "tickers": ["deflation", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "When boomers die, who gets the money?
