When you state a 56% gain, you're saying you capitalized on 56% of the net credit received upon opening the position, correct?\n\n2. Theta is good for sellers and bad for buyers because as time goes on, the potential for profit from a buyers side is less than less as the chances of the option being ITM (strategy wise) is shrinking and thus the value of the option decreases. This is bad for buyers because they may have paid $X at Time A but by Time B its now valued at $X-t(v) where t(v) is the time value decay. Conversely, this is good for sellers because they sold it at $X and could Buy-To-Close the option at $X-t(v) or let it expire worthless and keep $X; note, t(v) is assumed to be <$X at any given time. Is this understanding correct?\n\nMy account is only approved for Options Level 2 so I cannot do spreads yet, but I am having a time with what I have (mostly CSPs and CCs). What I have found confusing about the spreads, is that while I don't own the underlying on the short leg, I can still execute the short leg. That is, I don't need the 100 shares to create the leg of selling a 473 call in your case. Given my experience is at a lower level of options trading, selling a call has only be a CC position for me. So in the case of the bear spread, typically the stock price is below the short leg upon opening the position. If the stock price moves above that leg, the 473, but not above the long leg, the 477, wouldn't you be assigned at 473 and have to go out and buy the shares? I thought the purpose of the long leg was \"in lieu\" of having the underlying, or so this seems to be the case with a bull call spread given that the short leg is higher than the long leg and thus you could exercise the long leg to cover the short leg. \n\nTL;DR last paragraph, in a bear call spread why are you able to open a short position without owning the underlying? Isn't that naked shorting? Or is this option typically only available if you have the capital in your account to be able to buy the underlying should you be exercised on the call (such as a CSP)?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Yes, I retained 56% of the net credit received when opening the trade.\n2. Theta is the rate of decay of the extrinsic value of the option, and that rate starts growing exponentially the closer it gets to expiration. [This free course from Tastytrade](https://tastytrade.thinkific.com/courses/beginner-options-course) explains and tests you on all the of option Greeks and is fantastic.\n\nAnd no, it's isn't naked shorting. The long leg in the spread acts as the cover for the short leg. This is what protects you from a theoretical unlimited loss on the call side, or the underlying price to zero on the put side.\n\nThe maximum loss for a credit spread is the width of the spread minus the credit received. In this case, it would have been $400 - $252 = $148 per spread (spread width of $4 X 100, minus 2.52 X 100 credit received X number of spreads). If $SPY had risen above both strikes of my spread and stayed there after expiration, both options would be ITM and would be automatically exercised, realizing my max loss of $148 per spread.\n\nI would never let that happen though, you should never let your spreads expire, **especially** if it's really close to the short strike. A scenario exists where the underlying moves after hours and breaches your short strike and is assigned before options exercise time cutoff, but your long leg won't automatically be exercised since it wasn't ITM at close. So depending on the spread, you'll be either long or short those shares at your short strike, which you'll have to buy to cover or sell after market open the next trading day and hope that the underlying hasn't moved too much in the meantime. This is called Pin Risk and you can lose a shit ton of money because of it. Buy back your spreads even if it's selling for .01.\n\nPin Risk is also why you can't do spreads without a margin account and the appropriate options level at your brokerage.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But what if the long leg isn\u2019t ITM? Suppose the underlying rises above the short leg, so now the short leg is ITM at expiry and is exercised.

That is [Scenario 2](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/030414/what-bear-call-spread.asp) on Investopedia; obviously you could close the position before ever being exercised.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">But what if the long leg isn\u2019t ITM?

You are describing Pin Risk and I covered that in the last two paragraphs of my previous post.\n\n**The only way** this can happen is if the underlying finishes between your strikes at expiration, or if the underlying moves between the strikes after expiration but before options exercise cutoff and the short buyer elects to exercise the option you sold them.\n\nThis cannot happen if you just close your spread. It's almost never worth it to let it expire worthless because the possibility of Pin Risk, no matter how small the probability. If your spread is well OTM, both legs will probably be selling for $0.01 each close to expiration. Paying the $2 to close the spread is cheap insurance and you should almost always do it.\n\nA spread is never technically naked because of the long leg, but Pin Risk is the **only** scenario in which you can lose more money than the defined risk you accept when you enter that particular spread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I completely understand now.
