When you state a 56% gain, you're saying you capitalized on 56% of the net credit received upon opening the position, correct?\n\n2. Theta is good for sellers and bad for buyers because as time goes on, the potential for profit from a buyers side is less than less as the chances of the option being ITM (strategy wise) is shrinking and thus the value of the option decreases. This is bad for buyers because they may have paid $X at Time A but by Time B its now valued at $X-t(v) where t(v) is the time value decay. Conversely, this is good for sellers because they sold it at $X and could Buy-To-Close the option at $X-t(v) or let it expire worthless and keep $X; note, t(v) is assumed to be <$X at any given time. Is this understanding correct?\n\nMy account is only approved for Options Level 2 so I cannot do spreads yet, but I am having a time with what I have (mostly CSPs and CCs). What I have found confusing about the spreads, is that while I don't own the underlying on the short leg, I can still execute the short leg. That is, I don't need the 100 shares to create the leg of selling a 473 call in your case. Given my experience is at a lower level of options trading, selling a call has only be a CC position for me. So in the case of the bear spread, typically the stock price is below the short leg upon opening the position. If the stock price moves above that leg, the 473, but not above the long leg, the 477, wouldn't you be assigned at 473 and have to go out and buy the shares? I thought the purpose of the long leg was \"in lieu\" of having the underlying, or so this seems to be the case with a bull call spread given that the short leg is higher than the long leg and thus you could exercise the long leg to cover the short leg. \n\nTL;DR last paragraph, in a bear call spread why are you able to open a short position without owning the underlying? Isn't that naked shorting? Or is this option typically only available if you have the capital in your account to be able to buy the underlying should you be exercised on the call (such as a CSP)?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Yes, I retained 56% of the net credit received when opening the trade.\n2. Theta is the rate of decay of the extrinsic value of the option, and that rate starts growing exponentially the closer it gets to expiration. [This free course from Tastytrade](https://tastytrade.thinkific.com/courses/beginner-options-course) explains and tests you on all the of option Greeks and is fantastic.\n\nAnd no, it's isn't naked shorting. The long leg in the spread acts as the cover for the short leg. This is what protects you from a theoretical unlimited loss on the call side, or the underlying price to zero on the put side.\n\nThe maximum loss for a credit spread is the width of the spread minus the credit received. In this case, it would have been $400 - $252 = $148 per spread (spread width of $4 X 100, minus 2.52 X 100 credit received X number of spreads). If $SPY had risen above both strikes of my spread and stayed there after expiration, both options would be ITM and would be automatically exercised, realizing my max loss of $148 per spread.\n\nI would never let that happen though, you should never let your spreads expire, **especially** if it's really close to the short strike. A scenario exists where the underlying moves after hours and breaches your short strike and is assigned before options exercise time cutoff, but your long leg won't automatically be exercised since it wasn't ITM at close. So depending on the spread, you'll be either long or short those shares at your short strike, which you'll have to buy to cover or sell after market open the next trading day and hope that the underlying hasn't moved too much in the meantime. This is called Pin Risk and you can lose a shit ton of money because of it. Buy back your spreads even if it's selling for .01.\n\nPin Risk is also why you can't do spreads without a margin account and the appropriate options level at your brokerage.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But what if the long leg isn\u2019t ITM? Suppose the underlying rises above the short leg, so now the short leg is ITM at expiry and is exercised.

That is [Scenario 2](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/030414/what-bear-call-spread.asp) on Investopedia; obviously you could close the position before ever being exercised.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">But what if the long leg isn\u2019t ITM?

You are describing Pin Risk and I covered that in the last two paragraphs of my previous post.\n\n**The only way** this can happen is if the underlying finishes between your strikes at expiration, or if the underlying moves between the strikes after expiration but before options exercise cutoff and the short buyer elects to exercise the option you sold them.\n\nThis cannot happen if you just close your spread. It's almost never worth it to let it expire worthless because the possibility of Pin Risk, no matter how small the probability. If your spread is well OTM, both legs will probably be selling for $0.01 each close to expiration. Paying the $2 to close the spread is cheap insurance and you should almost always do it.\n\nA spread is never technically naked because of the long leg, but Pin Risk is the **only** scenario in which you can lose more money than the defined risk you accept when you enter that particular spread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I completely understand now.

All of ARK\u2019s other ETFs, including the latest, ARK Transparency (CTRU)\u2014launched in December\u2014are also deep in negative territory.  \n\nGrowth stocks fell on Wednesday after the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting were released, suggesting that the central bank\u2019s rate increases might be earlier and faster than market has expected. \n\nInvestors were spooked as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell shifted his tone to emphasize the risks of inflation\u2014after months of describing rising prices as \u201ctransitory\u201d\u2014as a new Covid-19 variant is rampaging across the country and causing supply-chain disruptions.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost 2% in the last two hours of Wednesday\u2019s trading, growth stocks within the index tumbled 3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3%. \n\nBut the ARK ETFs were some of the worst-performing funds amid Wednesday\u2019s decline. Besides ARK Innovation, ARK Genomic Revolution (ARKG) was down 7.1%, ARK Fintech Innovation (ARKF) dropped 6.6%, and ARK Next Generation Internet (ARKW) fell 6.2%. Other groups of growth stocks, such as blockchain, cannabis, clean energy, and technology, were also deep in the red. \n\nWednesday\u2019s loss was just the latest stretch of ARK funds\u2019 year-long struggle. ARK ETFs were some of the best-performing funds in 2020, soaring an average of 150% as the pandemic accelerated the adoption of many emerging platforms and technologies that companies in its portfolios own.\n\nSince peaking in February 2021, however, the funds have been tumbling downhill, shedding much of their gains from the year before. Rising inflation has made the future cash flow of growth-oriented innovation firms less valuable today, and investors were seeking returns from safer corners, such as cheaply traded cyclical stocks.\n\nWith the Fed\u2019s hawkish pivot, it looks like the volatility in growth stocks and ARK funds will continue. But if inflation can be somewhat contained following the Fed\u2019s tightening policy in 2022, innovation stocks might embrace some rebound\u2014though that won\u2019t be anytime soon.", "id": "rx3i2u", "created_utc": 1641437674.0, "score": 654, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 326, "comments": [{"body": "With investing there's never any patience from the masses.

{"title": "SAVA scheduled for a flight to Pluto on February 21st (in 45 days). All Abord!!!", "selftext": " \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znd7bx210z981.png?width=251&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdde29303e3fc325f2edce0f447b96cec31ae6d6\n\nMy gains.  \n\nAssociate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. Let\u2019s not squander this opportunity.\n\n**TLDR:** \n\n1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a drop in the price. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The price fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150-180 days from the date of the accusations depending on the manner of filing. Because the false assertions cratered the stock price, I believe when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic, then I anticipate price recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**\n2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \\*clinical\\* data.**\n3. &#x200B;\n\n**Math Class:**\n\nStock price\u2019s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 77% after allegations\n\nThirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.\n\n**Complete recovery means the price will Increase 432%, not 66%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A quick recap of the data and stock runup:**\n\nFor this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial (both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer\u2019s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA\u2019s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the price went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull. \n\nWhy did the market value the data at 5 billion? [ Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best: \n\n***\"If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.\"*** \n\nPut simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data\u2019s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the price was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that\u2019s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.  \n\nBut before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam\u2019s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm\u2019s (another competitor) data thus far, is worse than Donanemab\u2019s results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mui1zs60z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=02dc23fb4794b0d2b41878ffeb3ff7f01f21f4be\n\n**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:** \n\nOn August 2021, a short report was filed with the FDA (called a citizen\u2019s petition) to halt further testing to protect patients. The claims, by Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt (more on them later), asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety; however, the report 70-page report and five supplements mentioned no significant adverse events. Here is the full [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) for your viewing pleasure. You might assume the price action signified the|accusations had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won\u2019t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials (Facts). Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:\n\n1) The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will halt trials. \n\n2) The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety. \n\n3) Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues. \n\n4) But Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses? The summary of the number of doses can be found [here](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam), and again here is the [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) filed by Pitt and Bredit.\n\n5) Thus IMO, there is NO chance of the FDA halting trials.\n\nI am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what Dr. Bredt and Dr. Pitt are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can\u2019t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this \u2018news.\u2019 The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the price recovers leading up to the citizen\u2019s petition dismissal. IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don\u2019t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence.  Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but I\u2019m probably not ;)).\n\n**Need More Evidence?**\n\nBelow is a tweet essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a84qpth90z981.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f1c56cd14553c388e56edd2567abcb10785a9d\n\nYou will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the Adrain et al. are trying). A safety assessment was the entire point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under no circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3.\n\n**Still More Evidence:**\n\nOn November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, \"there are no signs of data manipulation.\" SAVA price increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations. \n\n**Remi The Diamond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Chief SAVAge):**\n\nSAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It\u2019s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.\n\n[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cosyntex. Here is their insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu4s6wkg0z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=196ed053083cae9e70a8e9bd583f78b84c9a24cf\n\nReady?  Okay, the data readout was \u201cprimary endpoints were not met\u201d meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason. \n\nNow let\u2019s look at SAVA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxisqrui0z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ee063b74d1266c778ff3760281d3f574e266cf\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)\n\nSAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself.  **As Peter Lynch said, \u201cInsiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.\u201d** \n\nTo reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won\u2019t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. IMO, that date will be on/or before February 21st, 2022. In some instances, the FDA may respond by the deadline and say they are extending, but as long as the FDA does not halt trials SAVA is on its way to FDA approval. As discussed above, IMO, the sky will fall before the FDA halts trials.\n\n**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**\n\nThere will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (March-ish). \n\nSAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.  \n\nOther potential drivers of price action include:\n\n* A SI of 40%. (ATH\u2019s)\n* A float of less than 40 million.\n* A dedicated investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)\n\nAll this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.  \n\n**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**\n\n[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)\n\nWhy did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western blot says (pre-clinical data). **The FDA will never ignore dying humans for western blots. The opposite is also true.** Simufilam\u2019s CLINICAL data shows cognitive and behavioral improvement.  This is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why critics shift the narrative here: \u201c[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).\u201d\n\n**Simufilam's data shows it is:** \n\n**1). Safe**\n\n**2) Effective** \n\n**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**\n\nIt was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. These clinical sites can be audited by the IRB at any time. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The sponsor (SAVA) maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded) which can be audited by the FDA at any time. CRA\u2019s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way\u2026\n\nLong-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the price over 750-1000 within two years. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. It\u2019s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.\n\nI must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer's treatment.  \n\n***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).*** \n\nSAVA's market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point is, I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I\u2019ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.\n\n**House cleaning:**\n\nI spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: our group of Scientist investors together we have written a 48-page research report on SAVA [here, \"A Comprehensive Stock Analysis\"](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/cassava-sciences-sava-comprehensive-stock-analysis). \n\nThe Authors include\n\nClinical and Academic Neurologists, \n\nMDs, \n\nPhDs, \n\nPharmDs, \n\nSuccessful biotech investors \n\nAn Chief Global Strategist and Healthcare Leader\n\nThrough my investing career, IMO, the first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data they examine closely to see what others miss. Mr. Market's \"headline hysteria\" usually means buying opportunities for them (\u201coverreaction with reversion to the mean\u201d).\n\nSAVA's YT presence had grown courtesy of the one and only OG Joe Springer (He was a bull when SAVA was $6).  \n\nIf you have dyslexia and prefer to watch (not read), please watch [ Dr. Boyers (Academic and Clinical Neurologist) discuss SAVA's medication with Joe Springer here](https://youtu.be/h55Rio8qhy8).\n\n**Did I mention SAVA\u2019s historical data and Alzheimer\u2019s patients, families, physicians, and scientists have become a dedicated investor base rallying around the historical data? We are investors that will not sell unless the data changes.** \n\nWith the allegations expiring and the CUNY investigation ending, our SAVAge group plans to start pitching to tutes.  \n\n**Lastly:**\n\n**The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud and the FDA will halt trials, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either orbit Pluto or implode to $7 (cash price).  \n\nAnyone with genuine questions or who believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.  \n\nAll the above represent my own opinions. This is not financial or medical advice. I have been wrong many times, so do your own DD.

That does not mean the FDA requires a placebo arm and it does not mean the medication is not effective.  \n\nBelow is the analysis that clearly shows selection bias is not a factor.  \n\nFrom the CP filed with the FDA:\n\nA more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-Cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect is highly probable and placebo effect unlikely.\n\n\nA meta-analysis (https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jalz.2009.05.665) published by Ito et al. looked at placebo response data in 19,972 patients between 1990 and 2008. The disease progression in mild to moderate AD patients was estimated at 5.5 points per year.\n\n\nThe disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a follow-up analysis\n\n (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23803296/), Ito et al. also highlight that the placebo response tends to be more significant in the first few months.\n\nA follow-up meta-analysis by [Zhang et al](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00630-5). also looked at placebo response data in 19,210 patients between 1992 and 2019. The disease progression rate was estimated at 5.82 points per year. It's also suggested that placebo effect plateaus at approximately 16 weeks in clinical trials.\n\n\nSimufilam's ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above shows placebo effect waned at 6 months.\n\nThe data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-Cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-Cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. If a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-Cog at twelve months or greater. In that case this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below.\n\n\nTaking a closer look at the delta between the placebo cohorts (discussed above) and the OLE ADAS-Cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-Cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. A placebo effect can not explain this, in my estimation.\n\n\nSuppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04 based on the 40,000+ placebo cohort. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval based on FDA's treatment of Aduhelm, Donanemab, Gantenerumab. The three mentioned AD medications had received AA or BTD based on inferior clinical response to Simufilam. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes Phase 3 a foregone conclusion.\n\n\nLets review trials with already approved AD medications from open label data. Does open-label status make the data look more positive than it should be? This study (Safety and Efficacy of Donepezil HCl 23 mg in Patients With Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease - Study Results) and this study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2034585) of existing AD drug donepezil was open-label. Yet, patients declined after six months, which is not significantly different from the randomized control data. This implies that when it comes to AD, an open-label and a controlled study gives similar results.\n\nThe bonus structure of SAVA is irrelevant as it has not been paid out yet:\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company achieved 10 Valuation Milestones triggering potential Company obligations to all Plan participants from a minimum of $81.0 million up to a hypothetical maximum of $195.0 million, to be determined by the Compensation Committee. However, no compensation expense has been recorded since no grant date has occurred and no Performance Conditions are considered probable of being met. (taken directly from SEC form 10Q)\n\n\nThose skeptical of Cassava often reference the bonus program as evidence of a pump and dump scheme. However, that seems very unlikely considering the cash bonus plan requires SAVA to achieve a merger / acquisition, or have enough cash on hand to pay the bonus incentive. At this point in time, neither of those two conditions are being met. \n\nAdditionally, SAVA\u2019s share price was ~$8 in December of 2020. Throughout 2021, although SAVA hit an all-time high share price of $146, none of the insiders sold shares in the company. Even though SAVA stock has closed at upwards of a 10x multiplier of its December 2020 high, insiders chose not to sell. That being said, the likelihood of a \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme is considerably unlikely. \n\n\nWell I thought this all sounded odd, so I dug into the 10Q to figure out what the actual deal was. It turns out that the bonus for the 5B market cap is NOT 350 or 320M as I have seen quoted in various comments, but is actually 50M, IN AGGREGATE, meaning the CEO gets one third of the 50M pool, and other roles get smaller percentages of the aggregate bonus figure. So the CEO\u2019s actual bonus here is closer to 16.75M, which is a nice chunk of change, but not anywhere near what I would think would be motivation or compelling for a mere P&D scheme. He stands to make far, FAR more off stock or options if the company can reach a higher market cap than 5B. Also note that many CEOs, such as Elon Musk, get far more generous CEO stock compensation plans. This is all normal stuff.\n\n\nNote that the board must agree that there is adequate money to pay the bonus and right now the money is set aside for the trials. Remi owns approximately 2,000,000 shares and didn't sell a single one as it rose to $146/share. He believed in the company so much he bought shares on the open market the same as a retail investor. If you watch his interviews, you can tell he believes in the science and the company. \n\nhttps://sec.report/Document/0001069530-21-000045/", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yet NIH keeps funding, fda keeps allowing phase 3 to continue, and inflow of institutions keeps increasing.

Two issues concern me, however. First the date of the CP expiration. Doesn't effect my investment, it's just I hate not knowing. Due to the  mention of the IND in the acknowledgement letter from the FDA to the shorters, I am of the mind that this would delay an application and therefore the CP would be subject to the 150 day limit and no response requirement necessary as stated in the 2018 FDA guidande issued for these matters. If this is not the case, why does this guidance not apply to this CP? Second, and for my part most importantly, I see SAVA as a two horse team at this moment. SavaDX could be a monster by itself and that alone improve the market cap greatly. When reading the risk/reward reviews, this seems to be completely discounted.
