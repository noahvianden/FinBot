{"title": "Intel to Invest at Least $20 Billion in New Chip Factories in Ohio", "selftext": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/technology/intel-chip-factories-ohio.html\n\nIntel has selected Ohio for a new chip manufacturing complex that would cost at least $20 billion, ramping up an effort to increase U.S. production of computer chips as users grapple with a lingering shortage of the vital components.\n\nIntel said Friday that the new site near Columbus would initially have two chip factories and would directly employ 3,000 people, while creating additional jobs in construction and at nearby businesses.\n\nPatrick Gelsinger, who became Intel\u2019s chief executive last year, has rapidly increased the company\u2019s investments in manufacturing to help reduce U.S. reliance on foreign chip makers while lobbying Congress to pass incentives aimed at increasing domestic chip production. He has said that Intel might invest as much as $100 billion over a decade in its next U.S. manufacturing campus, linking the scope and speed of that expansion to expected federal grants if Congress approves a spending package known as the CHIPS Act.\n\n\u201cWe will go bigger and broader if it gets funded,\u201d Mr. Gelsinger, 60, said in a recent interview. \u201cBut our recovery plans don\u2019t rely on the CHIPS act.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden will meet with Mr. Gelsinger at the White House on Friday to discuss the project, Intel said. Administration officials have aggressively pushed the CHIPS Act.\n\nIntel\u2019s move has geopolitical implications, as well as significance for supply chains. Chips, which act as the brains of computers and many other devices, are largely manufactured in Taiwan, which China has expressed territorial claims toward. During the pandemic, they have also been in short supply because of overwhelming demand and Covid-related disruptions to manufacturing and labor supply, raising questions about how to ensure a consistent chip pipeline.\n\nThe move is Intel\u2019s first to a new state for manufacturing in more than 40 years. The company, based in Silicon Valley, has U.S. factories in Oregon, New Mexico and Arizona. Last March, Mr. Gelsinger chose an existing complex near Phoenix for a $20 billion expansion, which is now underway.", "id": "s99i92", "created_utc": 1642767598.0, "score": 535, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "The Fed is about to commit a disasterous policy mistake.", "selftext": "Long post warning, but there is a lot on my mind this morning.\n\nWhat a predicament. In the 4th quarter of last year, I predicted the 1st quarter of 2022 would bring volatility and devaluation to financial markets. So far, this appears to have been correct. Aside from the technical indicators showing visible cracks, there are true macroeconomic and monetary policy concerns.\n\nFirstly, inflation soared 7% in 2021, which is the highest rate in over four decades. What makes this more troubling is the current calculations for inflation are inherently flawed, resulting in under reporting. This is primarily due to the \u201cowners equivalent rent\u201d category being substituted in lieu of actual home prices, which differs from the late 1970\u2019s, early 1980\u2019s model. If you calculate inflation under the old model, inflation is considerably higher. Inflation is great for equities, so long as corporations can pass on increased supplier costs to consumers. The spread between PPI and CPI shows this isn\u2019t happening on the broad scale. Margins are compressing.\n\nSecondly, the Fed\u2019s primary tool to combat inflation is tightening monetary policy via reduction in QE, rate hikes, and eventually balance sheet runoff. Problem is, the Fed is forecasting three to four rate hikes in 2022. My questions to Jerome Powell: How do you expect a 1% rise in rates to offset negative real yields that are currently at -6% to -7%? This likely isn\u2019t enough to curb inflation. Remember, Paul Volker had to to raise rates to 20% plus once inflation became entrenched in the economy. Secondly, with the 2-year and 10-year spread sitting around 0.85%, is the Fed really planning on hiking rates to the point it results in a yield curve inversion? I highly doubt it, but they have made many terrible decisions throughout the years.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t let these politicians fool you by talking about retail sales numbers, the unemployment rate, and other \u201csuccess\u201d stories. Adjust December 2021 retail sales for inflation and you will see the numbers were abysmal. Adjust the unemployment rate for the drop in the Labor Force Participation Rate, and you will see we are not at historic lows.\n\nThe financial markets are about to go (already happening to a degree) into a tantrum because the Fed is telling us they want to tighten monetary policy in a weak economy (under the surface), which could result in a yield curve inversion (almost always preceding a recession in 6 to 24 months), and despite there efforts, it is entirely possible inflation continues to plow forward. The recipe for stagflation is in the Fed\u2019s cookbook and the cookbook is on the counter.\n\nProblem is, the Fed is out of viable options and they know it. They\u2019ve known it for months, but they have to display unfounded confidence to keep the music going.", "id": "s9c4u3", "created_utc": 1642775786.0, "score": 236, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "So, we're at that scene where the titanic is sinking and the fed keeps playing the music so everyone remains calm.", "score": 221, "replies": [{"body": "Before it sank, half the ship lifted into the air.

Right now the issue is retail demand which is leading to high prices, and Covid sick penalties which is wreaking havoc with the supply chain for retail the world around. Not to mention that spot shipping, traditionally used by industries to order parts has been bought up by retail as well.  Same story, it\u2019s all due to Covid and the US Gov handouts that didn\u2019t go to where it was needed, and went everywhere. \n\nWhat the economy needs is for retail demand to subside and for services to take some of that load. That can\u2019t happen until Covid disappears, so the economy is going to be stuck in volatility until a way forward is determined.\n\nThat way forward isn\u2019t all interest rate hikes. Xi has been showing the world that policies are just as effective to cool down markets.. to the point that China is now lowering interest rates, which is deflationary pressure on retail goods coming out of China. \n\nThe Fed doesn\u2019t have to hike rates like a madman, they only need to appear to be combating inflation, so modest rate hikes, preceded by very aggressive end to QE, and then unloading treasuries when it makes sense. The reason is because unlike the 80\u2019s, the amount of debt in the market is massive, a modest hike with a stance for more will have a large trigger on reducing exposure to volatile assets (like the riskiest of tech venture speculating stocks that aren\u2019t making money today), house prices across the board (as high house prices are hit hardest by interest rate increases). It also curtails risky investment by businesses and reduces (eliminates) those jobs that are borderline necessary for the businesses. \n\nFed rate increases have a lag effect on the economy when they\u2019re implemented. Meaning that their effect isn\u2019t felt for at least a quarter. So a modest increase in rates now, will have an effect this spring/summer, which will coincide with continued improvement in retail supply chains, the dry-up in capital (stimulus) we\u2019re experiencing now in the market, and the likely change from Covid being a pandemic to an endemic, which switches retail demand to services. \n\nSo Powell\u2019s thesis on transitory rates is intact, it just depends on Covid being finished for it to come true. There are now Covid cures, Covid vaccines in pill form, and a slew of new treatments. So Covid is over, it just doesn\u2019t know it yet. \n\nThink about the inflationary talk recently as well. The Fed last talked about this in December. Since then the media took 3 rate hikes in 2022 and increased it to 7, with multiple point increments. This is ridiculous, the press is whipping up a frenzy based on speculation. So the press is being influenced by a few bad actors who wanted to see the market dip\u2026 and they brought about the result by spreading fear and lies.\n\nCovid also did that thing that Republicans have been railing about for decades. Those expats that live in other countries.. they moved to the US for Covid, they\u2019ll likely go back home when it\u2019s over. Similarly, there are likely many rich foreign national\u2019s that are doing the same, they\u2019ll likely be going back home afterwards as well. Everything in the market is determined by Covid, so it\u2019s likely that it\u2019s resolution will have an impact.  Atm though, we\u2019re balls deep in omicron and the Fed has been mum for over a month and it\u2019s led to some bad actors getting air-time, with politics also whipping up inflationary fears because it serves the republicans efforts in defeating Biden and the Dems.
