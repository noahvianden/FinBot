{"title": "Bad Apple: Why AAPL is Heavily Overvalued", "selftext": "Let me first start by saying AAPL is a tremendous company with an incredibly strong present and future - contrary to the title. They make great products and are constantly looking to innovate. If you are an investor I believe you will likely see strong returns over a longer time horizon.\n\nRight now however, AAPL is overvalued in my opinion.\n\nLet's observe the last 4 years of revenue:\n\n* 2018 = $266B\n* 2019 = $260B\n* 2020 = $275B\n* **2021 = $366B**\n\nOne of these things is not like the other. As you can see, prior to 2021 we saw relatively stable growth, and then BOOM 33%. On the surface this looks great! But let's get into why this has me worried.\n\nI'm a health insurance actuary and in our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit **RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH.** This occurs when there are **plan design changes**.\n\n**RUSH**\n\nWhen a new benefit is added, or there is a significant benefit increase beyond what we would typically observe. People **RUSH** to use the new benefits as they get new glasses, get their cavities filled, and get that procedure they've been holding off on in anticipation of the benefit increase.\n\n**CRUSH**\n\nThe next year there is nothing to spend money on. Everyone already got their new glasses, teeth are filled, and that procedure they got fixed whatever health issue they had. The inflated spending experience a **CRUSH.**\n\n**HUSH**\n\n2-years after the plan change this volatility will **HUSH.** We will observe that claiming returns to a level that we would typically expect, but since the prior year was a CRUSH, the year-over-year increase appears more severe than expected. This would catch a layman off guard, but a well informed actuary would understand that benefits are simply returning back to a reasonable level.\n\nIn the case of AAPL. The plan design change is the pandemic. People weren't spending money on restaurants, bars, travel, concerts, sports, etc. so they had more dollars to allocate to updating their gadgets (**RUSH**). In 2022, people will have already updated their gadgets so there is no need to go out and purchase more. Add to this that the world is expected to reopen, so more dollars will be allocated to other things mentioned above (**CRUSH**). In 2023, I would expect spending to return to a more routine level, some people will update their gadgets while others will hold off another year (HUSH).\n\nEssentially what I'm expecting is that AAPL will have a down year, worse than expected (because of **CRUSH**). This will cause people to over-sell which is where the buying opportunity comes in because in the **HUSH** phase, we know that spending will return to normal. It will appear to be strong growth but in reality it is simply just reverting to the mean.\n\nI read the annual report to look at the components of AAPL's revenue. I would expect that wearables, home, accessories and services continue to grow at a strong pace since those are newer products that are growing organically compared to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, iPhone, iPad and Mac saw a combined 36% YoY increase and they account for 71% of revenue. There is a chance that the market prices all this in but the point of this piece of writing is to inform you that these changes are typically more exaggerated than intuition expects. With a PE of 28.5 the market expects growth, and if AAPL instead sees a reduction in revenue the market will overreact, this is when the buying opportunity arises and you ride the HUSH to glory!\n\nWould love to see your thoughts below. I'm sure this will be controversial and I look forward to hearing the opposite side of this argument to see what I might be overlooking.", "id": "scz42n", "created_utc": 1643177538.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "!remindme 1 day Apple earning report and stock performance", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Predictions are that last quarter will be revealed to be the best in Apple\u2019s history at earnings.

I mean tens of billions worth of stock every year. This means that every share outstanding now owns a larger part of the company's revenue and earnings. So while you are analyzing the growth of total revenue, you should be looking at the growth of revenue per share and earnings per share. That is, if you are comparing revenues to Apple's stock price.\n\nSecondly, not every $ sold is valued the same. As an owner of a company you shouldn't focus solely on the top line *(=Revenue)* but rather on what's left for you once everything is paid *(=Net Income/FCF depending on your angle)*. In Apple's case, the revenue stream that is growing the fastest is Services. And because their gross margins on Services is somewhere around 70% while it is around 35% for Products, every Service revenue $ is double as valuable (compared to Products). This is the same phenomenon we are seeing with Amazon and their AWS cloud segment which is highly more profitable than the E-Commerce side.\n\nThere are naturally other factors in play, such as interest rates (*desperate need to find returns on this newly available piles of cash causing multiple expansion*), politics (*Right-to-repair & limiting the power of Tech giants*) but I haven't investigated Apple deeply enough to chip in on those issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple (along with other tech giants) have witnessed huge multiple (P/S, P/E etc.) expansions during the last few years and could very easily be overvalued.

It was just my first point to emphasize as it is part of the equation. \n\nAnd they have bought back shares previously, yes. But the amount being bought back doesn't have to grow exponentially for them to have an impact. Unless massive buyback growth was priced in 5 yr ago (if that's what we are comparing the current price to) the share price should grow by the amount of share buybacks every year. This is just a way for them to return money to shareholders in a tax effective way instead of paying dividends.\n\nLet me explain: If we would assume that everything else (earnings, multiples, sales mix, market conditions, interest rate) stayed the same (and this came as no surprise to market) but during the last 5 years Apple has bought back 50% of their shares, their stock price should have risen by 100% since the share of earnings has doubled. \n\nThis is also assuming that Apple bought them back at an average valuation. \n\nIf they bought them while the market was pricing the stock cheaper, it created more value and the stock price should have risen more than 100%. If they bought them back at expensive valuation compared to current situation, this would have destroyed value and the stock price should have risen less than 100%.\n\nShare buybacks have definitely had impact on Apple's stock price.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Apple Cash cows so hard that it will be enough to offset lack of growth probably.

Revenue was used because this piece is about consumer spending on Apple products which can really only be measured by looking at Revenue.\n\nAgree that services are seeing strong growth AND increasing profit margins which is a very promising thing to see.

{"title": "Relax", "selftext": "Seeing a ton of fear and misinformation. Relax. You will be okay. \n\n1) this is not a crash. This is a correction. Corrections are healthy, rebound quickly, and happen cyclically. We could see another 5% but I still wouldn\u2019t worry too much. \n\n2) January is usually a bad/volatile month as leaps expire, folks rebalance portfolios, and people wait for earnings (list not exclusive). Rate hikes always cause a little dip. Nothing to worry about. \n\n3) there is no catalyst for a crash. The economy is strong. Labor market is strong (arguably the strongest ever as we are witnessing a labor shortage). Inflation is high but will be curbed with rate hikes. Rates remain historically low and will not affect consumer spending. Anything under 5% is incredibly low. \n\n4) rate hikes are necessary. A) we need to build in a safety net for QE if the economy does slow. B) rate hikes will help with inflation. Rate hikes are the smart move and just happening a bit too late and slow. \n\n5) every equity has a discernible value. Because of democratized investing and government aid tons of new investors have entered the markets. A lot of new money. So, some equities got a bit over their skis. Those equities will get hit the hardest but they are not \u201ccrashing\u201d they are just coming back down to earth. This happens regularly and actually shakes out a lot of novice investors, bringing the entire market back to homeostasis. Which is a lesson for all new investors: never trade the hype and never trade on TA. Fundamentals are crucial for serious investors and if you want to make real long term money in the market, if you want to build real wealth, you must learn fundamental analysis and read business books to understand basic sound business. Knowing how to invest and how to spot great companies/ leaders is a valuable skill. In the same vein, equities and indexes will only fall so much before institutions start gobbling up shares trading at low multiples or offering high div yield. For example, it\u2019s unlikely the spy falls another $75, the valuation would be too cheap and the yield to high, folks will start accumulating well before those levels. Everything has a value. \n\n6) this is not the 70\u2019s, stagflation unlikely. Strong economy. Strong jobs numbers. Low interest rates. \n\n7) Russia is a threat but America is not. Let me explain. Russia now controls a number of major oil and natural gas supplies, especially since Germany shut down its plants. Russia controls a lot of energy. Russia could drive oil prices, natural gas prices and energy prices through the roof. If we intervene in the current political conflict they will do just that. Which is why we won\u2019t intervene. Just like Obama never actually intervened in Crimea. Politicians like to talk but I doubt they act. \n\n8) markets always recover. Even if it takes a few years. Don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t sell. Keep your money parked in good equities with strong leadership and long term growth potential. Long term, you will make a nice return. Patience is key. The stock market is merely a means of transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient. \n\nGood luck to all. I\u2019m not trashing anyone or any trading strategies. Just sharing insight from a seasoned and successful investor. But my way is not the only way. If you disagree, share your thesis. I\u2019m always looking for a diff perspective and to learn. And I hope everyone wins\u2014bears, bulls, TA, FA, quants, newbies . . . Just have fun and make some money. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. stop trashing each other, life is hard enough, the world is shitty enough, stop hating and bringing your negativity here.\n\nEDIT: having read through some comments, recognizing general trends on main streets, and reviewing some historical data back to 2016 I do worry about certain sectors and equities. \u201822 might be a bit choppy, at least to start. Hard to tell how long this lasts. The amount of new & inexperienced $ in the market will create chop (it always does). How things shake out is yet to be seen. Usually a lot of new investors drop out and markets self correct. I don\u2019t think the major indexes dip too far below 20% and recovery should be fairly quick. But, long term, we will face certain demand issues entirely separate from the supply chain issues we are currently witnessing (I don\u2019t want to get too into this but if you\u2019re curious, drop a comment and I will send you a great piece to read). So we are racing against the clock to raise rates and get equities back on track. Now more than ever it\u2019s important to focus on fundamentals and look for long term plays.

My old Micro Economics professor told me a lot about it and how he dealt with it and made mistakes. He said it was better overall for there to be a Bull Market because it will correct eventually and that it the surest bet.\n\nOn recent events though, the Fed has specifically been tasked with dealing with the fallout of a rapid recovery. That rapid recovery of the overall American Economy results in 1 thing: inflation. To combat this, they will raise rates and cause multiple corrections and even bear traps. Riskier investments will have a lot of their support withdrawn by institutions as a result\n\nIn general, and im not trying to tell you how to live your life or that i know everything or anything close to that, but a understanding of Macroeconomics and monetary policy can tell you how the government will react to crashes. The Federal Reserve is responsible for the rates specifics and the Government is responsible for the overall economy so keep that in mind. They are doing whats best for the economy and in turn whats best for their jobs. They only cut supply off because of inflation. If the supply chain was stronger, the Fed would never have raised rates. It is in their best interest for a steady growth in the stock market with as little inflation as possible without deflation. Since they have considerable power to manipulate the markets, you have to keep their wants/needs in mind constantly. \n\nSo in general what im saying is politics is definitely part of how the market reacts and a Bear Market will only come off of a failed recovery which is politically disastrous for the Biden administration so\u2026 i would never ever put money on it.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Reading through these comments I see it's not quite what I thought to be a bear market.

{"title": "Market Manipulation by Some Entity Around Vol Spike Yesterday around Noon", "selftext": "As you know, we saw some fireworks yesterday the 24th. Around noon, the S&P was down 3.5%, and the nasdaq was down close to 5%\n\nThis tends to happen post opex, especially as hedges roll-over, and with the VIX running at 30, it was forcing liquidation by institutional longs. This forced liquidation and negative gamma was forcing dealers to go short, leading to the sell-off. I had thought this was going to create an ignition effect similar to late feb 2020, whereby the increasing volatility creates a cycle of forced selling by particularly factor strategies with VIX as an input, creating every increasing VIX and spiraling into a liquidation cascade that resembled the Covid crash.  Everything was looking similar, including the VIX and SPX.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sboq57/road\\_to\\_vix\\_150\\_spx\\_2000\\_technical\\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sboq57/road_to_vix_150_spx_2000_technical_analysis/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfdw2fzgkxd81.png?width=2247&format=png&auto=webp&s=05d5b1b610dc84d9ba0b5374371836cb9fd10d4f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33o1mgrtnyd81.png?width=2243&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f0a0c5ed664720696128ab1e6ea19f39e5d668\n\nPut volume was exploding as everyone was trying to get puts to hedge their books, to levels of the early March 2020 highs.\n\nthen something strange happened, at almost exactly at noon, some player, I mean really big player stepped into the market and started selling billions and billions of puts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7gdxnvjoyd81.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=55fded0a5c60e1c0840d10449eefd410f853d879\n\nThis is the equivalent of something going infront a freight train that was gathering speed, and saying, i am going to step on to the track and directly fight it with the worst risk reward known to man. Selling puts into a crash gives you x payoff if it reverts, but you will lose 10x if it keeps going. There is no way any sane trader would do something like that, but someone clearly did, and to the scale of probably tens of billions of dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/213f8oqtkxd81.png?width=2091&format=png&auto=webp&s=8425ce4c746c7f30385eebebbf34302d22653a67\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48fv6p11kxd81.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c9665e14481046a3195b343b07932af25419e7b\n\nSpotgamma covered it as well in this video.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzTbKCeKcOk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzTbKCeKcOk)\n\nAs a result, VIX was crushed, and this allowed relief and dip buyers to come in, VIX was crushed down back to 30, and the forced liquidation of the factor longs never came. Someone prevented what was setting up to a extreme liquidation event, we were nowhere close to overbought on the SPX on the RSI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vo0ztogulxd81.png?width=2099&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a258f5b7866935537c54aa4167933747ce134a4\n\nI know of no institutional investor, or hedge funds, even the largest one that have that kind of capital, the largest investment bank prop desks would not be allowed to sell billion, maybe even tens of billions of puts and attempt to crush the VIX and prevented what could have been a 1987 crash style event. Notional options that rolled off Jan 21 expiry was somewhere around 1-2 trillion. The hedging/gamma demand by rolling hedges may be in the 30-100 billion range.

With MBS they're also taking on prepayment risk.  \n\nAnd as long as the system is flooded with cash, banks won't need to borrow at the overnight rate.  In fact, banks have been parking $1.5 trillion at the reverse repo facility.  When they raise rates they'll pay higher interest on the reverse repo.  So it's free money to huge banks.  The $1.5 trillion is also proof that they've printed way more money than necessary to support the economy.\n\nPartly devil's advocate again - probably one of the reasons they've done so much QE is that if they didn't buy the bonds, there's a chance that nobody would (at least not at these yields).  That would mean that unless politicians can agree to balance a budget, deficit spending will 1) pull money out of private investment and 2) raise market yields on bonds, stocks, real estate...  basically crash everything.

Well I imagine that things like appreciation or other outside factors can keep the balance sheet growing faster or keeping pace with the reduction of the purchasing rate.However more importantly none of this is that big a deal since these smooth brainers still don't understand that real rates are continuing negative, possibly quicker than any proposed hikes, so money is actually probably still getting easier and looser and not tighter despite the fake appearance.

Again I haven't personally check this myself but it seems to be the disconnect you may be having, or maybe what I'm saying is nonsense though I'm not sure why it would be.\n\nI agree with inflation however from the prospective of a bond investor and the government they really don't seem to care.

I haven't paid enough attention to know if next week they can go back to 1/26 and show a larger reduction that just hasn't posted yet.\n\nIf that is not the case, then the next reasonable conclusion I would draw is that they are still going to end QE in March, but they aren't actually easing us into it.  We are actually still living in easy monetary policy (thinking the markets are taking reductions in stride) and then a massive rug pull when it actually shuts off?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.008303908631205559}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03184719756245613}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03184719756245613}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.00452800327911973}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.00452800327911973}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.030396414920687675}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.030396414920687675}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0014291496481746435}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0014291496481746435}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.032362498342990875}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.032362498342990875}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.011820000596344471}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14826853573322296}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39617839455604553}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05979292467236519}, {"body": "If you are right I\u2019m going to be pissed.
