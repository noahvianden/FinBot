{"title": "Bad Apple: Why AAPL is Heavily Overvalued", "selftext": "Let me first start by saying AAPL is a tremendous company with an incredibly strong present and future - contrary to the title. They make great products and are constantly looking to innovate. If you are an investor I believe you will likely see strong returns over a longer time horizon.\n\nRight now however, AAPL is overvalued in my opinion.\n\nLet's observe the last 4 years of revenue:\n\n* 2018 = $266B\n* 2019 = $260B\n* 2020 = $275B\n* **2021 = $366B**\n\nOne of these things is not like the other. As you can see, prior to 2021 we saw relatively stable growth, and then BOOM 33%. On the surface this looks great! But let's get into why this has me worried.\n\nI'm a health insurance actuary and in our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit **RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH.** This occurs when there are **plan design changes**.\n\n**RUSH**\n\nWhen a new benefit is added, or there is a significant benefit increase beyond what we would typically observe. People **RUSH** to use the new benefits as they get new glasses, get their cavities filled, and get that procedure they've been holding off on in anticipation of the benefit increase.\n\n**CRUSH**\n\nThe next year there is nothing to spend money on. Everyone already got their new glasses, teeth are filled, and that procedure they got fixed whatever health issue they had. The inflated spending experience a **CRUSH.**\n\n**HUSH**\n\n2-years after the plan change this volatility will **HUSH.** We will observe that claiming returns to a level that we would typically expect, but since the prior year was a CRUSH, the year-over-year increase appears more severe than expected. This would catch a layman off guard, but a well informed actuary would understand that benefits are simply returning back to a reasonable level.\n\nIn the case of AAPL. The plan design change is the pandemic. People weren't spending money on restaurants, bars, travel, concerts, sports, etc. so they had more dollars to allocate to updating their gadgets (**RUSH**). In 2022, people will have already updated their gadgets so there is no need to go out and purchase more. Add to this that the world is expected to reopen, so more dollars will be allocated to other things mentioned above (**CRUSH**). In 2023, I would expect spending to return to a more routine level, some people will update their gadgets while others will hold off another year (HUSH).\n\nEssentially what I'm expecting is that AAPL will have a down year, worse than expected (because of **CRUSH**). This will cause people to over-sell which is where the buying opportunity comes in because in the **HUSH** phase, we know that spending will return to normal. It will appear to be strong growth but in reality it is simply just reverting to the mean.\n\nI read the annual report to look at the components of AAPL's revenue. I would expect that wearables, home, accessories and services continue to grow at a strong pace since those are newer products that are growing organically compared to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, iPhone, iPad and Mac saw a combined 36% YoY increase and they account for 71% of revenue. There is a chance that the market prices all this in but the point of this piece of writing is to inform you that these changes are typically more exaggerated than intuition expects. With a PE of 28.5 the market expects growth, and if AAPL instead sees a reduction in revenue the market will overreact, this is when the buying opportunity arises and you ride the HUSH to glory!\n\nWould love to see your thoughts below. I'm sure this will be controversial and I look forward to hearing the opposite side of this argument to see what I might be overlooking.", "id": "scz42n", "created_utc": 1643177538.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "!remindme 1 day Apple earning report and stock performance", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Predictions are that last quarter will be revealed to be the best in Apple\u2019s history at earnings.

I mean tens of billions worth of stock every year. This means that every share outstanding now owns a larger part of the company's revenue and earnings. So while you are analyzing the growth of total revenue, you should be looking at the growth of revenue per share and earnings per share. That is, if you are comparing revenues to Apple's stock price.\n\nSecondly, not every $ sold is valued the same. As an owner of a company you shouldn't focus solely on the top line *(=Revenue)* but rather on what's left for you once everything is paid *(=Net Income/FCF depending on your angle)*. In Apple's case, the revenue stream that is growing the fastest is Services. And because their gross margins on Services is somewhere around 70% while it is around 35% for Products, every Service revenue $ is double as valuable (compared to Products). This is the same phenomenon we are seeing with Amazon and their AWS cloud segment which is highly more profitable than the E-Commerce side.\n\nThere are naturally other factors in play, such as interest rates (*desperate need to find returns on this newly available piles of cash causing multiple expansion*), politics (*Right-to-repair & limiting the power of Tech giants*) but I haven't investigated Apple deeply enough to chip in on those issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple (along with other tech giants) have witnessed huge multiple (P/S, P/E etc.) expansions during the last few years and could very easily be overvalued.

It was just my first point to emphasize as it is part of the equation. \n\nAnd they have bought back shares previously, yes. But the amount being bought back doesn't have to grow exponentially for them to have an impact. Unless massive buyback growth was priced in 5 yr ago (if that's what we are comparing the current price to) the share price should grow by the amount of share buybacks every year. This is just a way for them to return money to shareholders in a tax effective way instead of paying dividends.\n\nLet me explain: If we would assume that everything else (earnings, multiples, sales mix, market conditions, interest rate) stayed the same (and this came as no surprise to market) but during the last 5 years Apple has bought back 50% of their shares, their stock price should have risen by 100% since the share of earnings has doubled. \n\nThis is also assuming that Apple bought them back at an average valuation. \n\nIf they bought them while the market was pricing the stock cheaper, it created more value and the stock price should have risen more than 100%. If they bought them back at expensive valuation compared to current situation, this would have destroyed value and the stock price should have risen less than 100%.\n\nShare buybacks have definitely had impact on Apple's stock price.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Apple Cash cows so hard that it will be enough to offset lack of growth probably.

Revenue was used because this piece is about consumer spending on Apple products which can really only be measured by looking at Revenue.\n\nAgree that services are seeing strong growth AND increasing profit margins which is a very promising thing to see.

{"title": "Relax", "selftext": "Seeing a ton of fear and misinformation. Relax. You will be okay. \n\n1) this is not a crash. This is a correction. Corrections are healthy, rebound quickly, and happen cyclically. We could see another 5% but I still wouldn\u2019t worry too much. \n\n2) January is usually a bad/volatile month as leaps expire, folks rebalance portfolios, and people wait for earnings (list not exclusive). Rate hikes always cause a little dip. Nothing to worry about. \n\n3) there is no catalyst for a crash. The economy is strong. Labor market is strong (arguably the strongest ever as we are witnessing a labor shortage). Inflation is high but will be curbed with rate hikes. Rates remain historically low and will not affect consumer spending. Anything under 5% is incredibly low. \n\n4) rate hikes are necessary. A) we need to build in a safety net for QE if the economy does slow. B) rate hikes will help with inflation. Rate hikes are the smart move and just happening a bit too late and slow. \n\n5) every equity has a discernible value. Because of democratized investing and government aid tons of new investors have entered the markets. A lot of new money. So, some equities got a bit over their skis. Those equities will get hit the hardest but they are not \u201ccrashing\u201d they are just coming back down to earth. This happens regularly and actually shakes out a lot of novice investors, bringing the entire market back to homeostasis. Which is a lesson for all new investors: never trade the hype and never trade on TA. Fundamentals are crucial for serious investors and if you want to make real long term money in the market, if you want to build real wealth, you must learn fundamental analysis and read business books to understand basic sound business. Knowing how to invest and how to spot great companies/ leaders is a valuable skill. In the same vein, equities and indexes will only fall so much before institutions start gobbling up shares trading at low multiples or offering high div yield. For example, it\u2019s unlikely the spy falls another $75, the valuation would be too cheap and the yield to high, folks will start accumulating well before those levels. Everything has a value. \n\n6) this is not the 70\u2019s, stagflation unlikely. Strong economy. Strong jobs numbers. Low interest rates. \n\n7) Russia is a threat but America is not. Let me explain. Russia now controls a number of major oil and natural gas supplies, especially since Germany shut down its plants. Russia controls a lot of energy. Russia could drive oil prices, natural gas prices and energy prices through the roof. If we intervene in the current political conflict they will do just that. Which is why we won\u2019t intervene. Just like Obama never actually intervened in Crimea. Politicians like to talk but I doubt they act. \n\n8) markets always recover. Even if it takes a few years. Don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t sell. Keep your money parked in good equities with strong leadership and long term growth potential. Long term, you will make a nice return. Patience is key. The stock market is merely a means of transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient. \n\nGood luck to all. I\u2019m not trashing anyone or any trading strategies. Just sharing insight from a seasoned and successful investor. But my way is not the only way. If you disagree, share your thesis. I\u2019m always looking for a diff perspective and to learn. And I hope everyone wins\u2014bears, bulls, TA, FA, quants, newbies . . . Just have fun and make some money. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. stop trashing each other, life is hard enough, the world is shitty enough, stop hating and bringing your negativity here.\n\nEDIT: having read through some comments, recognizing general trends on main streets, and reviewing some historical data back to 2016 I do worry about certain sectors and equities. \u201822 might be a bit choppy, at least to start. Hard to tell how long this lasts. The amount of new & inexperienced $ in the market will create chop (it always does). How things shake out is yet to be seen. Usually a lot of new investors drop out and markets self correct. I don\u2019t think the major indexes dip too far below 20% and recovery should be fairly quick. But, long term, we will face certain demand issues entirely separate from the supply chain issues we are currently witnessing (I don\u2019t want to get too into this but if you\u2019re curious, drop a comment and I will send you a great piece to read). So we are racing against the clock to raise rates and get equities back on track. Now more than ever it\u2019s important to focus on fundamentals and look for long term plays.
