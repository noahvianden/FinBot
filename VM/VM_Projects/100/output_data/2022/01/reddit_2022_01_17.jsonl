{"title": "The Market has already correctes", "selftext": "I have some news for you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs. There\u2019s no crash coming, markets have already corrected and as usual you\u2019re all fucking broke.\n\nFor those of you who didn\u2019t know there\u2019s TWO WAYS THE MARKET CAN CORRECT. It can correct through price as well as through time. This is why there\u2019s been a market correction without anyone even realizing it. \n\nFirst off most companies have had a correction in price. Lots down 50%, tech down 10%. Secondly if you haven\u2019t noticed which you probably haven\u2019t, SPX (SP 500) has gone absolutely nowhere since November. For 3 months we\u2019ve gone no where. THIS IS A CORRECTION IN TIME. The 20sma on the weekly chart that has held as support on the weekly chart has held since March 2020 and it CONTINUES TO HOLD. We are in a bull trend plain and simple. To all the bears out there. No crash this time. I hope you bought the dip because we\u2019re about to resume the bull trend and SPX will hit 5000 in the next couple months.\n\nMost people are very bearish and think a huge crash is coming. And are planning on buying the dip. Let me tell you what will happen. We\u2019re about to bounce and have a V shaped recovery. All the money which was waiting to buy the crash is going to jump in and create a fomo rally. This will drive prices higher and create new ATHs.\n\nStop buying into the doom and gloom and buy on support before you fomo and lose all your money at the top.\n\nPositions: Sold 90 SPX ITM credit spreads 4735/4730 01/21/2022", "id": "s5wqab", "created_utc": 1642399572.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Man you\u2019re fired up, huh?", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Nah.

It's simply impossible.\n\nTo know where that chart is going you need to know the rate of change.  But even that's not enough.  You need to know the second derivative as well (the rate of change of the rate of change).  Then you get a clearer picture.\n\nTake $PYPL for example.

You brought PE for Google and I gave you a list of PE\u2019s that were worse to show a 30% correction doesn\u2019t put them all to 17 like Google.  \n\nI understand the connection to Earnings and rate of change.  In fact, I specifically stated those stocks tanking is dependent on missed Earnings or reduced Guidance.  I even said it may not be this quarter or next, and that it all depends on what happens to earnings and the impact reduced liquidity has on them.  \n\nThe point is not that a correction absolutely has to happen right now from PE levels alone.  The point is that collectively they are telling us there is extraordinary systematic risk here if liquidity dries up.  \n\nIts very unlikely the broad big cap techs all keep making Earnings when the Fed tightens policy.  If a drop happens, the drop is unlikely to be a time correction or minor adjustment.  The market has had a lot of Fed support to get to these levels.

Stocks like ZM, PTON, TDOC, NET are all down 60-70% or more.  These are the most speculative names because they were being priced as if perpetual 50%+ revenue growth will extend for a decade plus.  Further, names like PTON and ZM have growing competition and their long-term dominance in their fields is uncertain.\n\nThe tech stocks that have fared better are names like NVDA, GOOG, AAPL, AMD, NFLX, etc.  These names are absolutely dominant in their fields.  They have massive moats and will outgrow the S&P500 in almost any environment.  \n\nIf the speculative tech stocks like ZM keep falling, you'll barely notice it on indexes.  They're much smaller than they were even a few months back.  Their valuation has less of a floor because they still trade on long-term growth potential vs. current financials.  So market sentiment plays a big role in their valuation.\n\nEither way, if these names like ZM and PTON keep on dropping, you should seriously consider bargain hunting.  Another big leg down will put the risk/reward of a long position heavily in favor of the long.  They're already trading below their values in 2018/19 in a lot of circumstances, despite huge tailwinds from WFH transformation which is here to stay.\n\nIMO, the market is full of these mini-bubbles which get destroyed constantly.
