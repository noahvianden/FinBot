Before 2021 VIAC was typically around a $50 stock. Fair value.  In 2021, VIAC doubled before being taken down to 50% of its fair value,  Last Friday VIAC just got taken down 7% because its competitor slowed down and Reed Hastings admitted the slowdown was because now finally Netflix has to share the pie with others, including VIAC. So Netflix's pain should be VIACs gain.  Same with DIS and T-Discovery.\n\nMost of the bubbles from 2021 have been at least half popped.  Many high quality stocks are already at 52 week lows.   Interest rate hikes and inflation are historically rather modest.  Inflation with gradually fade.  Hopefully covid fades away but even if it doesn't, everyone wants quality streamed entertainment. VIAC was doing okay even before Paramount Plus. The stock is down close to the 52 week low which was 28-29, mpstly because of tax loss selling.  I doubt it will break that again.

It is telling to me that when Cramer was faced with a possible bloodbath friday morning the only stock name he could mumble was Viacom.

The sky is not falling unless you are in highly speculative overvalued assets or leveraged for a bgi chunk of your net worth.\n\nMy situation and VIAC at $31 is the opposite of that.  I am not at all worried, just in suspense because no one knows how long VIAC will take to get back to fair value.  I am just betting that it will.

People delta hedge options, meaning that they buy and sell to cover the obligation from the delta factor on the options that they sell.\n\nFor many of us, our brokers won't let us sell calls or puts without the capital on hand or a delta cover from another option or 100 shares... but if you're a more advanced trader and hold a position, you can cover the option by providing delta hedging. I.e. if delta on a call option is .5, all you need is 50 shares of the underlying to cover it. If it goes up to .6, then you need 60 shares... that's a gamma squeeze because gamma influences how much delta goes up as the underlying moves and the buying increases the price further, creating a rising price dynamic.\n\nPuts work in the opposite direction, with the Greeks being negative. You can back the value of a put with an underlying, but instead of buying to cover a put as it moves towards ITM and its negative gamma/delta increase, you actually sell to cover because holding more shares as they decline gives you more exposure.\n\nSo gamma squeezes can work in the negative direction as well. And that combined with margin and fluctuating bond yields means you can end up in a negative feedback loop. Typically, bond yields rise, people buy them, and then the yields go down, but tapering is amplifying people's concerns because it's basically frontloading (combined with market speculation on rate hikes) bond yield increases while at the same time increasing the number of bonds actively on the market (since the Fed isn't locking them up)... that's driving a continuous reassessment of risk and helping keep the feedback loop moving down.\n\nEventually this will settle out.... that'll happen when the weaker hands complete capitulation and the selling pressure slows, or when good news brings buying.\n\nI don't think it has a huge amount to do with the amount of underlying on margin, per-se, because the cover will happen on the way down either way, but the heavy margin issue definitely amplifies the downside pressure.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I always wondered what delta hedging meant", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4108548164367676}, {"body": "Gamma squeezes are more commonly to the downside than upside", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4991699457168579}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.029669590294361115}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11124441772699356}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24940821528434753}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3868798315525055}, {"body": "Absolutely no one can know the future.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Nancy Pelosi?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Lol", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10479091107845306}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06439512968063354}, {"body": "He is onto something with the margin calls being due.

{"title": "Market\u2019s Anticipation of Continuous Rate Hikes Is Wrong: Calling Out the Fed\u2019s Bluff", "selftext": "**Introduction** \n\nI believe that the current market sentiment of continuous rate hikes from the federal reserve to combat high inflation and to cool down what is considered a \u201chot\u201d economy is false and misplaced. I believe that beneath the surface, there are a lot of fundamental weaknesses that have not been addressed throughout the entirety of the pandemic and the Federal Reserve is fully aware of this. However, there is clearly an excess in terms of valuation in many areas of the stock market and in alternative asset classes and knowing the dangers these unfounded valuations can pose in the long run, the Federal reserve will do its best to bring valuations into a more reasonable range without upsetting the overall stock market.    \n\n**GDP Stagnant growth**\n\nIf you were paying attention the last couple of quarters you would realize that real GDP growth in the US has slowed down a lot to 2.3% in 21q3 from a 6.7% in 21q2 on an annual basis. Looking underneath that headline, it\u2019s obvious that the main reason behind this drastic drop in growth rates comes from a sharp decrease in personal consumption expenditures from 7.92% in 21q2 to 1.35% in 21q3. This is primarily the result of a drop in expenditures on goods, with both durable and non-durable goods showing an actual decline for the first time this year. \n\nServices, another component of personal expenditures also decreased as well but at a more modest pace. What this shows me is that people are finally running out of the money they got from the stimulus cheques and the enhanced unemployment benefits, which means consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of US GDP can no longer be relied upon to prop up the GDP figures. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Consumer expenditure on goods and services are going down as they run out of stimmy money. ](https://preview.redd.it/rhlb9tandcd81.jpg?width=1078&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30396f56214771238943ed1728213332fceb4c5b)\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that the other components of GDP can not be relied upon as well because all of them are in the negatives with the exception of change in nonfarm private inventories with a growth of 2.2% but I think this will become negative as well since there is no point for retailers to overstock in inventory if the consumers are not there to buy them.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Retail and wholesale purchases of inventories will also become negative as well as companies such as Costco and Target overstock their shelves based on a misconception of continuously strong conusmer demand. ](https://preview.redd.it/uwfywyzndcd81.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2b17f0e4ca747e7c20ca9579d1c768a3a02333f)\n\nLastly, to drill the point home, personal savings rate in the us is now down to 6.9%. This is on par with figures pre-pandemic so the idea that consumers have a hidden cash stockpile is out of the question. The amount of spending you saw during the summer months are the result of one-time government assistance programs and the money has run out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Savings rate are now at pre-pandemic levels meaning a sudden increase in consumer spending is not possible. ](https://preview.redd.it/etbyu4oxdcd81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35bc0852b10eb19715bf3db02b0b1b54449b9504)\n\n**Labor force participation and why the unemployment figure is a lie**\n\nThe unemployment figures are full of sh\\*t. The 3.9% unemployment figures is fundamentally flawed and is designed to misguide the general public into thinking everything is going fine. One of the main reasons why is because it does not include labor participation rate. This is the rate in which people who are eligible to work are actually working or actively searching for work. Right now, it\u2019s at a record low of 62% and stagnated. Just stop and think about it. Only 62% of people who are capable of working are actually working and providing an income. That is ridiculously low and clearly a fundamental flaw in the labor market. The labor market is not as tight as the media paints it out to be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dpv8f5z2ecd81.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=557588262eb4aada939a7ce00350c43bcf49d100\n\n**Areas of high inflation**\n\nMy other point is that inflation is not evenly spread across all goods and services. Just take a look at this table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that gives a breakdown of where CPI increases are coming from for the last 12 months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Most of the inflation is driven by autmobiles and gas prices.](https://preview.redd.it/ptqy691gecd81.jpg?width=823&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5888f858a15e415aa8125bc5763dd72e23bfd92e)\n\nFrom this table it is obvious that the vast majority of inflationary pressures comes from fuel and automobiles. This is evident of supply chain bottlenecks and material shortages rather than a systematic failure in monetary policy. Just think about it for a second. Oil prices are high because supply cannot catch up to the sudden increase in demand. Automobile prices are going up because manufacturers can\u2019t get semiconductors to finish their product. What\u2019s more is that the ports are all blocked up due to a shortage or truckers, shipping containers, and a host of other issues. Putting this all together it becomes clear that a tighter monetary policy is going to have little to no effect on the core underlying issues driving up inflation. A decrease in QE isn\u2019t going to produce more cars just like a 25bps hike isn\u2019t going to unblock the ports. \n\nMy final point to drive this home is to look at the M2 money velocity. This is the rate at which money changes hands. In a true hyperinflationary environment, the velocity of money should also increase in tandem with M2 supply since the longer you hold on to it, the more value it loses. Looking at this, it shows a different picture: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The money that was \\\\\"printed\\\\\" is not changing hands, rather it is staying in the financial system. ](https://preview.redd.it/sx2nhq8necd81.jpg?width=1157&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a0f01c0e3aee5809d42b2b9838d1e3421fe3f80)\n\nIt is sitting at record lows. What this means is that all the money that was printed is staying within the financial system. It isn\u2019t being leaked out into the general economy so the notion that the QE is causing this inflation is completely false and misguided. \n\n**TIPS**\n\nAnother key area to focus on is what the smart money is thinking. A good way to gauge Wall Street\u2019s predictions on long term inflation is through TIPS or breakeven inflation rate. This is the spread between a 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Security and 5-Year Treasury Inflation Indexed Constant Maturity Security. It is used to imply what market participants expect inflation to be in 5 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wall Street predicts average inflation in next five years to be 2.7&#37;. A far cry from the 7&#37; we are seeing currently. ](https://preview.redd.it/26axv2jsecd81.jpg?width=1171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90713970283d124509d89b13b0c62f31e95620f0)\n\nAs you can see, the rate is 2.7%, far below the 7% figure we got recently. What this means is that even though inflation remains stubbornly high for now, it is expected to calm down in the near future and we hit a 2.7% average. \n\n**Political Pressure and Asset Speculation**\n\nLastly, this part is mostly speculation so put on your Alex Jones\u2019 tinfoil hat on. I believe that the primary reasons behind a fed hike is because of political pressure and the need to tackle pockets of excess in the markets driven purely by speculation. The political pressure comes mostly from politicians and everyday Americans complaining about inflation and wondering what the Fed will do about it. They think the inflation is mostly due to the Fed\u2019s monetary policy but in reality, it is due to supply chain bottlenecks and covid restrictions. The Fed on the other hand cannot attack these accusations head on and shift the blame to the federal government. Because if they do, they will indirectly attack the Brandon administration and will be dragged into a partisan political shitshow, something that is definitely against the Fed\u2019s interest. So instead, they are going to do what every bureaucrat is going to do: Talk a good game but really don\u2019t do shit and wait for the problem to sort itself out. Just take a look at Brainard\u2019s recent confirmation hearing where she stated she will do everything she can to bring inflation under control all the while knowing that raising rates or cutting QE isn\u2019t really going to have any effect. All of this is designed to look like the Fed is on top of things but in reality, they are going to let it sort itself out because the economy is still fundamentally weak and small businesses are still hanging by a thread so if they make lending too difficult, they are going to have another downturn on their hands and look like absolute jackasses. \n\nNow in terms of speculation, the Fed knows valuations in certain assets such as made-up internet money (**fight me**) and crappy meme stocks have gotten ahead of itself and they need to stamp it down or look completely complacent and fuel another asset bubble. That being said, cutting off QE in March and threatening to raise rates is a good move because its them sending the *nudge nudge wink wink* signal that the party is over for rampant speculations. A dying movie theater chain company shouldn\u2019t be worth billions, EV companies with $0 in sales shouldn\u2019t have a multi-billion-dollar market cap, etc. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Fed is most likely going to raise rates in the first quarter, if not definitely the first half. The market is expecting it and the Fed has to do it in order to look like they care about inflation as well as bringing the rampant speculation to an end. But, because of the weaknesses of the economy, the Fed has their hands tied behind their back and it is doubtful they can raise rates 4-5 times this year which is what the market is currently expecting. I predict that the Fed will raise rates once in the first half and when they do so put out a carefully worded statement that opens the door to a halt in further hikes if the situation changes. The Fed knows the economy is weak and it knows the market can\u2019t take too much tightening but they need to look like they are doing something about inflation and speculation so they will bite the bullet on this one.  \n\nAll that being said we are most likely heading back to a 2018-2019 style stock market. Economic growth is shit but not too terrible that stocks crash and die. The Fed will remain loose with monetary policy but there won't be breakneck rallies. Meme stocks with crappy fundamentals like AMC, CLOV, etc etc are most likely going to underperform the general market.", "id": "sai5u6", "created_utc": 1642902732.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Without significant improvements in productivity, or population growth, this is mean reversion.

The 10 year rate is already priced at basically what it would be if the fed funds rate was 1%.\n\nHowever I think that\u2019s the point. There is nothing that can be done monetarily to fix the supply side problem of inflation. Jpow was clearly banking on some easement to happen over the last year but it\u2019s only gotten worse. I\u2019ve seen various articles saying the bottleneck is port efficiency or some saying lack of port workers, or truck drivers or covid protocols, you name it. The one constant is that nothing has been done to change those bottlenecks so the supply chain disruption is here to stay for a long time. The only thing that can be done now is reducing the demand. Even though a few .25% hikes will barely dent the demand it\u2019s the only thing the fed can do.\n\nI agree with what you\u2019re saying though that too many will be bad for the economy because of the labor participation issue. Right now I think the market is finally repricing assets in accordance with the new 10 year rate and the forecast for it to go up over 2%. There\u2019s a portion of the market out there that thinks 7 or 8 rate hikes are coming but assuming jpow doesn\u2019t come off that hawkish in this FOMC I think there should be a bounce back in SPY since such a high 10 year rate forecast won\u2019t be priced in anymore. \n\nThe inflation problem still isn\u2019t going away though and we\u2019re going to see bad numbers again when the Jan inflation report comes out.

As far as I understand, the FED does not literally print magical money like many people have come to believe. Instead, it buys debt instruments from Banks, allowing them to refinance and to keep providing financing services to the economy, albeit with no risk and therefore low prices. Those Banks not using the refinancing park the cash in overnight facilities, hence the large increases in overnight repo we saw over the past months.

Most American households have little to no savings and live paycheck to paycheck - so inflation matters to their daily purchasing power. And a 6% loss of buying power is significant to them. However, if you have $1,000,000 it doesn't matter. In the $1000 example, who cares if you are now spending $1060 per month on your expenses and meat obsession? Your disposable income is so high it doesn't even register.\n2. At the same time, inflation is transitory. It will not be at 6% forever. It will not be at 8% forever, and the purpose of the FED intervention is to reign it down to 2%. With macro events around the world the USD will likely have stronger purchasing power across international trade and will do well against oil (which is why all the major oil stocks are up in the last 45 days). Anyway, my point is - nobody with a $1,000,000 let alone hundreds of millions or billions of dollars is worried about spending all of it this year to buy meat or some consumer expenditure that is the most affected by inflation (supply chain included). So it will just sit in cash. $1,000,000 USD is a $1,000,000 USD. Since you are not spending it, then yes, at the moment you might be able to buy less with it, but in another year you can buy more with it. Either way since you are not touching it it's not affecting you and you do not feel the effects of transitory USD inflation - even if it reaches temporarily touches 10%.\n3. Meanwhile as stocks plunge and bottom out you have a new place to invest that $1,000,000 - and here is where inflation also doesn't mean shit. Who cares what goods the dollar can buy if the only thing you want to purchase with it are securities? Netflix is 20% cheaper. If it rebounds just 10 percent in the next year you are ahead again. As inflation drops from 6 to 2 percent you are \"further\" ahead in terms of these types of purchasing power concerns (but again it never really affects you so who cares).\n4. Lastly people tend to forget that a 2% interest rate on that large amount of cash being parked will offset inflation concerns even further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically cash is king. Money moves to places of stability in times of negative market sentiment and stays there until markets are ready to rebound.

MACD: Held onto yesterday\u2019s (1/20) bearish cross at 12:50 UtC-7\n* Daily MACD still holding onto bearish cross on 1/6. Expanded obv.\n* 65 min. RSI: 24 (bearish - oversold)\n* Daily RSI: 26 (bearish - oversold)\n* At the edge of lower 3 fib band so wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see upside tomorrow (at least in the AM)(AGAIN)\n* Technically the market is set-up for a rally this week with FOMC and earnings. We need to see some good news enter into the fold (really anything that is perceived as good news (maybe good earnings and outlook from the big players?))

I\u2019m bearish until we break the bearish divergence resistance line on RSI, Stoch, and Cumulative Delta on the weekly. If we break resistance then crisis averted.\n* If we close a few weeks below 426.40, and break 414.33 I believe we will see a 20-30% drop before years end, which would put us around 378.12 - 319.53 and back into the pre-covid crash trendline. Note that the bottom of the trendline is at around 273.59 or roughly 43% away from ATH.\n* Close a few weeks above 460.27 then bulls are in clear IMO.\n* Crash will be confirmed when a bearish cross occurs on the Monthly IMO (last occured end of Jan and beginning of Feb 2020).\n* Levels to watch:  \n\n   * **460.27**\n   * **425.99**\n   * 414.33\n   * 394.55\n   * **378.12**\n   * **350.33**\n   * **319.53**\n   * **273.59**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vfvw8m8mkgd81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=20531d3d55926d420d1fbdf73cc479f74e496703\n\n# Indicator Divergences as SPY climbed to ATH.\n\n**MACD**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb7axyjokgd81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8f3376597b58361dece8c9fd72d2bc10a8cd356\n\n**Cumulative Delta**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4bjl3hqkgd81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=34cc4dc7b20eea2f73684f918bbc241e6486efc5\n\n**Stoch:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjd2lo5skgd81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd7722c2c946a500080ce0b4f458a2ffe904daf\n\n**Monthly MACD**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3vgxu8ukgd81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaf6377de5027c23521f41904a0d84eaeb3d5773\n\n## Positions:\n\nMostly played futures.
