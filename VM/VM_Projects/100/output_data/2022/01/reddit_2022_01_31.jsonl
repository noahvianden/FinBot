Isnt he already in Profit?\n\nFirst, let's review what extrinsic value is.\n\nContract premium = intrinsic value + extrinsic value\n\nIntrinsic value is 0 if the contract is OTM.\n\nIf the contract is ITM, intrinsic value = stock price - strike price for a call, strike price - stock price for a put.\n\nExtrinsic value is also called \"time value\". It's the risk premium that sellers demand for taking on the risk of fulfilling the contract at a specified time. The more time to expiration, the higher the risk to the seller, thus the higher the risk premium.\n\nIn your scenario where ROKU went below $85, if there are still many days/weeks to expiration, there is still risk through time. Thus, sellers of that put will demand time value (extrinsic value) above and beyond intrinsic value.\n\nLet's say ROKU goes to $84. This means the intrinsic value of the put is $1. But what is the put actually worth? If you look up the quote you are likely to see a larger number for the total premium of the put. It might be $1.69. It might be $2.36. It could even be $11.27. Whatever value the contract has above $1 intrinsic value is extrinsic value.\n\nSo, recall that exercising *throws away extrinsic value*. If you exercise that put right now, you get $1/share. But if the put itself was worth $1.69, you just threw away $.69/share. If it was worth $2.36, you threw away $1.36/share. If it was worth $11.27, you just threw away $10.27/share.\n\nNow, how likely is it for someone to decide they will throw away each of those amounts of money?

I would only do it when volatility is low or you expect it to be low or if volatility is high and you have a itch or premium's just too good, then never sell more than a week out. Here's the reason:\n\nI sold some 100 strike CSPs expiring 2/4 on January 19 when AMD was at 130, for 50 cent premium. The following few weeks was massacre for AMD so to speak where it dropped day after day until it reached \\~99.60 early morning last Thursday. The premium had shot up from 50 cents to around 5 dollars. \n\nHere's the first lesson - although I don't mind owning AMD at 100, even if assigned, if the stock price approaches your strike price quickly way before expiration, the premium becomes really juicy. If I was willing to take AMD at 100, it would have been even better to collect 3-4 dollars / contract of premium instead of 50 cents / contract, with even less time premium. Had I just sold weeklies, first batch expiring Jan 28, then selling another batch for this week last Friday, the premium collected would have been way better. \n\nThe second lesson is that when you sell CSPs, you no longer can buy the stock even if the stock fell to a price point you want to enter i.e. 100, unless you are willing to take on margin AND assignment risk. When AMD fell below 100, I didn't want to take the risk of buying at that point, because of the very real risk that my CSPs will be assigned and push me into margin. During this volatile period, anything can happen and I've been burned before with margin calls. Had I not have CSPs, I could have used 1/4 of my cash and bought in at 100 and enjoy the 15% gain since, and if it had fallen further, I have more cash to deploy. \n\nOnce you write a CSP, you can miss out on your buy point, because it can reach your strike price and under, then make a quick recovery to way over your strike price at expiry. \n\nIn this environment, my advice would simply to wait for an opportunity to buy rather than using CSPs in lieu of limit order, unless the premium is so good for the strike and the duration till expiry.\n\nHopefully this is not too confusing.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "A bit confusing, but I think I get it.

Google on the other hand is commonly known to be a long- term investment.\r  \n\r  \nWhich one to go with?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nA: Never invest money you can't soon afford to lose.\r  \n\r  \nThe goal of investing is to beat inflation and not lose money.\r  \n\r  \nYour best investment always depends on how long you can wait for its return.  To maximize your chance of success, match each investment to its time horizon.\r  \n\r  \nOne-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 have averaged 9.9% since 1989; 79% of one-year returns beat inflation.  However, over 17% of one-year returns were losses; the worst one was -46% between March 2008 and March 2009.  It would taken nearly seven years to recover from such a large loss if the average 10% growth then resumed.\r  \n\r  \nConservative assets are not productive for long time horizons.\r  \n\r  \nRisky assets are not appropriate for short time horizons.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nGOOG has doubled over the past 18 months, but has now dropped below its 200-d moving average and is threatening a death cross.  But the fundamentals still look good, the balance sheet is solid, and the current valuation is fair.  Once the Fed makes its first rate hike in March, the worst of the market reset will be over.  Assuming a time horizon of 3 years or more, I might buy up to 5% GOOG in my portfolio on a pullback and let time work for me.\r  \n\r  \nAMZN doubled in 2020 and was flat in 2021.  It has much higher P/E multiple and earnings are much less predictable.  Not especially thrilling.  In any case, the same 5% maximum limit per stock would apply here for proper diversification.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nOver the past 30 years and more, the prescription to avoid losses and make money in stocks was to hold them as investments long enough to overcome short-term fluctuations and reap long-term compounded returns.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIf you liked this comment, please upvote and help me build more Karma.

Every investor should consider the probability and magnitude of potential loss first before estimating any future gains.\r  \n\r  \nThe bad news - Since everyone is different, one size does not fit all.\r  \n\r  \nThe good news - There is more than one single right answer.\r  \n\r  \nYour investment strategy needs to match your temperament, your time horizon, and the time and effort you can commit to investing year after year despite all the attention required by everything else in your life.\r  \n\r  \nThe overwhelming majority of investors consistently earn less than stock market benchmarks.  Consequently, it makes good sense to start investing in a low-cost fund (e.g. VTI) that covers the total US stock market.  This passive indexing has been a winning strategy to successfully build wealth with minimum effort for the past 100 years. \r  \n\r  \nEvery investor's long-term investment success depends more on asset allocation than any other single factor.  So congratulations, you are on the right track.  VWRL is a  well-diversified global ETF and any low-cost S&P 500 fund is effective as well.  Since the total U.S. market includes 20% mid-cap and 10% small-cap stocks, you might consider including some VB in your portfolio to cover the full spectrum of company sizes.\r  \n\r  \nYour question about how to properly overweight individual company stocks in your overall portfolio really boils down to optimum diversification to minimize risk (avoid losses) and maximize gains (build wealth).  Constructive diversification means reducing risk but not diluting winning investments with chronic losers.  Although the 4 individual stocks that comprise 55% of your portfolio have all done quite well over the past few years, I would still not recommend more than 5% of any single company stock.  \r  \n\r  \nSo, I am not suggesting that you throw more money at individual big tech stocks because they are more volatile than ETFs.  Spread your investments over time and over different assets to minimize risk and maximize long-term gains.
