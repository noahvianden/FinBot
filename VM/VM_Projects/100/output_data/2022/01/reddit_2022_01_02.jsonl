{"title": "Cash is a position - and a bad one", "selftext": "My person: I am 59 years of age and bought my first security 40 years ago.\n\nI keep reading that cash is a good thing to hold in case the market breaks. Bonds (except maybe Junk Bonds) are basically the same as cash when looking at inflation.\n\nI write this article because it seems that 95% of investors have another opinion, I am a contrarian here.\n\nCash is a position; and a dangerous one. The main problem is of course that security investments are always compared to cash, even measured in cash. But cash can be more volatile than securities. Cash may be created by central banks, by banks and even by every person just writing a debt on a piece of paper. But this is not the subject of this post.\n\nEverybody needs cash, it is so practical. Without it you would need to exchange goods for goods, which could be a pain in the ass. True. Money has two purposes: facilitate exchange of goods and keep values. Now, money is not very good at keeping value. So the best you can do with it is exchange it for goods.\n\nSometimes you may read something like \"a lot of our money is debt\". That is true, even worse, all of our money is debt. And it is almost guaranteed to lose value.\n\nSo what can we do? I cannot speak for other people, but I can describe what I do: As money is debt, somebody owes me. So I try to create debt for myself to balance that out. I usually take a margin loan with my broker for every cent I have in my purse or in my bank accounts. That debt is covered by dividend stocks that at the moment pay more dividends then I have to pay interest.\n\nNow the second argument that one hears in favour of cash: the market may crash and you can use it to buy stocks then. That is a valued argument, but what happens during the time you have to wait for such an event to occur? You lose double, money decreases in value and you lose the opportunity to gain money in other investments.\n\nSo what do I do? I am always invested 100%. When the market dips 20% or more I wait for signs of recovery, than buy on margin, if possible stocks that pay more dividends than I have to pay interest. Then I pay down the debt with the dividends and some partial sales when the market reaches a top again.\n\nIn my early days as an investor there was a saying \"divide your investments: your age in bonds, the rest in stocks\". I don't like that, liquid stocks are easier to cash-in then bonds. And bonds are almost guaranteed to lose money now.\n\nHope I could give some of you a different perspective.\n\nWish you all a happy and successful new year!", "id": "ru65e5", "created_utc": 1641115459.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "Cash is a form of diversification, and is significantly less volatile than almost any other form of wealth.\n\nMargin borrowing doubles the volatility of stocks instantly. \"Buy the dip\" is a reliance on regression to the mean, and only works when markets are diverting randomly, not when secular changes are occurring. Margin also introduces interest costs that quickly swamp the inflation cost of keeping cash ready or the frictional cost of selling something else to free up funds.\n\nRefusing to carry cash at all rejects its ability to avoid and blunt other kinds of risk, the same as those other investments help avoid the risks of cash. Telling people to go on margin instead just multiplies risk and negates the justification of avoiding any particular risk.\n\nTo properly diversify you should not have all your wealth in any one form or class of investments. All stocks or stocks plus index ETFs is a concentration in the corporate equity market, which is well known to go completely haywire at flash-crash rates. You shouldn't be all-equities any more than you'd be all-cash.\n\nIf you don't want to deal in things that aren't exchange tradeable, you should have commodity funds (ETF or ETN or whatever), direct real estate funds, mortgage funds, equities in multiple sectors, ETFs in multiple strategies, multiple forms of currency, and of course count your house, insurance, and Social Security entitlements as part of your diversification scheme.

If your broker habitually shifts your cash to an MMA, then that's also protected by FDIC up to $250k, and if the MMA further splits it between several underwriter banks (many do now) then it is $250k times the number they split it into. If you have an individual and a joint account, each gets full protection, and if you have taxable, trad IRA, and Roth,  each of those is fully protected, so even in one broker you can have several million split among half a dozen accounts and it could all be covered. But it can take time to get the insurance payout and if the broker that fails is big enough it could force the insurance to be decreased (the Bear Stearns failure would have gone that way if JPM hadn't stepped in and bought the firm to prevent it from breaking customer accounts), so keeping more than one broker is still best to avoid being unable to access money in a calamity.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Oh wow, that\u2019s a very helpful breakdown.

Bonds and cash are both losing real value right now, but that does not make them similar at all. Bonds are insurance. Bonds move slightly inverse to the market, especially during crashes. This lowers your volatility and increases your returns. \n\n3. Cash is not a remotely dangerous position. Holding the USD is one of the safest positions to hold in the world. The only things that have the same level of safety and a better return are US treasury notes (IE the risk free rate). It\u2019s even in the name\u2026\n\n4.

It\u2019s almost like thats necessary for a functioning economy. Guess what else can be created out of thin air? Shares. This is completely useless point. \n\n6. Money is great at keeping value. It loses it at the inflation rate which is a necessary evil, but it\u2019s still far more stable than any other store of value. \n\n7. I have nothing against trading on margin buts not something that should be casually encouraged in people who don\u2019t have enough experience to understand the significant risks associated with it. Buying dividend stocks on margin is not some cheat code to wealth. \n\n8. Having a reasonably sized cash position is a perfectly acceptable position is almost any portfolio. It\u2019s a deleveraging method that provides stability and opportunity. Will the person in 100% equities fare better in the long run? Probably, but that\u2019s not the point.

The fact that you don\u2019t understand why bonds go in a portfolio tells me everything I need to know. You should consider doing some reading on the efficiency frontier which will eventually bring you to the classic 60/40 portfolio. This is the most efficient combination of risk per unit of reward you can achieve. If you want higher returns you will be better off leveraging up a low volatility portfolio than continuing to add to a 100% equities portfolio.

Try to answer your points:\n\n1. Sorry, just thought it is good praxis to present yourself before such a posting. And mostly people my age say stocks are things of the devil and you need to be in cash or bonds. But just ignore it, not important.\n2. You speak strategy and I agree, there are strategies where bonds make sense. Even cash may make sense. But I spoke of my personal situation and for me neither bonds nor cash makes sense in an inflationary environment like just now. But then again I don't invest billions, otherwise probably there would be a need for bonds, cash and other strategies.\n3. Holding USD for me that spends a lot in Switzerland where I own a home would be a very bad thing the last 30 years. You see, it all depends on the viewpoint.\n4. This is like \"to understand regression you have to understand regression\". Volatility of stocks is measured in cash. But then inflation adds to it, so if inflation hits cash harder than stocks (like most of the time) cash is more volatile than equity.\n5. OK, this is more of an economic question. In my opinion everybody who lends money creates cash. Actually cash is just a piece of paper stating this debt. Once the debt is paid back the money disappears. Simple view but that is enough for me.\n6. Money is a very secure thing. It is almost a 100% secure... to lose value.\n7. Agree and that is exactly what I commented. **Please please please, don't buy equity on margin if you don't know exactly what you do**. And don't start now at the top of the market. One little error and you are financially wiped out.\n8. That is exactly the opinion of 95% of the investors. Not mine...\n9. Unfortunately I am not able to do that. I think nobody is. I always buy too late, but it could be worse. You only see afterwards.\n10. Actually I think I understand bonds. Held and traded bonds in the 80s. So maybe I should say treasuries, as for company bonds there are some strategies that in combination with other instruments can make money and reduce risk. And of course I did read Markowitz decades ago. But then I think risk is a very personal parameter. My post was not about strategy but about cash as a position.

Maybe once in a blue moon, someone will tell you that the other way is more profitable.\n\nIll reduce it down to what everyone should be doing to maximize profit. It only takes 2 question (okay maybe 2 and a half questions...) and you have to answer honestly.\n\nHere are the questions:\n\n1. Are you significantly more intelligent than average and do you actively improve your intelligence over time? Some valid measures would be level of math completed or if you can solve hard STEM problems without just guessing. There are other ways to measure too but those are the most obvious since we can easily measure them.\n   1. And as you aged, did you take time to actually get even smarter or are you coasting on what you had when you were young? Did you learn a new complex skill? Did you go out of your way to read an actual STEM book (not just some biography with someone opinions).\n2. Do you have 20-40 hours per week to invest into research?\n\nThats it. Now there are 4 possible answers but only 2 possible outcomes. Here we go.\n\nBased on your answers to questions 1 and 2 above:\n\n* No/No - You should passive index. For this person picking stock is gambling.\n* Yes/No - You should passive index because you dont have time.\n* No/Yes - You should passive index. For this person picking stock is gambling.\n* Yes/Yes - **THE HOLY GRAIL**\n\nIf you fall under the Yes/Yes category then you should be active and to be active you need cash. **Cash = Opportunity**. Its not infallible but opportunity is the most valuable asset you can have if you want to beat the markets. Thats not to say you cannot beat unless youre a rocket scientist with 100 hours to spare per week, but your odds drop a lot and for every success there are likely 9 failures. This is why its gambling.\n\nThe author of this thread incorrectly assumes crashes are infrequent. They arent. Anyone with any experience knows that we get sector or sub-sector level crashes on a scale of once to twice a year on average. **ON AVERAGE**. Many call them \"dips\" but I dont do just plain old 5%-10% dips. There are some very quiet years where nothing happens but this is actually rare. Most years you will get a crash of some sort and sometimes you hit the jackpot with a market wide crash and other time you might get two or three a year like in 2020 when we had a market wide and we had an oil crash later.\n\nHell, we also had a crash in 2021 and we might still be in it. This time its speculative tech/finance. They are down 30%-50%. Now granted that doesnt mean you should go buy peleton or tdoc or palantir but guess what? When this stuff happens >> IT TAKES EVEN GOOD PROFITABLE COMPANIES DOWN WITH IT << And that is the key. This is where you outperform but you need to recognize it and be disciplined enough not to gamble on the bad companies. Hence intelligence and time.\n\nThe author also severely underestimates the value of these sub sector crashes. He incorrectly assumes that missing a year will even you out with the time over timing crowd... he is wrong. Very wrong. A single trade during one of these big dips will outsize many years of normal performance. It is what it is.\n\nNow all that said, Im not advocating this for everyone. This is why I asked those questions above. To be honest, finding someone with high intelligence is uncommon and who also has time to burn is peven more rare because most people have jobs, or family and time is not available.\n\nFurther, what percent of the population actually continues to exercise their brain after high school or college? I mean... what? Maybe 1 in 100 people actually do that? Most say they will or want to but never actually do it. A normal person just coasts intellectually for most of their life if not all of it. And thats ok. Doesnt make you bad just that you did the minimum to get along. This is perfectly normal behavior. But stocks are a moving target. Its a little like working in tech but with much faster cycles. You either improve or you become obsolete. With stocks it worse because change happens even faster and you need to be ahead of the curve, not just riding it.\n\nSo yea... cash is king. It always was. Namely because its limitless opportunity for those who can capitalize. But not every can. Also note that almost all financial advisors and analysts fall under the No/Yes profile. Same with execs with some rare exceptions. So dont follow them either. There is no point.

You are completely right, diversification is a must. But that was not the point. And I don't assume anything about how often a crash happens.
