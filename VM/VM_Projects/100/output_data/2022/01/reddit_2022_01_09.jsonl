With that perspective, what I want to try here is to use the benefit of hindsight, but not to state the obvious, but rather, state how things turned out in reality vs expectations at the time.\n\nListening to Warren Buffett's older speeches, one of the things he mentions often was that how American society thought they would be taken over by Japan in terms of technological advancement back in the late 70's and early 80's and that there was not enough optimism with respect to American innovation that could prevail its leadership going into the following decades. While obviously not the only factor, this lack of optimism was apparently evident in markets and there were many years when not much was happening.\n\nIt is actually fascinating to observe that over the coming years, the exact opposite has happened. Introduction of computer in the 60's in the west coast - perhaps much earlier than most of the world - the creation of Silicon Valley and emergence of big-tech are more than just happenstance. I am not an American. While i will not go too further deep into this topic here, my personal view is this all goes back to foundations of the country and the fact that there is no cultural baggage/deeply embedded subconscious that prevents things from happening on this side world. Perhaps the big reason for this is the change in behavior/consciousness of people who emigrated here and were able to drop the burdens of the past.\n\nIf you think about the wealth currently possessed in our world, most of it was perhaps created/generated in the last 50-100 years (perhaps even 20-30 years). You might have been born somewhere with rich history (as I was), your forefathers and the empires that they have built could have ruled the world for hundreds or thousands of years and conquered every corner of the world, but none of that matters now. It's as if millions of years of history is almost irrelevant at this point because you were either able to adapt things in the past few decades or you were not. What I am obviously talking about here is the new creation of wealth as the existing wealth matters less and less each day. One of the reasons for this is obviously the fact that the world has not seen a \"reset\" since World War 2. It is perhaps the first time in history when we had such prolonged peace.\n\nLet's think for a second the implications of globalization in this peace period. This is perhaps the first time in history where the world is so connected that even the products we use on a daily basis are the same. Imagine the flow of goods and services 50 years ago or even 25 years ago. Were you able to access goods and services overseas this easily? Where would your disposable income be spent on? Even 25 years ago local markets did matter for the most part. I'd watch local TV, buy local newspaper, only a handful people had cellphones, internet was still nascent, most of the appliances in your home were already a commodity. If you had disposable income, most of the money would be circulated within the local economy and the most expensive things would be the house you'd buy (that obviously does not change today) and a car which would benefit a few countries but not a single one (perhaps Germany for the most part). So all in all, there was no single country that the money was flowing into. This was not possible by design.\n\nI am not saying all this goes away now. But thinking for a second, isn't this really the first time that a significant portion of disposable income, wherever you are in the world, flows into one single country? And for economies in which this does not happen, do they really matter to the global wealth in grand scheme of things?\n\nTake Europe or Middle East for instance, amazing blend of many cultures, languages. The entire world once was ruled from Mesopotamia, then Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, Rome and so on. Are they relevant anymore? What does a beloved country of Italy contribute to world economy these days? France? Spain? UK? South East Asia? - amazing corners of the world, billions of lovely people. Do they matter from a wealth creation and flow of money perspective? Of course they do, but to what extent if you think about end products: goods and services. What do they actually produce that the entire world consumes/needs? Of course Middle East has oil. But oil is a raw material and the goods and services used by this wealth creation does not necessarily change - the cars they buy, the planes they fly, the services they use are not locally produced. Take Saudi Arabia, a total GDP about $800 billion with all the oil. Apple generated $366 billion revenues in the last twelve months.\n\nLet's expand upon this.\n\nLet's assume you wake up in the corner of the world and don't have survival problem. What you do or spend your time is not significantly different than us here in the US. Your homepage is google for everything, you use whatsapp to talk to your friends, you are on instagram, your business uses outlook/microsoft, your phone is samsung/apple/android, you log into youtube on a daily basis, you prefer to watch netflix over local TV. (Sure, China is different from this aspect but it is also the reason why they have been outpacing everywhere else in terms of economic growth. They were not stupid about this and realized the effects of globalization early on).\n\nNow, you might be thinking - dude that is only such a small portion of the world. Millions of people don't even have access to any of those. I am well aware of that and while it is correct for the most part, from an \"overall wealth creation perspective\", billions of people actually don't matter all. It may sound so harsh, but think about the many countries of the world with millions of population and realize that their total GDP is less than the cash sitting idle on Berkshire Hathaway balance sheet.\n\nOr think of this perspective: What would happen if their disposable income was magically 10x tomorrow? What goods and services would they spend their money on? Is it really the local goods and services that would benefit from the overall increase in GDP - of course to a great extent - or is it really a handful of companies in the world that would actually benefit disproportionately from this wealth increase when that happens? If everybody in India could afford iPhones would they buy something else instead? Or would they be able to produce a competing good or a service locally that the entire world would consume? Would the money really flow elsewhere?\n\nOr are they really late in the game anyway, as we already argued that in the wealth creation game only the most recent period matters.\n\nSince the dot-com bubble era, I'd argue that a lot of things have changed. It is interesting because dot-com bubble was the classic innovation pattern - people knew internet was the next big thing but it was not exactly clear who the winners in the next decades would be. 20 years since, we know who the winners are. We know what business models work, what business models can scale, have network effects and become profitable and so on. Horses vs cars was another classical example. You did not have to be a genius to realize cars would take over horses but time was harsh to many car companies in that there was no one single winner. It was by design of the product it became commoditized. Same can be argued for air travel. Internet however is different. While new business models emerge, consolidation and monopolistic effects are far more real - it's a world where big becomes bigger as it employs smartest people, outbids competition, and constantly innovates.\n\nOf course there is no guarantee this will go on like this. After all, if you look at top 10 companies in the S&P 500 for each of the past several decades, you will see interesting results. How will the next big thing overthrow the existing giants when big always get bigger, especially when they benefit from the overall wealth increase in every corner of the world? Perhaps a new technology or maybe a catastrophe can trigger this. While I'd never want to guess the future, I am inclined to think as long as the status-quo peace continues, certain companies in the world  - as they keep their innovative pace - will continue to dominate.\n\nIs the market expensive? It sure is. But what will happen tomorrow if GOOG, AAPL, AMZN drop by 20%? Wouldn't people rush to put their entire wealth the next day? Sure multiples can contract. But is a 25bps/50bps move in rates going to destroy these companies? Would it make them worth less? Yes discounted cash flows should be lower and they may be growing 15% instead of 20%. But 5 years from now, are we going to see something similar to dot-com bubble where things don't recover?\n\nBut where else can the money go when your disposable income will be spent on that next iPhone, or half your time is spent on instagram/whatsapp/youtube/google, your businesses will still use Microsoft and its products and that will probably not change anytime soon. These are important as indices are market-cap weighted indices. So we would need a correction in big-tech more than anything else. And even if they do change, from which corner of the world is the next big thing going to emerge? \n\nNone of this is against the argument that the markets will not correct. However, I do not think the examples of dot-com era or 08' are justified. I think something \"bigger\" than 25bps increase in rates is needed for US markets to crash and stay at those levels for longer periods of time. This is again based on my reasoning that there is a wider fundamental shift in how we live and consume in comparison to past. And I did not even go into the demographic change here which is a totally different animal on its own.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.
