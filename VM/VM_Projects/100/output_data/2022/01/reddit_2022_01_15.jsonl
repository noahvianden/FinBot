My final move, however, was dumping most of my funds into Tesla.\n\nWhen I finally logged back into my account last January I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw. My Tesla stock had multiplied by 5 due to the split, and gone up in value like 16X. I don\u2019t know what would have happened had I still been constantly checking the stock price, but I imagine I would have gotten frustrated and sold during the several years of stagnant prices. I learned that the best course of action is usually no action at all. \n\nDuring the huge drop last May, I put some funds together and doubled my position at $580. Instead of panic selling, I realized what a fantastic buying opportunity was presenting itself and turned it into a huge net positive. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to read about what\u2019s right to do while investing, but the only way to really learn is to experience things for yourself.

{"title": "White Gold Rush: Lithium America\u2019s Corp (LAC)", "selftext": "Currently those commies in China control 80% of the worlds Lithium supply. Well, Uncle Sam wants to take this back and there is one business with the American flag at their back which will be doing this $LAC. \n\nLAC have exclusive mining rights to Nevada Thacker\u2019s Pass, the second largest Lithium reserve in the world &amp; the largest in North America. \n\nAs a base start for your intro to LAC there is a great interview recently with the CEO Jonathan Edwards here: The market for lithium: A metal miner with an out of this world valuation (https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/06/the-market-for-lithium-a-metal-miner-with-an-out-of-this-world-valuation.html) don\u2019t let the alarmist headline throw you, the CEO handles the value question straight out of the gate. \n\nOkay, so you haven\u2019t watched the video and instead just googled LAC seen it\u2019s up a bunch and think, meh this isn\u2019t for me, well, let\u2019s look at the catalysts that are coming up: \n\nCatalysts:\n\nThacker Pass approval, the judge just denied the appeal to stop construction. Ground is being broken people! Whilst this isn\u2019t the final judgement, it is a great step in the right direction; two of the attorney\u2019s for those trying to stop the mine just quit. Final judgement is in March and I expect the price to keep climbing ahead of the inevitable approval. \n\nUSA USA USA! It has political desire to take back lithium production from the measly 1% it currently gets itself and is subsiding hugely lithium production at home - see BBB, or whatever they replace it with &amp; other legislation. The USA won\u2019t allow a major ingredient in industry to be at the hands of the CCP and potential tariffs. LAC is going to be the key USA based supplier of this &amp; all other based innovations/products that come from lithium. This will be reflected in legislation, if they can every agree to write and vote on any. \n\nLithium prices are rising exponentially - Google Lithium prices - and are much needed in the clean tech revolution; EV, battery etc. \n\nLAC has just received multiple price upgrades and has a 80-90% buy rating by analysts. \n\nRecently approved acquisition to a further mine, taking total to 3. \n\nPotential partners including Ford, GM and TSLA - the CEO JE states, we are in numerous talks with people regarding potential partners and are under NDA. TSLA ain\u2019t far away from this mine\u2026 just saying. \n\nElsewhere: \n\nLook, we all have picked a sports, I mean Car team, whether you are Ford or TSLA or GM or Lucid or are a GME ape who thinks they will make EV cars soon as well, every man and his dog is scrambling to build as many EV\u2019s as possible, ice cars will be out of production by 2030. They will all require huge lithium to get through the EV arms race. In a world at war, the arms dealers get rich. \n\nThere is a less visible battery race going on this needs lots of lithium. \n\nJust signed off on another mine taking their total to 3. \n\nJonathan Evan\u2019s is a rockstar CEO. \n\nYour complaints: \n\nAnother business with no revenue!? Yes, but by the time they are making loads of revenue the share price will be a lot higher. Speculate to accumulate my regarded brothers. \n\nThose tribes &amp; eco warriors are against it; well yes and no, a lot of the tribes peeps are for the mine due to the prosperity &amp; jobs it will bring. In terms of climate, the impact study shows this will be a huge net positive in the fight against climate change. Biden has committed to fighting climate change at COP26. It hot outside and we got to stop it. \n\nInflation! Rate rises! This can be offset by the rise in demand and price of lithium + the subsidies by the USA gov for lithium production. LAC also has an excellent balance sheet to weather this. \n\nMy position: \n\nI am in for $30K with an avg 3x leverage at $29 per share. \nI plan to run up this up to it hitting $45 and take profit. Then reinvest everything in straight shares. I\u2019m in Australia, so I don\u2019t have the fun of options. I can only just leverage myself to the tits. I am sure people can come up with far more regarded plays that will make bank! Also, I\u2019m in Australia, we make a lot of money from digging shit out of the ground. \n\nTL;DR: LAC is going to make lithium, lithium make EV go brrrrr. USA need to take lithium away from China. LAC make USA go purrr. Lithium is white gold. \n\n(Wrote this on the mobile because couldn\u2019t be bothered to open the laptop.)\n\nNot financial advice. I have been wrong often in the past. Do your own googling.\n\nEdit: just to be clear, the main point here is that the USA needs to get Lithium out of the ground in its own back yard. The USA is not trying to make money from LAC directly (which is a Canadian based company) rather it needs LAC to supply all it\u2019s own industry\u2019s with Lithium. LAC\u2019s origins isn\u2019t important, but if it was Canada and China hate each other; see the whole Huawei thing. Canada and USA are staunch brothers obvs. LAC giveth the USA lithium.\n\nEdit 2: clarifying American lithium backing: \n\nAs responded in thread source SA: \n\n\u201cThe Government Wants Lithium\n\nLooking past the trendy word crafting, we can see the Biden administration is behind lithium much like the Trump administration was. Looking at the December 13th, 2021 statement we see the following highlights:\n\n1. \"The Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Transportation (DOT) will establish a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation focused on deploying EV infrastructure.\"\n\n2. $5 billion in funding for a national charging network.\n\n3. $2.5 billion in additional charger funding.\n\n4.

Millennial's lithium brine project, Pastos Grandes is immediately adjacent to Arena's Sal de la Puna project. Arena is an exploration company and it makes sense that LAC will want to buy that as well.\n\u2022\t\u2060LAC has something like $400m cash on hand. This gives them a tremendous amount of leverage when selecting a partner for Thacker Pass.\n\u2022\t\u2060So you see, LAC is not just Thacker Pass. They aspire to be a \"major\" Lithium producer and have been making very strategic moves. They have Thacker Pass. They have Cauchar\u00ed. They have Pastos Grandes. They will likely have Sal de la Puna. The quality and quantity of Lithium they will likely be producing in a few years is amazing.\n\u2022\t\u2060Problems in Chile and other countries are going to lead to more good new for LAC and other producers in the USA and Argentina.\n\nFull disclosure: I am a long term LAC holder and began accumulating in Feb 2017. LAC has changed my life. I personally scaled out a bit at $18 and will trim a bit around $50 (or whenever it overtakes too much of my portfolio.) IMO we'll see $100+ one day, and I'll still be holding. It's probably not a good stock to \"get rich quick\" on, although, many people do believe it will run up into the 40's over the next several weeks.\n\nFWIW I got lucky and found Joe Lowry's \"Global Lithium\" podcast back in the day.

Perhaps the only difference between the reality of tragedy in life today compared to  20 years ago is how fast news travels.  the power of media outside of conventional new of the last 50 years has been drastic. These sources range from podcast to social media, and soon a mataverse. The world has always been in a constant state of conflicts from international to domestic affairs. Not all events lead to crashes, some may even give rise to HUGE  opportunities.  The only significant difference this time is the tragedy of COVID and its aftermath. Whos to say the aftermath is negative for the market specifically.  In fact  i see technological advances from the mistakes learned in this b.s we all got caught on in, thus paving the way for more market opportunities. \n\nHike increase was known ; Hike increases will be less impactful then previously thought . Theres a difference between the reaction  of the number itself  and the actual impact of that number. The number was slightly higher then estimated followed by an overaction. Once they realize the impact isn't as bad because feds will continue to print and people will continue to afford, theyll soon talk about how stable the rates are. \n\nMidterms: every midterm election is a moment of great uncertainty, markets use that as an excuse. Yet every president needs  his last  two years  after midterms to have better economic poll numbers. And if they don't the market will rally behind the next president. They will try everything they can to pass spending bills, first its a fat one, once it doesn't get through, like a brisket they trim it down to the perfect fat amount to tickle both parties. Once a new president is elected the idea of a great economic run based on b.s promises runs the market again...it also depends who actually keeps their promise.\n\n\nOmicron and other variants  :  People are catching  on. The reaction will be less impactful overtime. COVID allthough real and unfortunate,  like many other previous pandemics  will soon be ineffective for the short side. In fact  pharma tech stocks  will benefit from talking about new progress made in preventing future pandemics, technology etc. \n\n\nSupply chain : it has been ALLOT  better in terms of ports. The hard part has certainly been fixing the labour demand. Without much immigration it becomes hard. These days it pays to stay home plus the mental stress of covid has caused an even deeper desire to stay home. As long as it pays to stay home  markets will be fine, because companies will keep making money from cash been poured to  stay at home dads. The hike increasing pushes people to get back to work and stop sitting on their ass, as social welfare won't cut it.  Hike increases also increases inflation then causes assets value to go up.\n\nTech will rocket ,5g, BIG DATA,  metaverse, the next 50 years we will be literally living on Mars. \n\nAs for AMC and GME ;  we know some have a negative reaction to those two ticker symbols. Perhaps because they have had *missed opportunities* no pun intended or perhaps they wanna move on. The though is the following; You and I most likely learned about WSB because of first GME and then AMC. They  are also the ones with the most evident volume and catch on with main steam media.\n\nGME/AMC will rocket again as they are too lucrative for media to stop talking about. If AMC was the second most searched topic it means hundreds of thousand of clicks meaning $$$$.

We know that the richest people make more money when markets crash because they have the capital to buy all the way down. Crashes are good for them, as in factually and demonstrably good. What happened in the past was that you'd have a crash and then a slow recovery, typically followed by sideways action.\n\n Covid is obviously not like the other situations but it really does seem like the rich have learnt how to have their cake and eat it even quicker this time. Yeah big crash, loads of chumps lost money but two months later the big boys were richer than ever before.\n\n They (central banks/politicians/megacorps/trillionaires) kept interest rates as close to zero (or even below in some countries) to encourage nonsense spending and no saving and that seemed to be a long term policy until covid, after all how else do you get exponential growth without massive debt accrual? You can't keep making humans because over population is fucking catastrophically awful. So the plan was to increase debt bigly to make stonk (and real estate) go up bigly but then you've got a pretty big problem because everyone's spending way beyond their means, personal and government debt is so insanely removed from actual earnings/gdp and wages have been de facto frozen (reduced) for the working class for fifteen years so what you need, like really really need, is inflation to reduce the value of that debt and then....covid happened and then there was a flash crash and then there was a crazy bull market and then inflation over 5% every month for a year. If I was rich I couldn't think of a more perfect scenario. I don't give a fuck about inflation because I bought the crash pre-inflation, that's locked in, those profits are untouchable now and inflation let's stonks go up and allows debt to be maintained (just don't go adding to it right governments...right?) annnnd it allows you to decrease, yes decrease, wages because the peasants get a 3% wage rise...and inflation is 7% (fucking lol). \n\nThis obviously doesn't in any way solve the problem of ever increasing debt and a populace earning less and less (in real terms) money but it does postpone having to deal with that and it does fulfill the function of a capitalist society perfectly. More money has gone from the poor to the rich than ever before and it looks like they think they can squeeze another couple of cycles of that before...I assume before they think they'll be snorting space cocaine off space ass but it might be the nukes for us and a couple of generations in underground lairs (that they've literally all built for themselves) for them and then back to speculative tulip markets. \n\nIt looks a fuck of a lot like everything's going perfectly for the people with all the money.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

I am not sure what their long term is. I don't know how how heavy their revenue is. They make money doing ads, audience analysis tools, sodtware/hardware licensing, streaming subs, and selling audience behavior metrics (everyone does this).  They are doing good in the smart TV / technology integration market  but they pay for it too. I'd personally cut roku and dollar cost down NVDA. \n\nNvidia owns their technology and the value of what they do is much greater than Roku. They're the big dog in AI and datacenter HPC. Crypro miner / retail is far less of their income than their datacenter HPC DPU etc. Add in the fact that Huawei hardware disqualifies you from a large number of govt contracts, Nvidia bought Mellanox and it seems that companies are starting to become more open to SDN and network automation. You can get 100G switches for a fraction of what cisco or Juniper costs. The only alternative really is Nokia or Quanta/Quantamesh/QCT (also a good buy) since they OEM for the rest of the market too. \n\nI like Square but i'd rather have a few payment companies. Stripe is killing square right now and has a much more reliable stream focusing on businesses vs consumer transaction processing. I like the idea of owning Visa Mastercard Chase/JPM and AMEX, and some other banks that are on the banking side side.  Paypal is a good company but there are a large number of payment processors process through visa to card partners like chase/JPM, CIBC, PNC and tons of of others. Visa, mastercard, amex, and a large number of other providers sell access to their gateways for application back end transaction processing. I also like banks that hold the credit cards for big box stores. CIBC for instance got the exclusive mastercard contract for all of Costco Canada. They have banks in the us and the Caribbean and are scratching and clawing for more contracts.\n\nI'm legging out of most of my portfolio. Things don't smell good.
