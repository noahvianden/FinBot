But in 2021, GM, Ford and Stellantis \u2014 the European automaker that owns Chrysler \u2014 had only 38% of the US market between them in the first nine months of the year.

Shanghai production numbers is conservative given the current run rate is ~800,000 with the factory still ramping up and planned expansion with 30% more employees this year.\n\n3.

Car prices drop globally, forcing tesla to lower prices and hence margins\n\nA common mistake that people make is comparing Tesla's valuation to legacy automakers. There are 3 key differences that cause such contrasting valuations:\n\n1. Tesla's cars are 3x more profitable at scale than legacy manufacturers\n\n2. Legacy automakers are hundreds of billions of dollars in debt.. each, pushing down their market cap. Their Enterprise Value figures are much higher.\n\n3.

I guarantee you the people posting massive gains don't spend much time acquiring DD on WSB. Like for real, I spend 1-2 hours per DAY researching the company. It's the only company I own, and I don't feel nervous about it at all.\n\n There are a ton of nerds that do things like drone flyover videos of tesla's factories and researching car VIN numbers to predict more accurate delivery numbers before the fools in Wall St. have their first bump of coke in the morning. \n\nScour the web, reddit, forums, youtube, twitter, etc and locate the non-sensationalist nerds that nobody gives a f\\*\\*k about because their voices are monotone and uninteresting. The ones that get excited about numbers and data like profit margins per vehicle and FSD take rates. I say I spend 1-2 hours per day on research, but like 4 times a year I have the proper info to make ludicrous bets based on research and hard work that really end up paying out $250-$500 per hour of work. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's actually hardly surprising because you knew the numbers before everyone else. You will genuinely acquire information before the majority, and subsequently print money 75% of the time, only getting shafted 25% of the time when macroeconomic factors overshadow Tesla's success (which is why simply dollar cost averaging shares is where I've made 1000% returns. Anything over 50% is profit with options though, if you place similarly sized bets each time.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "how much do you have in savings for having retired in SEA at 25 mate? we are the same, TSLA fanatics + SEA retiree (", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I consider myself still employed!
