{"title": "Why Elon Musk views Optimus as an immediate necessity", "selftext": "There seems to be a massive disconnect between the thinking of analysts and the thinking of Elon Musk. There was a massive shock that Elon would prioritize unproven robots with an unproven addressable market over new hotly expected car models.\nThis is understandable, as there are probably a few steps in Elon\u2019s thought process that he seems unwilling to express explicitly at this time.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the obvious point: many people and many analysts think that the physical product that Tesla produces are the cars. In Elon\u2019s mind, however, the physical product that Tesla produces are instead the factories that produce the cars \u2013 \u201cthe machine that builds the machine\u201d.\n\nOne aspect to consider is that Elon has always wanted to have fully automated factories operating really quickly. Contrary to his initial expectations, however, there were a lot of steps that are hard to automate and it was necessary to use human labor instead (c.f. General Assembly). In his interview with Marques Brownlee he lamented that an operation like putting two cables together is trivial for humans, but is really hard for a robot.\n\nAnother aspect is the availability of workers. Over the years Elon has sent multiple tweets on the topic, including one very recently.\n\nThus it is extremely likely that a primary reason for Optimus was the need to optimize and automate the Tesla production process. It was pretty clear at the earnings call that Tesla plans to start using Optimus internally initially. Of course, as it develops over time, it would likely become a rather viable product itself.\n\nIn other words, analysts seem to miss that Optimus is very much related to Tesla\u2019s car production, its capacity, and its margins. It would also be fun to see their estimates for the \u2018Optimus\u2019 product towards the end of the year when Tesla shows the robot in use.", "id": "sfecjj", "created_utc": 1643447540.0, "score": 125, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "I think it\u2019s more basic than this.

This is the equivalent of him holding up a drawing, saying \"we're building this and it will change the world\", and then not elaborating further. And all we've heard of AGI is Elon sending one tweet saying [\"Tesla AI might play a role in AGI\"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1483728729545363457), and now people believe that it's part of their core business.\n\nAs other people have commented, a car is inherently stable (it doesn't need to balance on anything), only has to work in two dimensions, and only has two inputs: driving a motor forwards or backwards, and turning a steering wheel. All the AI has to do is recognize objects and give a relatively rough idea of its location and size, then program a path to avoid it. And despite this relatively simple problem, Elon has been [promising level 4/5 FSD every year since 2014](https://jalopnik.com/elon-musk-promises-full-self-driving-next-year-for-th-1848432496) and we're still not there.\n\nCompare this to a bipedal robot that has to balance on two legs, needs to work in two dimensions, and at a minimum has a few dozen motors. The AI not only needs to recognize objects, but also identify its position down to the millimeter so that it can pick it up without missing it or pushing it away. It also needs to know how to pick up an object based on its shape, how malleable and deformable it is, and how much force to apply; picking up a wooden cube is very different than picking up a plastic bag. And this is just the software side of things, then there's the hardware side that needs to account for things like differing tolerances between motors, pinpointing the position of its limb in relation to where the body is, and the minimum amount the motors have to move in order to overcome static friction.\n\nIn other words, it's the difference between a car being able to identify a trash can and drive around it, and a robot that can walk up to the trash can, open the lid, and toss a plastic bag in.

With SpaceX reusability was considered a meme and dismissed summarily by the rest of the industry. On Dec 21, 2015, SpaceX landed their first Falcon 9. Since then, for 7 years, they've been landing nearly every single F9 and FH flight they've launched; for a total of 100 booster reuse flights. It's become SO trivial, it doesn't even make the front page of any major news site anymore and only does when something goes *wrong*. Now, EU with Arriane Next is copying the Falcon 9. Russia is copying them. China is copying them. India is copying them. Almost every major Aerospace player is making Falcon 9 clones to get their own reusable orbital class booster up and running before the Starship/SuperHeavy platform comes online. SpaceX was started by Musk. Tesla wasn't, but he got involved early and then eventually took over the company and became the head off and has basically been the head off for the better part of two decades. At this point, the balance sheet and earnings report all point to the fact that Tesla is where it is at today because Musk has insane ideas and doesn't take no for an answer.

Further, in their earnings call, they noted that they can achieve a 50% growth for FY22 with Fremont & Shanghai factories alone. Meanwhile, Berlin and Austin are beginning to come online. If you play it conservatively and say +30% instead of +50% for FY22... (936,222 BEVs \\* 0.3) + 936,222 = means they'll sell at least 1,217,088 BEVs for this year with those two active factories. It takes several years for other factories to ramp, but if you were to add say 15% production capacity from either into this equation for this year, then you're looking at 30% between Fremont & Shangai + 30% between Berlin and Austin for a total of 60% growth for FY22. That means: (936,222 BEVs \\* 0.6) + 936,222 = 1,497,955 BEVs for FY22.\n\nGM claims it wants to sell 1M BEVs in 2025 and exceed Tesla by 2030. If Tesla has reached nearly 1.5M BEVs 3 years before, then by 2025, Fremont, Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin will be completely ramping and you could probably double that output to 3M BEVs in 2025; 3x GM's expectations.\n\nWorse, Elon on the earnings call along with everyone else, stated and agreed that they will disclose by end of FY22 where their NEXT GigaFactory will break ground at.\n\nThe point to all of this is that Tesla has managed to disrupt and execute on every single front despite the so called \"whims\" and \"dreams\" of Elon, and in doing so, has exceeded every single benchmark, metric, and expectation in the market. Thus, for him to talk up Optimus Subprime this and that and FSD this and that doesn't worry me, because the hard numbers in their earnings reports...the math says that whatever crazy shit that's happening on their side of the fence is working.

That said though, labor does require expenditures in excess of energy and basic material cost. Let's assume, theoretically, that Tesla per GigaFactory prints 1000 bots and uses them to address material relocation and simple actuation tasks like connect wire A to wire B. There's 4 gigafactories, so 4K bots. That's fleet wide NN training that can occur in shadow mode (courtesy of the FSD platform running the core of the bot) coupled with basic tasks simultaneously. This labor can be quantified relative to the cost of a human doing the same work. How much does it cost to make a bot? Let's say $100,000.\n\nWell, a person with a 50k job on the factory line has a hidden cost of another 20-25k in benefits, so really the person is being paid \\~70k. This person also is only available 9-5, then another person comes in and takes his shift, and you have 3 cycles of 8 hour shifts to reach your 24 hour operation window. So really, you're paying $210,000 for 24 hour operational window. But if a bot costs only $100k, that means for a 24h window, you can get 2 bots for 3 humans. That seems asymmetric, but humans have fatigue tolerances. They get hungry. They need breaks bio and food. They have emotional and psychological needs.\n\nThese aren't bad things, but when you're producing hardware, they're risk and OpEx that you have to factor in. If you can do away with much of that overhead for future growth (not replacing present talent, that'd be dumb), then your revenue can exponentially increase and same with gross and net profits. Additionally, as said elsewhere and by others, Moon/Mars ambitions of SpaceX does play a factor here (as SpaceX/Tesla have collaborated before on other projects in the past. The gigacasting alloy is one project. SpaceX sourcing Tesla motors and batteries for Starship development is another.) Developing autonomous humanoid bots is immensely valuable for space economy (LEO and post LEO). You won't be replacing humans as much as you'll be augmenting the workforce significantly.\n\nInstead of sending 1,000 humans to build a base, you can send 10 or 50. Each of them would oversee some bot group who'd be responsible for base building, clearing, connecting of materials and wires, etc. The hard *labor* would be taken care off by these bots, because exertion is an aerobic activity and lifting heavy things to put them together on Moon or Mars where every gram of oxygen and nitrogen is precious, would mean that doing all this heavy activity would require you to ship way more oxygen/nitrogen/water/food during the initial trip than you would otherwise. That mass which freed up by these bots, can then be repurposed for more structural growth/farming/nutrients, etc.  \n\n\nI think a lot of people are missing the forest for the trees and jumping the gun for this far off reality by thinking it'll happen tomorrow or the year after. Even if they manage to figure out to **print** the bot at scale, it still has to LEARN and TRAIN and UNDERSTAND its environment. It's taken Tesla approximately a decade to get to where it is today. Dojo will help accelerate that learning curve, but I have confidence that it's going to take Tesla the better part of this ***decade*** to do similar things with the bot and its own FSD style learning curve. If you want to be concerned about the bot and its broader market impact, perpend your expectations with a caveat of 2027-2030 and not sooner.

{"title": "Should i pay all mortgage or invest in the S&P 500?", "selftext": "First of all I'm not buying anything, this is just a thought experiment, my main goal is to find out which is a better option? let's say I want to buy a house for $100K, and I have the $100K in my bank account cash. should I:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Pay for the house CASH.\n2. Get a loan and pay for mortgage.\n3. Invest in the S&P500 and pay for mortgage every month by taking the monthly payment from the S&P500 balance.\n\n# Here are the Factors :\n\n\\-Mortgage interest rate : 6% per year fixed.\n\n\\-Mortgage period : 15 Years.\n\n\\-Down payment : 20%.\n\n\\-Interest on my 100K if sitting in a bank account: 0%.\n\n\\-S&P500 average return :  10.5% per year.\n\n\\-Inflation rate : 2% per year.\n\n\\-Taxes on investment gains : 0%.\n\n\\-paperwork fees & all fees : $0\n\n\\-Property appreciation : 0%\n\n\\-Currency : $\n\n\\-Value = price - inflation rate\n\nHere come the numbers, I'm an idiot so correct me if I'm wrong please!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-If i go with option N\u00b01: my total cost would be : $100K TODAY. Value =$100K since there's no inflation yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-If i go with option N\u00b02:  my total would be : 20K down payment + 80K principal + 41,5K interest=  $141,5K.\n\nSince inflation is 2%, in 15 years it would be 30% total, but because of the fact that inflation is gradual, the average inflation rate on 121K (principal+intrest) should be 15.83% after 15 years, so Value would be less hence, Value =  102,279+down payment of 20K= $122,279.\n\nSo in conclusion from the first 2 options, after 15 years paying cash would be a better option than mortgage, since even after factoring inflation I'd still be paying 22% more in value if i chose getting a mortgage.\n\nAnd without factoring inflation using price rather than value, I'd be paying 41.5% more on a mortgage vs paying cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's go with option N\u00b0 3 this one is  a bit more complicated for my monkey brain.\n\nThe plan is to invest 100K in the S&P500 index fund and every month I'd withdraw  $781.96 which is the monthly payment for the mortgage, my questions are:\n\nIs it better to pay cash or to use option N\u00b03?\n\nCan the gains pay for my interest? or better yet, pay for the interest and leave a positive balance on my portfolio?\n\nIf i go with option N\u00b03: my  total would be: 100K initial investment - 20K down payment  - 781.96 per month for 15 years  +10.5% per year (I used interest calculator) should be = (negative)  -$37,677.\n\nThe way i go this number is by calculating how much 10.5% per year would yield me if i invest $80Kand take out  $781.96 every month for 15 years. and the answer is  $79,177. Total yield paid. that's a total of 98.9% return in 15 years!\n\nMeaning i can pay the 100K principal + 41,5K total  interest and still have $37,677 hence the negative number in the last equation, i did not factor inflation in this case since if I did I'd have to factor it on the mortgage and the investment gains and they'd just cancel each other out.\n\nIf you wanna factor inflation on the remaining $37,677 , it'd be worth  $  30,141in 15 years.\n\nIf you wanna factor Taxes at 20% you'd still be able to pay for the interest and keep   $ 30,141 valued at  $ 21,099after 15 years of inflation.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nOption N\u00b03 is the best since you'd be able to pay interest for free & have a nice bag of cash afterwards, unless of course you're me in which case as soon as you buy $SPY the market will go into a recession and will not recover until after 15 years yielding you $0 and you'd have no house and no money since you sold the bottom the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: it's 4am and I'm an idiot who wanted to answer this question which kept me awake for 2 Hours i posted it here so i can be corrected if I'm wrong please feel free to call me names, i want to laugh a little is this red sea of death.", "id": "sfa0bq", "created_utc": 1643430910.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR; Never Again\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the bottom absolutely fell out of the stock market and the housing market.  As a mortgage broker, my job disappeared and I worked physical labor to get by.  I was pretty young and I spent everything I made as a broker, my lack of savings did not concern me, my property was appreciating, that was my savings, right?  Wrong.   Eventually, I gave up on paying anything but my housing payment, destroyed my credit with collections and chargeoffs, and worked some truly poopy jobs to keep the house and to keep living.  Never Again.\n\nAfter going back to school for a masters, I squared away the chargeoffs and collections and aggressively started paying off the house, because: Never Again.\n\nIn about 8 years I had whittled the mortgage down to a small amount and refinanced it to a 7 year mortgage at 2.5%, because: Never Again.\n\nI had rebuilt my credit, but I bought a new car with cash, because: Never Again.\n\nI did not finance anything, I bought everything with cash, and I also kept plugging away with extra payments on that 7 year loan while squirreling away a year's worth of money to live on, because: Never Again.\n\nThen COVID hit and I sold that house for ridiculously more than it should have been worth.  I could easily have gotten a mortgage for a very nice house, but: Never Again.\n\nI bought a decent place with cash and added even more to my arsenal of 'what if' money, because: Never Again.\n\nI truly hope that our economy never again suffers another event like that of 2008-2013ish, but if it does, I will have no bills and I will not have to toil at poopy jobs to cover expenses.  The money I invest is not the money in my squirrel fund and it is not the money I netted from the house, it is additional money that I can lose, because: Never Again.\n\nI was fairly sure I knew what the future would bring back then and if I could think about it without crying for how hard those years truly were, I'd probably laugh.  \n\nIf you can be liquid, please consider it, just in case, none of us know what the future will bring.", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you good Sir for sharing valuable lessons you\u2019ve learnt over time!
