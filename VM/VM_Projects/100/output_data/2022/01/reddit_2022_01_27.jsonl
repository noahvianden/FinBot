The fact they achieved performance parity with the latest generation and can even go past AMD currently is because of a better design. \n* AMD is supply limited due to TSMC's capacity needing to be shared between different clients. \n* Amazon and Microsoft would also need to build their chips. They will compete with other buyers like Apple, AMD and Nvidia. This will drive up the price at Samsung and TSMC. They can also go to Intel as well in the next few years since they are going to produce third party designs. Additionally Amazon and Microsoft making their own designs is also a bearish view on AMD. However unlike AMD, Intel could capitalize on this.  \n* Intel can take full advantage of the chip act and new subsidies that will come in the EU. Additionally the US congress and administration consider Intel as part of a strategic industry. This means that they will be further supported through several benefits on state and federal level.\n* While TSMC is ahead, part of that is down to being further with applying ASML EUV technology in their production line. Intel has not gone as far with 10nm, however they will be able to achieve parity down the line with their announced partnership with ASML. \n* ARM processors from Microsoft and Amazon are indeed a concern and are great to support their own SAAS products, this is not the case for a fast majority of enterprise software that requires x86. e.g. SAP. Cloud growth will remain for x86 IAAS and PAAS. \n* Intel still holds 83.8% market share for laptops\n* AMD has almost no chips in the budget segment. \n\nYes Intel has risks:\n\n* Failure to execute on fab expansion\n* Will not get subsidies\n* AMD superior design for next gen\n* Cloud going to use more bespoke CPU's\n* margin pressures\n\nI believe the balance is positive.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yeh just adding balance there's alot of mindless repetition of \"Intel is so undervalued and a sure fire bet!\" in this sub I like to come in and spout bitterly about how they're a falling giant to add the counter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Intel may have an X86 edge but AMD are better complete systems and they are still building up to their \"final form\" if you like with 3D cache and the rest.\n* TSMC are also expanding massively and are bigger and demonstrably better than Intel at foundries.\n* I agree with you that Intel may have seen the writing on the wall with ARM and is hedging with foundries to sell to Microsoft/Apple.\n* I also agree with you that they are probably going to do well from subsidies they are a sweetheart of govt although the DoD failure was special.\n* AMD doesn't have supply capacity for the budget segment right now, but with Microsoft now moving to ARM it's a matter of time before that segment gets massively eroded by ARM designs and last gen AMD may also start filling in.

{"title": "Apple to Rival Square by Turning iPhones Into Payment Terminals", "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/apple-to-let-iphones-accept-credit-cards-without-extra-hardware\n\nApple Inc. is planning a new service that will let small businesses accept payments directly on their iPhones without any extra hardware, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe company has been working on the new feature since around 2020, when it paid about $100 million for a Canadian startup called Mobeewave that developed technology for smartphones to accept payments with the tap of a credit card. The system will likely use the iPhone\u2019s near field communications, or NFC, chip that is currently used for Apple Pay.\n\nn order to accept payments on an iPhone today, merchants need to use payment terminals that plug in or communicate with the phone via Bluetooth. The upcoming feature will instead turn the iPhone into a payment terminal, letting users such as food trucks and hair stylists accept payments with the tap of a credit card or another iPhone onto the back of their device. \n\nThe move could impact payments providers that rely on Apple\u2019s iPhones to facilitate sales, such as Block Inc.\u2019s Square, which dominates the market. If Apple lets any app use the new technology, then Square can continue accepting payments via Apple devices without needing to worry about providing its own hardware. If Apple requires merchants to use Apple Pay or its own payment processing system, that could compete directly with Square. A Block representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nShares of Block fell less than 1% during pre-market trading in New York on Thursday; Apple advanced less than 1%.\n\nt\u2019s unclear whether the payment acceptance option will be branded as part of Apple Pay, though the team working on the feature has been working within Apple\u2019s payments division since being brought over from Mobeewave, the people said. It\u2019s also not known if Apple intends to partner with an existing payment network for the feature or launch it alone. \n\nApple may begin rolling out the feature via a software update in the coming months, the people said. The company is expected to release the first beta version of iOS 15.4 in the near future, which is likely to see a final release for consumers as early as the spring. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \n\nApple has been escalating its push in payments in recent years, launching the Apple Card in the U.S. in 2019 and rolling out Apple device installment plans on the credit card later that year. It also offers the Apple Cash card for digital peer-to-peer payments and is working on a service for Apple Pay that would let people buy things and pay them off later in installments, Bloomberg News reported last year. \n\nThe iPhone won\u2019t be the first device to have Mobeewave\u2019s payment acceptance technology. Samsung, which backed the startup before it was sold to Apple, implemented credit card acceptance with a tap on its devices in 2019.", "id": "sdyaas", "created_utc": 1643289726.0, "score": 1406, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 258, "comments": [{"body": "There goes my SQ farther down\u2026", "score": 535, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I\u2019m so frustrated with my decision to get into SQ so heavy.

SQ doesn't just provide a payment terminal for small businesses, it provides services that are needed for running and growing the business: keeping track of inventory, payroll, insurance, taxes, reward programs, and even loans. So if I am a small business owner relying on SQ's services, I'm not going to start using Apple's payment terminal and abandon SQ unless they provide something equivalent in terms of business services at a similar cost. I'm not familiar with what Apple plans to do besides what's written in the above article, but I don't think they've set the groundwork to provide such services.\n\nSecond, SQ's business has also grown beyond the seller-side with the Cash App digital wallet becoming a multi-billion dollar business.
