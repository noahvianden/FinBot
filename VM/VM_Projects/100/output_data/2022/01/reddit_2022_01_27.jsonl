The fact they achieved performance parity with the latest generation and can even go past AMD currently is because of a better design. \n* AMD is supply limited due to TSMC's capacity needing to be shared between different clients. \n* Amazon and Microsoft would also need to build their chips. They will compete with other buyers like Apple, AMD and Nvidia. This will drive up the price at Samsung and TSMC. They can also go to Intel as well in the next few years since they are going to produce third party designs. Additionally Amazon and Microsoft making their own designs is also a bearish view on AMD. However unlike AMD, Intel could capitalize on this.  \n* Intel can take full advantage of the chip act and new subsidies that will come in the EU. Additionally the US congress and administration consider Intel as part of a strategic industry. This means that they will be further supported through several benefits on state and federal level.\n* While TSMC is ahead, part of that is down to being further with applying ASML EUV technology in their production line. Intel has not gone as far with 10nm, however they will be able to achieve parity down the line with their announced partnership with ASML. \n* ARM processors from Microsoft and Amazon are indeed a concern and are great to support their own SAAS products, this is not the case for a fast majority of enterprise software that requires x86. e.g. SAP. Cloud growth will remain for x86 IAAS and PAAS. \n* Intel still holds 83.8% market share for laptops\n* AMD has almost no chips in the budget segment. \n\nYes Intel has risks:\n\n* Failure to execute on fab expansion\n* Will not get subsidies\n* AMD superior design for next gen\n* Cloud going to use more bespoke CPU's\n* margin pressures\n\nI believe the balance is positive.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yeh just adding balance there's alot of mindless repetition of \"Intel is so undervalued and a sure fire bet!\" in this sub I like to come in and spout bitterly about how they're a falling giant to add the counter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Intel may have an X86 edge but AMD are better complete systems and they are still building up to their \"final form\" if you like with 3D cache and the rest.\n* TSMC are also expanding massively and are bigger and demonstrably better than Intel at foundries.\n* I agree with you that Intel may have seen the writing on the wall with ARM and is hedging with foundries to sell to Microsoft/Apple.\n* I also agree with you that they are probably going to do well from subsidies they are a sweetheart of govt although the DoD failure was special.\n* AMD doesn't have supply capacity for the budget segment right now, but with Microsoft now moving to ARM it's a matter of time before that segment gets massively eroded by ARM designs and last gen AMD may also start filling in.
