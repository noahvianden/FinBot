{"title": "A Company to Profit HANDSOMELY from the Energy Crisis", "selftext": "\n**GEWD MORNING**\n-\nI'm back with updates!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMonths ago, I stated the demand and importance of LNG in the upcoming years? Yeeeeaaah, well those needs came quicker. There is now a global energy CRISIS:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/europe-s-energy-supply-crisis-has-the-eu-at-the-mercy-of-putin-and-the-weather\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis\n\nIt used to be harder for fossil fuel start-ups to get bank financing due to not being viewed as \"green\".  But now that, you know, there is an energy crisis, the EU is trying to get nuclear and LNG fuels listed as GREEN. For those that have a chromosome tolerance of \u00b1 1, LNG is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and is poised to be the energy source for the foreseeable future. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/europe-green-investments-nuclear-natural-gas.html\n\nBecause of this current climate, it has set Tellurian to EXPLODE. I know, I know, most of you don't know how to operate the shiny buttons on the TV, so you may have not seen the news. Have a parent or guardian help you with viewing the current crisis unfolding in front of your useless eyes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**To summarize from my last DD:**\nTellurian is building Driftwood which is \"developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.\"\n\nCharif Souki started Tellurian. If you don\u2019t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, and pioneered the LNG industry. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Energy, the first company to export LNG from the US. A company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share(**updated: now at $100+/share**).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTellurian has multi-billion dollar LNG purchase agreements with: Gunvor, Vitol, and Shell.\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/072921-shell-agrees-to-buy-3-million-mtyear-of-supply-from-tellurians-driftwood-lng\n\n**When these deals were signed, JKM pricing was in the $10-15 range. We are now +$30 and climbing!**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Due to covid and all, Driftwood construction was delayed. New timeline:**\n\nSyndicate announcement: This month Jan 2022\n\nFinal Investment Decision (FID): 1Q22\n\nBechtel construction Notice to Proceed (NTP): 1Q22\n\nBechtel construction begin: early 2Q22\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Many signals aligning giving evidence to something big brewing:**\n\n-Multiple job listings for Tellurian have been posted in the recent months. \n-Tellurian's Linkedin shows they have filled many job openings with top-of-the-line hires.\n-On Jan 6 2022, Tellurians K-8 shows \"approved the issuance of 174,942 restricted stock units to Mr. Granmayeh, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Each restricted stock unit \n    represents a contingent right to receive on or within thirty days after vesting one share of Tellurian common stock, cash of equal value, or a combination of both, as \n    determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The restricted stock units generally will vest in one-third increments upon an affirmative final investment decision by the \n    Board with respect to the Driftwood liquefied natural gas project and the first two anniversaries thereof.\"\n-Souki released a YouTube video this morning (1/11/2022) reaffirming this FID and construction timeline; it's right around the corner. He also stated that banks' attitudes toward \n    energy financing have dramatically changed over the last 6 months because of the crisis as explained above.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**I VISITED ONGOING CONSTRUCTION:**\n\nDOT is mandating that highways leading to Driftwood need to be widened to accept construction traffic. This construction is currently underway as well as power utility company running new power lines.\n\nAs stated in my last DD, I work in the area. I decided to drop by the construction site and take some pictures and videos for those who can't read. I also asked some questions to construction workers. \n\n**Here are my findings:**\n\nI talked to a gas station owner who is located on the Driftwood highway. He confirmed that TELL was doing the work. I asked him when construction would begin, and he confirmed March or April. I asked more questions and he directed me to Tellurian's temporary office. I drove by but didn't see anyone around. As I was leaving the office, I flagged down a truck slowly passing me. He works for a company who has a lot of land in the area. He said a \"company\" was clearing a bunch of trees and making driveways into the woods. He pointed in the direction that the Driftwood terminal will be built.\n\nNext, I talked to one of the construction flaggers located a few hundred yards from the office. He works for Entergy (power company for those who don't know). He said they are running new power lines - I assume these are power lines for Driftwood. They're doing some pretty serious work headed in the direction of Driftwood. Power for Driftwood will be a serious power addition; I doubt Entergy would be making these additions unless Driftwood construction was certain.\n\nThen, I stopped next to a truck that had been watching the road construction crew (he was the construction supervisor). I asked him if the road construction was for Tellurian. He said yes and that things were going well. I asked him when he expects to finish, he said JULY! I asked him if Tellurian had been pressuring them on a constrained timeline. He said, \"No, actually they gave us certain deadlines for certain stages AND WE ARE WELL AHEAD OF THEIR DEADLINE.\".\n\nI asked him if they need to finish the road work before Driftwood construction can begin. He said \"No, they can start bringing in equipment while we're working. Our main goal is finishing the turnoff from the main highway so that we are not impeding traffic.\". I asked him if he worked for Tellurian, he told me no but the guy in the truck next to him did.\n\nSo I walked over to the Tellurian employee's window and asked how things were going. Super nice guy. He said things are going very well. I asked him if they are still expected to start construction in the second quarter. He confidently said, \"Oh yes, construction in the second quarter.\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSee this link for my pictures and videos of the ongoing construction.\nhttps://1drv.ms/f/s!Anxr6tk-0ohkgZxJUAZcVhf7p-wPAQ\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tl;dr and additional facts:** \n\n\n-Undervalued company is about to build an LNG plant that will help mitigate the global energy crisis.\n\n\n-The current energy crisis and potential EU classification of LNG as \"green\" crafts a perfect \n    environment to finalize financing of the Tellurian Driftwood LNG facility. \n\n\n-This morning, Tellurian's founder Charif Souki, industry legend, reaffirmed the financing and \n    construction timeline. \n\n\n-Tellurian has been actively posting and hiring important positions in the company with top-of-the-line hires. \n\n\n-On site road construction workers, a local gas station owner, and a Tellurian employee \n    confirmed construction timelines.\n\n\n-$80 million in revenue this year, $200 million in revenue next year - exponential growth baby!\n\n\n-Stock has recently up listed to NYSE\n\n\n-Stock has been added to Russel 2000 and 3000 as of 11/24/21\n\n\n-Earnings have doubled since last year and stock price is not reflecting the rapid growth as of yet.\n\n\n-Europe is burning coal as their renewables are not providing what they need\n\n\n-TELL estimates they will account for 24% of global natural gas supply\n\n\n-Carbon futures in Europe are screaming higher\n\n\n-LNG prices in Europe and Asia are ridiculously expensive compared to USA Henry Hub prices\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Price predictions:** \n\n\nprice after FID: $6-8\n\n\nprice after NTP: $10-15\n\n\nprice mid-construction: $20-30\n\n\nprice after first liquification train is complete: $50-70", "id": "s27egf", "created_utc": 1641997276.0, "score": 240, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Loving the $TELL vibe today ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17102186381816864}, {"body": "Good article on Tell.
