What happens next is the legacy farmers grow the hybrid berry and supply the market. But at this point in time there is one too many farms than is needed to supply the market. The start ups are in the weakest position due to the burden of start up costs ( cost of capital ) and will have to beat the odds to survive.  \n\nOf all the legacy automakers Ford moved first and boldly, positioned itself early and now will reap the rewards and a Lions market share of the EV market.\n\nFords market cap and share price will double long before others in the EV market. Consequently it is the best stock in the auto sector for outsized gains.IMO.\n\nGood luck to my Fellow FORD Bulls !\nI will see you on the MOON !", "id": "s3d49g", "created_utc": 1642117133.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Bought some last summer when people were telling me Fisker lol.

I know the regular car market doesn\u2019t peak anyones interest as much as EVs. There is always a Ford in my driveway. I have been a customer for years, mostly Explorers but I have owned Navigators, Expeditions and Edges. This past Wednesday I picked up my first ever EV, the Mach E4X. It\u2019s only 2 days but I love it!!! I am thinking of ordering the F150 lighting but I really don\u2019t have a need for a pickup truck. I may wait until they produce a Navigator EV. I am sure it\u2019s not far off.  \n\nThe biggest difference in my opinion from the EVs of past (Bolt/S10 etc) is the technology. The Mach E may not be on par with a Tesla yet but it\u2019s damn close. I got right on the highway and turned on Blue Cruise and it worked fine. The programming options are cool. I am yet to play with all the features yet. \n\nWhat I will say about Ford/Chevy/GM is that no matter where you drive across the country you will find a dealership. The new EV companies will not have any real estate/footprint for years. With the major car companies footprints they can build a charging network to compete with Tesla. In my opinion the charging network is Teslas biggest strength. \n\nI also read Ford is developing a charging cable that is liquid cooled and it can charge a car to 100 percent in the same time it would be to fill your tank with gas.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well Noted.

When viewed in isolation, their growth numbers are stellar (for a car company) and they are (mostly) executing along the expected trajectory. So far, they have seemed largely immune to the chip and other supply chain shortage issues that have pestered Ford, GM and others. Led by a charismatic (say what you will about Elon) founder, they have been terrifically successful in using the capital markets to their benefit (raising tens of billions of dollars at market highs). There's no question that they are a much better company than your average auto manufacturer and (outside of the fact that they are in a fundamentally lousy business) could be one of the best companies in the world. Yes, there's a lot of hype and BS (Cybertruck, semis, robotaxis, AI, robots, etc.) and even some quality and other issues, but the cars have a lot of demand and this will continue to be so (and they will continue to execute on being able to fill that demand for quite some time).\n\nNow, to your second point about market share and profitability.\n\nI wrote this quote from Terry Smith on another thread just now:\n\n>\u201cAs Jim Chanos, the renowned short seller, observed \u2018The worst thing that can happen to reopening stocks is that we reopen.\u2019 It is often better to travel hopefully than to arrive.\u201d\n\nBy extension, the worst thing that can happen to the Tesla stock is that they actually get to 20 million cars annually.\n\nIMO, the stock is 100% a \"trading sardine\" at this point. Yes, they are not a traditional car company, margins are slightly better (and could still improve somewhat), etc. But there's just no way the $1T market cap (which is even higher fully diluted) is or ever will be justified. Yes, it's true that nobody knows what industries and areas they will venture out to etc. but that's just the same old price-driven narrative seen so many times before in times like 1999 etc. The stock is held by:\n\n- traders / speculators / shills who are holding to sell at profit to less sophisticated investors\n- unsophisticated retail investors who just know the story and are completely price indifferent (just poll your friends and relatives and you'll know what I mean)\n- cult fanatics (like Jason DeBolt) who are either also price indifferent or have intentionally blocked off intellectual honesty when it comes to valuation work\n\nAs a side note, I am bullish on stocks and am currently 100% invested in US stocks in my PA.

When I started investing in Apple before the pandemic, around 2018, everyone told me to ignore it. They said it was overrated, that there were better stocks out there that could lead to larger gains. They all said Apple was going downhill and that there was no way it could outperform the previous year. Instead of chasing quick gains in other stocks, I went in heavy in Apple. Apple went on to become my largest holding. I sold most other stocks just to hold this one. Is there risk associated with this? Yes. Could it tank on bad news? Yes. Could something disastrous happen like poor quarterly earnings? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. You have to be willing to take risks in life to get rewarded. You have to accept the risk and understand the scope of the consequences if things go sour. I go sleep peacefully at night because I know it's Apple, a company that's had a massive following in the past 40 years. Apple is a long term hold due to its strong cash position, good earnings record, aggressive stock buy back program, and worldwide brand recognition. It's got the Apple Car and the VR headset/glasses coming up which could be huge catalysts. If you look at a 5 year chart, needless to say Apple has been a great investment for me so far. If I diversified, I would've never seen the massive gains that I have now. It's also a large part in any tech ETF or index you may be familiar with.\n\nTLDR: Go all in if you can accept the risk knowing the future is uncertain, if you're willing to accept the outcome whether it's good or bad.
