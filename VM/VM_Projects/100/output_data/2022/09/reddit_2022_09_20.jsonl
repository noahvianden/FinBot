With both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox using AMD hardware, there was likely a very good reason for both to ditch \"team green\". Not to mention the recent news with EVGA, I'd think Nvidia has more troubled relationships with 3rd parties than AMD ever has.\n\nServer CPUs are AMD's bread and butter currently, and they have no competition from Intel on that front.
