With both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox using AMD hardware, there was likely a very good reason for both to ditch \"team green\". Not to mention the recent news with EVGA, I'd think Nvidia has more troubled relationships with 3rd parties than AMD ever has.\n\nServer CPUs are AMD's bread and butter currently, and they have no competition from Intel on that front.

They are basically replicating Alibaba and applying it (And applying it well/better than Alibaba) in their regions. Mercado Libre is absolutely dominant in Latin America and everybody else is way behind. Mercado Pago, which is their e-wallet & fintech arm is also a huge money maker.\n\nShopee is basically the same thing and absolutely dominant in South East Asia. They beat Lazada (backed by Alibaba) at their own game and kicked Lazada down to 2nd place. Shopee pay is not as dominant as say Mercado Pago because of the amount of competitors in the South East Asian E wallet space. Garena is a gaming company but it's been in decline since revenues have dropped since the Covid gaming boom. I believe SEA LTD is weaker and riskier than MELI but that is definitely reflected in the stock price and valuation.\n\nBoth MELI & Sea Ltd are very close to their historical lowest Price to Sales ratios and if there is a time to buy, it's now. They are pretty risky so I'm only comfortable with a small bite. Hope they turn into the Amazon/Alibaba of the future. I'm not big on Electric Vehicles because their valuations are still expensive. E-commerce/E-wallets may be boring, but they are proven to be essential to everyday life since that is usually the cheapest & easiest way to buy things/send money.\n\nI'm not that convinced by EVs as electric vehicles are optional and once people realize how much it costs to keep replacing their lithium batteries, the demand growth may not keep up. Also the scalability of EV production is IMO over estimated. There is a limit to global Lithium/rare earth mineral production. EV company prices are still taking into account huge growth rates and high scalability. I am not convinced. I prefer to stick to tried and true working business models.\n\nSemiconductors are very cyclical and also it requires in depth technical knowledge to be able to make good decisions IMO. Intel vs AMD is difficult, I don't know enough about semis to be confident that Intel can make a comeback. I also don't know if AMD & TSMC can keep growing at their break neck pace. If I had to pick one, I'd go with boring- Micron. I'm not buying at the moment but it it drops below 50 and is close to a P/B ratio of 1 I'll take a small piece.  Memory/Ram is basically a commodity with only 3 big players.

VR adoption is not as fast as many people expected and it's quite under the radar now. META is super cheap in valuation. At this price, I like the risk/reward. Even if the Metaverse flops, growth can still come from monetizing Whatsapp & Instagram. I see that they are planning to roll out grocery purchases through Whatsapp in India. Having Whatsapp as a Global super app is a huge monetization opportunity that Meta hasn't tapped yet. It seems that they are finally following in Wechat's (Tencent) foot steps.

Because Ford definitely needs to aquire more debt for a successful transition.
