So far my plays have consisted of earnings plays and bets on spy w/r/t the economic events calendar. I've generally been buying ATM contracts shortly before the catalist which would trigger the price move to occur (i.e. buying spy puts at close the day before a fomc meeting).\n\nNow, in this situations, am I better off going deeper ITM or is buying ATM sufficient for such a method?

I'm not sure of the pros/cons here.\n\nYou're asking the right kinds of questions. Just about everything involving options trading decisions boils down to one or more trade-offs.\n\nThere is no absolute \"better off\". ITM buys you more delta, but increases your capital outlay. ATM usually gets you the best liquidity, which means crossing the bid/ask will cost you less money.\n\nFWIW, buying a put or call the night before an expected move maximizes the amount of money you pay for volatility. Which means you are exposed to maximum IV crush risk, assuming there is extrinsic value in the contract. Going deeper ITM would reduce that exposure, since that reduces the amount of extrinsic value in the contract.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I was aware of the IV crush aspect of my method, but wasn't sure of the proper move to mitigate this.

Not only would you realize the loss on the shares, *you pay more money for the calls*, putting you deeper in the hole. And on top of that, you now put a time limit on the recovery, because the calls will expire.\n\nIf you think the stock will eventually recover and you think holding will eventually be the best use of your money in terms of net profit and positive expected value, including consideration of opportunity cost, just continue to hold the shares and benefit from no expiration.
