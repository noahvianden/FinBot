I do not plan on becoming a professional trader. I plan to continue becoming a nurse. If I make any money that's a bonus.\n\n\nI will not be spending any money any time soon on trading stocks. I am looking to just use simulations right now to further learn and understand how everything works. I understand, and agree with, the fact emotion can fuck stuff up that doesn't happen on simulations. Any money I would use towards this is Money I've already decided I have lost.

Growth is generally recommended for younger investors, while divs for older/near retirement but see what works better for your lifestyle. \n\n\nI'm 25 but I have found dividend/income focused investing better for me, which I can talk about. I make just about $500 average, in dividends every month. Which will continue to grow as I re invest. I would encourage anyone who is growth focused to speak on their experience as well because that can definitely work better for certain people. \n\n\nThere are some risks, but that comes with any market Investing. I Invest in mainly ETF's (look into those if you haven't heard of them) that pay a dividend. Buy and hold. Most will payout monthly or every 3 months (every quarter). In very simple terms you buy into a company or fund (that holds multiple companies), and you receive money for holding it. The pros for me are, I don't have to worry about the day to day market fluctuations, goes up, goes down doesn't matter, as long as it continues to payout (obviously you don't want to invest in something that's just going straight down tho, you still have to research what will be a good investment). I'm Canadian with a TFSA so any money I make in there is tax free (not sure if other countries have something similar) so I personally don't have to worry about a tax drag. It has created somewhat of a safety net for myself and cash flow, I don't have to worry about pulling from my principal investment if it happens to be down. but that's more of a psychological benefit. It is more of a slow and steady approach, I'm not getting rich overnight but I am becoming stable. There are many more things to learn about this strategy then I could type here but I hope you take the time to look into it. And look into growth investing as well because that might end up being better for you depending on your situation (it can be better in a tax perspective, if you are not able to invest in a tax free account).

Someone else already asked you to figure that out first but I would like to add that most people are made to believe they need to trade stocks so they can compound their savings / surplus earnings. That is very far from the truth and in fact dangeous advice, since research has shown over and over that retail investors are prone to make major mistakes, setting their annual wealth growth back signficantly. There are simple and relatively safe financial products you could buy that do the work for you - such as government bonds (when bought at the right time) or an index fund or ETF. Those never require you to analyze or trade anything individually and, given time, will also build and grow your wealth, provided the underlying index (or economy) does not collapse for good to a point the country spirals into civil war and despair (which is highly unlikely if you stick to developed nations). You could just buy a large index fund with a low expense ratio and hold that for a long time. It would compound for you without you having to trade a single stock. You'd just cost-average your surplus earnings into the index fund each month and let your net-worth grow over the years.\n\nSpeaking of compounding: Compound interest is really important to understand when it comes to wealth-building.\n\nMost people's minds are blown when you ask them the following: Person A starts saving 1000$ a month at age 20, does that for 10 years until age 30, then stops saving money and will spend the rest of their earnings past their 30th year on life experiences and family. The savings compound at 7% anually. At age 65 the person wants to retire and live off their savings. Person B first spends money on themselves and lifestyle, starts saving 1000$ a month at age 30 and does that for 35 years until retirement at 65. The savings also compound at 7% anually. Who of these two will have more money by the time they retire at 65? Instinct lets most people assume that saving money for 35 years would mean person B ends with more money for retirement but that is sadly not true. If you look at any compound interest graph you quickly see why: It goes up sharply towards the end and the more intervals are passing, the higher the result. The fact that person A started earlier and therefore has more compounding periods simply puts them ahead, despite only saving money for 10 years.\n\nLearnt to understand compound interest instinctively. You can go to an online calculator (such as the very simple one at [https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator) ) and experiment with annual return percentage and monthly savings scenarios and total durations - or you can try to do various math exercises centered around doing math in your head. You might want to look into \"The Rule of 70\" - it's a nice shortcut to approximate the doubling time of an investment growing at a certain average percentage a year. Speadsheets are also useful to learn but there's a way of getting lost in numbers and losing track of fundamentals, so I suggest doing it carefully. Once you get a feeling for compound interest, you will have an easier time to figure out how inflation and real returns affect your net worth. Often overlooked but also important: If you lose 10% in a stock and have it gain 10% again, you're still not back to where you started. 100$ become 90$ but 10% on top of 90$ is only 9$, so you'd be 1$ short. It's such basic math but easily forgotten by most traders and investors when chasing percentage returns. It leads to a very important rule in wealth building: Try to never lose any money, as it will be much harder to gain it back.\n\nLife is obviously not nearly as simple, so every math exercise breaks apart in reality very quickly. However, understanding something thoroughly will make it easier to plan ahead in life, especially if if you have a specific saving goal in mind (such as a down-payment for a house, to start a business or spendy lifestyle goals) or dealing with inflation.\n\nOne piece of advice I can give anyone young: Invest in yourself and your earnings potential first. Learn life skills, learn professional skills that will be useful for future promotions, pick up hobbies that help you balance out (physical and mental health are important to keep earning and growing), pick up a few hobbies that help keep your mind sharp, learn languages, learn social skills. The latter seems counter-intuitive at first but as you mentioned having an autism spectrum diagnosis you might want to ask yourself if there could be situations/scenarios where you future earnings potential (from your career) might be impacted by underdeveloped social skills or experiences you did not get to make while you were younger. That could be you being career blocked when the next promotion would force you to lead a group of employees or having to deal with a wide array of people outside of your department. Maximizing your earnings potential by investing in yourself (in the form of education and healthy habits) is by far the best way to build wealth, especially if there is high inflation or a looming global crisis (no matter if economic, poltical or ecological). There is ample research and evidence for this. I'll not go into this but you surely know we're living in troubled times and the future comes with major challenges for your generation, so it might not hurt to pick up a few helpful skills on the side. You don't have to be a jack of all trades but sometimes you discover something you mind can chase endlessly outside of your professional field. Don't hold back for sake of saving money and instead give yourself a chance to experience and grow.\n\nIf after all this you are still determined to invest into stocks, please never forget the following: You are not trading an abstract slip of paper that has a magical value to someone (that would be speculating - which is a nice way to avoid saying \"gambling\") but you actually buy a fraction of a business. For that reason alone you'd need insight into how the business and its industry works, to truly make informed decisions. It's very easy to fall victim of numerology by looking at charts and spreadsheets and then extrapolating them in hopes to time things. That is also a surefire way to lose money, especially when the graphs and lines are not continuing forever because the fundamentals of the business and the surrounding economy are shifting or if the market was building up to a major bubble. Look into the concept of \"mean reversion\" and what it means for market speculation or fundementals of a company. One question to ask yourself is always: If you buy a stock, when do you sell it? If you can't answer that with certainty by knowing anything about the underlying business and economic factors, you are just speculating and risk losing it all. It's not about setting an abstract return value to achieve growth but about having actual insight into the business, its competitors and how far it can and will grow. Investing is very, very hard (because it's global and competitive) and time consuming. You need to form a circle of competence into business sectors you learn to understand, learn how the businesses actually operate and then have to find overlooked deals that let you buy shares of a quality business below value. This value is not correlated to the current market value but the actual fundamentals and earnings potential of the business. Look into the term \"intrinsic value\" and \"value investing\" while you are at it.\n\nIt's not always about stocks by the way. You could very well invest into local real estate and companies in your town and do quite well for yourself. In what ever way your journey starts, please remember investment is about compounding returns and those scale with long time. Do not make hasty decisions to get in some bubble and if you do want to do something risky never do it with money you or your family might need.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["ups"]}
