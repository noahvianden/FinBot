{"title": "So how many people think this is a dead cat bounce and a huge crash is incoming?", "selftext": "So I\u2019m curious. I was saying it during the entire bear rally. What you saw was literally an average bear rally during a market crash.\nBeen saying it during all the dips and rises. \nI just think we are way too behind on the inflation curve and everything has gotten out of control, including the housing market. I don\u2019t see a soft landing being a possibility. I mean look at what\u2019s going on in other countries. \nMassive inflation in Europe as well.\n\n[New record inflation in Europe.](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/08/31/record-inflation-which-country-in-europe-has-been-worst-hit-and-how-do-they-compare)\n\nWe\u2019re sitting at 9.1% in the US and I guarantee it goes higher. \nSorry but that\u2019s officially a recession..\n\nYou can see it in the prices for everything. I mean eggs are 40% more expensive for fucks sake. A staple..\nGas? \ud83d\ude02 \nSo we tapped the reserves? Who cares when they shut down major oil pipelines that were giving us more oil independence.\nThat\u2019s a band aide. \n\nI think we\u2019re headed down a rough path and our government is just pussyfooting. Which is even more dangerous. \nI mean the faster you attack a problem like this the better it will be in the long run but they\u2019re so worried about election season that they would rather watch the country burn than mess with Bidens re-election campaign.\nIt has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans. Both of them would do the same thing.\nIt\u2019s crazy and it\u2019s dangerously irresponsible. I hope you are all in a good place to brace for this impact.\nI hope I\u2019m wrong.\nGood luck.", "id": "x4588r", "created_utc": 1662134534.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "economy is good but economy should be bad", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s been this way since the pandemic started.

{"title": "Michael 'Big Short' Burry Makes Another Dire Prediction", "selftext": "Call him a Cassandra: Financier Michael Burry's predictions tend to come true. His latest is worrisome.\n\nMichael Burry rose to fame after the 2015 film \"The Big Short\" depicted his bet on the subprime-mortgage meltdown, which sparked the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe financier has since become a market statesman. He mainly plays the role of Cassandra. The name of his profile on the microblogging website Twitter is \"Cassandra B.C.\" He's the bearer of bad news. And he's been delivering it for the past few months.\n\nThe investor, who recently liquidated his entire portfolio of U.S stocks save one, says the worst for the economy is yet to come as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated on Aug. 26 that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates aggressively to fight inflation.\n\nThis monetary tightening will lead to a hard landing for the economy -- in other words, a recession, some experts say.\n\nBurry didn't wait to start pointing out potential red flags for the economy, like a household-debt crisis, that pose a serious danger.\n\n**Burry Indicates a Crash Is Coming**\n\n\"Net consumer-credit balances are rising at record rates as consumers choose violence rather than cut back on spending in the face of inflation,\" the legendary investor posted on Twitter on Aug. 12.\n\nHe included a graph from Bloomberg showing that U.S. consumer borrowing increased by $40.2 billion in June from the prior month. This was the second-biggest increase ever, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"Remember the savings glut problem? No more. Covid helicopter cash taught people to spend again, and it's addictive. Winter coming,\" Burry added.\n\n\"Winter coming\" seems to refer to the HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones.\" Characters used the phrase as a warning.\n\nNearly three weeks later, the financier did it again with a very gloomy prediction for the markets.\n\nIndeed, he seems to say that a stock market collapse is a matter of when, not whether.\n\n\"And yet I keep getting asked 'wen crash?'\" Burry tweeted on Aug. 31, with a Bloomberg chart showing the movements of the S&P 500 since 2017.\u00a0\n\nOn the graph he highlighted the fact that the stock market benchmark has fallen 18% since its high in December.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ylesvnt1zfl91.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf3c14901cb5bfc6c3b24cd60a1702cc36be6c00\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/ccz5l78wzfl91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=774ab77bacf2778bd54ee467bf19a1ca04b3c152](https://preview.redd.it/ccz5l78wzfl91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=774ab77bacf2778bd54ee467bf19a1ca04b3c152) \n\n**Burry Has Already Been Right This Year**\n\nBurry seems to feel that a stock crash is shortly going to happen. In May, the investor predicted that the S&P 500 could fall to 1,862 points over the following few years based on the crashes of past years. At last check the index was around 3,908; from there his call would be a drop of 52%.\n\n\"Re: paradigm shifts/speculative peaks, the SP500 bottomed 13% lower than 2002's bottom in 2009, 17% lower than 1998's \\[Long Term Capital Management\\] crisis low in 2002, and 10% lower than 1970's low in 1975. 15% lower than the covid low is SPX 1,862 \\~Shiller PE of 16, nominal PE of 9. In historic range,\" the  Scion Asset Management chief executive posted on Twitter on May 3.\n\nThe cause of his pessimism is that the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things\" has been created since summer 2021. That's particularly because small investors went heavily into the meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, portending the \"mother of all crashes.\"\n\nSource: [https://www.thestreet.com/technology/michael-big-short-burry-makes-another-dire-prediction](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/michael-big-short-burry-makes-another-dire-prediction)\n\nMichael Burry has tweeted \"And yet I keep getting asked \"wen crash?\" with a chart of the S&P 500 movements since 2017.
