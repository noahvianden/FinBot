People work better and faster when they have shorter days and more time off. The amount of fluff time in a 40 hour a week is almost half. There have literally been studies showing that reducing days worked or hours worked in a day as resulted in more productivity for the company. Because of the way businesses view wages as an OPEX and it's basically the only number that can be manipulated to show ever continuing growth of a company, it's in a businesses best interest to placate workers with an extra day off for the same pay over a pay raise. The company is likely to come out ahead in terms of bottom line growth because of wages staying the same and increased productivity. The employee is likely to view their work week as a raise because they are now being paid more for less work even if the wage stays the same. In your case they actually cut the pay and didn't keep it the same as if you were working 5 days. I believe this will change as more companies adopt a 4 day work week. Also in your case you now have 3 days a week to pick up a part time job or side work to make more income. In the future if you're paid the same as you were for 32 hours a week this would allow you to make more than you did before if you chose to work more. \n\n\nIn the end, the ability to have choice and flexibility is superior to money.

Gas prices were already on their way up prior to Biden going into office - went from a year of people not needing to drive as much to people starting to drive again; a surge in demand along with people speculating on future prices means it jumped up. His Afghanistan options, while a bit of a disaster, were literally a continuation of a deal that Trump started. You want to talk about Biden's covid policies, but the Republican parties stance was anything like wearing a mask or getting a covid shot was an assault on freedom which only encouraged covid to spread. How is Ukraine even Biden's fault? Biden tried to warn Ukraine prior to this invasion, meanwhile Trump wanted to withhold funding to Ukraine which would've made it an even easier target. You want to talk about VP's based on race/gender, and I actually hated the Kamala pick myself, but realistically it's not like VPs have been really picked for many more reasons than to support the candidate in areas they're seen as weak. I actually fucking wish Biden wasn't a bitch on the Supreme Court, after we've had Republicans hold out on nominating a president and essentially stacking the court by spending months not dealing with Obama's pick in 2016 then nominating a Trump pick with weeks until the election. You're accusing Democrats of wanting Democrat rule of the Supreme Court but Republicans literally did that exact thing between 2016-2020 with how McConnell allowed nominations to function.

The Chinese did. Trump warned us for years about how bad and dangerous the Chinese government is. You can't blame trump for covid. Trump didn't put covid positive people in nursing homes, further spreading the disease and killing elderly people left and right that was a Democrat. Trump tried to warn people about covid while trying to keep people calm. Democrats tried to pretend covid was not a problem but Republicans being racist. Trump and his administration are the only reason a vaccine was available so fast in the first place. He laid the foundation that allowed the biden administration to make the vaccine, a vaccine that wouldnt be available without the trump administration, more readily available for those who want it in the first place. People lost jobs because of covid. Biden made it a requirement for peopoe to get vaccinated to have certain jobs. That had a much more permanent impact on jobs lost than anything directly trump related. \nTrump and his administration had benchmarks and requirements that had to be met in order for the troops to pull out when they were supposed to, a strategic plan. Biden ignored that plan and 18 months of no american soldier deaths in Afghanistan ended really fast. \nUkraine happened because Putin and Russia learned that Biden and his administration are weak. And, trump, being a better politician was able to work better with our enemies for the good of the country and world. I really don't think Russia invades Ukraine and the Taliban doesnt take over Afghanistan if trump were still in office. I wouldn't say mike pence was selected to run as VP to support the president. I think he was selected for showing good moral character and strong republican values, and a patriotic love for his country. Trump didn't try to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, like biden and the democrats have been trying to do.\nI don't know what you mean by the Republicans Supreme court doesn't care about precedent.

{"title": "The long-term case why free speech platform Rumble will be a winner", "selftext": "Rumble is an online video platform and cloud services business founded in October 2013 by Chris Pavlovski, a technology entrepreneur from Toronto. The cloud services business is known for hosting Truth Social and the Rumble video platform.\n\n# News cycle catalysts for current price movement:\n\nRumble officially De-Spaced today and is now listed as $RUM\n\n# Content Creators Taking Notice:\n\nRussell Brand with 5.9 million followers has signed a deal for an exclusive live show on the platform.\n\nGlen Greenwald the founder of The Intercept and a Pulitzer-Prize-winning investigative journalist who leaked the Snowden files is also starting an exclusive live TV news show.\n\nAndrew Tate has moved his 4.5 million followers to his Hustler's University \u2013 after recently being removed from Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter for misogynistic remarks.\n\n## List of some other notable content creators recently added:\n\nTulsi Gabbard, Bridget Phetasy, Matt Orfalea, Siraj Hashmi & Mujahed Kobbe, Shant Mesrobian & Zaid Jilani\n\nJoe Rogan who hosts the most successful podcast in the world has taken notice [https://twitter.com/rumblevideo/status/1569295378910167040?s=20&t=L0yUuCVsBYNVqATk2gdkOQ](https://twitter.com/rumblevideo/status/1569295378910167040?s=20&t=L0yUuCVsBYNVqATk2gdkOQ)\n\nImpressive Growth Story:\n\nOn par with Twitter in million monthly active users last reported @ 69 million and that company is presently valued at around $44bn, in comparison Rumble is currently deeply discounted at a value of only $2bn-$3bn.\n\n## Growth Story:\n\n(**Excerpt from CEO on SEC filing**) Before this explosion of growth, we were doing roughly 1, 1.5 million monthly active users. In our first major leg of growth, we posted 21 million monthly active users in Q4 of 2020. By the summer, of Q3 of 2021, Rumble hit another leg of growth, hitting an average of 36 million monthly active users on the platform.\n\nRumble saw another massive leg of growth happen, averaging an average of 44 million monthly active users in Q2 of 2022. Then that takes us to now, and what we\u2019ve seen now is probably one of the most exciting times that I\u2019ve ever seen in running this business. We are now transcending politics. This has nothing to do with politics anymore. We hit 78 million monthly active users globally in August of 2022, with 63 million alone in just US and Canada.\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-22-055451/](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-22-055451/)\n\n# What makes them different:\n\nCensorship has become a major problem on the YouTube platform for content providers and they are starting to take notice. I believe it\u2019s about to reach a tipping point on its way to juggernaut status. Mainstream media and tech companies continue to ignore alternate viewpoints or actively try to suppress information.\n\nInformation suppression is likely to get worse after the midterm elections go badly for the democrats, with platforms likely to double down on their idea censorship. Rumble is a bootstrapped company whose main tenet is to resist censorship which will eventually cause a shift in the most popular names to move platforms to regain their freedom.\n\n## Notable Investors:\n\nMay 19, 2021 - Peter Thiel and venture capital firm, Narya Capital, which was co-founded by author J.D. Vance. Narya\u2019s Ethan Fallang will be joining Rumble\u2019s board of directors.\n\nPeter Thiel isn\u2019t in the habit of losing money!\n\nDavid Sacks - another member of the famed Paypal mafia was recently complaining that an episode of his popular podcast had been removed from YouTube without explanation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Nimble and actively recruiting\n\nAfter Truth Social went live in February with a rocky start users couldn\u2019t sign up because of glitches Rumble stepped in and migrated the platform to its cloud infrastructure in April.\n\nIt's planning on offering its cloud web hosting service with guarantees to uphold freedom of speech and plans to make it available to all users in 2023. [According to Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/), the $178 billion cloud services market, which grew by 37% in 2021, is dominated by the tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Google who all have questionable records on censorship.\n\nThe company is also quick to react to calls for content creators' cancelations one recent example is Joe Rogan\u2019s who the media called to cancel before any decisions were made Rumble quickly stepped in with a $100 million contract offer.\n\n[https://insiderpaper.com/rumble-offers-100-million-to-joe-rogan-to-bring-his-podcast-over/](https://insiderpaper.com/rumble-offers-100-million-to-joe-rogan-to-bring-his-podcast-over/)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTake this lesson from the past as to why you should support free speech platforms even if you are not currently in need or personally affected:\n\n*First, they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out\u2014 Because I was not a Socialist.*\n\n*Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out\u2014 Because I was not a Trade Unionist.*\n\n*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out\u2014 Because I was not a Jew.*\n\n*Then they came for me\u2014and there was no one left to speak for me.*\n\n*- Martin Niemoller Lutheran pastor Imprisoned by the Gestapo for \u201ctreasonable statements\u201d*\n\nThis stock is headed up every time Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter decide to arbitrarily censor someone Rumble is going to gain new active monthly viewers and with it those coveted advertising dollars.
