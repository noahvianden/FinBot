{"title": "Apple is gaining on Facebook and Google in online ads after iOS privacy change, report shows", "selftext": "The Google-Facebook online ad duopoly may be breaking up. According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple\u2019s ad business has benefited from the company\u2019s major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple\u2019s search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker\u2019s App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google\u2019s rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.\n\nApple has \u201cjoined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,\u201d according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple\u2019s improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn\u2019t exist in the same way for Apple,\u201d Lais said. \u201cSo you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon\u2019s position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%. Amazon wasn\u2019t listed because it\u2019s not a platform for developers. At the lower end of the market, TikTok overtook Snap, which has also been hammered by ATT. TikTok has 3% market share, and Snap is at 2%, Appsumer said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/06/apple-is-gaining-on-facebook-and-google-in-online-ads-after-ios-change.html", "id": "x71h0c", "created_utc": 1662440037.0, "score": 517, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 178, "replies": [{"body": "History is very consistent on this point.\n\nCompanies form extremely powerful moats.

{"title": "Meta has been fined $402 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission for its handling of children\u2019s privacy settings on Instagram", "selftext": "check this out\n\n[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6lyop/meta_has_been_fined_402_million_by_the_irish_data/)\n\nA fat fine \u2014 of $402 million \u2014 is headed Instagram\u2019s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children\u2019s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nMeta was contacted for comment on the penalty.\n\nWe understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram\u2019s parent, Friday \u2014 ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company\u2019s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities \u2014 however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.\n\nIreland\u2019s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: \u201cWe adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of \u20ac405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.\u201d\n\nThe Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) \u2014 following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR\u2019s transparency principle.\n\nThe Instagram complaint focused on the platform\u2019s processing of children\u2019s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to \u201cpublic\u201d by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to \u201cprivate\u201d.\n\nThe GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally \u2014 as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children\u2019s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).\n\nThe reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn\u2019t leak early).\n\nWhile today\u2019s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it\u2019s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children\u2019s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it\u2019s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.\n\nThe Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland\u2019s draft decision \u2014 triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.\n\nIreland\u2019s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft \u2014 and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.\n\nSource: [https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy/](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy/)", "id": "x7gd8d", "created_utc": 1662485102.0, "score": 2959, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "They always go after the kids.", "score": 269, "replies": [{"body": "It's the modern equivalent of tobacco.
