{"title": "Soft Landing More Likely Than Recession, Say JPMorgan Strategists. What That Means for Stocks", "selftext": "A soft landing is becoming a more likely outcome for the global economy than a recession, according to strategists at JPMorgan Chase. The avoidance of a global recession, along with moderating inflation and wage pressures among other factors, should continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, they added in a note. Within equities, the firm favors cyclical stocks, which it said should benefit from the gradual easing of inflation. They also like small-cap stocks and remain bullish on China and emerging-market stocks. \n\n\u201cWe maintain that inflation will resolve on its own as distortions fade and that the Fed has over-reacted with 75bps hike. We will likely see a Fed pivot, which is positive for cyclical assets,\u201d they said. The bank\u2019s strategists said economic data and investor positioning were more important factors for the performance of risk assets than hawkish central bank rhetoric. \u201cThe data appear to be increasingly supportive of a soft landing (rather than global recession), given moderating inflation and wage pressures, rebounding growth indicators, and stabilizing consumer confidence,\u201d said the bank\u2019s global markets strategy team.\n\nThe U.S. consumer-price index is due to be released later Tuesday and economists expect it to show that annual inflation cooled to 8% in August, from 8.5% in July. That would be the second consecutive month of decelerating price growth, and the lowest rate since February. \u201cOur expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus (e.g. China and energy support in Europe), and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,\u201d they added.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/stocks-economy-soft-landing-recession-jpmorgan-51663056229?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/stocks-economy-soft-landing-recession-jpmorgan-51663056229?mod=home-page)", "id": "xd1w4n", "created_utc": 1663057411.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019ve predicted ten of the last two recessions.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "And I've seen 17 of the 3 variations of this quote 248 times over the last 13 months.", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2619307339191437}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.061606068164110184}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0017680668970569968}, {"body": "This aged well.", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "The finest milk left out in a warm room", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2086668461561203}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04854752495884895}, {"body": "Look I\u2019m pretty optimistic for a soft landing and or stagflationary sideways period over recession myself, but for anyones that lived through and or studied recessions knows how hollow these sorts of analyst forecasts are. \n\nThey even say their thesis rests on a fabled fed pivot when without fail every single week every single fed board member has been telling the market a pivot is not going to happen. \n\nGetting real 2007 early 2008 era \u201cthe federal reserve is not currently forecasting a recession\u201d and \u201cthe us economy has a strong labour force, excellent productivity and technology, and a deep liquid financial market that is in the process of repairing it\u201d vibes from this forecast", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I've gone back on archives and looked at CNN in 2007-2009 and a recession was 100% predicted.

Inflation had peaked per CPI as I expected coming in a 8.3% vs. 8.5% previous, however, market honed in on year over year and month over month core. Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some\u2026 this is why plays like that should be small in size. \n\nThe worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast\u2026 the psyops continue. \n\nAnyways moving on!

This morning markets realized inflation did not peak (per core), the 75bps rate hike might not be enough to fight inflation so a 100bps hike could be needed, and they are also accepting more and more that a soft landing is not going to happen. \n\nMarkets are not in a rock and a hard place. They were previously rallying on news that few were going to pivot (July to august run) and then Jackson hole slapped markets to reality that was not going to happen. However, markets were feeling pretty bullish going into this CPI. Now that markets realize there is nothing to be bullish about this is where things get interesting. \n\nIs this the start of a capitulation like sell off we saw in June around that CPI (remember it dropped 10.3% in 3 days) or was this a massive market over-reaction to a potential 100bps rate hike that was not even mentioned to begin with? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xg2fd3fyton91.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff1a3b52ce9ad7e5c32a7d777b5deb92997d8066\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olcyivwyton91.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=d107a4730e71ec34fe9c097aabec05a8b4af2fef\n\nToday we broke down and opened below the 405.2 daily resistance level and didn\u2019t quite make it to that 390 level. We have not broken back below the red dotted support line using the June low and sept 6th low for support. \n\nWe are looking at a potential blue bear channel which gives EOW support near 380 (-3.4%) or the black bear channel which gives a deeper sell off of 362 (-8%). \n\nThe one thing that is for sure is that we broke through the v shaped recovery support and the next major support test comes at 390.5. This is where I suspect if the bulls are going to put up a fight that it happens. However, if we are to close a candle in the 380s tomorrow or later this week then it would appear we could be in a bigger sell off until FOMC. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 391.1 -> 390.5 -> 388.5 -> 386.8 -> 382 -> 368.3\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 395.3 -> 400.4 -> 402\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1ysjgzton91.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f47e77e7e570fe7b04635df99b4084d825b8e14\n\nSPY weekly is starting to show more and more of this current black weekly downward channel. Key support comes at 390.4 and 380. With key resistance at 412.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gisefqzzton91.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=e46117a0f4d543c3c0e2a3e8eac88561e874f11f\n\nLooking at the futures daily ES candle this is a 3 day long bearish engulfing candle. Pretty impressive regardless of what side you ended up on today. \n\nBlack bear channel gives EOW support at 3620 while blue bear support comes in more mildly at 3825.\n\nKey supports tomorrow- 3908 -> 3867 -> 3840 -> 3830\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 3980 -> 4025 -> 4060\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzxgstj0uon91.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6ab9ccd644d780d05669bd2be0fd58599bf5de\n\nFutures weekly in a nice downward channel but same thing its not breached its weekly support recovery line yet. \n\nKey support- 3900 -> 3827 -> 3676\n\nKey resistance- 4025 -> 4100 -> 4160\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn37r131uon91.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e4fc9fd78aad88ebfb6962e06636bdf593d417\n\nApple with a pretty incredible breakdown today hitting -6% briefly at points. The biggest take away on Apple is that it did break through its red dotted support line from the June recovery. In addition it closed back below the daily 200ema and closed lower then any of the candles last week during the sell off. \n\nBlack bear support line comes in at 139 and blue bear support comes in at 148 for the EOW potential targets. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 151.5 -> 148.7 -> 149.4 -> 147\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 157.4 -> 159.9\n\nUnlike SPY (thanks to apples huge 4% day yesterday) there is no gap left on the daily chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1y0t7km1uon91.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=61cb2a0add86a0d1831cc3cbc85a4e61cd0967d3\n\nIn terms of bearish and clean looking charts this apple weakly chart does look extremely clear in what trend we are clearly in with a break in the weekly support line. \n\nKey support- 150.2 -> 148.8\n\nKey resistance- 157.5 -> 161\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgw37j52uon91.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2c9cdbbe1cb56c3092a22a940fcef3ce2d07ca\n\nThe VIX is where things are going to get a little interesting. You can see how many times we have found ourselves over this 26.9 level but unable to push any higher. There is an obvious reason to suspect we are still in a bullish channel up on the VIX, however, previous to today that channel was breaking down and we were trending clearly back under 25.5. \n\nWhile a 14.33% green move on the VIX is big when we look at other VIX days from this year we have plenty of 20%+ moves on the VIX. There was even part of the day today where the vix showed weakness and had even broke back below 25.5 before the EOD push up on the VIX and down on SPY.\n\nKey level to watch tomorrow for the VIX is 28.3 and 26.8. I am wondering with how disconnect the VIX has been from reality and the markets since really the June lows if we could see a major sell off on the markets without getting the vix back to 35-40. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsm9kmr2uon91.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec8177b4bd3ed9c28b51d011ea2b9512800f799\n\nYes my call was worthless\u2026 yes it sucked.
