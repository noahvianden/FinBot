Depending on your marginal tax rate, this tax asset could be quite valuable. It may also allow you to realize large gains in the future without having to pay much or any tax (the realized losses would partially or fully offset the realized gains, and of course, return of capital is tax-free). \n\nIt may also help to keep in mind that shares represent an ownership stake in a real business which, like a farm, or an apartment complex, or a local McDonald's franchise, produces income year after year, and sends you a check representing your share of the profits. Some years are good and some are bad, but so long as the business produces a profit - even if it is lower than last year's - some portion of that is yours to keep. In most cases, one doesn't sell an otherwise-productive farm simply because the value of the real estate it's on went down, or because drought rendered the crop unusually sparse for the year. You might think of equity ownership in a similar way. \n\nTax-loss harvesting, as described above, is simply a house-keeping chore you can perform in taxable accounts to create a tax asset while maintaining your equity stake. It's less about selling for the sake of cashing out, and more about exchanging one equity position for a similar-but-not-identical equity position with similar performance in order to realize losses that can lower you tax burden or offset gains elsewhere in the portfolio.

It walked off with someone, and that someone is the shorts. When they say shorting provides liquidity they mean it provides liquidity to the bank accounts of the shorts.\n\nAnd hey.....if they do get caught on the wrong side of the trade they can just turn off buying for retail right? Of course they will still be able to trade, even during halts.
