They will both sell as many as they can make for a long time. Don't stress about this.\n* The biggest concern for the Cyber Truck ramp (and indeed the Giga Texas ramp in general) is the 4680 battery process. **This is the biggest indicator for 2023 ramping speed**. Tesla has promised they will achieve this - matter of when, not if - but until it is achieved, Tesla is kneecapped on Texas Model Y, Semi, and Cyber Truck. \n* E-Transit and Rivian vans both continue to be slow to ramp, although to my knowledge Rivian doesn't break out production by vehicle type.

Right now, *we don't know for sure* \u2014 though my own take at this time is that it's hard to imagine they're losing any money at all with the Mach-E when a GT model costs $71K.\n\nSome stuff we certainly *do know:*\n\n* Commoditization (supply chain development) is happening quickly. The Mach-E and Lightning are *already* products of supply chain thinking. Cells from LG and SK. Packs from Magna. Motors from BorgWarner. It won't be long before we hit full commodity \u2014\u00a0you can already buy *dozens of designs* in China which are basic assemblies of parts from CATL, Nidec, and Continental, like just about everything coming from GAC AION. Tesla already gets components from Aptiv, EnFlex, Faurecia, and ZF, including EV components.\n* Ford already has their \"first EV facility\". Cuautitl\u00e1n is already that facility. It did not take them long to transition. Most of the rest of their facilities (BlueOvalCity notwithstanding) will simply transition just like Volkswagen's Zwickau, Renault's Douai, or Tesla's Fremont. There's no need to build from the ground up like Austin, so timeline comparisons to that facility are silly stuff.\n* Other OEMs (who are ostensibly in similar positions to Ford) seem confident enough in their profitability that they are expanding. Renault today announced they're bringing their EV lineup to Latin America \u2014 a region where there are no fleet emissions regulations or incentives driving supply \u2014 a big step.\n\nSome additional thoughts on my end: \n\n* Software and services are a dead end. A race to the bottom. Bandwidth costs are asymptotically approaching nothing, and no one is buying apps for their car. Kids will keep playing Minecraft on their phones \u2014 none of that revenue is heading to an automotive OEM, despite their lofty dreams. \n* Platforms are probably the biggest problem for Ford right now, but a double-edged sword, because being late can actually be good for them.

{"title": "The US stock market will not just keep going up. You\u2019re being lied to.", "selftext": "So all your life you\u2019ve been told to invest long term and keep throwing money at VOO in your 401k in hopes that you\u2019ll have enough when you\u2019re 65 to retire. \n\nIf you\u2019re like me and in your early 20s, this is terrible advice. Our parents and grandparents had the ability to invest in the quickest growth in human history. Think about that. Just because the last 50 years have been insane growth doesn\u2019t mean the future will be. The economy will either be stagnant or lower in the future. \n\nIf you follow Elon Musk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen his take on [underpopulation](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1563020169160851456?s=46&t=UWWtwmwjDeA2twRazq5H3Q)\n\nHere\u2019s a excellent video where he talks about [it too](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRPQnBLa/)\n\n\n\nYou may be thinking \u201cHE JUST WANTS MORE WORKERS! HE IS A RICH BILLIONAIRE DONT LISTEN TO ELON\u201d\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you listen to Elon, or at least be curious to see if he\u2019s right? Well let\u2019s take a look. \n\nLong term, the [fertility rate](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/fertility-rate) has been steadily going down. So has the [marriage rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195951/marriage-rate-in-the-united-states-since-1990/).\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at population by generation. [Almost 90 million old people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/797321/us-population-by-generation/). \n\nThe last statistic I want to bring up is that 30% of men ages 18-30 are not having sex. [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/)\n\nThis means less and less younger people are getting married and having kids. Young men 18-30 who are not having sex won\u2019t suddenly get married and start having kids. This will translate into a worse economy in the next 20-40 years. When the millennials and gen Z are older, we will literally not have enough young workers to keep the economy going. My prediction is the next great crash in the mid 21st century will be due to an underpopulated society. \n\nThese are all indicators of a slowing society. It\u2019s not good for your long term portfolio. A healthy society would be raising children and keeping the family unit alive. \n\nThe only counter argument people have is that immigration will solve this. Sadly you couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. We get maybe 1 million [people a year](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/) immigrating to the USA. \n\nLess people means less innovation, less growth, and a slower economy. It\u2019s going to be a rapid decline. I don\u2019t want to say 2021 will be the peak of the market forever, but we\u2019ll see.\n\nWall Street bettors who win will be the richest. Short term/medium traders will be the winners in the long term.\n\nSouth Korea is already [paying people triple to have kids](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-31/korea-to-triple-baby-payments-in-bid-to-tackle-fertility-crisis).
