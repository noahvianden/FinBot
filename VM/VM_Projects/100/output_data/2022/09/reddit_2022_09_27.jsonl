{"title": "Analysts at mutual fund Vanguard says there is a 25% chance that the U.S. will drop into a full-blown recession sometime during the next 12 months, and some time during the next 24 months at 65 chance%. Do you agree?", "selftext": " Analysts at the mutual fund giant Vanguard estimate the likelihood that the U.S. will drop into a full-blown recession sometime during the next 12 months at 25%, and some time during the next 24 months at 65%.\n\nThe Vanguard analysts aren\u2019t alone.\n\nA SmartAsset survey of nearly 300 financial advisors taken in early August found that 80% believe the U.S. either is already in a recession or will enter one during the next 12 months. A rough rule of thumb to define an economy in recession is when it records two straight quarters of declining economic growth. For the second quarter of 2022, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.9% after a contraction of 1.6% for the first quarter.\n\nBut many believe it takes more than just negative growth to constitute a recession.\n\nOther factors also are part of whether an economy is in a recession. They includes employment, which has remained high despite the GDP figures, with a jobless rate of 3.7% for August, a level well below the 5% unemployment rate economists have traditionally considered full employment. In addition to adding more than half a million jobs, inflation stalled between June and July. Since then, gas prices have fallen, housing prices have dropped and consumer spending has remained strong.\n\nEven with those signs of improvement, prices are remain higher than before the pandemic. Even if inflation disappeared tomorrow \u2013 dropping to 0% for the rest of the year \u2013 the inflation rate for December would be 6.5%. That\u2019s unlikely, so the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee is expected to keep upping interest rates. Right now, another hike of at least 50 (0.50%) or 75 (0.75%) basis points is set for this week, with more increases continuing into 2023.\n\nThe Vanguard analysts wrote that they expect the Federal Reserve to increase its federal funds rate target to a range of 3.25%\u20133.75% by the end of the year, which will increase rates on mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other consumer and business borrowing. The aim is to reduce the amount of available money in the economy in order to lower demand for goods and services, resulting in lower prices to bring inflation down.\n\nFull article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-says-theres-65-chance-155559181.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-says-theres-65-chance-155559181.html)", "id": "xpfnot", "created_utc": 1664282321.0, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "lol.
