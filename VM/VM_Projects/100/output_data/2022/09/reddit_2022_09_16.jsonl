{"title": "Scott's Miracle Gro is in big trouble: CEO - \"I love working, but this isn\u2019t exactly the s\u2014hole I was planning to live in\"", "selftext": "Never in the modern global economy have businesses seen such a rapid shift from shortage to glut.\n\nJim Hagedorn says he is lucky it didn\u2019t get him fired.\n\nJust months ago, the chief executive of Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. SMG -4.94%\u25bc was bracing for the biggest summer ever. After two years of struggling to fill store shelves, the company had ramped up production to catch up with consumer demand for lawn seed, fertilizer and other garden products. Investments in new manufacturing capacity were paying off as the 67-year-old CEO prepared for the usual rush of May orders from retailers looking to replenish their stocks.\n\nThe orders never came, and by Memorial Day, Mr. Hagedorn knew his company was in trouble. Scotts has already cut about 450 jobs, or around 6% of its workforce, since May, and more layoffs are coming. Manufacturing plants have been slowed. Cash is dwindling. Nobody is getting bonuses. Instead, the company is in full-blown crisis mode.\n\n\u201cI love working, but this isn\u2019t exactly the s\u2014hole I was planning to live in toward the end of my career, working my way out of a goddamn latrine,\u201d Mr. Hagedorn said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it is and that\u2019s where I am.\u201d\n\nVersions of this story are playing out across business sectors, where makers of everything from clothing to kitchen appliances have gone from trying to catch up to demand to buckling under the weight of their own inventory, in a matter of weeks. Now many companies are cutting jobs, idling plants and working to undo many of the other steps they took to ensure they would have enough products to sell.\n\nScotts, Mr. Hagedorn said, was largely a casualty of bloated inventory at big retailers like Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. Those companies didn\u2019t foresee the sharp reversal in buying behavior that has taken place in recent months as shoppers, squeezed by inflation, cut back on furniture, electronics and other goods and shifted spending to travel, food and fuel.\n\n\nNewell Brands Inc., the maker of Yankee candles and Sharpie markers, said that in a span of six weeks starting in early August, it went from being comfortable with its retailer stocks to cutting its sales and cash-flow forecasts for the year after chains slashed orders. \u201cA number of our top retailers have chosen to make a more dramatic inventory reduction certainly than we expected,\u201d Christopher Peterson, the chief financial officer, said at an investor conference this month.\n\nScotts was in the middle of its active selling season when Covid-19 shut down much of the global economy. Early in the pandemic, the company\u2019s manufacturing operations were deemed essential because fertilizer is important to the food supply and most retail stores that sold such products also remained open.\n\nProduction was chaotic. Scotts began paying workers a 50% premium, but entire shifts would typically be sent home if someone got sick. Scotts changed from three eight-hour shifts to two 12-hour shifts to use available workers as much as possible.\n\nIt soon became clear that homebound families or those fleeing cities would garden more than ever before. Stores had already been stocked for spring when Covid-19 arrived, but keeping shelves filled soon became a problem. When the quarter closed at the end of June 2020, sales in the consumer business, which make up around two-thirds of the company\u2019s total revenue, were up more than 20%. Empty shelves indicated Scotts could have sold even more.\n\n\u201cOur best guess is that we missed about $200 million in sales because we just couldn\u2019t deliver,\u201d Mr. Hagedorn said. \u201cWe picked up 10 years of growth in a year, that first year of Covid.\u201d\n\nScotts typically builds inventory in the fall and winter in preparation for spring, its peak season. More than three quarters of sales in the North America consumer business come in the first six months of the calendar year.\n\nBy the next spring, in April 2021, Mr. Hagedorn told investors that the rapid sales growth meant inventory was below an acceptable level, which meant leaving sales on the table and frustrating retailers. Still, consumer sales rose more than 10% in fiscal 2021, which ended Sept. 30.\n\nMeanwhile, Scotts had been investing rapidly in a multiyear project to expand production\u2014a major shift from the conservative, slow-and-steady model it had held for decades. Its Marysville, Ohio, headquarters, where Scotts was founded in 1868, got upgraded packaging and processing equipment, along with new control systems. In other facilities, Scotts added new equipment, including expanding the capabilities of some locations with new mixing lines.\n\nCapital expenditure in the consumer business almost doubled to $52 million in 2020 and rose to $78 million in 2021, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBy November 2021, the company\u2019s chief financial officer assured investors Scotts was in a good place on inventory. The company set conservative expectations for 2022, forecasting that consumer unit sales would fall because of strong year-ago comparisons, but that price increases would offset the decline. At the end of December, total inventory was up 55% to $1.7 billion, almost doubling its pre-pandemic level.\n\nIn early May, when Scotts delivered its fiscal second-quarter results, it said spring rain had clipped some sales, but that consumer demand was strong. The company was optimistic that the usual parade of May reorders would come but warned that it might have excess inventory.\n\nBy the middle of the month, it was becoming clear those orders weren\u2019t coming.\n\nClearing the aisles\nScotts asked stores why they reduced orders and learned they planned to carry lighter stock.\n\nThey had stocked up on merchandise of all sorts before realizing that consumer spending patterns shifted as the pandemic eased, leaving them with bloated inventory that would take months to whittle down. So instead of having large piles of fertilizer at the front of the stores or aisle ends, the stores wanted to use that space to clear out other merchandise. Scotts said there was no warning that the order change was coming.\n\nRetailer orders were more than $300 million below expectations for May. \u201cBy Memorial Day, it was like, turn everything off immediately. We need to preserve money,\u201d Mr. Hagedorn said.\n\nThe big jump in inventory tied up cash\u2014as of the end of June, Scotts had just $28 million in cash, down from $244 million at the same time last year.\n\nOver the summer, the company has slowed some manufacturing, closed some distribution centers and made changes to other facilities to make them more flexible to demand. A lighting manufacturing facility from Washington state was merged into an existing plant in California. If needed, workers there can now work on lighting fixtures for half a day and then spend the other half assembling lawn seed spreaders.\n\nThe existing fertilizer inventory won\u2019t spoil so it can be sold off into next season, and the company doesn\u2019t plan to cut prices to move it.\n\nMr. Hagedorn has pledged that more job cuts are coming, and along with the cuts that began in May the company hasn\u2019t filled open positions.\n\n\u201cWe are tightening our belts severely,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m probably overcorrecting.\u201d\n\nThird-quarter results in early August showed a bleak outlook\u2014consumer sales for the year were now expected to be down 8% to 9%.\n\nScotts also reported a net loss related to its nonconsumer business, which is mostly made up of its Hawthorne segment. The unit sells equipment and supplies for the cannabis growing industry. Scotts bought up smaller companies for years and saw rapid sales growth, but expects revenue to drop this year because of what it calls market saturation.\n\nScotts is using fiscal 2019 as a rough guide for budgeting and financial planning, Mr. Hagedorn said, and rethinking its strategy in the face of inflation and the risk of recession.\n\nIt\u2019s stockpiling some raw materials to hedge against price increases. A ton of urea, the basic building block of fertilizer, has been costing around $500, down from $900 earlier this year but twice the $250 it cost at the beginning of the pandemic. Analysts are warning that natural-gas shortages in Europe could cause urea prices to spike again, so Scotts has been buying as much as it can. It has set up a temporary rail yard near its Marysville headquarters to hold cargo cars full of urea.\n\nScotts\u2019 shares, around $120 just before the pandemic, are now trading around $56\u2014after peaking at more than $250 in March 2021.\n\n\u201cOur ability to absorb a lot of shots in the business is very high,\u201d Mr. Hagedorn said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, when everything goes against you, it eats you alive.\u201d\n\nFamily business\nMr. Hagedorn joined the family business in 1987 after seven years of flying F-16s in the Air Force. His father, Horace, had co-founded Miracle-Gro in the 1950s, and the plant-food company quickly capitalized on the surging demand for garden products that came with the post-World War II home-building boom. He sold his business to Scotts Co. for $200 million in 1995 in a deal that made the Hagedorns the largest shareholders of the combined company. Six years later, Jim Hagedorn was named CEO.\n\nBlunt and loud, Mr. Hagedorn has a bald head, gray goatee and salty tongue. He speaks fast, prefers video calls instead of the phone and regularly walks around headquarters talking to employees.\n\nThree times a week, he wakes at 3 a.m. and flies his own plane from the East Coast to the Marysville offices. After hitting the gym, he is in the office by 7:30 a.m., usually with his German shepherds, who join him in the plane. The dogs roam the office, and some workers keep treats for them on their desks.\n\nThe Hagedorn family controls more than 25% of the company\u2019s shares. Mr. Hagedorn\u2019s sister, Katherine, sits on the board, his son Christopher is a division president and his son Nicholas works as a government-affairs analyst.\n\nRaymond James analyst Joe Altobello said Scotts could have done a better job of forecasting and that it was slow to respond. While the drop in consumer sales by unit was \u201cpretty much what we expected coming into this year,\u201d the fact that retailers weren\u2019t reordering \u201cwas the big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got caught flat-footed.\u201d\n\nScotts said its forecasts were accurate until a sudden shift in retailer orders in late April and early May.\n\n\nThe warehouse at Scotts. \u2018By Memorial Day, it was like, turn everything off immediately. We need to preserve money,\u2019 said Mr. Hagedorn.\n\nScotts\u2019 decision to produce so much inventory at a time when retailers were overstocked with durable goods may have made it easier for the retailers to reduce their orders, said Andrew Carter, analyst with Stifel, an investment bank. Big-ticket items like grills take longer to sell down, he said, but lawn and garden goods should move faster.\n\nIf the retailers know that Scotts can quickly resupply them, it makes sense to carry fewer weeks of that inventory. \u201cThey put themselves in a position where they were a pretty easy target,\u201d Mr. Carter said.\n\nScotts promotes three-day delivery as part of its sales pitch to big retailers.\n\nLast month, Walmart, Target and Home Depot reported their collective second-quarter inventory jumped $20 billion from a year ago, meaning the stores are still working to sell their current stock.\n\nHome Depot and Lowes Cos., which together accounted for about 40% of Scotts\u2019 fiscal 2021 sales, also said last month that the weather in many parts of the country reduced demand for products like fertilizer, which had been one of the biggest sales categories in the previous two years.\n\n\nIn late August, Scotts said full-year cash flow would be negative $275 million to $325 million, compared with a projection of negative $150 million in early August. The company also disclosed that its finance chief, Cory Miller, had left the company. Board member David Evans took the interim role as it seeks external candidates for a replacement.\n\nMr. Hagedorn wants the company to get back to its roots.\n\nOn this office wall there is a framed 1996 article from The Wall Street Journal about the family\u2019s takeover and their \u201cremolding Scotts to reflect their own thrifty, entrepreneurial ways.\u201d He said his current mission to cut costs and keep the company leaner in terms of inventory and debt is to return to those ways.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/scotts-miracle-gro-shortage-glut-inventory-fertilizer-11663261193?mod=hp_lead_pos5", "id": "xfchct", "created_utc": 1663287880.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "When the basics like utilities, rent, and food have radically increased in price then I sure as hell don\u2019t give a crap about whether my lawn is green.", "score": 164, "replies": [{"body": "This \ud83d\udcaf.
