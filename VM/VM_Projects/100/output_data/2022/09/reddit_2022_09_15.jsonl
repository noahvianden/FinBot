{"title": "Expert says railroad worker strike would 'devastate' economy", "selftext": "FOX 2\u00a0-\u00a0Less than 48 hours away from a possible railroad strike and there\u2019s another casualty involving passenger train travel. Amtrak announced it\u2019s canceled all long-distance travel starting Thursday, \u00a0which includes trips to Chicago and Miami.\n\nIt\u2019s because some of the Amtrak traffic relies on tracks owned by Freight Railroads.\n\n\"I think that there\u2019s an effort right now, on part of the workers, they see there\u2019s a shortage of workers. we have had high inflation,\" said Janell Townsend, Oakland University. \"This is an opportunity for them to make a stand.\"\n\nOut of the 12 unions, nine have tentative deals with the US Freight Railroads. The three unions still at the bargaining table would like better pay, better work schedules, and more time off.\n\nIf a deal isn\u2019t reached by Friday, some union workers said they\u2019d go on strike.\n\nTownsend, the chair of OU\u2019s managing and marketing department, spoke about what the fallout could be.\n\n\"If the railroad workers go on strike on Friday, it will be devastating to the economy,\" she said. \"Because there is so much of our freight that goes through the rail system; especially in the business-to-business background, that we don\u2019t see.\"\n\nTo put the strike into perspective, look at how freight trains impact some our favorite foods. The Association of American Railroads says one rail car carries enough wheat for 280,000 loaves of bread, enough corn for 480,000 bags of Fritos.\n\nAnd the impact of a potential strike doesn\u2019t end with this - it could impact the beer we drink, thousands of car parts, and many of the things we buy in stores.\n\nBut before any of us panic buys, listen to this:\n\nFOX 2: \"If I\u2019m at home, and have my family with me, this isn\u2019t a situation where I need to run to the grocery store or pick up something right away, right?\"\n\n\"No. I don\u2019t anticipate it being an immediate situation,\" she said. \"It\u2019s highly unlikely this will last very long. the reason being is that the federal government will step in and will require some terms to be met.\"\n\nProfessor Townsend says the president or Congress could use emergency powers to step in and resolve a potentially catastrophic blow to the US supply chain.\n\nSource: https//www.fox2detroit.com/news/expert-says-railroad-worker-strike-would-devastate-economy", "id": "xek4gw", "created_utc": 1663207488.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|104|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|31|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xek4gw)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xek4gw)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11201810091733932}, {"body": "We could build a massive hill and roll goods and services down the hill in carts across the us.
