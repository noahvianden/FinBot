{"title": "My Full Plan for this Week (5 Earnings Plays, 2 Economic Events, 4 Stocks & 1 Lotto 10x Play)", "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)\n\nI'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:\n\n1. Earnings\n2. Major Economic Events\n3. My Watchlist\n4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play\n\nThere  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading\n\nOk so let's get this show on the road\n\n**Earnings this week that I will play**\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow i play earnings:\n\n* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don\u2019t  go over 5% size on any earning\u2019s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Tuesday 6 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - GitLabs - $GTLB\n\n* DevOps software company\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.23) & Revenue $94m\n* Unusual Options: trade of 2500 $75c 12/10 in August nothing notable recently\n* Options pricing in a 16% move on earnings\n* $JPM downgrade knocked it down 18%, could be dropped to grab shares before a great earnings call, or could be something else.\n* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)\n* My play: 09sep 49c it has massive potential to run if they beat, going with calls flow looks pretty bullish\n\n**Wednesday 7 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - NIO inc - $NIO:\n\n* EV car manufacturer\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 6:00 am EST\n* Estimate eps ($0.17) & revenue $1.45b\n* Unusual Options: trade of 9000 19c 09/09 expiry, on Friday.\n* Options pricing in a 10% move on earnings\n* On the latest delivery report, $NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August 2022, an increase of 81.6% YoY\n* They won't be affected by the chip ban, and are no longer in danger of delisting\n* My Play: $18c 9 Sep, following the options flow on this one, I think guidance will be good on this one\n\nAfter Close - Gamestop - $GME\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.41) & Revenue $1.27B\n* Unusual Options: trade of 7600 $20p 09/16 expiry in aug but nothing recent yet.\n* Options pricing in a 15.0% move on earnings\n* NFT  marketplace not making money, no major games or studio deals last  quarter, consoles sales slightly declining and Ryan Cohen screwed folks  on $BBBY\n* My Play: $24p 09sep, don't see how this one doesn't miss\n\n**Thursday 8 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - Docusign - $DOCU\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 & Revenue $602m\n* Unusual option: trade of  $65p 16/12 worth $3,792,570 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 19.8% move on earnings\n* Charts and options chains are screaming bearish on this one massive put block getting bought last week\n* My Play: $53p 09 Sep, gonna go with the flow here\n\n**Friday 9 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - Kroger - $KR\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 & Revenue $602m\n* Unusual Option: trade of  $48p 09/09 worth $577,500 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 7% move on earnings\n* My Play: $49c 09sep, $WMT, and $HD beat, I'm going against the flow here and going for calls following them\n\nSo  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only\n\n**Major Economic events this week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqjdjjif04m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3aa440a8c327e58887e2d1d141bab0767b35b55\n\nSo  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have\n\nTuesday\n\n10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug\n\nWednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July\n\n12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech\n\nThursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech\n\nFriday\n\n10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories\n\n12:30 - Fed Walker Speech\n\nAs  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.\n\nMarket  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $ETH  has been channeling between $1700 and $1420 for the past week, I will  looking for a break of the channel either way for the position, till  that happens we can scalp within the range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/604ru4hg04m91.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6e9e87326dd21d474096de1711815ff8023442\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ieni1q8h04m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=85453d8dbdac1b28296d4df076c3fa67d3ab835d\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij6qhjzh04m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb51178430044fc682960729dc1e04c3cbcc0d8\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syeuqopi04m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=9038e92159a29baa9cc51e993dcde163eaa636de\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!", "id": "x6s3zs", "created_utc": 1662413906.0, "score": 410, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Love this idea and format, looking forward to following along if you continue.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you kind sir, will 100% continue as long as you guys and gals like this", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Should post an end of week summary/conclusion as well!", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3382800817489624}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5795188546180725}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13871799409389496}, {"body": "Actual DD that isn\u2019t conspiracy focused nor penned by someone with an IQ < 50?!?

{"title": "My Full Plan for this Week (5 Earnings Plays, 2 Economic Events, 4 Stocks & 1 Lotto 10x Play)", "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)\n\nI'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:\n\n1. Earnings\n2. Major Economic Events\n3. My Watchlist\n4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play\n\nThere  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading\n\nOk so let's get this show on the road\n\n**Earnings this week that I will play**\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow i play earnings:\n\n* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don\u2019t  go over 5% size on any earning\u2019s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Tuesday 6 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - GitLabs - $GTLB\n\n* DevOps software company\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.23) & Revenue $94m\n* Unusual Options: trade of 2500 $75c 12/10 in August nothing notable recently\n* Options pricing in a 16% move on earnings\n* $JPM downgrade knocked it down 18%, could be dropped to grab shares before a great earnings call, or could be something else.\n* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)\n* My play: 09sep 49c it has massive potential to run if they beat, going with calls flow looks pretty bullish\n\n**Wednesday 7 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - NIO inc - $NIO:\n\n* EV car manufacturer\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 6:00 am EST\n* Estimate eps ($0.17) & revenue $1.45b\n* Unusual Options: trade of 9000 19c 09/09 expiry, on Friday.\n* Options pricing in a 10% move on earnings\n* On the latest delivery report, $NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August 2022, an increase of 81.6% YoY\n* They won't be affected by the chip ban, and are no longer in danger of delisting\n* My Play: $18c 9 Sep, following the options flow on this one, I think guidance will be good on this one\n\nAfter Close - Gamestop - $GME\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.41) & Revenue $1.27B\n* Unusual Options: trade of 7600 $20p 09/16 expiry in aug but nothing recent yet.\n* Options pricing in a 15.0% move on earnings\n* NFT  marketplace not making money, no major games or studio deals last  quarter, consoles sales slightly declining and Ryan Cohen screwed folks  on $BBBY\n* My Play: $24p 09sep, don't see how this one doesn't miss\n\n**Thursday 8 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - Docusign - $DOCU\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 & Revenue $602m\n* Unusual option: trade of  $65p 16/12 worth $3,792,570 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 19.8% move on earnings\n* Charts and options chains are screaming bearish on this one massive put block getting bought last week\n* My Play: $53p 09 Sep, gonna go with the flow here\n\n**Friday 9 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - Kroger - $KR\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 & Revenue $602m\n* Unusual Option: trade of  $48p 09/09 worth $577,500 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 7% move on earnings\n* My Play: $49c 09sep, $WMT, and $HD beat, I'm going against the flow here and going for calls following them\n\nSo  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only\n\n**Major Economic events this week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqgg3wooz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cbe5492878cfebe6c452aeda9fd851dd42d08d2\n\nSo  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have\n\nTuesday\n\n10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug\n\nWednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July\n\n12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech\n\nThursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech\n\nFriday\n\n10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories\n\n12:30 - Fed Walker Speech\n\nAs  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.\n\nMarket  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!", "id": "x6s01x", "created_utc": 1662413634.0, "score": 343, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x6s01x)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x6s01x)\n    \nHey /u/Flimsy-Willow-3086, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10987527668476105}, {"body": "FYI: GTLB is Gitlab not GitHub labs.
