You've only presented a war criminal, and the media outlet he used to lie in order to start wars, making claims with 0 evidence. Someone saying something is not proof. Just like when the Clinton Campaign hired people to make up the fake Russia gate caims, then lie to the FBI about its origins, in order to convince the public their campaign opponent really worked for the Russians lol. They said it over and over, yet the fbi, and courts forced them to admit they made it up. I'm starting to believe you don't know what evidence, proof, or facts are. \n\n\n\"It's not OK be factually ignorant\" coming from the person still pushing Russia gate in 2022 lol.

{"title": "Do Not Fight The Fed - Warning/Education", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been a while since I wrote a post for Wallstreetbets. I thought given yesterday's FOMC meeting that it was a good idea to do so. I see a lot of you posting loss porn from failed call positions and I see an abundance of suggestions to continue buying Memestocks. You can buy whatever you want, but I am going to take a moment to say something.\n\n[Don't fight the fed](https://preview.redd.it/mfwcwr64thp91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63df8cc6f06a6c9441bf3b37cd2934d850bc42cf)\n\nStop fighting the Fed.\n\nYes, you, with your far OTM positions in calls on a company with a huge debt-to-equity ratio. You're taking a massive, massive risk. It is not the same risk you took in 2020 or 2021. Most of r/wallstreetbets has joined the sub since the pandemic crash. A lot of you are very young. I respect your interest in investing, trading, and looking for a fat gain, but you're in a different world. That should have been apparent over the past 6-9 months.\n\nThis is what a bear market looks like. This is how it feels. You can probably feel it in the back of your mind, the rough psychology of the market and how 'hope' of rallys and reversals are slowly getting ground out of you and everyone else. That's what investors/traders mean when they say \"Feels like a bear market\". It's an excruciating psychological process that's at work.\n\nOn the way up, thousands here chanted \"Do not fight the Fed!\" to every bear in town. Well, the fed is raising rates--fast, hard, and without mercy. The mantra is still true. When the Fed is EASING, you do not fight the fed and you follow the liquidity. You go for calls. When the Fed is TIGHTENING, you either 1) sit it out with a bundle of cash (Rich people strategy 101) and wait for a slaughter or 2) You move with the Fed and you short/buy puts.\n\nThat's the name of the game. You do not fight the Fed. They are far more powerful than you and all of us combined. They are more powerful than all of Wall Street to boot and nothing can stop them. They are an independent institution.\n\nPowell was **EXTREMELY** clear that they will not stop until they break the back of inflation and can see it laying dead-still on the mat. He's reiterating a lot of Volcker's language, \"Keep at it\". Look it up. If you want to know what's going on. That's the best analogy you've got in this.\n\nWhy do rates matter? Well, as you can guess it affects credit card debt, housing debt, and a multitude of other things. So why does it hit your memestocks? Because they eventually **have to refinance their debt and their payments will balloon. This is why they get shorted into the ground.**\n\nWhen the tide goes out, you will see who's skinny dipping. With the fed accelerating their balance sheet run off, that tide (liquidity) is being sucked out of the market. Everything will seem 'ok' until suddenly it gets very shallow, and then it's too late. Illiquid markets are extremely volatile and not in favor of bulls chasing green candles. Take a look at low market cap cryptos and how they trade. That's a prime example of how bad liquidity can lead to horrendous outcomes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"but we're almost back to the june lows! It's a perfect entry!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt isn't. In fact it could be one of the worst entries. When you're in a long decline, the longer trend is more likely to beat the shorter one. Now that we've been defeated at SPY 400-410, we're coming down to 367 with **momentum**. It will bounce and skid probably, but the odds are in the bears favor for it to break. This is where the 3300 estimates are coming from. The 3300 mark is from the much older trend of the entire market, but be warned...\n\nWe will overshoot.\n\n>Everything is still very expensive. We could lose a lot more. Historically our PE for SPY is 14.9-15.98. We're sitting around 19 right now. Chances are when we bottom we will go under the mean, maybe 12-13ish. The market could lose another 20-30% and still be within a normal bear market.\n\nWe overshot to the upside, we will overshoot to the downside. I've traded bear markets before and it always happens. It's okay if you miss the bottom. It's not okay if you're leveraging in a bear market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Earnings Cuts are going to happen](https://preview.redd.it/j9eevdzpuhp91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe81d5720b3184eeff8dd7aeecdbbd83ecc8318a)\n\nHow does the next step down happen? Earnings cuts. Chances are someone will run us up into earnings, but these numbers are probably going to disappoint. Either this quarter, or next. You've already seen a slew of headlines of companies not offering guidance or preannouncing bad results. Looking at you FedEx (who also just raised shipping costs by 7%, driving more inflation into the system).\n\n\"But how can you be so sure? The numbers aren't out yet.\" Because the fed released a forecast. Their higher interest rate is going to have to be added into a company's free cashflow. If your company has debt, it'll have to get re-financed. Those projections help them estimate how much that's going to cost. Therefore, if it's 'higher rates and for longer' then it's going to cost more to have that debt, leading to lower free cash flow.\n\nPlus interest rates to curb demand is a deflationary act. If prices drop on things, well, that cuts into a company's earnings. All that clearance at Target? You saw how that turned out. Cut their EPS in HALF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrade safe. Trade wisely. I am very tired of seeing all the loss porn on the front page. I am seeing notes of self harm that's greatly disturbing me. I wrote years ago to be careful with GME and to protect your mental health.\n\nA bear market could be even worse if you lose your money now. The fed is coming for jobs and savings. If you lose here, you could find that your source of money gets taken out too. Bear markets are god awful. I was job searching after 2008. It freaking sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, that's it. I hope some of you listen. I know this sub is bias'd to bulls, but hey, someone has got to talk to y'all. Please don't do anything that will seriously harm your life. This isn't a time to gamble. Sitting on the sideline is a perfectly good strategy in a bear market. Rich people pretty much run the \"sit and wait\" system their entire life for generations to build wealth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add, there's absolutely no reason the market can't retrace all of the pandemic. No reason at all. It happens all of the time in markets for there to be a 100% re-tracement. Keep that in your mind when you're looking at these companies.

Sony wants their own marketplace otherwise they wouldnt have built funded and continue to staff/improve the service. Sony and Xbox having their own marketplace is the driving factor of digital sales. And that number is growing larger every year as more and more people kick physical copies (not that I agree) why would Sony outsource their already built and established marketplace to a company that has no digital games marketplace and would have to build one from scratch and then gain market share. Maybe some peons at Sony aren't happy running a marketplace. \n\n>No one execpt FTX and ImmutableX\n\nGood I hope it works out for them, doubt it'll help them grab market share. Ftx and immutable aren't partnering to make GME better it's to enrich themselves with traffic and GME gets the scruples. \n\n>Nintendo codes that GameStop sells works very well. If only there was an e-commerce that could be trusted to streamline the whole process\n\nYes because most people will stop buying things on Nintendo store/PSS/XBOX market to go back to buying things at GME. Just not gonna happen. GME is probably sitting at the largest market share of all the things they sell and I doubt they will grow that. It'll probably shrink as again more people are moving away from buying physical copies and GME knows this, that's why they are now trying to sling NFTs like everyone and their dog. They wouldn't be adding so many different divisions if they weren't scrambling for a long term solution to their underlying problems. \n\nLike I said maybe I'll be wrong, only time will tell. At least GME has the foresight to try and pivot unlike the dinosaurs of the past.

That is not true! The thing is, you need to have the grounds to make reasonable, educated predictions about which companies will probably continue going down (and how much) vs. which companies will probably not go down a ton more. To \\*really\\* make educated predictions, you need to be good at reading and understanding lots of kinds of information that is out there, but a (very) quick and dirty list of things to look at are things like Price/Earnings, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow ratios. If these ratios are small and you don't have reasons to think the company is going to go bankrupt, other things being equal you probably shouldn't expect them to go down way further, so the risk of waiting may well be higher than the risk of buying now. If a company is down quite a bit but still has a very high P/E or P/S, other things being equal it's reasonable to predict that it's likely to continue going down for some time and potentially by quite a lot - so you are risking missing good prices, but you're making a reasonable decision if you decide to hold off in hopes of even better prices. \n\nKeep in mind, though, other things are never entirely equal. For example, what counts as \"reasonably small\" P/E or P/S ratios differs significantly by sector. If I was looking at stocks in industrials or basic materials and I saw a P/E of 20, I would consider that a very high ratio and would definitely wait on it even if it was down a good bit from its ATH. The same P/E in a tech stock would not worry me in the same way. On the other hand, the changes in interest rates we've seen and are likely to continue seeing for some time have hurt and likely will continue to hurt the tech sector more than many other sectors, so even if a tech stock is down a lot and has what seems like \"reasonably low for a tech stock\" ratios, there's still reason to think that it's not a good time to jump on that stock.\n\nIn the end, buying now is a risk and waiting until later is a risk. All you can do is try to be informed about specific stocks before investing in them. If you don't have the time/interest in really digging in to specific stocks, you're better off sticking to index funds or broad ETFs and the like, and then strike a balance between \"locking in good prices\" and \"waiting for better prices\" by putting some but definitely not all of your money in sooner rather than later, and then either regularly buying more shares when they go down or just setting a schedule for putting more money in them regardless of what their prices are doing that particular day (aka \"dollar-cost averaging\").", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s a lot of words for buy an ETF but maybe don\u2019t go all in just now.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Poster was asking for an explanation of \\*why\\* it is or isn't a good idea to keep waiting, not a simple recommendation of what to do.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2221411168575287}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3135949671268463}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.572486400604248}, {"body": "\"Predicted\" lol.
