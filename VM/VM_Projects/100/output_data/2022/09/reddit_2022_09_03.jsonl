It's almost half a year later and it's still at 8.5%. It's moving in the right direction but we have to remember: When we look at annual inflation, adding a month on one end and chopping a month from the beginning still leaves eleven months in the middle. If the Fed can lower inflation at the same pace at which it skyrocketed we're in for a full year of pain starting *today*.\n\nThis is what it means when you think about investing for the \"long term\". If you invested $1000 in the S&P at its peak in 2001, it would take 13 years to break even. If you invested the money halfway down, it would take 10 years to break even. And right now, valuations remain sky high.\n\nSo I'm not an oracle, but IDK how the fuck people think they can fight the fed for the next year. You gotta really beat the market just to do better than holding cash. Equities are going to tank because the Fed is determined to destroy them, no?\n\nHere's the thing: Even if the strongest growth companies priced at ridiculous valuations keep pace, that doesn't mean the market cap has to grow with them. These companies can keep growing while the share price shrinks to smaller multiples. This is what happened in the 70s: the airline industry took off, but investors lost heaps of cash trying to ride the wave.\n\nWhat planet are the bulls living on right now?

YoY inflation was 8.5% in March 2022. YoY inflation was also 8.5% in July 2022. So what was inflation between March 2022 and July 2022? Well, there's not enough information given to calculate that yet!

It's understandable, thinking about both MoM and YoY can be a bit tricky. Let me explain to you where you went wrong with an analogy.\n\nSuppose you've been unemployed for a year. It was really hard during this year. Because you had no income, you had to tighten your belt and control spending however you can. There were lots of hungry nights during this year.\n\nThen, in July of this year, you found a job that has an annual take-home salary of $36k. You are really good at budgeting and know that you need exactly $3000 a month to get all your needs met. So hooray! All is good again, your new job pays you exactly $3000 a month. You won't be going hungry anymore.\n\nBut wait a minute, you say. After you get your first monthly paycheck, you think to yourself, so I had $0 in salary for the last 11 months, and I just got paid $3000. That means For the past 12 months my annual salary was only $3000. How can I live on $3000 a year? That's only $250 a month! That's way below what I need, I have to tighten my belt again.\n\nYou see how this doesn't make sense? It's because you are looking at the wrong number! Once your situation has changed, and you are now taking home $3000 a month, you shouldn't be budgeting like you were making $3000 for a whole year. It makes more sense to budget as if you were making $36k a year, even though you won't have a full 12 months of earning at that rate until a whole year of employment has passed.", "score": 33, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "So...here's the thing, man.\n\nIf you're a long-term investor and you haven't cashed out yet, I think it's less than 50-50 whether cashing out is going to be worthwhile.
