The TLDR is that I wait for, very most often, very specific points to buy at and then take gains very quickly. Most often trend lines on the 5 min chart for scalps, enhanced by patterns, dojis, and some technicals/studies which is mostly MACD and stochastic slow, with some RSI/reverse RSI. \n\nI also only trade options with thin margins. XOM is a favorite, as it\u2019s spread is usually just like .78-.81 for options. I\u2019ll trade Netflix but it can make me a bit nervous as the spread can be wider at like 3.10-3.25. That\u2019s harder to land a good fill and sell point, especially with how I\u2019m trying to get in and out super fast usually. \n\nSince I buy at very specific points, if I\u2019m down 5% on a scalp, I know that most likely I\u2019ve lost this one/I was wrong and so I bail. But that doesn\u2019t happen often. For any being longer, like holding for weeks or months, my rule is a bit looser. This has been working for me very well. May or may not help/work for you but would be happy if it did!\n\nCopy pasta:\n\nI\u2019ve been scalping almost exclusively the past few months cuz I haven\u2019t really trusted spy, so I haven\u2019t done any 2-3 week stuff which I\u2019ll do as well normally.\n\nThe basic just of my strategy is just \u201ctake gains\u201d. Im not trying to get to 100%. Been there, lost in the past cuz of that. Was up 30-70%, held and end up selling for loss.\n\nBut the rules are about the same, maybe a little more lose for longer out plays.\n\nIndicators I use are SMAs (50,100,150,200), RSI and reverse RSI, VWAPs, MACD, stochastic slow.\n\nThen there\u2019s dojis, trend lines and patterns.\n\nMy main focuses are MACD, patterns, trend lines and I love the stochastic slow in combination with MACD and RSI and sometimes patterns.\n\nI rarely take \u201carbitrary\u201d positions, like just because something is flagging doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to buy it relatively wherever. I\u2019m going to buy it when it touches my trend because from that, it\u2019s clear that if it breaks up or down in a bad direction, I\u2019m out, usually with just a 5% loss.\n\nIf something is making a pennant, I\u2019m not going to just buy anywhere, I\u2019m only going to buy when it touches the trend.\n\nAnd I definitely miss plays ALOT because it just doesn\u2019t quite hit my fill. A good example from today I that AAPL raising wedge on the 5 min chart. I missed buying puts on the last green candle when it touched my trend line. I Was hoping it would touch again but it never did and even though it was breaking down, I never got into it because I only want to buy at a spot where if it\u2019s going against me, it\u2019s very clear and I can sell by 2-7% loss. At the same time, maximizing room for profit.\n\nI also almost always take gains by 10%, even 3%. I use webull so there\u2019s no fees. I also just do this cuz I often aren\u2019t buying enough contracts to make scaling real worth it. If I\u2019m making money and winning as well as I have, I\u2019ll start to scale out to get more gains, but overal I\u2019m not trying to get to 100%, I\u2019m happy with 5-10% gain.\n\nIn what world is a 5-10% return on investment within 15 minutes a bad thing?

{"title": "The DOJ says Google illegally dominates the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies. Do you agree that it is illegal?", "selftext": "Google pays billions of dollars to other companies -- Apple, Samsung Electronics, etc. -- to keep its search as the default option on phones and in browsers, something the Department of Justice (DOJ) believes creates an illegal dominance over the search market.\n\nDeals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business. The practice has gone on for years. Google, at one point, paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to a law suit filed in 2020.\n\nDOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn\u2019t disclose the amount Google spends to remain the default search engine on browsers and U.S. mobile phones, but described it as \u201cenormous numbers,\u201d reports Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cGoogle invests billions securing defaults, knowing people won\u2019t change them,\u201d Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington, admitting that Google buys \u201cdefault exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Google began giving Android users in Europe a choice to select a provider to power a search box on their device's home screen, and as the default in Chrome when installed. The changes complied with a competitive European Union ruling. The EU fined Google, saying it had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.\n\nThe change gave users with a phone running the Android operating system and Chrome browser an option to customize and personalize their device, choose and change their search engine based on their preference. It included selecting the apps to download.\n\nGoogle, for example, added private, decentralized search engine Presearch as a default option on all new and factory-reset Android devices in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nSince Google added Presearch 2021, its daily searches have grown from about 200,000 a day to more than 4 million, said Alex Carrabre, head of growth at Presearch. \u201cAt the peak it was 6 million per day in the past 20 months,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just in the Europe economic area.\u201d\n\nCarrabre estimates Android has about 70% of smartphone market share in Europe, which means there\u2019s strong potential for the fledgling search engine to grow its user base.\n\nGoogle\u2019s private contracts with companies like Apple, and Samsung form the basis of the DOJ\u2019s antitrust lawsuit, which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws.\n\nThe trial isn\u2019t expected to start until next year. Thursday\u2019s hearing was a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google\u2019s business.\n\n[https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/377584/google-exclusivity-and-dojs-battle-over-search.html](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/377584/google-exclusivity-and-dojs-battle-over-search.html)\n\nThe DOJ says Google (Alphabet, Inc: GOOGL) creates an illegal dominance over the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies to keep its search as the default option.

And that\u2019s a benefit that basically no other search player has access to, simply because they\u2019re not big enough; Google can outbid all of them.\n\nBoth of these ideas can be true simultaneously, and I don\u2019t have to stop using Google Search to hold them to be true.\n\n--- \n\nAs an aside, one of the big difficulties with arguing against monopolies in our day is that they frequently produce *good products*, which makes it difficult to get people to see the harm in their presence.\n\nOne of the issues with letting \u201cbenevolent monopolies\u201d have their way is that the competition lost to them over time has also robbed us of uncountably many unknown innovations that would have been driven by competitors, had they existed. \n\nIt\u2019s very hard to accurately compare that unknown loss to the things that we do have, and that people know and like, e.g. Google Search.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> hey have also used their size to push around other players to their advantage\n\nCan you provide an example?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I found [a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department in 2020 against Google](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7273448-DOC) which details a few:\n\n> For years, **Google has entered into exclusionary agreements**, including tying arrangements, and engaged in anticompetitive conduct **to lock up distribution channels and block rivals**. Google pays billions of dollars each year to distributors\u2014including popular-device manufacturers such as Apple, LG, Motorola, and Samsung; major U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon; and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb\u2014to secure default status for its general search engine and, in many cases, **to specifically prohibit Google's counterparties from dealing with Google's competitors**. Some of these agreements also **require distributors to take a bundle of Google apps, including its search apps, and feature them on devices in prime positions** where consumers are most likely to start their internet searches.\n\nIt goes on to also mention Google\u2019s voice assistant & IoT device integration, which further leverages their size to intrench their search engine into people\u2019s lives (often in a way they can\u2019t even opt out of):\n\n> Also, Google has turned its sights to emerging search access points, **such as voice assistants**, ensuring that they too are covered by the same anticompetitive scheme. And Google is now **positioning itself to dominate search access points on the next generation of search platforms: internet-enabled devices** such as smart speakers, home appliances, and automobiles (so-called internet-of-things, or IoT, devices).\n\nThe first section concludes with a summary: \n\n> Google is now the unchallenged gateway to the internet for billions of users worldwide.

{"title": "AST Spacemobile ($ASTS) - A long-term, asymetrical bet", "selftext": "**TL/DR** *I like the stock !* \ud83d\ude80\n \nAllright listen up retards, and listen well. I'm an OG and I have some hard to swallow truth for you. This sub has been overtaken by nefarious actors, bots and actual retards since the GME drama. Squeeze this. Squeeze that. Squeeze my fucking dick and fuck betting on lame has-been retail companies and fucking silver. \n \nIt's time we reclaim this sub and start posting proper autistic bets and DD again.\n \nNow, for those of you cowboys with at least a braincell remaining, boys do I got a bet for you. Something asymetrical and long term. *ewww, long term*, I hear you say? Well, perhaps I can change your mind about that!\n \nAs many here may already know, AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is a pre-revenue company aiming to deliver world-wide satellite-based direct-to-cellphone broadband. That means 2G/3G/4G/5G all over the world, from space, on the device in your hands right now. No more dead spots.\n \nI could talk for hours of the benefits and desirability of this service, the adressable market of billions, their partnerships and MOUs for distribution through cell-phone service providers, their 2400 patents, their amazing CEO and how he personally funded ASTS' beginnings, the marvels of technology they have built, how stupidly faster than GSAT IRDM AAPL and starlink it will be, how they launched yesterday their first satellite and are about to demonstrate their tech in the coming weeks, etc., but I'm going to take you by the sentiments. *Let's talk money*.\n \nASTS plans to deploy 168 sats. Sats will cost somewhere around 16M and launches 5M. Each sat will be able to give 1.8M GB per month. \n \n*Yes, but how much is a GB of space internet worth?* I hear you ask?\n \nWell I kid you not, Globalstar and Iridium are managing to sell their GB for more than *2000$* a pop. That's fucking right. And they're slow af, not even comparable.\n \nNow, for the sake of pessimism (\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b), let's imagine ASTS and their partners decide to sell at a much lower price and ASTS gets half. Say 20$ per GB, so ASTS gets 10$. And again for the sake of pessimism (\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b), let's say they sell only 10% of their capacity.\n \nOnce the full constellation is up (likely before 2030) that means a yearly revenue of 10$x168satsx1.8M GBx12 monthsx10% = **3.63B$**\n\nYeah, *that's fucking right* **.** My \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b case is 3.63B$ per year for a constellation that will cost about the same only once to build. They may *very well* be able to sell *a lot more* at a *much higher* price. I'll let you do the math and come up with stupidly high valuations by yourselves.\n \nIf we give that a 10 years valuation that's 36B$. Currently stock is trading at 10.76$ with a 1.97B$ market cap. \n \nThat means a 2030 share price of **196.7$** or 18.3 times today's price share.\n \nSo here's the bet. **>**18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.\n \nPosition: Long shares, warrants, 2024 leaps, and other calls.\n \nDisclosure: Forward looking statements, Not financial advice, Do your own DD, don't trust strangers on the internet, Gambling is risky, yaddi yaddi yadda.\n \nNote: For those curious to learn more check out r/ASTSpacemobile", "id": "xc08j1", "created_utc": 1662947797.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|52|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xc08j1/ast_spacemobile_asts_a_longterm_asymetrical_bet/) \n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xc08j1)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xc08j1)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">\\>18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.\n\ni'm still mulling over activition arbitrage and that as a shorter time horizon.

Comparing to Geostationary communications is idiotic. Those are very limited services that people have high demand for and will pay excessive fees for. Extrapolating that to a constellation of LEO satellites sold to the masses is like extrapolating Bugatti car prices to Camry buyers.\n2. Your math is wrong. Using your own numbers it is not $3.63B but $1.8B\n3. The GB a month availability per satellite is based on what? I saw estimates of 40 gbps, which would come to 540,000 GB a month, far less than 1.8 million GB's a month. Plugging 540,000 GB a month into your calculation gets you $540M a year in revenue.\n4. Assuming 10% of capacity is sold is a pipe-dream. Most of the world is covered in water so about 70% of capacity is going to be unused because of that. Then there are vast sparsely inhabited places on earth (e.g. the Sahara) that would not have enough users to saturate the service (i.e. because if it was used to capacity there, it would be overextended in more dense places). No idea what % of capacity would get used but 10% is probably the most bullish scenario you can come up with.\n5. At $10 a GB, people will limit use of the satellites for talk and sms and not use it for data. It would just be too expensive. Not working through the calculations but would assume actual capacity used ends up being under 5%... so even assuming $10 per GB that is now $250 million in revenue a year. Realize this service is being envisioned as an add-on to a land-based service. Very few people are going to be willing to pay excessive amounts on top of their expensive cell service for this.\n6. Beyond anything above, the simple physics of it says that providing broadband via your 5G smartphone is not a very economical business as the number of satellites needed to be launched would be in the tens of thousands, not 168. What does work is basic phone service (talk, SMS, and some data). There are I think over 8 billion cell phone subscribers in the world if each can pay $1 a year that is $8 billion in potential revenue to ensure basic coverage worldwide. Providing such service will be competitive between any player putting up satellites for this and the actual revenue will be determined based on how reliable your network is and what is the lowest cost you can charge for it. So rather than even that $8 billion dollar number perhaps this whole industry will be worth at most a few billion in revenue a year.\n7. SpaceX will be putting up satellites that are already being used for internet service and adding on the phone services is a low cost addition. So consider that your competition. There are also other companies vying for this space.\n8. I have to wonder about the speed assumptions made about ASTS... my mind tells me a lower bandwidth satellite that covers a smaller area (e.g. the SpaceX ones) will likely be better suited for being able to saturate that bandwidth over a bunch of connections as opposed to a single higher bandwidth one listening in to more connections. I am not an expert in the technical aspects here, but I suspect my thinking is right here. If correct, the bandwidth projections for ASTS are based on a few connections and not numerous connections, which is kind of a huge deal as it might very well mean their are underestimating by far the number of satellites needed.\n\nBasically the revenue assumptions here are wildly optimistic. This is literally a bottom of the barrel value added service that pricing will be determined based on who can provide it the cheapest and most reliably. I am guessing that the reason T-Mobile said they should be able to provide this for no additional cost (or maybe some minimal amount) is because SpaceX realized that this is not a service you can charge much for. As to why SpaceX would go into this business then; well for one, since they are already sending up satellites this is a small additional cost and two, this may be related to providing connected service to all their cars which is important for self-driving. Cars should have larger antennas built in that would enable faster communication and enable remote connectivity anywhere.\n\nBottom line, investing in this service at current valuations is simply idiotic and you will lose your money long-term when the economics here are clearly shown to not work out. I am sorry, but the numbers for these services when run diligently don't translate into this pipe-dream that is being sold here.", "score": -13, "replies": [{"body": "If you think his DD is bad you should be the poor bastard that has to read what you wrote, because you can't even do math.

Why couldn't they refinance their loans?

Given permission to relax their underwriting, banks and mortgage companies were ever so happy to do so. Short term adjustable rate mortgages and balloon mortgages were common. [Federally backed mortgages fell sharply as a proportion of total home loans](https://americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RootsOfRecession-fig2-693.png)^(2)...a concerning trend because federally issued mortgages have statutory creditworthiness requirements and a mandatory mortgage insurance premium.\n\nThe banks knew they were loaning money to people who lacked the creditworthiness and income to pay back the loan. To hedge their risk, loans were securitized: thousands of individual loans were sold to commercial banks who pooled the risk into tranches. This is similar to how life insurance and health insurance works -- one person might be a risk of catastrophic loss, but the loss is covered by the other 999 homeowners who were expected to pay on time.\n\nHome prices were rocketing due to demand, and even if buyers weren't flipping their own homes and moving often (they were), the price increases meant that buyers were gaining equity in their own home much faster than they were paying principal down. As a result, it became common to take out junior mortgages (second mortgages or Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC)) to pay for vacations, ATVs, motorcycles, or luxury goods^(3).\n\nBy late 2007, the writing was on the wall. Millions of short-term adjustable-APR loans were due for a rate reset^(4).

The subprime market collapsed, billions of dollars were lost by traditionally staid bondholders such as Harvard's endowment fund and the State of California Pension & Retirement System, faith in the banking system was shaken....all at a time when the post-2002 bull market was getting long in the tooth and the business cycle was due for a contraction and a pullback.\n\nCombine waves of foreclosures with job losses due to a slowing economy, and you have a perfect storm that nearly spread to a global financial contagion.\n\nAnd we learned nothing from it.

I know for a fact that if the 10 yr hits yield hits 6% I'm (even as a young investor) am locking some in. Some people are even already doing that at 3.3-3.5%, albeit with smaller amounts.\n\nThat will cause demand to drop out (less spending, more saving, more shifting away from equity into fixed income, govt or opportunistic high yield corp bond, higher cost of capital so more unprofitable companies will shed jobs or go busto) and that's where we get the full on. That will cause the layoffs that will curb inflation -> I can go company by company and see if they're likely going to bust.\n\nWhen they run out of cash and equivalents, they will go to banks and the bank will look at their negative free cash flow and say \"Well, you can't pay this back, goodbye.\"\n\nSame thing with the stock-based compensation companies. They're not going to be able to keep employees with stock and banks won't lend to them either.\n\nInterest rates can still hit 7% or even higher and be sustained for a long while. The argument I've heard is that the debt is so large that a higher debt servicing cost is not feasible. However, the effective tax rate of the vast majority of US existing debt will still be \\~1% for quite a while. As a % of federal budget it will take 3+ years for interest payments to hit 5% of the budget or higher.\n\nTo comment on the markets, the way I see it, there has been a deleveraging in equities as people have gotten murdered by margin calls. However, the vast majority of that money, wealth leaving equities was outright destruction of wealth, not money 'rotating' out into other asset classes. Tons of mid level high net worth investors and institutions lost 40-50%+ wealth just like your average joe even if you see them buying whatever choice sector now.\n\nSo they've only dipped their toes in bonds and commodoties so far.
