{"title": "Great Depression?", "selftext": "Firs off, i would like the begin by saying that i have been doing this almost 4 months so any constructive criticism is appreciated, i see it at an opportunity to learn. With that being said, enjoy my book \ud83e\udd23.\n\nPersonally, a recession has seemed unavoidable based on the Feds decisions and the economic data supporting those decisions. Now we are beginning to understand the magnitude of repercussions that will follow while the Feds attempt to tame inflation. \n\nDuring the Fed meeting today we heard from representatives for some of the different business sectors, wholesale, transportation, etc. As of todays meeting, we no longer have to speculate if we will see a recession. Businesses expressed hardships revolving around wages, supply/demand (be that too much or too little supply/demand), overhead costs, \u201csignificant\u201d decline in profits, environmental concerns that have negatively affected different crops, and one i didn\u2019t expect to hear, mismanagement of PPP funds. \n\nThere was little spoken by the Feds though they did have some key comments and questions. First off Powell began by reiterating that they have been very transparent with their stance on inflation. In addition to that, at one point when the reps had neared the end of their comments and concerns, a Fed member asked one of them if they had anything that they could help them with, implying none of these problems being presented are their priority. I believe this is key because it says that everything they\u2019re saying is stuff they already understand to be a consequence of the fight on inflation. It\u2019s not the Feds fault a business grew too fast, it\u2019s not their fault that a business has failing practices, it\u2019s not their fault businesses mismanaged their PPP loans. At another point Powell had asked one of the reps if these additional expenses are going to be passed onto the consumer. When companies choose profit margins over stability for consumers, that\u2019s an issue. Companies need to eat some of these expenses, some companies will have prepared better than others however that\u2019s just how this works. As Powell said before \u201cjobs will be lost, households will suffer\u201d. The train is full speed and not set to stop in the near future. Add in foreign tensions on-top of this and we could be in for a very bumpy ride down, especially considering Putin doesn\u2019t seem to be changing his mind anytime soon.\n\nIf you made it this far then thanks for taking the time to read this long ass book \ud83d\ude02, look forward to any comments and questions.", "id": "xmbyqx", "created_utc": 1663973850.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "Let be clear.

Everything that we know about is manageable. Interest rates are numbers that fit into equations quite easily. Goldman Sachs ran their equations and came up with 3600 as a year-end number for the SP500. Seems reasonable, and not horrible (given we are almost there.)\n\nThe issue is what we might not know about. When economic conditions are shifting this quickly, you have businesses making irrational decisions due to a squeeze (in inventory, in labor, in cash on hand, etc.). Those irrational decisions will not have been anticipated by others in the economy, and can catch them by surprise, in turn squeezing them, and so things can escalate. This is what happens in really bad economic situations. Things spiral out of control. No one can anticipate these, not even Goldman Sachs.\n\nThere's interest rates, and there's the proper functioning of the financial system. Those are different things. Proper functioning of the financial system means that credit is available to responsible borrowers who need it, bills are being paid in a timely fashion, payments are being cleared quickly, etc. I think that's what was meant when they asked \"is there anything we can do to help\" in the meeting - the Fed's primary responsibility other than interest rates is making sure that money keeps flowing in the ways the economy needs it to in order to function.\n\nIf you think of what is happened as an earthquake, what we don't know is whether it's just a matter of riding out the earthquake of the spike in inflation and interest rates, or if gas and water mains are breaking and a tsunami being created that will spawn thousands of unanticipated side effects.

Been at this just over 3 months. \n\nThe market began in a descending wedge when Powell spoke about aggressively combating inflation. Since then any rally has been on false hopes of a soft landing that would be crushed by data supporting the likelihood of us entering a recession. Some traders attempted to make sense of the rallies by saying the Feds are either bluffing, not in a position to do it and then up till this week, the last hope of a .5 interest rate hike. That is if you believed they were bluffing, or that they didn\u2019t have the tools to combat inflation, i.e strong employment, the highest competitive wage market in my young life, and the trillions injected into the economy. \n\nIf you look at SPY (which mirrors or inverses all the huge stocks), you\u2019ll see that the market was respecting the 30min 50MA since before Powell spoke. Ever since then it only began respecting the 30min 50MA when it would rally for a false breakout. If you look at the last rally before we confirmed with more data that we will be seeing a .75 rate hike, we dropped back under that 30min 50MA in a single day, not only did we drop under the 30min 50MA but we also broke back into the edge we were out of for the largest decline the market has seen in a single day since the pandemic in 2020. In addition to this, every single one of those rallies were after dividends payouts. I theorize that the larger money are rolling their dividends payouts into shares at a discounted rate due to tax laws. They are then buying both low and selling high in the form of puts. Each rally is just an opportunity for shares to be dumped on unsuspected traders. \u201cSmart\u201d money bought 3x the number of puts compared to before the 08 crash at the top of the last rally of hope for a .5 hike followed by a .25 finishing the hikes and decreasing interest rates next year. Since then we have now seen data that absolutely confirms we will be seeing a recession, on a global level. Now that the rest of the market is on the same page, we only have one place to go and that\u2019s down.

{"title": "Barrons: Could This Be Another \u2018Lost Decade\u2019 for the Stock Market?", "selftext": "it\u2019s impossible to overstate just how good stock market returns have been for investors over the last 40 years\u2014and for even longer. From the S&P 500\u2019s SPX \u20131.72%  low of 102.20 in 1982 through its peak of 4818.62 in January 2022, the index returned 12.9% annually including reinvested dividends. That\u2019s slightly above the average of 11.8% going back to 1928.\n\nBut the stock market goes through \u201clost decades,\u201d periods where returns are hard to come by. The most recent occurred from the dot-com peak in 2000 through 2013, when the stock market finally broke out in a meaningful way. Before that, the stock market remained mired in a decade-plus trading range from 1968 through 1982, when the S&P 500 returned just 4% annualized including reinvested dividends.\n\nAlbert Edwards has been singing the same tune for a long time about the end of what he calls the \u201cIce Age,\u201d a period of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d that left yields low and boosted asset prices. But now, he looks like he may be right. Instead of printing money and cutting rates to boost the economy, central banks will now have to deal with governments that seem more willing to spend than ever, bringing \u201chigher growth, higher inflation, and higher interest rates across the curve,\n\nIf Edwards is correct, it will come as a shock to investors who are used to stocks going up most of the time, and a Fed that always had the market\u2019s back. It will also require more than a simple buy-the-S&P-500-and-hold strategy. Stiefel strategist Barry Bannister has argued that investors will need to be more tactical, buying when the market is weak and selling when it is strong. Dividends, too, will be far more important. It\u2019s one reason the S&P 500 could lose 5.7% from its 1968 high through its 1982 low and investors could still emerge with a positive return, at least before adjusting for inflation.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-lost-decade-51663945507?mod=hp_LEAD_1_B_1", "id": "xmcpgd", "created_utc": 1663975783.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m confused, how can they say we have had 40 years of stellar performance, AND acknowledge that we had a lost decade 20 years ago.
