It depends on other factors and the company\u2019s operating strategy. Higher margins ensure higher disposable capital they can invest back into the company to  grow for future years. Another factor is competition. A company that can maintain higher margins, keep operating costs low, and reinvest their profits responsibly to grow future returns will stay in business longer and beat its competition. If a company cares about its employees and wants to remain competitive in the labor market, then it would consider giving out significant cost of living raises to help their employees afford rising prices and so they would choose to remain at said company. A company does not have the authority to print new money like a central bank and therefore they have to obtain more by raising their prices on produced goods and services. \n\nThe choice to not raise prices is not as simple as it would seem. The inflation problem is a result of too much money in the economic system. Period. More money leads to more spending which leads to higher demand for goods and services. The problem is when demand becomes much higher than the current supply of goods and services. Prices of goods and services will increase dramatically as demand remains abnormally high. In a normal healthy economy, supply and demand run toe to toe. What we currently have is a major imbalance between supply and demand. There is just too much money circulating in the economy relative to the current supply of goods and services. \n\nOne tool the central banks use is raising interest rates. This makes borrowing and ultimately spending more costly. This helps to decrease demand. The higher they raise interest rates, the stronger the decrease of demand. \n\nThis tool is a double edge sword. If interest rates are raised to high to fast, then the balance will tip dramatically the opposite way and trigger a recession. However, if interest rates are not increased enough then the rate of inflation will remain high and people will struggle to afford the higher costs. If people spend less, then this effect will trigger a recession. Some experts believe that a prolonged recession would result if inflation does not get dealt with sooner. A prolonged recession is what we call a depression. \n\nSimilar to pulling a bandaid off a wound. Would it make sense to just rip the bandaid off and deal with the intense pain knowing that it won\u2019t last long? Or would it make sense to slowly peel the bandaid off knowing that the pain would last longer but the intensity would be less? \n\nThe answer depends on who. Those who live on a fixed income will likely not be able to handle a prolonged recession. Those who can increase their income as inflation remains high will come out ahead.

A company has to has to generate higher margins to stay competitive with similar companies and take care of its employees.

Does the farmer use the seed on hand now to make bread and keep the belly full each day? Or should the farmer plan for future a harvest? The answer is both but  striking a perfect balance is a daunting task. Now let\u2019s add another factor in this analogy. What if the farmer knows there will likely be a drought in the next year or two. How would this affect sowing the future plans? Well sowing no seed will generate a zero yield harvest for sure. Sowing more than last year may not guarantee a 100% yield with a drought as a factor but would likely help obtain a same or better yield than last year. \n\nI disagree with the statement about geopolitical conflicts being the main driver for inflation. I agree that the conflicts have exacerbated the inflation picture. Prices were already going up before the war in Ukraine. It is a story that mainstream media is trying to sell to the public to distract them from the real problem. The problem of printing too much money. \n\nThe US economy is not healthy given the circumstances. Inflation is high still. Higher since the 80s. GDP has shrunk and cannot service national debt.
