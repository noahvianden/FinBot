Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.

As rates go up, specifically the risk free rate that the fed is basically changing, the calculation for where to invest changes. I'm sure there's tons of math models about supply and demand and other stuff but the part I like to focus on is just that big funds, pension funds, etc, allocate their money on a risk reward basis. \n\nWhen the risk free rate goes up, it's not just that people irrationally flee stocks. Where would they flee to? Cash? No. What really happens is big funds sell out of some of their dividend stocks and buy bonds instead. And then they or other funds sell out of their risky super high multiple tech stocks to buy safer dividend stocks. In short, the whole market pushes a little further to safety or yield depending on your point of view. \n\nSelling dividend stocks to buy 4% bonds makes sense. It's risk free, and you are selling your 2% dividend with a possibile equity upside, to a guaranteed 4%. \n\nSelling high pe tech with the possibility of a moonshot for 2% guaranteed yield with a possibility of equity appreciation also makes sense. Why wait 40 years for your tech stocks earnings to actually come in when you can get some hard dividends right now and rotate back into tech if it looks super cheap. \n\nIn reality, if rates go and stay above 4%, stocks will have some real competition with bonds and fixed income for investment dollars. When rates were 1% or lower there really was almost no downside to betting on moonshots. Money supply was increasing, which meant both the moonshot stocks could finally become profitable or at the very least attract some of the new printed money as new bagholders for you to sell to. \n\nBut with rates going to 4% there's going to be fewer new dollars heading to stocks as compared to last year. There's real competition for those dollars now. If people start locking up money in bonds, that money stays locked for years. It won't come rushing back into stocks any time soon. And it also can't be spent by old farmer joe on gifts for the grandkids. This also means with more money locking itself up for some years, and less money being invested in stocks AND less money being spent on crap, earnings could also take a hit. \n\nIt's not just the fear or the panic or the irrational market. It's real money leaving the market to go lock itself up somewhere else. That's why stocks sell off on interest rate rises. And it gets worse the higher rates go. If rates ever went to 10%, why would anyone buy stocks when they could get a 10% yield risk free?", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "While good points, I\u2019ve to disagree on one thing. Dollars being locked up by buying bonds. Bonds can be bought in the market or directly from the debtor. In the case of buying it from the market, someone else, specifically the person that sells you the bond, makes the money that they are now free to spend it on goods, services and assets. If a company issues bond and you\u2019re buying it, the company is raising capital to buy inventory or pay people for goods or services.

They COULD use that money, but it's less than it was when they started (likely). You're also right that the money from a new issue of corporate debt would be used and deployed, but it likely won't be used to invest in stocks. Yes I do understand that the money will circulate and could eventually find it's way into stocks, but then we go back to the real competition for investor dollars again and it's just as likely the second order money gets put in fixed income or is used to grow or expand directly or pay down existing debt or etc etc etc. \n\nAgain, it's not that the money disappears.
