Option selling also has a different risk and return profile which attract some types of trader. But in terms of B&H, I think it\u2019s very challenging if not unlikely.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I've commented many times in this sub and some of the others about how I wheel and the results I've personally had.  Maybe my results are completely abnormal but I would find it hard to believe since I'm not that smart and was shown what to do by someone else already in the business .\n\nSo comparisons between strategies are usually highly dependent on what time frame is looked at and what happens over the years. In my experience slow and steady will often win the race. My personal results indicate the statement about buy and hold always being better over the long haul, isn't always true. It seems that general advice and phrases like \"no one can beat the market\" are primarily geared at the masses who don't actually want to spend any time or effort learning how to manage investments on a regular basis.\n\nHere is my real life personal results.\n\nI started with $5500, in a just for fun options account, back in June 1995. Its sole purpose was to sell options and execute the strategy that I learned from my finance professor in college (turns out it was essentially the 'wheel'). I've been selling CSPs and CCs ever since. Over the years I've pretty consistently earned between 0.75-1.5% each month and built that account (which I've never added to) up to a present balance just over 175k.\n\nSo when people ask if actively trading and selling premium can be profitable, I simply point to my account and say 'yes'. In fact (with the right conditions) it can beat a market etf (ie SPY) buy and hold strategy, if patience, discipline and perseverance are applied.\n\nFor comparison I've earned a \\~3184% total return over 27 years. Compared to if I had simply used that same money to purchase 100 shares of SPY (at around $53-$54), which would have had a price appreciation of \\~779% and if you include the $8k of dividends I would have received over that time the total return comes out at \\~931%.\n\nBut how can that be? A cash flow income strategy can't beat a buy and hold plan, or so I'm constantly told.... Well it's because markets don't always go up all the time. Sometimes they go down or sideways. Yes, the last 12 years have been an unprecedented bull market and have created most of the gains seen by the S&P during my time investing. Most people don't realize, or they forgot that in the summer of 2000 the S&P reached an all time high just over 1500. Then it fell back and didn't return to those highs again until 2007. Then it fell back again and finally reached that point one more time in 2013, before continuing up to it's current highs. But for 13 years the market vibrated up and down and didn't grow beyond it's range. Essentially it was sideways that entire time.\n\n**TLDR:** I started with $5500 and never added money to it. Have been conservatively selling premium (wheeling) with it for 27+ years. I've returned 0.75%-1.5% per month every year.  It is currently worth just over $175k. That same money could have been used to buy 100 shares of SPY at $53-$54/share which would now be worth just over $49k at close today (including the dividends and price appreciation for all 27years).\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I also believe that a dollar cost averaging savings buy and hold plan along with a dividend focused reinvestment strategy should be a part of everyone's investment portfolio to help round it out and allow a person's money to capitalize on the markets no matter how they change over time.   So in addition to that one option selling account I also have those and because I was working and saving into those over that timeframe I was well positioned to capitalize on the past decade bull market.
