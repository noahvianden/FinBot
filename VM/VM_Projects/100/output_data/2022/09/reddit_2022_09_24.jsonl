He added that higher-margin businesses such as gas and travel sales help Costco maintain its value deals.\n\n\u201cThose things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer \u2013 forever,\u201d Galanti added.\n\nCostco and other retailers have hiked prices over the last year, passing along the higher costs of commodities and goods to consumers.
