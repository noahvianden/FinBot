{"title": "What will cause the next market crash?", "selftext": "- A. Corporate debt as interests rise and businesses go bust, firing people who then can't pay their mortgages, etc.\n- B. Real estate bubble in China bursts and shockwaves spread.\n- C. Energy crisis, rising inflation and higher interest rates hit the weaker countries in the EU. Banks of certain countries (i.e. Italy, Spain) need to be bailed out.\n- D. Other: please explain.\n\nEdit: I'll add a few more options that seem plausible:\n\n- E. After years of financing stock buybacks with tons of cheap debt, tighter economic conditions and higher interest rates force companies to sell a lot of their stock back, causing a crash.\n- F. China invades Taiwan. The microchip shortage gets a lot worse and supply chains coming to/from China get disrupted.\n- G. Russia weakens Europe by cutting their gas supply and then invades the Baltics. Possibly while scenario F. plays out simultaneously.\n- H. Deflation. Inflation was just due to a temporary \"revenge buying\" behavior from consumers coming out of the pandemic. The FED raises rates, supply chains improve, consumers run out of their discretionary budgets and start spending less because everything is so expensive. We enter into a deflationary spiral. Debt gets harder to pay, and asset prices go down because... why would anyone buy an anything now if it will get cheaper next year?
