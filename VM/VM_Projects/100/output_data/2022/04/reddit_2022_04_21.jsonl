{"title": "On Tesla's valuation (Part Deux)", "selftext": "Five months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation to determine whether it's really as cheap as Tesla bulls say, or as expensive as most of the rest of the sub thinks it is.\n\nAfter yesterday's earnings report, it seems like my analysis has already been proven incorrect, and I felt it would be worth having another look at it.\n\nFor those who don't like reading, I will again explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to \"The Numbers\"\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might rise slightly higher today, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my last analysis. After Q1, that has grown to $62,190M, with Q1 being a 87% YoY increase.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q1, that has grown to 19.2%, equalling market leader Ferrari.\n\nIn terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. After Q1, this has grown to $8,399M, with Q1 being a 658% YoY increased.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nLast time, I said the following:\n\n> Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.\n\nWe have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.\n\nI also said:\n\n> That said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.\n\nWhile we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.\n\nThen I said:\n\n> In terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.\n\nI think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.\n\nThat said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nPutting all of the information from the previous section together, I had created a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024; however, after Q1 Tesla has already significantly surpassed my best case scenarios. Below, I will update my Best Case scenarios while leaving the Worst Case untouched. While I do think the likelihood of the Worst Case occurring has decreased significantly, it is still a small possibility.\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|1,900,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|3,000,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|3,700,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nLast time I mentioned ASPs would likely increase, but chose to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 to be conservative. After Q1, we know that ASPs did in fact increase significantly, to ~$55,000. With recent price changes in Q1 and continuing strong demand, I expect these to continue to increase to ~$60,000 by 2024.\n\n\n**Revenue**\n\nUpdating the higher ASPs ($55K for 2022, $57.5K for 2023 and $60K for 2024) and delivery projections into a new worst and best case gives us the following numbers:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$70B|$77B|$85B|$105B|\n|**2023**|$100B|$115B|$135B|$173B|\n|**2024**|$130B|$156B|$165B|$222B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nLast time I said:\n\n> Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\nThis is where I was most wrong by far. After Q1, Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. As I don't see margins decreasing throughout the rest of 2022, I will need to significantly increase my expectations for both the worst and best cases:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|14%|19%|14%|22%|\n|**2023**|15%|20%|18%|26%|\n|**2024**|16%|21%|20%|30%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$9,8B|$14.6B|$11,9B|$22.1B|\n|**2023**|$15,0B|$23B|$24,3B|$45.0B|\n|**2024**|$20,8B|$32B|$33,0B|$66.6B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|102|68|84|45|\n|**2023**|67|43|41|22|\n|**2024**|48|31|30|15|\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nAfter Q3, using the $1T market cap I expected Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Only two quarters later, Tesla was able to beat the expectations (of what some would consider a \"delusional Tesla bull\") by such a large amount, that my new expectations are for it to be trading at a PE of between 15 and 31 by 2024 should the market cap stay flat at $1T.\n\nDepending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock now only has between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is how, even in the worst case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($23B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the best case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.\n\nSo to reiterate, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\", \"energy is a scam\" and \"the Bot will never work\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla managed to beat all expectations by such an insane margin that based on the current trends, they now only have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.", "id": "u8ka1h", "created_utc": 1650536252.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "when your competition pays for your ads, and just pays you lmao", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla is the bully.

It would seem like someone would be able to do good margins and good volume and be a profitable company. Or failing that at least be consistent and steady and unleveraged on average.\n\nBut the global auto market looks like it's cut throat, with tiny margins, and is barely scrapping by in the periods between one crisis and the next crisis. There's some brands that can charge good margins, but they have real problems scaling that up. The most reliable segment for long term profits over the last couple decades has been luxury SUVs, but even there over investing in that segment caused serious problems for major players when there was an economic downturn and consumer preferences shifted in the short term.\n\nAt first glance, it would seem like EVs are a godsend for the incumbents, they get to sell a whole new kind of car to all their existing customers. And would hopefully be able to get some subsidies to do it, or at the very least get out from underneath increasingly stringent emissions regulations. \n\nBut basically no major incumbent is embracing EVs as an answer to their long term problems. For a long time they barely made any, just enough to meet minimum compliance needs. And even now they're not investing nearly enough to capture decent market share, while still relying heavily on segments that are going to be problematic long term (mostly SUVs).\n\nAnd when you dig in to their balance sheets, it starts to make sense. They make a huge amount of money selling parts for the existing fleet of installed vehicles. If they push out new cars, that are much less complicated and much more reliable, to replace the aging installed base, their parts sales profits are going to disappear. It will be incredibly hard to fund a transition to new products if they're losing short term profits from high margin vehicles, and also cutting off a steady supply of long term profits from parts. The only real option is to dive in completely and commit to the new market, and it doesn't seem like anyone is willing to make that jump?\n\nPart of the issue might be that most automakers also rely on financing to make money. They're basically banks that also sell cars, and I'm sure that creates a very difficult management structure, especially if you need to convince everyone to make a huge commitment to new a new engineering and manufacturing model.\n\nIt's kind of like how [airlines basically became banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4) and rely on loyalty programs to make any real profit.

{"title": "DD - $AMZN 2500 PUTS 4/29", "selftext": "Amazon will tank on earnings due to 7 factors:\n\n1. Price increase announced in February 16\n2. Amazon stock buyback/split announced March 9, 2022\n3. Amazon 5% fuel/inflation surcharge announced April 13\n4. $JBHT last mile logistics company Q1 results\n5. Valuation/growth issues\n6. Competition hitting inflection point\n7. $UPS earnings 4/26 TBD\n\n\n\n1 - Amazon announced a price increase which reflects that internally they are seeing increases costs and likely new member stagnation. Market has likely reached saturation like $NFLX reached.\n\n2 - This is a gambit to create short term hype. If you review FY21 financials they generate no free cash flow (cash from ops - capex - stock based comp). A $10 billion buyback ONLY keeps their share count flat at best. It does not reduce it. (509k -503k = 6k. 6k / 503k = 1.2% dilution. 1.2% dilution on 1.6 trillion market cap means it requires almost $20 billion free cash flow to buyback the stock comp. We know stock split means nothing in reality but it's used to pump up the market on your company.\n\n3 - This is weird that it came out about a month and change after quarter end. Seems like management/board received draft financials and didn't like what they saw. A 5% surcharge is their \"fix\" for future quarters.\n\n4 - $JBHT just had earnings with 33% revenue growth and huge earnings growth. Except ALL of that earnings growth is because they charge a fuel surcharge. Without it they had lower earnings than 2021.\n\n5 - The valuation for a company growing operating cash flow 10-15% would be in the 20x -25x normally. This company hides the fact that they can't create real cash flow using stock based comp and they are granting so much that they now can't buy enough back to even stay at 0 dilution. We may see Amazon only grow high single digits (inflation rate) and the premium does not make sense. Same issue as Netflix.\n\n6 - $TGT, $WMT, $COST and other retailers are doing a much better job of leveraging their local stores with delivery. They can share the delivery price burden with their retail store sales and absorb more costs. TGT is growing at the same revenue year over year as $AMZN as of FY 20 to FY 21.\n\n7 - Watch $UPS earnings to get an idea of how the costs of delivery were in Q1. This will give us more insight into what to expect for $AMZN.\n\nI am risk averse so putting like 1% of my boomer portfolio into $2500 Puts. If I am right I expect a COVID roundtrip back to $2100 by the end of the month. I expect $2400 to be the realistic initial sell-off. At $2400 you make $250-$300 into $10k so risk/reward is there. I will have a few thousand worth. Have $1k so far but will add as we get closer and likely after $UPS earnings.\n\nBiggest risk is that I DO think AWS will continue to do well AND I think capex for AWS may be cheaper than expected (Check GPU/CPU prices dropping everywhere and becoming readily available).\n\nFor chart fiends there is NO volume between $3k and $2400.\n\nFor street cred on financials: My day job is income tax manager for 20+ billion revenue public company.\n\nEdit: 2 new items brought to my attention. They will mark to market their Rivian loss which could trip up the algos that trade on headline #s. Also, $FDX earnings are out and guidance was not good.\n\n2nd Edit: $AMZN just announced they are opening up prime delivery services to 3rd parties. VERY strange timing at midnight on 4/21.

But their 2nd quarter isn't looking so hot, so my guess is they'll attempt to jam as much expenses into the quarter as possible, making it even worse.  Most of Tesla's high margin sales are coming from their Chinese plant's production due to the cheap labor costs and MUCH cheaper LFP cells, so with the Chinese plant shutdown, they could take a pretty sizable hit on margins, and prove just how critical that plant is to the company's profits.\n\nThe gross vehicle margins are definitely benefiting from Tesla's price increases, but I don't know how long those can last if we head into a recession within the next 1-1.5 years.\n\nAlso, that lithium shortage isn't a minor issue.  Other OEMs are JUST starting to bring their cell assembly line plants online to ramp up their own BEV production.  Thus far, Tesla has seen very little competition, and they've had the lion's share of the lithium production to themselves.  Prices could go MUCH higher and shortages could hit ALL OEMs, including Tesla with all OEMs desperately competing for the metal... and if that happens going into a recession, it isn't like Tesla can just raise prices to offset it.  Other OEMs can simply push out more ICEVs / HEVs / PHEVs during the storm.\n\nNotice that even the bull cases on Tesla didn't see the target prices go up all that much.
