I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.  \nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.  \nHow to use it?  \n1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.  \n2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).  \n3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line  \n4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line  \n5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line  \n6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you). You can see example entries here: https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uySEqjQE.png  \nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!  \nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  \na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  \nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them  \nThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).  \nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media.

Don't go overboard on complex and arcane derivatives and such, but start researching and buy stocks. \n\nThe tried and true strategy for gaining wealth is just buying and holding + Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA). This has been the most successful wealth generation strategy for more than a century and has worked in every stock market condition including if you had started at the ATH prior to the great depression, the dot com bubble, or the great recession.\n\nStep 1 is to decide if you want to do this in a retirement plan and be unable to touch it until you retire but let it grow tax advantaged, or do this in a taxable account and retain access to it at the cost of having to pay taxes on it. If in doubt, put it in a retirement account.\n\nStep 2 is to decide how much money you could walk away from each month and not see for 15-45 years. for point of argument lets say you can afford 100/m. \n\nStep 3 is to pick an index. If you live in America the S&P 500 is the gold standard index that is the benchmark for how investors do each year. Everybody compares their performance to the S&P 500 and half of them underperform it. If you live outside the US pick the relevant index for your nation. SPLG is the most newbie friendly of the S&P 500 indexes at 52.78/share. \n\nStep 4 is to set up autodraft between your bank account and your brokerage account, or better yet, set up a direct deposit if your company allows you to split your paycheck into two place. Ie. if you get paid bi-weekly put $50 per paycheck into your brokerage account \n\nStep 5 is every time you can afford a share of your chosen index go on and buy it regardless of price. Seriously, ignore the price. If you can afford a share, buy it. \n\nStep 6 is to turn on Dividend Reinvesting (aka DRIP)\n\nStep 7 is to do this for 15 years or more until you retire regardless of market conditions. Ignore the news, it is for day traders and short term active traders, it doesn't hold any value for you. Every time you get a pay raise increase the amount you are contributing proportionately and try to increase the amount you are saving in your 401k + IRA + taxable brokerage account (or equivalent if you live outside the USA.) to at least 15% of your gross pay over time. More is always better.\n\nRule 1 of this strategy: Pretend the sell button doesn't exist. Just keep buying regardless of the price. You are going to pretend this money \n\nRule 2: Don't track your balance more often then when you are buying more shares. Just keep buying regardless of the price. If the stock market crashes, AWESOME you can buy MORE shares than you might otherwise have been able to buy. Even better for you.\n\nRule 3: Track your progress using share count not value.

They went on to talk about thermal benefits from a shorter electrical path (I.e: the electrons not having to travel from the ends of the roll to the single tab in the centre) which people misinterpreted to mean top cooling but they never actually said it out loud.\n\nThere were then a whole lot of articles written from that misunderstanding, but it never made sense, especially if they\u2019re using the top and bottom sheets for shear strength in a structural pack, the extruded tubes they use for cooling in the fins would weaken or flatten under load if they were formed as part of the top or bottom plates.\n\nTabless means the whole jelly roll is welded to a top cap and that top cap makes contact with the battery can; so even by cooling sides of the can you can still rapidly draw heat from the centre of the cell via the rolled foils and riveted center spindle far faster than a 2170, meaning the extra thickness of the jelly-roll doesn\u2019t matter because even through the fins are on the sides they still can pull heat from the entire cell.\n\nFeel free to link me to the timestamp of the videos where they say it if you wanna argue I\u2019m incorrect.

When such materials are used only on the components, it is referred to as encapsulation. \n\nBattery packs in some products are electrically insulated by simply shrink wrapping.
