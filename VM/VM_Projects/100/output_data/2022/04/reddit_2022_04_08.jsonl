{"title": "Transcript/Outline of Elon's speech", "selftext": "gonna talk past, present, future\n\n(points to car he drove in, a black roadster) -this is the first production car we ever made\n\nwhere did we start?\n\nstarted with Tesla roadster, manufactured power train in menlo park CA. Old Ford Dealership.\n\nWhen we started I thought, optimistically, we had a 10% chance of suceeding.\n\nThanks to incredible work of Tesla team over many years, we got here.\n\nwe now have Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, We've got the most expensive joke in the world, bu we did bring sexy back.\n\nWe've got cars in major segments, commercial and residential energy products.\n\nThanks to incredible work of Tesla team, 2/3 of EVs in the USA, have been made by the hard work of the Tesla team.\n\n\\[Manager of Giga Austin construction drives roadster away to applause\\]\n\nWe have FSD in beta, anyone here used it? Cheers\n\nYou can get a feel for how much FSD will transform society. Car will take you anywhere you want, 10x safer. Will revolutionize world. this is one of the things that comes along VERY rarely.\n\nWe're going to wide beta for all FSD drivers in North America this year.\n\nSO, this is now our 6th major factory, in three continents. Great for us to have two major auto factories in North America. Huge improvement for Tesla, better for environment because you don't have to ship across oceans. Way better to make the cars locally.\n\nWe're entering a new phase of Tesla's future with 6 factories. Scaling to extreme size as you can see, this building is not small.\n\nThis is also Tesla's global HQS.\n\nWhy Austin? Well, actually I asked the Tesla team, uh, California's great, we're continuing to expand, we ran out of room, we need a place where we can be REALLY big. There's no place like Texas.\n\nWe're ten minutes from the Airport, 15 from downtown. Thank you Austin, Travis County\n\nIt wasn't easy building this humongous building, can't express enough appreciation/gratitude for team that built gigatexas.\n\nDeep freeze, rain, quicksand, incredibly fast build, difficult, done\n\n\\[Shows scale graphic of factory on its side taller than Burj Khalifa\\]\n\nIt's 80 feet tall, equivalent to 3 pentagons. Buildings measured in pentagons are very larges.\n\nLargest factory in the world by volume.\n\nYou could fit 194B hamsters in the building.\n\nthis is the machine that builds the machine and this is the latest version of the machine. The factory is the product.\n\nPrototypes are easy, manufacturing is hard. This is the largest car factory the earth has every seen. Alien Tech. You know its advanced when it feels like an alien dreadnought landed.\n\nTook lessons from Fremont, buildings are separate, movement between buildings\n\nThink of factory like a chip, IC, combine everything together in one package. This is what you get. This is a case of raw materials come in one side, cell, pack, cast body, pack is structural, out comes finished product.\n\nRaw material in one side, cars out the other side.\n\nBuilding our own battery cells, we think the most advanced cell in the world here at Giga Texas. All footage you see is from this giga factory.\n\nOve time this will be the biggest cell factory in the world.\n\nAnother major innovation is structural pack. We're basically bringing to fruition the things we said we would do - rear casting, cells carry load, like an airplane. New model Y cells carry load, lighter, cheaper, better crash performance, fewer parts.\n\nrevolution in car manufacturing to make car out of three parts, rear, pack, front.\n\nwhat you're looking at are the biggest casting machines ever made. crazy to make a car this way, never done before.\n\nWe called the 6 major casting machine companies in the world, 5 said no, one said maybe. That sounded like yes.\n\nGreat effort from team to radically simplify the manufacturing of the car\n\nModel Y program alone .5M units/year, then we're gonna manufacture CT here. MY line will be the largest capacity line in the world, highest volume car factory in America. .5M/year in one building\n\nCT looks like CGI in real life but its not, that's an actual truck driving around. Cant wait for production, it will be epic.\n\nTesla is growing fastest pace of manufactured object in history. Now exceeded 1M cars in TTM.\n\nStill long way to go. \\[Shows bar chart showing Tesla is miniscule compared to global vehicle output in the world. 1%. We want to get to idk 20%, as much as we can to move the needle.\n\nScale matters, to make difference to sustainability, need a lot of cars, lot of stable packs, transition as quick as posible\n\nNEXT\n\nSo, what's next? Not gonna spill all beans right now \\[groans\\]\n\nWhat I can say is we're gonna move to truly massive scale, no company has ever achieved in history of humanity. Massive scale, FSD, dedicated robotaxi(!!)\n\ngonna look quite futuristic.\n\nTesla robot optimus, this will obviate what an economy even means. Anything humans don't want to do, optimus will do. It's gonna be an age of abundance. Hard to imagine, as you see it develop, we make it safe, no terminator stuff. Will transform world to a degree greater than the cars.\n\nShot at being in prod in v1 of optimus hopefully next year.\n\nCT will be in prod next year.\n\nWe will be in prod roadster, and with Semi. All coming.\n\nThis year about scaling up, next year, massive wave new products.\n\nLet's deliver first MIT teslas. \\[Music\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCT rolls out. Franz emerges.\n\nSo, we're gonna smash the window again\n\nF: I didn't bring my hammer this time\n\nWant me to do it? \\[cheers\\]\n\nI feel like I've broken enough things around here. Maybe we'll pass \\[crowd unsure... weird moment\\]\n\nF: Cyber Truck is worth the wait.\n\nE: You can see some of the changes, as you can see, no handles. Who needs handles? The truck knows you're there, knows the door needs to be opened.\n\nE: Magnum Opus\n\nE: We're gonna have incredible product next year.\n\nF: There's no other truck, everything else fails in comparison, this is the only one you need.\n\nE: sorry for delay, it's been an intense year. its' gonna be great.\n\nCool stuff we haven't talked about.\n\nThanks for coming, hope you're having a great time. Here at Tesla we believe in throwing great parties.\n\nLet's get this party started!\n\nI love you guys! \\[cheers\\]\n\nE+F leave in CT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCut to fireworks set to music outside.", "id": "tytqe4", "created_utc": 1649386584.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "So what I am hearing is \u201cinvest now or you will be left in the dust when we 20x\u201d.

If your shareholders are not rewarded than they can replace the board of directors and the fire CEO.\n\nIt is true that too much debt is a bad thing.
