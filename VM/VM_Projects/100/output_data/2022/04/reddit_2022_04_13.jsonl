{"title": "Why breaking things is not profitable (wars, destroyed production, repair costs)", "selftext": "It has come to my attention that at least some users here don't understand why the broken window fallacy is a fallacy. For those who have been misled into thinking war is somehow good for the economy it is time to take a reading field trip to Investopedia.com\n\nWhen money and productivity have to be spent to replace things or repair something that should already be working then they are lost. That money is not creating something new or invesing in the future. If that thing that is broken or needs replacement was intentionally damaged then that is a cost and not an investment. \n\n\nIf suddenly Amazon warehouses spontaneously ignite and need to be repaired that is not a benefit to AMZN nor the American economy nor the world economy. If someone went around destroying delivery trucks around AMZN distribution centers that would not be creating jobs for the economy and would not be adding to anyone or anything it would be reducing overall productivity. Instead of AMZN expanding distribution it is delayed while trying to fix what it **already had**.\n\n\n*The broken window fallacy argues that there is no economic gain from fixing the destruction caused by a certain event. Even though capital will be spent to repair any damages, that is only a maintenance cost that does not spur the economy in the long run, as it is not a true increase in economic output. The money and time spent on repairing damages could be spent on more productive goods and services. In war, resources are diverted to creating weapons as opposed to using those resources to invest in areas that could increase actual economic output.*\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp", "id": "u2ryuy", "created_utc": 1649861182.0, "score": 163, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Here's a completely non-hypothetical example that you have to understand:\n\nMy dad owned a construction business in Miami in the early 90's. He specialized in those aluminum pool enclosures. In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew hit South Florida and blew down damn near every pool enclosure That destruction brought my dad more business than he could handle.

Its a social thing to make people become a collective mind hive.\n\nThe primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of *doublethink*, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward.\n\nThe essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. \n\nIn principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. \n\nBy the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter\u2014set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call \u2018the proles\u2019. \n\nThe social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.\n\n- Emmanuel Goldstein, *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM*, Ch. 3 'War is Peace'", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5334174036979675}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3020053207874298}, {"body": "Unless those resources and capital were idle, which was the case during the Great Depression.

Capital would be better allocated to infrastructure, renewable energy, education, etc.  Projects that actually have a positive return in the long run.\n\nIn the same vein, however, if you're in a situation where production and labor are idle, then war can be a catalyst to get things moving again.

Economic gains are made in two ways: increase in population and increase in productivity. \n\nWar reduces population and reduces productivity. While a nation that remains undestroyed might temporarily be able to take advantage of others wrecked by war, overall economic output is reduced and the unaffected nation also becomes dragged down over time compared to if war never took place. Let me dumb this down:\n\n\\-----\n\nThere are three ants in a colony. Two of the ants farm for food. The third ant works to repair their nests. They pay each other money for their food and services. Each year, the three ants eat half the food they produce. The other half of food is sold to birds for money. The three ants have food, shelter, and money. They are happy. \n\nOne day, one of the two farming ants gets invaded by Russians and his field is flooded. That ant has to spend the next year building a dam to get rid of the water. The ants produce half the food that year. They still survive, but have no leftover food to sell to birds. The colony as a whole is poorer. \n\nThe ant who is working to build the dam grows no food and has no income for that year. He must also spend out of his savings to buy food for himself, and to pay the birds for dam construction materials. By the end of that year, the flooded ant is broke. During this time, he falls behind on making repairs to his nest. The repair ant also loses half his income for the year. \n\nWhile all of this is happening, the other farmer ant (America after WWII) is thrilled. He now has a monopoly on food and jacks up his prices 20% to enrich himself and fuck the other two ants during their dire times. The other two ants are forced to reduce their food spending. They become thin, but survive.\n\nThe following year, the flooded ant is farming again. However, he owes money to the birds and must pay 1/3rd of his annual income over the next three years to the birds instead of spend it on repairs. The repair ant doesn't owe the birds money, but his income is reduced due the indebted ant spending less on repairs. The American ant, after making a killing the previous year, does poorly because a) his farming competitor is supplying food again; b) the other two ants are poorer and are now spending less on food; c) the reduced food demand has caused an overall drop in food prices, so the birds are paying less for his exports.\n\nAfter five years, the three ants hire an accountant. Audit reveals that the colony has recovered well, is richer than five years ago, and the non-invaded ant is the richest of the three. Nevertheless, the entire colony has a whole has in fact undergone a depressive cycle and is poorer than a neighbouring colony that was never invaded. The Rich farming ant is 10% poorer than reference; the poor farming ant is 30% poorer, and the repair ant is 15% poorer. \n\n\\----\n\nNow scale that up to any multiplier you want and realize the mathematics are the same.

Business is mostly about keeping things working.\n\nThink of it like this: By magic, a machine spontaneously appears with a broken valve. It's useless without the valve.

What NVIDA has going for it is that it it\u2019s the furthest along in GPUs for deep learning/ML training, currently maintaining its lead through pushing more power/wattage with ridiculously huge cards/racks. Their GPUs are becoming less efficient, but they have to find ways to push the envelop with the diminishing returns from smaller lithography nodes. Thus far, NVIDIA GPUs are the engine of choice for training ML models and have even brushed off challengers like Graphcore.

{"title": "JPMorgan Profits Drop 42%, Bank Writes off Russian Assets", "selftext": "# Pre-Markets: JPMorgan (JPM) Hits New 52-Week Low!\n\nThe nation's largest bank by assets said it earned a profit of $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share, down from a profit of $14.3 billion, or $4.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results missed the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who were looking for JPMorgan to earn $2.72 a share, according to FactSet.\n\nMuch of JPMorgan's profit decline came because, the year before, the bank released more than $4 billion in credit reserves tied to the improving economy and waning COVID-19 pandemic. For more than a year, JPMorgan and other banks had been releasing the funds they had socked away to cover potentially bad loans. Those releases had boosted the bank's profits significantly, but investors knew these one-time bumps in profits were temporary.\n\nNow JPMorgan is going in reverse. The bank set aside $1.46 billion to write off its assets tied to Russia as well as assets that have been negatively exposed to persistently higher inflation. The bank said most of the Russian exposure was in its investment banking division as well as its asset management business.\n\n\"We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term \u2013 consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels \u2013 but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement.\n\nJPMorgan is the first of Wall Street big banks to report their results for the first quarter. Analysts expect Wall Street will report a modest, but noticeable, hit to its profits as banks individually report their exposure to Russia. JPMorgan had a modest business in Russia. Citigroup, which had both an investment bank and a consumer banking business, will report its results on Thursday.\n\nThe volatility in markets the first three months of the year due to Russia's invasion as well as inflation also negatively impacted the bank's trading desks. JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank posted a 26% decline in profits from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue and fees dropped sharply, as companies put deals on hold. Stock and bond trading revenues also declined.\n\n[CLICK TO ENLARGE CHART](https://preview.redd.it/9efrumedfat81.png?width=1467&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b4654ad8917a156d4a1ac5609c848ba1f3629a)", "id": "u2orq3", "created_utc": 1649851480.0, "score": 713, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|62|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|36|**Previous DD**|[x](https://banyanhill.com/i-think-pot-stocks-will-rise-1000-in-2022/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rwoq61/cwbhf_insiders_issued_125000_shares/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sd9k59/vampire_fangs_next_target_are_fat_juicy_faang/) [x](https://i.redd.it/8yywpknpcmu71.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q6lg2q/stocks_short_squeeze_rating_jumps_to_983/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q3wmii/whales_are_buying_cwbhf_what_is_your_opinion/) [x](https://stockscan.io/100-popular-stocks-robinhood) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwu3f/its_time_to_look_at_cannabis_stocks/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sdz9g2/the_following_10_stocks_have_short_sale_borrow/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u2orq3)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u2orq3)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46596264839172363}, {"body": "im in the process of moving to a homeless shelter", "score": 196, "replies": [{"body": "Transitory ?", "score": 96, "replies": [{"body": "They prefer the term \"migratory\" now, like birds.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "A group of squids is called a squad \ud83e\udd91", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "A bunch of crows is called a murder.
