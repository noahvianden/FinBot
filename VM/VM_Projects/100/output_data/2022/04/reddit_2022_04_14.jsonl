{"title": "Ryan Cohen's plan for BBBY and why its going higher.", "selftext": "BBBY is going higher and is going to turn everything around. This last earnings report was horrendous BUT there are some interesting clues in the earnings call we will get to later.\n\nLets start with Ryan's letter to Bed Bath:\n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)\n\nSome highlights here. The letter starts out setting the table that management has been garbage with giving returns to shareholders and throws a TON of shade on the CEO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai3z1jnsret81.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d23fbe9f6f5bf65c759131362056f5dc8d3d494\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzxqayz2set81.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cdf5d0bba31a4e45b1fccbbd88b7eaf1cc62719\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98h42lq9set81.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=11bb2cdaa340fc7cf616d16044bddc99cec360b3\n\nTLDR the CEO is only destroying the company. Returns are down in the market and sales are down while other retailers are doing the numbers they were doing before the pandemic, thus making the pandemic not an excuse for not executing. He goes on to point out the lack of insider ownership:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6lihbftset81.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=58aad3fa98775c6101c41ee1bd010720c3946f5f\n\nNow for the juicy stuff:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1krk194tet81.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d57db1e13adb77c6a763b14cf73c5c65c372f1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9p6dreptet81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ed4464118c709092810edc675a9f694f106cd42\n\nThe long of the short here is the market is valuing BBBY so low because the company IS going that direction right now. No insiders are buying, the company has little cash and cannot deploy cash to buy backs and invest in its infrastructure and continue to grow its brands all at the same time. THEY NEED CASH. So how do they get the cash? They sell BABY\n\nHow much cash can they raise with BABY though? Here is Ryan's thoughts:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/my4juvjguet81.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=949c948e64156e84906d0e71df23b046a4a6f08c\n\nHere is what Ryan is saying BABY is worth. Shout out to shark tank for always spamming 5x multiples at everyone when they say their biz is worth 5 million bucks on 20k sales. Going off this logic, if BABY doing sales by 2023 of 1.5 billion then applying the multiple means it could sell for 7.5 Billion.\n\nYou might think this is crazy, why would anyone pay 5x for a business's sales? Well they do it now. MSFT bought ATVI for 68.7 Billion when the 2021 revenues were only 8.8 Billion. That would be a multiple of 7.8. Berkshire Hathaway just bought Alleghany Corp for 11.6 Billion with sales of  about 1 Billion and that would be a 11x multiple. There are other examples but just know 5x is cheap for a big well known name with an established infrastructure and customer base like Bed Bath and Beyond.\n\nTo tie this all together, here is the current value of the company. The great news is that you don't need to bother looking up the share count on unreliable websites and estimates from yahoo finance that differ from market watch that are different from etrade. Here it is from the company itself on their earnings call today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5gsso9gxet81.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=b77e23c714fe7e76eff63027a8485940c90685a4\n\nSo we KNOW there are only 80 million shares out there. 80 million \\* 17.76 (todays close) = 1.420.8 Billion. Funny how the total equals 1.420 just saying when 04/20 is a week away haha.\n\nBUT if we valued BBBY just on BABY alone, the company would be worth 7.5 billion/80 million shares = 93.75. I have seen a TON of speculation as to why Ryan bought calls that exercise as high as $80/share. Well this gets interesting but its quite clear that if Ryan is right about value and they find a buyer, the share price here is going to over 90 which puts all these calls in the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az9azeclyet81.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9564a036cd937bee734e5d6ff34685583e5f826\n\nI did the math so your smooth brain does not have to. The total amount of options he purchased were 16,701 option contracts with a cost average of 1,785,257. NOTE these expire in Jan of 2023. Ryan does not give a dam about the actual value of these contracts at all. These contracts exist for exercise purposes only and are not going to be sold.\n\nRyan has 9.4 million shares right now in BBBY and this represents 9.8% of the outstanding shares according to the letter written back on March 6th. Links under the pictures:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s.wsj.net\\/public\\/resources\\/documents\\/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/2pbqvoukzet81.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa1560c779e328354dc4b356ff3624c2b462e2b)\n\nOn pure coincidence this is a very similar level to the GME letter that was sent back in Nov of 2020:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sec.gov\\/Archives\\/edgar\\/data\\/1326380\\/000101359420000821\\/rc13da3-111620.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/ad4xi7drzet81.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb71fefb6d69d081d8c6d0228e31a23389a685e3)\n\nAs we all know Ryan actually increased his share count recently and back in Dec 15th of 2020 after he already made the 9% stake in GME.\n\nNow for proof BBBY is listening to Cohen. This part of the letter calls for BBBY to stop commenting on certain things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8hd2loj1ft81.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdaf7bb18332a662e8f10a9b9df4fee44d28a318\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5r6thnr1ft81.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c2876aff197782f6752258d10e938d960df6da\n\nIts obvious that Cohen does not want BBBY to give anything away ever again. Here is the proof from the transcript of this earnings call today:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdysz0v22ft81.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=b592965a3350d1192864cdc2f19dc0c63bfffb6a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah93hky62ft81.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=f976fc2ce708d58167a29090b9ece7567435c024\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yimz24bb2ft81.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdc38ce5c70285fef6839fdc7456b5003c7c41e3\n\nSo its quite obvious that the board and the CEO are 1000% on board with Cohen here on the plans for the future. This being the case, then there is an extremely strong possibility that BABY gets sold and for a very hefty premium at that around 7.5 billion or higher.\n\nIf Ryan is Ryan here, he will be buying even more BBBY in the future. Considering the spacing of a purchase in August of GME and then a purchase in Dec even after GME moved up over 100% from what he bought it at, this could mean Ryan will buy BBBY even if it moves to the upside here probably in the next 3-4 months. But I would not even be shocked if he made the purchase even sooner than this.\n\nWhat moves stocks? NEWS. If you have been in this game for more than 1 day, you know NEWS is everything. NEWS will move your stock up 20% or down 20%. The market dgaf about anything except for NEWS. Theres an entire NEWS channel dedicated to the stock market, tickers are over tv programs that have nothing to do with stocks. Pure news will drive everything.\n\nWhen the market gets wind there might be a negotiation for BABY or a component of BBBY, this will move the stock, and its going to move hard. The market will have to acknowledge BBBY has an asset generating sales at 1.5 billion with a forward multiple of at least 5x. This company being worth 1.4 Billion is an absolute Joke. Their total liquidity from the earnings call IS their market cap!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.fool.com\\/earnings\\/call-transcripts\\/2022\\/04\\/13\\/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcr\\/](https://preview.redd.it/z6sm4o2x3ft81.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34d2eb2cb3fd64a5b21a3977e70adcdd3445aa0)\n\nThere are endless good news cycles ahead. Insider buying, share re purchase program, Ryan buying even more, BABY being sold. Even when the stock gets over 90, Ryan can literally just exercise his options and gain another 1.7 million shares giving him even more ownership.\n\nFor what it is worth, here is the major ownership levels if you care to dig further into who owns what:\n\n[https:\\/\\/whalewisdom.com\\/stock\\/bbby](https://preview.redd.it/awy620gq4ft81.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=da7aae952087cd321dc584b251b9a9b5882baa91)\n\nFeel free to correct me about anything you find wrong here. Too exhausted to go into Twitter but lets just end it with this :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr25y25p5ft81.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d53bba036825cc8bd47afc04af4e252e886da59\n\nIcahn was shorted by Ackman, held and even bought up to 25% of herbalife. Buffet holds forever. This name change is a clear message for everyone to get out of the way and get on board.\n\nEDIT: I am shadow banned here and the mods refused to do anything about it for the last two weeks.
