{"title": "Why the success of Apple M1 series is hard to replicate for other companies and x86 is here to stay", "selftext": "When the Apple M1 series came out, lots of people were saying that x86 is doomed, Intel and AMD will be out of business and every big tech companies will be designing their own ARM-based processor. In my opinion, these statements are quite detached from reality and is a display of lack of understanding of semiconductor and technology. Here's why:\n\n1. It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team: Apple started using their in-house designed ARM-based architecture with the iPhone 4S, which was released in 2011. They should be working on the architecture at least 2 years prior to that, which means it takes Apple more than 10 years to be able to build the M1 series. Almost every generation of Apple's in-house design has a huge efficiency advantage over the standard ARM core, which implies the design team of Apple is far more capable than the team in ARM and Qualcomm. Despite that, it still takes them more than 10 years to accumulate the technical legacy and experience to make the M1 series. Few other companies can afford to spend that amount of money and time do built a design team as capable as Apple's, even if they could, it could still be more expensive than just buying processors from Intel or AMD.\n2. It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architecture: processors are expensive, but the time of competent software engineers is even more expensive. Good software engineers are required if you want to migrate your software to a different ISA and have it performing well, and they are expensive and rare. It makes more financial sense for companies to assign these engineers to other purposes than to re-write software that runs fine on existing hardware. On top of that, most companies doesn't have the complete control over their platform like Apple does on OSX and iOS, which would makes this task even harder, more expensive and time-consuming.\n3. Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node: Apple started using the TSMC N5 process more than 1 year earlier than almost everybody else, which is a significant contributing factor to the efficiency advantage of the M1 series. Even datacenter products with extremely high margin such as the AMD EPYC and Nvidia A100 are one generation behind in terms of process node. It takes an insane amount of money to design a processor on the most advanced process node, hundreds of millions for N5, billions is expected for N3. If processor vendors like AMD and Nvidia can't race Apple to the most advanced node, processors for in-house usage by Google, Amazon or Microsoft definitely won't have the volume to do so.\n4. The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains \"only\" roughly 54 billion transistors.  While the M1 Max is powerful, it's definitely not as powerful as the RTX 3080 and 5900X combined, even if it contains more transistors. If only fabbing cost is considered, a M1 Max is more expensive to manufacture than 2 RTX 3080 since the cost per transistor stopped dropping since 28nm. The design of M1 series sacrifices transistor efficiency for energy efficiency, which makes sense for mobile products, but for HPC applications better transistor efficiency should be more desirable. AMD and Nvidia products are still more efficient in terms of computing power to manufacturing cost ratio.\n\nIn conclusion, the M1 series is the result of Apple pouring tremendous amount of resource over a long time, which most companies can't afford to do. Even if they could, it would probably make more financial sense to simply purchase processors from existing vendors.", "id": "u44fqe", "created_utc": 1650015895.0, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Apple started working on the arch in 2008 when they hired Jim Keller.

The larger battery is more likely to be limited by the charger.

If the large battery adds enough weight to make the car 20% less efficient from a wh/mile perspective, then the large battery may gain fewer miles per minute of charge time while the battery is low. As the battery charges though, the smaller battery will slow down. If the battery can only accept 1C at 70% soc, then by that point the 50 kwh battery will only be drawing 50 kw, where the 100 kwh battery will still be drawing 100 kw.

You might not be aware but in January of this year the US Appeals Court ruled that a company could not require all shareholder suits be filed and heard in Delaware's Chancery Courts. The case was Seafarers Pension Plan v. Bradway, Case No. 20-2244 (7th Cir. Jan. 7, 2022). In that case the court struck down a company's bylaw requiring that all shareholder derivative suits be filed in Delaware's Chancery Court, finding the provision effectively eliminated claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nDelaware Courts previously upheld bylaws requiring that stockholder litigation be brought in the state of incorporation or the courts of the state where the company has a significant interest (such as a principal place of business). Those decisions left open whether a bylaw could require that a federal law claim be brought in a state court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFiled by a Boeing stockholder, the complaint alleged that proxy disclosures relating to two 737 Max jetliner crashes violated \u00a7 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 of the Exchange Act, which prohibit false or misleading statements in public company proxy statements. The district court dismissed the complaint, finding Boeing\u2019s bylaws established the Chancery Court as the exclusive jurisdiction for derivative suits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn reversing, the Seventh Circuit held that while Delaware General Corporation Law \u00a7 115 \u201cgives corporations considerable leeway in writing bylaws,\u201d it \u201cdoes not empower corporations to use such techniques to opt out of the Exchange Act.\u201d The court found that in enacting \u00a7 115, Delaware\u2019s General Assembly \u201ccautioned\u201d that the measure \u201cwas not intended to authorize a provision that purports to foreclose suit in a federal court based on federal jurisdiction, nor is Section 115 intended to limit or expand the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or the Superior Court.\u201d The court stated that it understood the Delaware statute as authorizing bylaws requiring that federal law derivative claims be brought in a particular federal district court, but did not discuss whether such a bylaw would be valid.\n\nFWIW your comment was rude...", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "You managed to post all that and not realize it\u2019s specific to shareholder derivative suits.

Presumably you think poison pills should be legal and I'd love your reasoning as well.\n\nI think the most relevant thing to consider is last years decision by the Delaware Supreme Court invalidating the Poison Pill employed by The Williams Companies. You can read their order [HERE](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=326150). Of course there were lots of unanswered questions that were discussed in the Fried Frank Memo [HERE](https://www.deallawyers.com/login/member.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fMember%2fDocs%2fFirms%2fFried%2f12_21_poison.pdf) \\[login required\\]. Salient points below:\n\n\"*The Court of Chancery\u2019s decision raised numerous questions that the Supreme Court\u2019s brief ruling does not resolve. While some interpreted the lower court\u2019s decision as casting doubt on the validity of pills generally except when adopted as a response to an actual, specific threat of hostile activity against the company, we note that the Chancellor\u2019s opinion emphasized the \u201cunprecedented\u201d nature of the terms of the Williams pill.Most notably, the pill had a 5% trigger (instead of the usual trigger in the range of 10-20% in the context of an antitakeover threat). In addition, the pill had an unusually broad definition of beneficial ownership, an unusually broad acting-in-concert (\u201cwolfpack\u201d) provision, and an unusually narrow exclusion for passive investors.This combination of features, the Chancellor wrote, was more \u201cextreme\u201d than any pill the court had previously reviewed. The court stressed that the terms were so broad (in particular, with respect to the acting-in-concert provision) as to impinge on the stockholders\u2019 fundamental right to communicate with each other and the company in ordinary ways. Moreover, with respect to the \u201cpurely hypothetical\u201d nature of the threat to the company, we would note that there apparently was no corroboration that the board had actually identified even a general threat.*\"\n\nHere are the areas of uncertainty about the court's decision according to the memo:\n\n*\u2013 The extent to which a wholly non-specific threat to the company would be viewed as sufficient by the court in the context of a board that had more specifically considered the potential threat.\u2013 To what extent, even in the face of a purely hypothetical threat, a pill with typical, market (rather than \u201cextreme\u201d) terms would be validated by the court.\u2013 To what extent the court, in the face of an actual and specific threat to the company, would accept a pill with \u201cextreme\u201d terms.\u2013 Whether the court would apply the same analysis in the context of a pill directed against hostile takeover activity rather than shareholder activism.*\n\nThere have been LOTS of research on the impact of poison pills on shareholder value as I'm sure you are aware. The last paper I read on the topic was Bothmer's Erasmus School of Economics thesis titled, '[The effect of Poison Pills on Shareholder Value](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/43147/Bothmer-L.E.-410351-.pdf)'. Bothmer studied companies in the US and Canada that adopted poison pills between  2000 and 2017. It is worth a read but basically concludes that the adoption of a poison pill increases the bargaining power of management and can lead to higher premiums for shareholders. However, it can also deter a takeover, leading to a loss of potential premiums for shareholders and safeguard the current management from being fired.\n\nIn this case there isn't a clear opinion as to whether or not the poison pill will increase or decrease shareholder value. Mark Kelley from Stifel downgraded the company after the announcement while Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan thinks long term shareholders will benefit if the company remains public.

Obviously I'm making a LOT of mental leaps to get there 1. someone needs to file a suit, 2. it has to get to trial, 3. they have to call the two side of the GS house, 4. they have to be in a venue that allows jury trials... on and on.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "True", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08528656512498856}], "tickers": ["gs"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["gs"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "There\u2019s a difference between market price and the price for company control", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed...

The price target that GS research puts on a company has nothing to do with the price GS advisory may put on the same company. The fact that there is a price delta between the two is expected. Hopefully that is clear. \n\nThat being said, the various class action lawyers working on various plans for shareholder fiduciary and derivative suits have mentioned ([as did Elon himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514726980909948928)) that a jury will find the valuation delta suspect. If this case ever goes to trial in front of a jury (an unlikely scenario) the lawyers will have a field day examining both teams about the valuations.\n\nThat being said, the typical control premium for a company like Twitter is between 20-40%. In this case GS advisory is claiming it will be higher than 81%. The highest control premium in the last decade was around 46% if memory serves. \n\nHope that helps a little.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["gs"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3362419009208679}, {"body": "Different division within the company.
