Duh, of course it will be.\n\nThe thing that was really intriguing about his statement is that it was made in the context of a future vehicle line up.  Heretorfore, my thinking as well as others was that once Robotaxi becomes reality Tesla would stop selling cars to consumers and would instead only make Robotaxi's for itself. for the no-brainer reason they could make 10X the money on every vehicle plus each Robotaxi takes three ICE vehicles off the road.  Win win in terms of profit and their mission.\n\nBut now I'm thinking dedicated Robotaxis will be an addition to the vehicle lineup and not a replacement for selling to consumers.  I'm cool either way, the future profits and share price is going to be fantastical either way.  But I guess I lean more toward the combo approach.  I dunno, I just like the idea that people will still be able to buy and own their own Tesla regardless of the opportunity cost it represents to us shareholders.

{"title": "Real estate market and the broader economy", "selftext": "I know there will be lots of \"just short the housing market, bro\" responses, but I am more interested in the opinions of the OG WSB autists if you guys are still around. Full disclosure: I'm not involved in this market. \n\nPapa powell lowered fed rates to almost 0 during the beer virus and printed paper, so there were lots of easy money. This money first went into stonks and the market became too hot. Institutional investors had to find an alternative asset class and it seemed like they went into real estate. \n\nAs you have noticed, the housing market went crazy over the last few years. However, I also noticed this insane price hike is mostly for starter homes -- aka the houses for entry-level buyers getting their first home. These starters are single-family houses/apartments/duplexes/condos/townhouses, you get the idea. In contrast, my older wealthy friends' >$1M mansion had seen maybe 300k increase, while the starter houses my younger friends are looking to buy increased by x2 or x3. \n\nInvestors (instead of home buyers) purchased [\\>18% of all real estate sold in Q3 2021 alone](https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q3-2021/). Firms like BlackRock has bought 66 apartment complexes in my city -- **not** units, entire complexes. I also looked at the prospectus of two REITs (Vanguard VNQ and BlackRock USRT) and \"residential\" is the second-highest holding in these funds. The top holding is something called \"Specialized REIT\" -- I wonder if apartment complexes or residential RE holding companies count as such. In both funds' documents, they identified \"increasing interest rates\" as a significant risk factor. The point is, this is just two REITs. There are lots more of these institutional or even individual investors of various sizes buying up starter homes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all that said, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on where this is going and how it will end. The following is my speculation and thinking-out-loud, so probably not everything makes sense: \n\nIt seems to me like these institutions are cornering the market by controlling the supply and causing the price to increase, and then slowly selling these starter houses to any sucker who would be willing to pay the ridiculous price ... so are they holding a bunch of empty houses waiting for appreciation or are they also renting them out? How are the occupy rates? \n\nSwitching gears -- what about the packaging and reselling of these mortgages? Anything going on there? I know they [never stopped selling CDOs](https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/mKya3x) after 08/09. Like the film ending scene of 'the Big Short' pointed out they are now making 'boutique synthetic CDOs'  and call them 'bespoke tranche opportunity' and [there's a lot of activity in product](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N22B5Q2). \n\nAs interest rates start to increase, are institutions gonna fire sale and try to make their rival firms and new home buyers hold the bag? I'm not sure of the exact cause or mechanism but if they needed to cooperate and hold it all together, they wouldn't -- just look at how they handled Bill Hwang's swaps. They all agreed to slowly unwind, but right after the meeting when Credit Susse and UBS went to sleep, Goldman and Morgan immediate offloaded and tanked those stonks and market in general. That's relatively small in comparison to the entire housing market. \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, and insights on this.
