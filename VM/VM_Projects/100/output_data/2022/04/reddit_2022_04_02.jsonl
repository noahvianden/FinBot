{"title": "The 2/10 year yield curve has inverted", "selftext": "Debt is more risky when it's held over a longer time period. Therefore, 10 year bonds are supposed to have higher yields than the 2 year. Yield curve inversion indicates that the bond market sees significant risk higher risk of default in the short term.\n\nThis recession indicator predicted the last 10 out of 11 recessions. There's generally a lead time of 6 to 15 months once the yield curve inverts. The yield curve works so well because delusional optimists will always ignore it and claim that \"it's different this time\".\n\nDuring June of last year, I predicted that inflation would explode and the Fed will cause a market crash combating inflation by jacking up rates. I was right about inflation but wrong about the Fed's response to inflation. It takes positive real interest rates to effectively fight a run-away inflation. Interest rates needs to be higher than the inflation rate to achieve that.\n\n[https://www.etoro.com/posts/0\\_\\_entry\\_\\_ddf66af8-97be-478c-8677-02ff82165ea0](https://www.etoro.com/posts/0__entry__ddf66af8-97be-478c-8677-02ff82165ea0)\n\nIf inflation doesn't cool down, the endgame is either double digit inflation or a painful long term bear market that can last for many years. It can potentially be both like what we saw in the 1970s.\n\nStocks are vulnerable because leverage and debt that are sensitive to interest rates. Companies with D/E greater than 1.0 and negative cashflow are at risk of bankruptcy in a long term bear market. Commodities are the only real hedge against inflation.

This has been the most hectic first quarter for the market in a long time.  I don't have any major events to speculate on this week, I am now looking at the bond markets. \n\nI remember talking about the bond markets 2 months ago saying an inverted yield curve could come in the next 5 months.  The bond markets are moving very fast however, this is not a good sign and the yield curve actually inverted last week with a 7.5bp negative spread in 10Y and 2Y government bonds.  \n\nIn 2001 when the yield curve inverted this was just about at the top of the market, when the yield curve inverted in 2008 there was still another 8 months before the market crashed.  This shows us that after the yield curve inverts it is only the final speculators that will prop up the market.  In 2001 it was obvious to many big funds that these trash companies were going for an IPO and then running 1000%, they knew that there was a bubble so when the yield curve inverted it was only a short period of time that this speculation crashed.  In 2008 though, the bubble was less obvious to many retail investors and funds, everyone was sure that the housing market was very solid and would forever be.  This caused many people to continue buying even through the obvious signs of a recession (the yield curve inverting).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2esx9y1cj5r81.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=174fde35e21b44ac9431af1b9ac3d3b02cf85793\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hjnlfjdj5r81.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca999f349064faf40057b32eac2d49f1123dfa2f\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not dumb like we all think they are, they are just saying as much positive news as they possible can to try to keep a positive sentiment in the markets.

Tesla missed, and most definitely didn't surprise. Think of how it blew Q4 estimates out of the water compared to Q3. Everyone expected the same because they got used to it.\n\nNow, every company that has met or slightly beat estimates this quarter has been massacred simply because they were priced on 2021 growth trajectory, which is unachievable in2022 (beat revenue and profit? that's a -5% for you thank you very much).\n\nIn short, meeting estimates will not cut it to keep the share price flat.
