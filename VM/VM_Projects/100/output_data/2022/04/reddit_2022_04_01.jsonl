It isn't that it confuses me.  It's that I hate it.  Years ago, before the Navy, I was in a rather rough spot financially, living in my car, working three jobs, and just trying my damnedest not to drown.  In order to eat, I would go into restaurants that were closing for the day, and ask them politely to use a clean trash bag for any food they were discarding, so that when I dug it out of the trash it would at least be a decent pile of discarded food.  About 8 out of 10 times they'd just pack up the food and give it to me for free.  About 1 in 10 would use a clean trash bag, often with an apology that rules prevented them from just giving it to me.  The last 1 in 10 would tell me to get a job, kick me out, call the cops, and I would go hungry those nights. \n\nI'm lucky to have two dollars a week to invest.  I've been poorer.  I've been hungry.  I've begged so that I can make ends meet.  Any time I think about marketing, it puts me right back there.  I know its different.  I can look at it logically and say \"this isn't the same, I am providing them something for their money.\"  I just can't help it, it's who I am.  I'll ask for help when I need it, but I can't bring myself to beg for people to try my product, and that's what marketing boils down to, for me.\n\n*please note, I understand that marketing is not a job where you beg.

It ended up turning into enough that most people here would still laugh at my \"portfolio\", but as long as I keep making good decisions and investing correctly, I hope to grow it steadily enough to get debt free.\n\nAs for how I survive, I was injured in the Navy.  Their \"We break it we buy it\" policy has my bills almost entirely covered, and not a cent more.  So as long as I don't ever do anything that costs money, I can survive indefinitely.  I don't make \"fun\" purchases without a lot of saving up, and I am really trying to avoid pulling from my investment portfolio for any reason until it's enough to get me debt free.  Only need about a 10k% return on investment to get there, so hopefully while I am young enough to enjoy it.  \n\nAny other questions?  I'm an open book.

They are used instead of staircases almost everywhere (I would just say everywhere, but I didn't explore every type of ship, or even ever space in my ship, so I just know it was the only way to change decks for me) to save room, and do a wonderful job at letting people get from one floor to the next.

It shredded every ligament, tendon, muscle, pretty much the only thing holding the top half of my right leg to the bottom was my skin.  Jacked me right up.

There was also a 2 week wait for enlisted, 8 months for officer.  When I joined I was already in the state of financial hardship I described above, so getting in quickly was very important, coupled with the waiving of 80k in student loans, it was a no brainer.  But then my recruiter misfiled paperwork, and the loan \"magically\" didn't get paid.

Let alone browse wsb??", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I answered a similar question, but I've no qualms with answering again.  I was in the Navy for a while and ended up getting injured on the job.  They have a policy of \"we break it, we buy it\", so they cover most of my expenses to exist in perpetuity, so long as I don't spend any money on anything that isn't a bill.  If I want to do something that costs money, be it go to Starbucks or grab some avocado toast, I need to save up to do so.  My budget does allow for about $2 a week in play money though.  I would very much like my financial situation to change.  I don't need to be rich, don't want a yacht, fat checking account, cool car, new shoes, etc., my tastes are very cheap, I'd just like to be debt free, so that the money going towards debts becomes my new \"fun\" money.  So a while back I thought about putting that two dollars a week towards lotto tickets.  But I couldn't get passed the statistical unlikelihood of anything ever changing (I may or may not be a bit of a math nerd).  I figured two bucks every now and then spent in stocks would only be a complete loss if a company went bankrupt, as I'm fine with waiting out dips, and the two dollars was going to go to lotto tickets that won nothing anyway, so worst case scenario I am in the exact same boat, especially since I don't mess with options or any of that \"potentially lose more than you invest\" stuff.  A couple dollars became a couple more dollars, and right after GME happened I took a gamble and switched everything (mostly penny stocks, legit penny, not just \"under $5\") to buy a handful of AMC stock.  I waited a few days, and backed out early to avoid missing the peak.  This left me with a couple hundred dollars to either get out of the market and blow on one extravagant (for me) purchase like a new video game, some books, or a nice dinner, or I could reinvest it and hope to earn enough to pay off my debt and be done with it.  \n\nI decided to stick to the original plan, and am trying my best to find good things to invest in that are actually cost efficient.  Buying one share with all of that money in something like Tesla is pretty much a guaranteed return, sure, but if you buy a stock for $200 and it spikes up to even $250, you only earn another $50.  If I instead spent that money on stocks for $20 a share, or even better, $2 a share, if they go up eveb just $10 dollars, I've earned at least double what Tesla's $50 would have got me.  So I keep my investments in cheaper stocks that seem like they are about to spike upward, make a few dollars here and there off of a few cents raised, and keep an eye out for the next GME.  As is, I need about a 10,000% increase total to be debt free (factoring taxes into play) so I am trying to be realistic and not plan on that being anytime soon, but it's a dream that I am trying to implement realistically, and so far, I have been moving in the right direction.\n\nFor any reading this that want to help, I have like 6k shares in stock called GTLL.  It's OTC (won't do that again, $7 to buy cuts into profits hard when you are manipulating pennies, lesson learned).  So if you all could just invest millions into them until their stock becomes worth about $80 a share, it'd be appreciated \ud83d\ude00   if it helps, they are in the process of buying Tersus Tech (trades about 50 cents a share) and doing a share transfer to their stock, which *should* drive their price up on its own to at least half of that, and since it is currently less than a penny a share, jumping to even a five cents a share is a pretty drastic increase, depending on how much stock you have.  Those with 20k to invest could turn that into 100k (if it stops rising at a nickle) and are likely far less concerned with the $7 buy fee.  If not, that's okay to.
