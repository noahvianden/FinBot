The reason is if there aren\u2019t enough exclusives on Xbox Game Pass, I don\u2019t think it could really entice enough gamers as it only makes sense if you buy a lot of games. Also, Microsoft does want people to buy Xbox\u2019s. When you buy a third party Xbox games Microsoft takes a cut. When you buy a PlayStation game Sony takes a cut.
