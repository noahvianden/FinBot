Musk already owns over 20% of all Tesla shares, so he'd only need one or two other people/funds with 30% of the shares to be able to do whatever he wanted (within the limits of shareholder rights laws).\n\nThere's also lots of big funds that have been with Tesla and SpaceX for a long time. Musk also has a few billionaire friends as well. So I think getting to 50% control of the company to vote to take it private wouldn't be too hard for Musk.\n\nThen they just need to come up with money or debt to buy up the other 50% of the outstanding shares. I'd guess that this is where a sovereign wealth fund would be useful. Not to be the new owners of the company, but to be willing to make a huge investment at a set price, and probably get something out of it. For example, I think the Saudis wanted Tesla to open a factory or something in their country.\n\nI remember that there was an announcement just before Musk's \"going private\" tweet, that the Saudis had acquired 5% of all Tesla shares? I think Musk was actually worried about them buying up enough shares to cause a problem with him taking Tesla private on his terms. Or maybe he was actually worried that they'd just accumulate a controlling interest through shares/options and going private would be preferable?\n\nEither way, it seemed to me that Musk was willing to let them invest, but didn't want them taking control.

Musk can see very easily what the difference between running a private company (like SpaceX) and a public company is like.

Obvious they took advantage of the stock price shooting up to raise some, but they've mostly used to pull forward some infrastructure investments, paydown debt, etc. Stuff they could've easily just put off until cashflows could cover it.\n\nThe fact that Tesla was getting hammered in the markets and just in the media/online, while it was transitioning to be a cash printing machine is just crazy.

But that's not all the data: Netflix actually had a +500k subscription gain this quarter, IF WE EXCLUDE RUSSIA, SINCE RUSSIAN USERS WERE TEMPORARILY BANNED FROM USING THE PLATFORM\n\nIn Addition, Netflix upped their subscription price from by about 8%, which means that even tho they lost 1% of their userbase... they're still making more money than in  the last quarter.\n\nAND THE PRICE DROPPED 20% - Complete overreaction, the market got clickbaited basically\n\nConclusion: Netflix will have a positive earnings next time, as most of the subscriptions lost were Russians, who were prohibited from using the app/website. Netflix is down 20% AH and I hope it stays that way til Monday.
