Economists' latest forecasts also show the chance of a recession in the next 12 months has risen to 27.5% from 20% last month\n\nAccording to former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the United States will fall into a recession next year, and more and more economists are reaching a consensus on this.\n\nOn Friday, Summers pointed out on a TV show that the combination of \"overheating, policy delays, and supply shocks\" poses an extremely difficult set of challenges, so that a U.S. recession is \"clearly more difficult than no recession in the next few years.\" It is possible,\" adding that economists are gradually reaching such a consensus.\n\nData from a survey of economists does show that the probability of a recession they forecast in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.\n\nSummers emphasized that historically, the United States has not been without a recession within two years after inflation above 4% and unemployment below 4%. At present, the market's expectation for the US CPI in March has exceeded 8%, and the corresponding unemployment rate is 3.6%.\n\nSummers believes that if the Fed is to reduce inflation, it needs to properly weaken the labor market. He cited nominal wages (not adjusted for cost of living), which he said were surging at the fastest rate on record, with an annual rate of 5.6 per cent in March. And a recent co-authored paper by Summers shows that once nominal wage growth exceeds a certain rate \"say 4% or 4.5%\" it leads to worse, not better, outcomes in terms of household purchasing power.\n\nAnd right now, in the words of Summers, the U.S.\u2019s current 40-year high inflation means that average real wages last year were \u201cone of the worst performances we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Summers predicted as early as the middle of last year that U.S. inflation would reach 5% by the end of the year, much higher than the Fed\u2019s statement of 3.4% at the time, and the final data also confirmed Summers\u2019 prediction.", "id": "u0y4yf", "created_utc": 1649646942.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\"Doomsday\"?!

It could be summed up as: some businesses had supply chain problems and raised prices, and other businesses saw stimulus money in the economy and wanted to get their beaks a bit more wet. But they also figured why give a raise to anyone, there's a CTC now. It also doesn't help that a petrostate is under sanction, which pushes up gas prices, which is a big contributor to how inflation \"feels\" to the average person.\n\nSo every signal told businesses to raise prices without actually doing the other part of making sure the workforce could afford it. (I'm speaking in a very general sense, of course most individual businesses do not set their prices based on what their employees can afford.) Supply chain issues actually masked this a little bit by making certain things more difficult to acquire, such that only the more well off could afford them. This made the demand-supply ratio look really impressive, but the numerator and the denominator were both smaller numbers than anyone cared to admit. (No evidence for this, just trying to make a case here that might be worth thinking about.)\n\nIf that's the case, inflation should cool pretty naturally because demand will just starve out due to inflation, and businesses will wise up and see there's market share to be gained through lowering prices.\n\nI just tend to think low/zero real wage growth is an underreported aspect of this economy and will ultimately constrain inflation.

I\u2019m not too sure if it still results in a bull case here.\n\nThe way I see it is that there is going to be some hurt going on whether the fed raises rates or not. If the fed raises rates more aggressively, there will be some hurt in the short term like a recession, but things will eventually try to go back to normal. If the can is kicked down the road, it will look like a bubble of some pretty extreme proportions. Extreme inflation till nothing is affordable, then pop.

{"title": "Tesla Needs Lithium. Elon Musk Suggests It Might Get Into the Mining Business.", "selftext": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk lamented the rising cost of lithium in a recent tweet. He even suggested that Tesla might get into the mining business to help solve shortages of the key raw material that goes into rechargeable lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries.\n\nTesla-as-miner has far-reaching implications for the EV industry. Will locking up long-term lithium supply become a strategic imperative for the industry? Will other auto companies look to backward integrate into the EV battery supply chain? Those are longer term questions for investors to ponder. More immediately, lithium mining stocks\u2014most likely the smaller ones\u2014could react wildly in Monday trading. The larger, more established, players include Albemarle (ticker: ALB), Liven t (LTHM) and SQM (SQM). ( Livent still qualifies as a small capitalization stock.)\n\nThree smaller players include Piedmont Lithium (PLL), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Sigma Lithium (SGML.Canada). The three large players have a combined market capitalization of more than $50 billion. The three smaller players, which are in different stages of ramping up new projects, have a combined market cap of less than $10 billion. \u201cPrice price of lithium has gone to insane levels!\u201d tweeted Musk on April 8.\n\nHe has a point. Benchmark lithium prices are at about $78,000 a metric ton, up almost 80% year-to-date. The price for a basket of battery materials Barron\u2019s tracks is up about 60% year-to-date, theoretically adding roughly $2,000 to the price of an EV. Most battery materials, however, are bought on a contract basis. Most commodity prices quoted are spot prices. When spot is greater than contract, it is a sign that contract prices will move higher.\n\n\u201cTesla might have to get into the mining \\[and \\] refining directly at scale,\u201d said Musk, adding in a later tweet \u201cwe have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction \\[and\\] refinement.\u201d\n\nScale doesn\u2019t appear to be the big issue. There are large miners such as Albemarle that produce lithium for well less than $10,000 a metric ton, according to company documents and Barron\u2019s calculations. What\u2019s more, everyone in the lithium industry is investing for growth. Wall Street expects Albemarle\u2019s capital spending to be about $1.4 billion in 2022, more than double levels from just a few years ago.\n\nCurrent spot prices are good enough for miners to put capital into the ground. Instead, the issues appear to be EV demand growth, which is happening faster than people, and the time it takes for the mining industry to ramp up new capacity.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-lithium-elon-musk-51649610496?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-lithium-elon-musk-51649610496?mod=home-page)", "id": "u117cq", "created_utc": 1649658456.0, "score": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "Can we stop making posts about everything that Musk is saying?\n\nMust said he doesnt want a seat at Twitter\nMusk said is getting into miming business\nMusk said he will introduce a humanoid android next year\n\nMusk said this, Musk said that.\n\nOK I get it, he is the richest person in the world and highly influential.\n\nBut can we move on? \nHalf of his tweets are bs, posted without any thoughts.

When those sellers make a sale through Etsy.com, they will now be charged a transaction fee of\u00a06.5% of the price displayed for each listing, plus the amount charged for shipping and gift wrapping. The fee hike is the[ first of its type since 2018. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/etsy-sellers-strike-as-site-ramps-up-to-battle-amazon-11649681740?mod=hp_lead_pos4)The fee previously was 5%.\n\nSellers began discussing the fee hikes nearly two months ago on a\u00a0[Reddit thread for Etsy sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/t0ltfi/yikes_etsy_raising_transaction_fees_to_65/), expressing anger over the situation and questioning the company\u2019s true motives.
