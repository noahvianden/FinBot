Economists' latest forecasts also show the chance of a recession in the next 12 months has risen to 27.5% from 20% last month\n\nAccording to former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the United States will fall into a recession next year, and more and more economists are reaching a consensus on this.\n\nOn Friday, Summers pointed out on a TV show that the combination of \"overheating, policy delays, and supply shocks\" poses an extremely difficult set of challenges, so that a U.S. recession is \"clearly more difficult than no recession in the next few years.\" It is possible,\" adding that economists are gradually reaching such a consensus.\n\nData from a survey of economists does show that the probability of a recession they forecast in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.\n\nSummers emphasized that historically, the United States has not been without a recession within two years after inflation above 4% and unemployment below 4%. At present, the market's expectation for the US CPI in March has exceeded 8%, and the corresponding unemployment rate is 3.6%.\n\nSummers believes that if the Fed is to reduce inflation, it needs to properly weaken the labor market. He cited nominal wages (not adjusted for cost of living), which he said were surging at the fastest rate on record, with an annual rate of 5.6 per cent in March. And a recent co-authored paper by Summers shows that once nominal wage growth exceeds a certain rate \"say 4% or 4.5%\" it leads to worse, not better, outcomes in terms of household purchasing power.\n\nAnd right now, in the words of Summers, the U.S.\u2019s current 40-year high inflation means that average real wages last year were \u201cone of the worst performances we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Summers predicted as early as the middle of last year that U.S. inflation would reach 5% by the end of the year, much higher than the Fed\u2019s statement of 3.4% at the time, and the final data also confirmed Summers\u2019 prediction.", "id": "u0y4yf", "created_utc": 1649646942.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\"Doomsday\"?!

It could be summed up as: some businesses had supply chain problems and raised prices, and other businesses saw stimulus money in the economy and wanted to get their beaks a bit more wet. But they also figured why give a raise to anyone, there's a CTC now. It also doesn't help that a petrostate is under sanction, which pushes up gas prices, which is a big contributor to how inflation \"feels\" to the average person.\n\nSo every signal told businesses to raise prices without actually doing the other part of making sure the workforce could afford it. (I'm speaking in a very general sense, of course most individual businesses do not set their prices based on what their employees can afford.) Supply chain issues actually masked this a little bit by making certain things more difficult to acquire, such that only the more well off could afford them. This made the demand-supply ratio look really impressive, but the numerator and the denominator were both smaller numbers than anyone cared to admit. (No evidence for this, just trying to make a case here that might be worth thinking about.)\n\nIf that's the case, inflation should cool pretty naturally because demand will just starve out due to inflation, and businesses will wise up and see there's market share to be gained through lowering prices.\n\nI just tend to think low/zero real wage growth is an underreported aspect of this economy and will ultimately constrain inflation.

I\u2019m not too sure if it still results in a bull case here.\n\nThe way I see it is that there is going to be some hurt going on whether the fed raises rates or not. If the fed raises rates more aggressively, there will be some hurt in the short term like a recession, but things will eventually try to go back to normal. If the can is kicked down the road, it will look like a bubble of some pretty extreme proportions. Extreme inflation till nothing is affordable, then pop.

{"title": "Tesla Needs Lithium. Elon Musk Suggests It Might Get Into the Mining Business.", "selftext": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk lamented the rising cost of lithium in a recent tweet. He even suggested that Tesla might get into the mining business to help solve shortages of the key raw material that goes into rechargeable lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries.\n\nTesla-as-miner has far-reaching implications for the EV industry. Will locking up long-term lithium supply become a strategic imperative for the industry? Will other auto companies look to backward integrate into the EV battery supply chain? Those are longer term questions for investors to ponder. More immediately, lithium mining stocks\u2014most likely the smaller ones\u2014could react wildly in Monday trading. The larger, more established, players include Albemarle (ticker: ALB), Liven t (LTHM) and SQM (SQM). ( Livent still qualifies as a small capitalization stock.)\n\nThree smaller players include Piedmont Lithium (PLL), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Sigma Lithium (SGML.Canada). The three large players have a combined market capitalization of more than $50 billion. The three smaller players, which are in different stages of ramping up new projects, have a combined market cap of less than $10 billion. \u201cPrice price of lithium has gone to insane levels!\u201d tweeted Musk on April 8.\n\nHe has a point. Benchmark lithium prices are at about $78,000 a metric ton, up almost 80% year-to-date. The price for a basket of battery materials Barron\u2019s tracks is up about 60% year-to-date, theoretically adding roughly $2,000 to the price of an EV. Most battery materials, however, are bought on a contract basis. Most commodity prices quoted are spot prices. When spot is greater than contract, it is a sign that contract prices will move higher.\n\n\u201cTesla might have to get into the mining \\[and \\] refining directly at scale,\u201d said Musk, adding in a later tweet \u201cwe have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction \\[and\\] refinement.\u201d\n\nScale doesn\u2019t appear to be the big issue. There are large miners such as Albemarle that produce lithium for well less than $10,000 a metric ton, according to company documents and Barron\u2019s calculations. What\u2019s more, everyone in the lithium industry is investing for growth. Wall Street expects Albemarle\u2019s capital spending to be about $1.4 billion in 2022, more than double levels from just a few years ago.\n\nCurrent spot prices are good enough for miners to put capital into the ground. Instead, the issues appear to be EV demand growth, which is happening faster than people, and the time it takes for the mining industry to ramp up new capacity.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-lithium-elon-musk-51649610496?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-lithium-elon-musk-51649610496?mod=home-page)", "id": "u117cq", "created_utc": 1649658456.0, "score": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "Can we stop making posts about everything that Musk is saying?\n\nMust said he doesnt want a seat at Twitter\nMusk said is getting into miming business\nMusk said he will introduce a humanoid android next year\n\nMusk said this, Musk said that.\n\nOK I get it, he is the richest person in the world and highly influential.\n\nBut can we move on? \nHalf of his tweets are bs, posted without any thoughts.

The fee hike is the[ first of its type since 2018. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/etsy-sellers-strike-as-site-ramps-up-to-battle-amazon-11649681740?mod=hp_lead_pos4)The fee previously was 5%.\n\nSellers began discussing the fee hikes nearly two months ago on a\u00a0[Reddit thread for Etsy sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/t0ltfi/yikes_etsy_raising_transaction_fees_to_65/), expressing anger over the situation and questioning the company\u2019s true motives.

So for that, you need a basis for comparison. Is that IV high or low? If it's high, it probably will go down more than up. If it is low, it probably will go up more than down.\n\nOne comparison you can do is compare to the average over the previous 52-weeks. That will give you a sense of whether the current IV is high or low. You can do that with IV Percentile and/or IV Rank:\n\nhttps://www.projectfinance.com/iv-rank-percentile/\n\nNote: IV by itself **is useful** once you open the trade. Note down the IV at open and if the contract makes an unexpected move, you can compare current IV to the IV at open to see if that is the explanation.\n\n**Delta**\n\nAs a starting assumption, assume you want the highest delta you can afford. If you can't afford more than 19 delta, well then that's that. You might be undercapitalized to trade options. Ideally you should be able to afford at least 50 delta.\n\nDelta is proportional to probability of profit at expiration (sometimes called probability of ITM at expiration), so the higher your delta, the better chance you'll make a profit over your holding time (which need not be until expiration).\n\nIn general, the more confidence you have in your price forecast for the underlying, the lower in delta you can go. You are not doing so for delta, since higher delta is usually better all else equal, you are going low on delta in order to lower your initial cost of entry. Lower cost means higher leverage.\n\n**Expiration**\n\nTry to keep your expirations under 60 days. Why August?\n\n-----\n\nAs for the rest, they are not very relevant.

It's not usually that large. So your example gives you an overly optimistic sense of the risk. Imagine a more realistic situation where the OTM put pays $1 ($1 extrinsic + $0 intrinsic) and the ITM put pays $16 ($1 extrinsic + $15 intrinsic) credit. Since you \"pay back\" all of the intrinsic value during assignment (assuming the stock price is below the opening price, as it was for your $10 open vs. $9 expiration), there would be no advantage for the ITM put vs. the OTM put, but all the additional risks already stated.\n\nIf you should actually find such an OTM vs. ITM put difference in extrinsic value, that's a rare exploitable edge that is probably worth the risk of going for. But like I said, rare.\n\n> Psychologically it does suck, but mathematically you are paying the same as $10/share for something worth $9/share right? (since you got the credit)\n\nIf you are a person where math can overrule psychology, sure. But don't underestimate the power of emotion when it comes to trading.\n\n> Wouldn\u2019t the max gain for B change as the stock price increases?\n\nYes, I believe that is what I said. It cuts both ways. The assigned stock may go up and you make (save) more, or the stock goes down and you lose more.\n\n> Could you explain early assignment in layman terms?\n\nIt means exactly what the name says. If expiration is 5/20 and you get assigned on some day before 5/20, that would be an early assignment.\n\n> while event B has wiggle room from $11 to $25.\n\nSigh, that's not wiggle room. That's pure penalty! That's intrinsic value that you were \"loaned\" and that you have to \"pay back\" on assignment. You don't get to keep all of that intrinsic value unless the stock price rises *above* $25.  Since that is extremely unlikely, you are going to pay at least some part of that intrinsic value back through the unrealized loss on the stock.\n\nI don't think you've grasped the importance of that unrealized loss. If you paid $25 for something that cost $9, and you spend the credit that would have covered it, what happens if the stock never goes above $10 again for years? You will carry that unrealized loss on your books for all that time. Eventually, you may have to realize it. Then what? The money that would have covered it is long gone.\n\nAnd if your plan is to immediately dump the shares as soon as you can, why take assignment in the first place? You can sell to close the put for very close to the same net gain/loss on or near expiration day, and avoid all the hassle of shares and unrealized loss. It will just be realized loss, instead.

The logic is that these orders, as opposed to market orders, do not fill immediately. Am I correct here?\n\nNo, that's not the whole story.\n\nA better way to think about it is like this:\n\n* There is a market for every exchange-traded option contract\n\n* Sometimes the market has many different traders in it, including MMs, sometimes it's only MMs, maybe it's only one MM. But the constant is that at least one MM is active in the market for that contract.\n\n* Everyone in the market makes bids and offers on the contract. But those bids and offers may not be the actual prices traders will trade at. So while yes, there will be limit orders establishing bids and asks, there are also \"invisible\" price targets that traders in the market, including MMs, will fill a trade at. For example, say the bid/ask is 2.00/2.10. There is at least one active bid and one active ask at those prices, those are visible to the entire market. But, you can enter a bid to buy at 2.07 *that instantly fills*, because some trader in the market, usually an MM with a computer, had decided that 2.07 was an acceptable bid for a contract they wanted to sell, but if they could instead get someone to pay 2.10, all the better. So they're limit ask is 2.10, but they're *actual* acceptable trade price was 2.07. The 2.07 price is invisible.\n\n* There is an edge-case where the only bids are invisible bids. The actual listed bid will be $0, but that doesn't mean a seller can't fill an order. If there is an invisible bid for $.01 from an MM, it may be possible to fill for that price.\n\n* Market orders are neither here nor there in how the market functions.

Couldn't my friend - a casual retail user, not a MM - create liquidity by setting up a bid/ask spread through limit orders?\n\nYou have it backwards. The reason there is an MM in the market always is for when you *don't* have any friends trading that contract. When no one else will trade with you, at least one MM will. Otherwise, there will be pockets of no liquidity across the options market, which will cause chaos. You would be less likely to buy a call with a 1 year expiration if you had some doubt about whether there would be a market for your *profitable* call in a year. Exchanges don't want you to worry about that.\n\nBesides, MMs make good money. It's not like anyone is forcing them to create liquidity, it's a good business for them.\n\n> Are there well-known market makers in the US options market? Who are they?\n\nThere are several, most associated with big banks, but the biggest MM in the US is Citadel Securities, which is *also* a hedge fund.

You decide to buy a call option to benefit from an increase in the stock's price. **You purchase one call option with a strike price of $115** for one month in the future for 37 cents per contact. Your total cash outlay is $37 for the position plus fees and commissions (0.37 x 100 = $37).\n\n> If the stock rises to $116, your option will be worth $1, since you could exercise the option to acquire the stock for $115 per share and immediately resell it for $116 per share.

If the current price is 108 and the target price is 116, yes, $114 would make more than 115, 109 would make more than 114, etc. Okay, since *everything is trade-offs*, you have to give something up for that extra reward.

If the 115 costs .37, the 114 might cost .82, and the 109 might cost 6.69. So now your \"bigger profit\" of 116-109 is actually smaller, because you had to pay more for the call.\n\n* Your risk actually goes up, not down.

The quick answer that it's often better to take a profit early than late, here's why: [Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/risk_reward_and_exits)\n\nFirst, where are you getting those prices from, like $100 and $80? Is that the bid of the bid/ask, or the mark? The mark can jump up and down, even though the bid goes steadily up, so it's best to track the value of your call by the bid. The bid may understate your value a little, but better that than overstating. For example, you could get that pattern of up to $100, down to $80, with a bid/ask of $.75/$1.25 (mark is $1.00), then later a bid of $.78/$.82 (mark is $.80). So even though the mark went down, the bid went up.\n\nAssuming it was the bid and not the mark that went from $1.00 to $.80, the key phrase in your trade history is, \"it dropped.\" For long calls, once option traders start to doubt that the call is going to pay off, demand can dry up. So even though the closing price was higher than the intra-day stock price that got you an intra-day high value on the call, the drop may have \"spooked\" traders into being more cautious. Demand can also dry up towards the end of the day as day traders who don't want to hold overnight unwind their positions and dump positions on the market, depressing price.\n\nIf the underlying had just gone straight up with no detours downwards, your call probably would have finished higher. Though even in that situation it can still tail off and not rise in value as much as it did earlier in the day, if IV started high and declined during the day.\n\nFinally, don't dismiss theta just because you have 6 months to expiration. If you have a lot of extrinsic value, theta is still a risk. For a single day it would be a pretty small per-day loss, but those days add up. Five months of $.005 theta decay a day is still $.75 of cumulative loss. As a percentage of a $1.00 premium that is 100% extrinsic value, that is some serious decay.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5569033622741699}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5762287974357605}], "tickers": ["tsla", "vix"]}
