The end does not look in sight.\n\nI wanted to know what are the possible recommendations to get out of this situation with less or no loss?\n\nSo far, this is what I have considered:\n1. Keep rolling up(10$) every week until it reaches close to stock price. Currently, this method costs money.\n\n2. Roll up(900C) and out(140 DTE) to asses the situation later and collect premium\n\n3.
