The end does not look in sight.\n\nI wanted to know what are the possible recommendations to get out of this situation with less or no loss?\n\nSo far, this is what I have considered:\n1. Keep rolling up(10$) every week until it reaches close to stock price. Currently, this method costs money.\n\n2. Roll up(900C) and out(140 DTE) to asses the situation later and collect premium\n\n3.

Now to if Elon is pumping crypto, who knows and it doesn't matter. The difference between just being excited about something and pumping it is practically non existent. The important factor is that people follow Elon and trust his judgement, that means if he talks about things people might buy them. Lucky him, it's not a crime to be worth listening to. If he abuses that power then it will become obvious and people will stop trusting him, so the problem is self correcting.  \n\n\nBitcoin is too big to fail now.
