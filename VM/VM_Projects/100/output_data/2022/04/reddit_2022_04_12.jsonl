Do you truly believe that?\n\nThe stock and the company are separate and you can like one and not the other. Any way you look at it, no matter the type of calculation you go by P/E, P/FCF, DCF modeling, it is overpriced at this moment to get a good return in the long run. It's also predicated solely on Elon being driving factor. If he loved his company so much and their revenue was phenomenal and he greatly appreciated his shareholders as much as his customers whom buy these vehicles, then why does he continually dilute the shares? Have you checked out the share dilution graph QoQ or YoY? We're talking about some of the worst dilution with the exception of true meme companies that are just keeping themselves alive. He uses the shareholders and laughs all the way to the bank when he essentially gives and board approves his company 0% indefinite loans to spend on the company.\n\nI love Tesla and Elon as a company & visionary, don't get me wrong. I want a Tesla despite their quality control issues and the failure to release their FSD software still after continual promises. I think there is still much growth company side for Tesla, but the stock, for the moment and the foreseeable future is drastically overpriced if you actually want a good return over the next 5-10 years. I'm not a hardcore fundamentalist but I try to at least educate myself from a value perspective. In that, you want to evaluate the company, not just the market sentiment for the stock. What you are buying at this price is purely speculatory with a complete disconnect from any fundamental. Right now you are paying for all future cash flow. Most people don't like to look at competition but look at it from a historical sale perspective. There are only so many cars that one can make and sell globally. Compare that to the entirety of the vehicle market in the last 10yrs. Also, look at the potential EVs that are coming from large manufacturers over the next 3-5yrs. While Tesla is ahead right now, there are only so many people that will pay 50k out the door costs for a basic Model 3 with the current rising price from himself (so much for my 38k version). There are only so many people that are going to pay 80k for a truck (what it most likely will cost when it goes to production, lets face it), only so many people will pay 100k+ for the Model S/X. Unless he comes out with a $25k model, a significant percentage of the US population is not going to buy a Tesla vehicle. So, already limited there. I do acknowledge other business perspectives like Batteries, energy companies, and larges amount of other potential licensing deals but there are already other competing companies in all of those spaces. Also, he mentioned an IPO eventually for StarLink so that's not going to be part of $TSLA just like SpaceX is not going to be either.\n\nYou have to think realistically. If you were in the stock prior to the S&P 500 listing and before that 1st stock split then sure, I would say it was a justified P/E and long term investment potential. But, right now the stock at $1000+ is just ridiculous, no matter what YouTuber tells you, or how you think it might be justified. Just do a quick calculation for a return. If you even want a 12.5% reasonable \"historical market beating\" return for the next 5-10 yrs, you are saying the company will make TRILLIONS in revenue. Does that make sense to you?
