They have a simple model and the cost side is the one side they have a lot of control over.  The only risk side is subscribers and set price.\n\nMapped out, subscriptions are and have remained very near a linear trend, even into Q1 of 2022.  Q1 of 2022 isn't even an outlier or below the trend line of the last decade.  It has been and is still quite linear overall.\n\nThe revenue side is relatively simple in subscribers times subscription rate.  This mapped out, they were very linear from 2013 to mid 2017.  Then they began ramping up income along a higher slope through 2022.  Even Q1 2022 with the new rate, it's at the highest revenue it's ever been.  Revenue has ALWAYS gone up.  Q3 2017 and Q1 2022 are distinctly the two single large jumps in the revenue model.  History had also shown that the rate increase in Q3 of 2017 did NOT generate a significant loss of subscriptions, a slight immediate down tick, but otherwise overall continued to follow a largely linear path regardless.  If history is an indicator, the rate increase in Q1 of 2022 would generate a slight down tick in subscription growth but otherwise shouldn't really affect overall growth.  Additionally, the rate increase has always generated an overall net increase in revenue and a moderate bump in practice.\n\nNow how Netflix chooses to spend that cash is kind of irrelevant if it's not creating a subscription loss or ultimately a revenue loss.  Netflix can manage its expenses and where they choose to invest those dollars.  That's kind of the easy part after ensuring solid subscriber count and associated revenue.\n\nIn terms of subscribers, Netflix still dominates over HBO, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+.  Disney+ is the only one that's showing faster growth.  Hulu is much shallower.  HBO is mostly flat.  Amazon Prime is significant globally matching Netflix, but Prime encompasses so many other elements besides video streaming.  Even so, Netflix with just video alone, no shopping, no books, has more subscribers.\n\nSo, what's actually bad about Netflix?  What actually warrants a significant trending drop in stock price and a large stock dip recently?  I don't get it.  The input side of the equation is absolutely solid.

You could binge watch your favorite shows (The Office, Arrested Development, South Park, etc.) and that made it appealing to people.\n\nAs soon as the companies that own those shows began to pull content for their own competitor apps (Peacock, Hulu, Paramount, etc), Netflix went into panic mode *just to survive* and began to just throw insane amounts of money at film and TV talent to lure them in.

I actually had no idea KO was part of the dotcom bubble... \n\nThis does look a lot like what we see today with blue chip stocks like V and COST trading at 30+ PEs. Admittedly I've been far less surprised by the tech selloff than I have been by the relative strength we're seeing in certain large cap stocks. The strength large caps have shown over the last few months relative to the rest of the market has been extraordinary. You would think higher rates would bring some of these stocks down to more typical valuations, but high valuation stocks like COST just keep pushing higher. COST specifically is now trading at 2x it's historical PE ratio.\n\nI genuinely have no idea where to turn at this point. The S&P500 seems to be full of overvalued companies that haven't realised rates are rising, while many growth stocks (which would typically be a bad investment in a higher rate environment) seem to be trading at relatively attractive multiples and at least seem to be pricing in the rate increases and economic doubts. But even growth stocks aren't that cheap with many still trading at double digit PS ratios, and if the S&P500 is about to crash there is no way growth stocks won't follow the indexes lower.\n\nSo where does an investor turn? A lot of people seem to be investing in commodities and consumer staples right now which have preformed relatively better, but when you look at the holdings of an ETF like XLP you'll see that basically all of the holdings look extremely overvalued relative to their historical valuations -- a lot of these companies could drop 25-30% and would still be pricey. The only thing I feel any comfort doing right now is picking up solid companies that I feel confident holding long-term which have sold off somewhat. Stocks like GOOG, CRM, PYPL, DIS, etc are expensive, but at least they seem to be reflecting the reality of monetary tightening and are trading at decent discounts to their historical valuations. Still, I'm getting killed by momentum and sentiment on these names because no one wants to own them at the moment regardless of price. I'm also holding a large cash position which I've never done previously because I literally don't know where to put it. My S&P500 valuation model (which tends to be overly optimistic) is telling me that the index is at least 10% overvalued, which is the most overvalued it's been in the last 5 years. The only way the S&P500 isn't over valued is if you're comfortable assuming the bond market is wrong and that rates won't go as high as the bond market is pricing.\n\nI've been wrong for months on my call that large caps crash or growth stocks rally at this point though so it's likely I'm missing something. What I'm now wondering is if valuations don't really matter so long as investors continue to flee bonds and look to the stock market and blue chip stocks for perceived safety. Perhaps counter intuitively the real risk to the market now is that yields and inflation is peaking as this is likely push the investors fleeing to the stock market back into bonds.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "At the end of the day no one knows what's going to happen. Looks like you have a pretty good feel for things, however, so I'll share some of my thoughts that might help complete your theory. \n\nThe only thing I've found reliable is to look at history how frothy markets tend to move in the end game. (Whether it be in the dot-com bubble, or the crypto bubble in 2017, etc.) There is a lot of evidence out there that growthy/frothy stocks tend to get pummeled first, and then finally the large caps come down at the very end. I think the rationale is that investors leave the riskiest names first and rotate to safer ones. However, even the safer ones start to become a problem when there are major structural issues/overall pessimism in the markets. Bull markets don't last forever and sometimes having no position is the best thing.\n\nSo far it's playing out exactly how it played out in the dot-com bubble. I've been shorting speculative/high PS ratio stocks since November, got cut a little bit on the rebound in late March, but have been recently closing them. Last week I began sizing into shorts in expensive large cap stocks like $COST, $AAPL, $ABBV, $DE, to name a few. While growthy names can continue to slide downwards, the risk-reward isn't there anymore. Most of the names I shorted ($CVNA, $NET, $HUBS, $SHOP, etc.) have had large enough drawdowns and asking for another 50% more would be asking a lot. The large cap non-tech stocks I mentioned above, however, are a completely different story. You're spot on with the likes of $COST. They are extremely expensive right now, and while I wouldn't expect a 50% drawdown, I think a 20-30% drop is reasonable from here to reset valuations.\n\nThe stock market hasn't been listening to the bond market for the past few weeks. When it eventually does, turbulence will come fast. Honestly, you really can't fault funds/investors/retail for greeding hard for large-cap names like $AAPL and $COST.  A true bear market hasn't happened for more than a decade. In that time span, fortunes and careers were made off of being a perma-bull. Unfortunately, the vast majority of investors are perma-bulls now. Who can blame them? Year after year it's been ingrained in every investor that being a bear is a losing endeavor. Buy the f*cking dip if you want to succeed. Only when you see the large-cap names fall will the S&P500 enter a true bear market.

I don\u2019t remember the one who pushed it. You could probably remind though, ya?\n\nStates can ban abortion if their people vote for it. I personally don\u2019t care. If a woman wants that emotional baggage, I suppose that\u2019s on them. I don\u2019t think less of women who\u2019ve had abortions. I do think slightly less of people who think they\u2019re cool and fun though.\n\nIn terms of CRT and hyper sexual curriculum, same thing. States can ban that crap if they want. Their people should be able vote on that like everything else. Democrats blindly saying that parents don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for their kids is pretty out of touch, but I\u2019ll let you carry their water. You\u2019re doing a good enough job of it.\n\nCare to defend them any deeper man? Looks like you\u2019re pretty passionate about it.
