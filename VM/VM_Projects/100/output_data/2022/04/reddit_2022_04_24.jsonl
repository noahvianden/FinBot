Twit\u00adter\u2019s re\u00adsponse won\u2019t nec\u00ades\u00adsar\u00adily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for invit\u00ading other bid\u00adders or ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adat\u00ading with Mr. Musk on terms other than price.

He also pledged to solve the free-speech is\u00adsues he sees as plagu\u00ading the plat\u00adform and the coun\u00adtry more broadly, whether his bid suc\u00adceeds or not, they said.\n\nThe Tesla Inc. chief ex\u00adec\u00adu\u00adtive made his pitch to se\u00adlect share\u00adhold\u00aders in a se\u00adries of video calls, with a fo\u00adcus on ac\u00adtively man\u00adaged funds, the peo\u00adple said, in hopes that they could sway the com\u00adpa\u00adny\u2019s de\u00adci\u00adsion.\n\nMr. Musk said he sees no way Twit\u00adter man\u00adage\u00adment can get the stock to his of\u00adfer price on its own, given the is\u00adsues in the busi\u00adness and a per\u00adsis\u00adtent in\u00adabil\u00adity to cor\u00adrect them. It couldn\u2019t be learned if he de\u00adtailed spe\u00adcific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about want\u00ading to re\u00adduce the plat\u00adform\u2019s re\u00adliance on ad\u00adver\u00adtis\u00ading, as well as to make sim\u00adpler changes such as al\u00adlow\u00ading longer tweets.\n\nMr. Musk al\u00adready has some share\u00adhold\u00aders ral\u00adly\u00ading be\u00adhind him fol\u00adlow\u00ading the meet\u00adings.

{"title": "Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation", "selftext": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23036976/eu-digital-services-act-finalized-algorithms-targeted-advertising\n\nThe EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.\n\nEarly Saturday morning after hours of negotiations, the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act, or DSA, which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly, explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work, and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to six percent of their annual turnover for non-compliance.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world, too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU\u2019s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. While lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU\u2019s rules for inspiration.\n\nThe final text of the DSA has yet to be released, but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:\n\n* Targeted advertising based on an individuals\u2019 religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.\n\n* \u201cDark patterns\u201d \u2014 confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices \u2014 will be prohibited. The EU says that, as a rule, cancelling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.\n\n* Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (e.g. used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system \u201cnot based on profiling.\u201d In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).\n\n* Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content, as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal, though, and leaves this up to individual countries.\n\n* The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to \u201cprovide more insight into how online risks evolve.\u201d\n\n* Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.\n\n* Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).\n\nThe DSA will, like the DMA, distinguish between tech companies of different sizes, placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firm \u2014 those with at least 45 million users in the EU, like Meta and Google \u2014 will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA, particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.\n\nAlthough the broad terms of the DSA have now been agreed upon by the member states of the EU, the legal language still needs to be finalized and the act officially voted into law. This last step is seen as a formality at this point, though. The rules will apply to all companies 15 months after the act is voted into law, or from 1 January 2024, whichever is later.", "id": "uavfl8", "created_utc": 1650808968.0, "score": 1828, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 337, "comments": [{"body": "> In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).\n\nIt's several orders of magnitude easier to sort by date than by any of the ML-trained bullshit they're using which makes this \"recently introduced\" feature particularly fucking galling.", "score": 149, "replies": [{"body": "Relevancy might make for a better user experience but the real reason is sponsorship", "score": 53, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2517111599445343}, {"body": "Chronological also will be worse for their time on site metrics, which will hurt and revenue.
