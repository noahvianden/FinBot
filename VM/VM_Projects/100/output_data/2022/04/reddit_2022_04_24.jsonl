Twit\u00adter\u2019s re\u00adsponse won\u2019t nec\u00ades\u00adsar\u00adily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for invit\u00ading other bid\u00adders or ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adat\u00ading with Mr. Musk on terms other than price.

He also pledged to solve the free-speech is\u00adsues he sees as plagu\u00ading the plat\u00adform and the coun\u00adtry more broadly, whether his bid suc\u00adceeds or not, they said.\n\nThe Tesla Inc. chief ex\u00adec\u00adu\u00adtive made his pitch to se\u00adlect share\u00adhold\u00aders in a se\u00adries of video calls, with a fo\u00adcus on ac\u00adtively man\u00adaged funds, the peo\u00adple said, in hopes that they could sway the com\u00adpa\u00adny\u2019s de\u00adci\u00adsion.\n\nMr. Musk said he sees no way Twit\u00adter man\u00adage\u00adment can get the stock to his of\u00adfer price on its own, given the is\u00adsues in the busi\u00adness and a per\u00adsis\u00adtent in\u00adabil\u00adity to cor\u00adrect them. It couldn\u2019t be learned if he de\u00adtailed spe\u00adcific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about want\u00ading to re\u00adduce the plat\u00adform\u2019s re\u00adliance on ad\u00adver\u00adtis\u00ading, as well as to make sim\u00adpler changes such as al\u00adlow\u00ading longer tweets.\n\nMr. Musk al\u00adready has some share\u00adhold\u00aders ral\u00adly\u00ading be\u00adhind him fol\u00adlow\u00ading the meet\u00adings.
