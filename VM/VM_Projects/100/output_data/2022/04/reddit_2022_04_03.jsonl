Looking out the window or even driving around and scoping out the traffic is a very ineffective way to find a matching car like this, and while it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s not really something you can completely isolate yourself from. But having your cars photos posted online make them searchable often through easily filtered databases that can be sorted by color and keywords. Basically by having your car posted online and cached on Google images, it just makes you a low-hanging fruit and an easy target for plate-cloning criminals. I\u2019ve read a few articles about people who have been fighting tickets they claim were not from their vehicle, for months or even years. \nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-02/cloned-number-plates-suspected-as-woman-receives-speeding-fine/13203388", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This doesn't make sense.
