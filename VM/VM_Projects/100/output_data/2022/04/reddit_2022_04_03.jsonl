Basically by having your car posted online and cached on Google images, it just makes you a low-hanging fruit and an easy target for plate-cloning criminals. I\u2019ve read a few articles about people who have been fighting tickets they claim were not from their vehicle, for months or even years. \nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-02/cloned-number-plates-suspected-as-woman-receives-speeding-fine/13203388", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This doesn't make sense.

{"title": "One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.", "selftext": "**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.\n\nI also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.\n\nNote that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.\n\n**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\\_amd\\_the\\_king\\_of\\_the\\_titanic\\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)\n\nThe basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.\n\nAMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.\n\nBut when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.\n\nLet's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.\n\n\\---------\n\nMost people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.\n\nIn 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.\n\nIt's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.\n\n**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**\n\n* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**\n* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**\n* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**\n* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.\n* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU\n* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool\n* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.\n* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**\n* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives\n* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**\n* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**\n\n**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**\n\n* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**\n* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**\n* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**\n* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.\n* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges\n* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**\n* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**\n* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.\n\n**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**\n\n* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**\n* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance\n* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021\n* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum\n* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**\n\n**GPUs:**\n\n* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.\n* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup\n* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**\n* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**\n\n**Consoles:**\n\n* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)\n* Consoles are a low-margin business\n* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years\n\n**TSMC:**\n\n* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly\n* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.\n* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.\n* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**\n\n**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**\n\n* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**\n* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**\n* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance\n* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**\n* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc\n* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI\n* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie\n* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox\n* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon\n\n**My personal recommendation:**\n\n* You can own AMD\n* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD\n* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well.

The M1 is one of the tightest integrations ever seen in a laptop. This also means there is little to no customization / upgrade / serviceability with M1. Anything goes wrong, the whole laptop (basically the main board needs to swapped out). The M1 chip is basically the entire motherboard in a single chip. This is one of the many reason the performance is so good. It also means the M1 is one of the most expensive chips out there going as high as 70% of the total machine cost.

The efficiency advantage of Apple processor is more of the result of TSMC N5 node and the extremely capable design team of Apple than the ARM architecture. ARM doesn't have much efficiency advantage over x86 in HPC application in the same node and design of similar competence. The design is more important than the ISA.\n2. Designing a processor is extremely expensive, and the cost is rapidly increasing with each new node due to increased complexity. It would cost hundreds of millions, even billions to design a chip in N4 or more advanced node. Not many companies can afford that. Below a certain volume, it's more cost effective to buy chips from Intel or AMD than to fab your own chip with in-house ARM design, and that volume is getting larger.\n3. Building a competent chip design team takes a lot of time and money. A good processor design is built upon years of technical legacy. Apple started designing their own ARM-based architecture with the A5 in iPhone 4S. It takes them more than 10 years to become capable of making the M1 series. The design team at ARM is much less capable than the team at Apple and AMD. If Amazon or Microsoft want to design their own ARM-based architecture, it would takes them years to catch up with Apple. Before that, AMD would still be the better option. The only one have the potential to catch up with Apple in efficiency is Nuvia(Qualcomm), but they have nowhere near the budget of Apple and AMD.\n\nTL;DR: Processor will rely on economic of scale more in the future due to rapidly increasing design cost in advanced node, and it's easier to achieve economic of scale as a processor vendor that sells to many customers like AMD.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Well said!

By the time Putin invaded, more than 1/3 my portfolio was energy stocks. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/3pAXd3t", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36915692687034607}, {"body": "Same but more specifically in Uranium since early 2021.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38407742977142334}, {"body": "What\u2019s commodities", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Rocks and stuff", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "They're minerals Marie, Jesus.", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "Shut up HANK", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2386101335287094}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4833295941352844}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2557046711444855}, {"body": "Uranium.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20277532935142517}, {"body": "Urea", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "What company?
