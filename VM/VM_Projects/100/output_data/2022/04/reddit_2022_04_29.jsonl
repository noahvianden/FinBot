When people dont even want to own big caps and stay in cash, thats when there is no sellers left. We are seeing FB, N, AMZN, GOOG starting to sell off recently. AAPL, TSLA, MSFT are holding relatively well. Until these giants give in, I dont think we have reach a bottom yet.\n\nI have a target of QQQ near 285 when I start to DCA. Current holding SQQQ and weekly covered calls. Portfolio up 40% YTD. 7 years as a trader, if it means anything.\n\nP.S. comments just confirm I am right.

Tesla shares fell 12% that day, but edged higher on Wednesday by less than one percentage point.\n\nAs the filings became public, Musk wrote on Twitter, \u201cNo further TSLA sales planned after today.\u201d He made the remark in response to an account that heavily promotes Tesla stock, products and Musk on the social network.\n\nCNBC reached out to Tesla and Musk to ask exactly how he plans to use the proceeds, and whether he sold more Tesla shares after April 27, the latest date on the filings out Thursday. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk is bidding to buy Twitter and take the social media company private for $54.20 per share, around $44 billion total. In order to do so, Musk secured $25.5 billion of fully committed debt, including $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock.\n\nTwitter accepted his offer earlier this week, but the deal still requires shareholder and regulatory approval.\n\nMusk would have to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1 billion if he fails to secure enough funding to complete his deal to buy the social media business, according to a regulatory filing out Tuesday.\n\nOn the other hand, Twitter would owe Musk a $1 billion break-up fee if it accepts a competing offer, or if shareholders reject the deal, according to the same filing.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/elon-musk-sells-tesla-shares.html)", "id": "uecwqv", "created_utc": 1651203174.0, "score": 582, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "couple billion more to go right?", "score": 160, "replies": [{"body": "According to the information, he got a $13 billion loan and an additional $12.5 billion margin loan tied to Tesla stock to help finance the purchase and he said he'd use his own cash to pay for the rest.

Windows 95 was sold on floppy disk, and one of the craziest technological advancements was being able to sell Windows 98 on a CD-ROM instead.\n\nThe dotcom bubble was a bubble. Cisco went from like $15 a share to $80 a share, back down to $15 a share all in a couple years time. That's like GME meme shit. Would be funny seeing someone in the future look at the GME thing and be like \"It never recovered after 2021\".\n\nIt is unrealistic for a company that sells routers to reach their stock price they had during one of the biggest stock bubbles in human history. Just like it's unrealistic for GME to ever reach $480 again. \n\nNow the question is, are we in a tech bubble right now? I do not believe we are. Our technological advancement has been RAMPING since the mid 2000s. Look up the specs for the earliest smartphones and compare them to what we have now. My 2005 Honda Civic is a fossil that has windows that I have to manually roll down and an airbag that will shoot metal shrapnel at me if it deploys. Compare that to any modern car. \n\nTechnology advances in a multiplicative way, rather than additive. In 10 years, our current tech will look like ancient caveman shit.
