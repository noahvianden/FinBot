{"title": "SoFi company analysis and valuation - Big story and many risks ($SOFI)", "selftext": "SoFi has been a very popular retail stock and I underestimated the amount of information that was available for it. It took me quite some time to differentiate what is important and what isn't and this post is a summary of my findings and it includes valuation at the very end.\n\n**What is SoFi?**\n\nSoFi is a Fintech company that aspires to be a one-stop-shop for financial services, that allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money.\n\nNow, the main question is, well, **how is this different than a bank?** The management provides 4 differentiation points:\n\n1. Speed - being faster than the competitors when it comes to approval of loans, opening accounts, buying/selling stock through their platform, payments, etc. - In my opinion, although this industry has been around for hundreds of years, there's no doubt that certain parts of it have to be disrupted. However, my question is, assuming this is an advantage that SoFi has, is it sustainable for the next 5, 10, or 15 years? I don't think so.\n\n2. Selection of products - More products related to borrowing, saving, investing, and protecting money. I personally don't buy this differentiation point. I do believe cost-cutting is possible, but coming up with something new and innovative that's significantly different than the current offerings, I doubt it.\n\n3. Content - Financial education, research, insights - Even if SoFi has a platform that offers more financial education and research, this is something that is easily replicable. I don't see this as a huge long-term advantage.\n\n4. Convenience - Instead of having opening times between 9 and 5 from Monday to Friday, they want to offer the services 24/7. The company has an only online presence so they can cut some costs as they don't have to lease buildings for this purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The 3 segments**\n\nThe company has 3 segments and it is worth spending time understanding each one:\n\n1. The lending segment - self-explanatory - accounts for 75% of the total revenue\n2. The technology segment - which is related to Galileo - accounts for 19% of the total revenue\n3. The financial services segment - is related to all the products such as debit/credit cards, budgeting tools, investing, etc. - accounts for 6% of the total revenue\n\nAll 3 sectors have been growing fast, but we need more information to understand the second one.\n\nThe technology segment is related to an acquisition the company made back in 2020 (Galileo) and the purchase price was roughly $1.2b. At the time, that was almost 15% of the company's market cap. What SoFi got from the acquisition was a payment processing platform that uses AI for fraud detection, which is more efficient than the industry average. On top of that, it has an API that allows for app development. The revenue for SoFi will come in the form of platform fees and program management fees. This is one of their big bets and the management refers to this segment as the AWS of Fintech. The same way a business can be started on Amazon within a day, well, that's what they're aiming for, except for companies in the financial industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The growth story, the metrics, and the confusion**\n\nThe company provides two key metrics for its growth in its annual report.\n\n1. The # of users - This has significantly grown from 1m back in 2019, to almost 2m in 2020 to almost 3.5m in 2021. However, it is worth mentioning that every one that is registered on the platform is a member and remains one unless the terms of service are violated. So, if there's an inactive member for 3 years, it doesn't matter, that person will be considered a member. However, what I'm missing here is the revenue per user. Having users is good, but if they're not being monetized, the metric is useless.\n2. The # of products - If the first metric is not that useful, maybe this one serves a better job. If you as a member have a personal loan, well, that's one product. If you have a credit card, that's another one. If you are using their platform to invest, that's another one. The idea of the company to build a good relationship with its members and sell many of its products is great. Well, the number of products reported in 2021 was 5m. That translates to roughly 1.5 products per person. It did increase from 1.21 in 2019, but it isn't that impressive (yet). Although it sounds as if this could be a great metric, well, there's another trap here, not every product has the same value. 1m of these 5m products are related to the lending segment, which as mentioned above, accounts for 75% of the total revenue! The remaining 4m products bring in only 6% of the revenue as they're related to the financial services.\n\nSo, we have metrics that are not that reliable. What's next?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The company's performance and what can we expect?**\n\nIf we look at the company's performance, it is a money-losing company with a negative net margin of -48% for 2021 on its roughly $1b in revenue.\n\nA **mature** company in this industry has:\n\n\\- a net margin that's between 10-15% \n\n\\- high leverage (debt on the balance sheet being over 80% of the total passive)\n\n\\- RoE around 16%\n\nCurrently, the debt is around 50% of the balance sheet, so there's still a lot of room to grow.\n\nThese numbers should serve as a sanity check later on for my valuation as if I forecast anything that's significantly above that, it might be unreasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's next?**\n\nThe company made one large acquisition (Galileo) in 2020 for $1.2b. At the beginning of 2022, they announced the large acquisition of Technisys for $1.1b, which is a company that will serve as their core banking system. Both of these acquired companies have some presence in LATAM, so SoFi is acquiring new companies that have a presence in other geographical regions as well.\n\nThe analysts forecast about 50% revenue growth in 2022, followed by 41% revenue growth in 2023. Great growth, but slightly declining. At the same time, the net margin is expected to improve, from -48% in 2021, to :\n\n\\-21% in 2022\n\n\\-6% in 2023\n\n\\+5% in 2024\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The risks**\n\nDue to the actions being taken, there are two large risks that I see:\n\n1. **Execution** risk - Their big bet (The technology segment), currently accounts for less than 20% of the revenue and hasn't yet proven as successful.\n2. **Integration** risk - Combining SoFi with Galileo and Technisys might sound great and there's always the amazing word synergy being used, but that's yet to be seen in the financials. There's an integration risk here that needs to be addressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The valuation**\n\nTaking into account all the information above, I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value.\n\n**Revenue growth** \\- 898% in the next 10 years (following analysts' estimates for the next 2 years, then slowly declining). From $1b in 2020 to $10b in 2030.\n\n**Net margin** \\- From -48% in 2021 to 13.5% in 2030 - Close to industry average\n\n**Discount rate** \\- 12.8% (Based on cost of equity)\n\n**RoE** \\- Based on the assumptions above and the development of equity, the RoE is roughly 15%, which is close to the industry's average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPutting all the numbers together, and adjusting for the equity options and the preferred shares, the value of the company is **$8.8b** (almost $8/share). The current market cap is $6.5b.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that at the moment, I am looking at SoFi as a company that's not significantly different than the current ones in this industry.  I am aware that I could be significantly wrong in my assumptions and if I see a better performance from their technology segment, my storyline would significantly change.\n\nI'd like to get your view on the company and I am sure there are plenty of pieces in this puzzle that I have to learn more about.", "id": "u02410", "created_utc": 1649537792.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Something to note, Wall Street generally focuses on interest income rather than revenue for bank & credit card stocks, so some websites will show interest income as the revenue number.\n\n[Intvestopedia article on how to analyze bank/credit stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/bankfinancials.asp)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26704439520835876}, {"body": "Everytime someone makes a post about SOFI the stock drops another 10%", "score": 197, "replies": [{"body": "LMAO, I've seen a similar DD and forcast of SOFI when it's $20+. \n\nThis stock just keeps dropping, despite all the catalysts.", "score": 46, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7336075305938721}, {"body": "So short and keep posting?", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "There are plenty of SoFi shorts.

So, is your argument that they bought them at bargain prices?\n\nYes and no.\n\nIt isn't easy to explain but I'll try. Every time a company, any company, needs to integrate something new and rework their code base, it will take longer than it would have taken to do it earlier. Imagine you've built a 2 floor wooden house, then you decide that you want to make it have cement supports instead of the wooden ones. You will have a lot more work ahead of you compared to if you've done cement supports from the very beginning. Software is the same, when you have to rework your codebase, the longer you wait the more time and money it will take.\n\nThis is the reason Technisys was bought now and not lets say in a year or 2. I'll get back to Technisys after I talk about Galileo.\n\nGalileo has made 96.3mil in 2020 and 194.9mil in 2021. I don't really know how much it saved SoFi in expenses for a backend. So in 2 years after the purchase Galileo has made  almost 300mil revenue and has over 100% growth YoY in 2021. So excluding cost savings, Galileo has already returned 25% of its acquisition amount. The growth isn't expected to slow down seeing as SoFi bought Technisys. \n\nTechnisys operates in 16 different countries and has over 100mil customer accounts. Technisys also supports 60 banks, FinTechs and non financials, these can be offered to use Galileo much more easily, reducing CAC, at the same time the Galileo customers can be offered to use Technisys. \n\nFrom the acquisition PR, Technisys is expected to add cumulative 500-800mil until EOY 2025, Technisys will also save SoFi 75-85mil cumulatively in 2023 to 2025 after the integration with Galileo, and then 60-70mil annually afterwards.\n\nSo overall, Technisys will give SoFi 575-885mil cumulatively until EOY 2025, but this is excluding the benefit of additional markets that Technisys exists in and Galileo doesn't, which Galileo can now be marketed in.\n\nPeople call SoFi a bank and people call SoFi a lending company, when in fact it is more a tech company than either of those.

He also has never worked with big banks, and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.

I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10%.  Oil rose 35% in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5% which is going to shock the markets.  \n\nAnother factor, is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession, but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.  \n\nThe amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day, even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.\n\nI hate to be that person, but, over the last year with unemployment decreasing, spending increasing, and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80% without interfering.  At most there will be a 50% bear market similar to 2008.\n\nThe stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell, then it should recover in the following days.\n\n \\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more \n\n**TLDR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j38bqv92ajs81.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=39172bb2a032402fe4c78d52443440fff4a1a227\n\nI will respond to every comment!", "id": "tzxfou", "created_utc": 1649523682.0, "score": 103, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|660|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tzxfou/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_411/) \n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tzxfou)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tzxfou)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5952810049057007}, {"body": "Don\u2019t know a lot about the stock market but I\u2019m pretty sure your prediction for Friday is wrong.
