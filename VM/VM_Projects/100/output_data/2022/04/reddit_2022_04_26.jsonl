{"title": "As a TSLA holder- screw Elon Musk and his Twitter takeovrr", "selftext": "I am a TSLA holder and a spacex enthusiast. I have a lot of respect for Elon Musk as a visionary and pioneer. Tesla is an amazing company that withstood a lot of skepticism and has upended the automotive industry. Spacex is incredible in how they have created efficiencies for rockets as well as starlink. But why can\u2019t Elon focus on his core projects instead of going off the rails with the Twitter takeover. This stretches his resources and attention and doesn\u2019t really gain anything except clout. It screams of a vanity project and it hurts shareholders of Tesla and I am concerned for impact it may have on spacex.

I'm not a permabear and very open to changing opinions, but OP asked for some counter-arguments to this being the bottom, so here are a few.\n\n**Growth Valuations:**\n\nOne argument wis that, during COVID's money-printing & rock bottom interest rates, households were suddenly flush with cash, but couldn't leave the house. That seems to have caused demand to have been pulled forward, and spent online, where these tech companies could tax the sales essentially via ads and storefronts (FB & Amazon). Then, companies told investors at earnings meetings that this rate of growth was something that could be linearly projected out for all the following years to come.\n\nOne argument is that tech valuations are still priced based on the \"easy money\" COVID period. Low interest rates meant institutions bet \"risk on\", companies could borrow money and buy-back stock, etc. Also, the guidances companies gave during 2021 maybe over-extrapolated on earnings from demand-pulled forward.\n\nWhirlpool could be a good example, since they reported they're having less orders. If someone bought a Whirlpool dishwasher in 2021, they probably won't need another for years. Yet you could imagine that Whirlpool has probably hired more people since tons of people moved around during COVID and upgraded their house. But now orders are falling at a time when input costs are rising (PPI) and wages are rising.\n\nRather than selling 10 dishwashers per year for 5 years, I guess it's like having a discount and getting 50 dishwashers sales in 1 year. But then telling investors that they can expect to have 60 diswasher sales in year 2, based on these year 1 numbers.\n\n**Energy:**\n\nYou've also got the energy scenario. For example, Russia is aiming to capture southern Ukraine, which would affect energy supply to the West - I think since Ukraine would have territory from which to extract hydrocarbons. The main point here is that consumers will be \"taxed\" by these higher costs in all sorts of ways (cost of food due to fertilizer production costs, shipping, plastics, gasoline at the pump).\n\nIt could be hard for markets to price-in unpredictable outcomes in the war.\n\n**Business With Europe:**\n\nThe war also puts Europe at risk of recession, and many large-caps that make up the S&P500, Nasdaq do business in Europe (Facebook, Google, Tesla). Russia will affect their business as it did for Netflix, but there's pressure if European markets have less to spend on products.\n\n**Food:**\n\nRussia & Ukraine & Belarus are responsible for lots of stuff related to food. So imagine you're playing Catan, and the robber is placed on the main wheat square - for months on end, with no clear end in sight. People will bid up the price of wheat. It means less money for people to spend on discretionary things like a new Wayfair lamp.\n\n**Bonds:**\n\nIt's worth keeping an eye on the bond markets too. They've been selling-off for weeks now, and bond yields have been breaking upward resistances. These higher yields may start to attract individuals and institutions who prefer a guaranteed 3% return with the possibility of a bond bull market as an exit (may be a long ways yet, who knows), rather than growth stocks.\n\n**Quantitative Tightening:**\n\nThe Fed is gearing up to do the opposite of what it did during COVID. During COVID, the Fed pumped I think around $80 billion per month into the markets. They'll be doing the opposite probably starting around May 5th, taking $95 billion out of the markets per month.\n\n**FX:**\n\nI'm ignorant on the inner workings of this, but the Yen and Yuan are apparently causing lots of volatility in Forex markets which have been linked with the recent rise in the equity volatility.\n\nI'll add that these notes aren't meant to convince or persuade anyone, but just to keep the dialogue going.

Bloomberg Economics\u2019 recession-probability model has estimated a 44% chance of recession happening before January 2024.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said their goal is to achieve a soft landing -- cooling the U.S. economy to bring inflation back down toward their 2% goal while preserving a robust labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May 3-4 meeting and announce it\u2019ll start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet.\nIn the Deutsche economists\u2019 view, the FOMC\u2019s plans to raise rates to a neutral level -- one that neither stimulates nor contracts growth -- of around 2.5% won\u2019t go nearly far enough to ease inflation. That\u2019s because of a rising-price psychology taking root among American households, and an extremely tight labor market, where unemployment has fallen to 3.6%. \nDeutsche estimated a neutral rate that\u2019s much higher than the Fed\u2019s view, around 5%, and projected the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will rise to 4.5% to 5%.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "So what Bloomberg bought?\nSpy 300 Puts June 2023?\n\nJust because someone said it does not mean it's true. \n\nI remember back in April 2020 when all analysts were saying sell your stocks at the next rally. \nThe market cannot and never in the history had V shape recovery so soon after 30% plus crash.\nThey were predicting a double bottom when prices would test the mid March lows and afterwards the next bull circle will begin. \nIt looked like a logical theory back then with all Covid uncertainties but guess what. \nIt never happened.

Gangs will grow in size, more violent, gun crimes at record levels will only go higher, the same with drug use which is at record levels now. What are now termed high crime cities like Philadelphia will become nightmares. \n\nMaybe over stated and over simplified but this will be the general trend going forward.\n\nLike every severe down turn, those with Cash are king and at a certain point in the new economic cycle will present opportunities to aquire key asset's at a huge discount.\n\n things to consider,, let's just assume this downturn cycle lasts 10 years. You need to factor in climate change effects over that period.\n\nExample, California wild fires increasing etc,  Texas assets (homes,land etc) will be selling at a huge discount, much more then last economic downturn). I would avoid areas such as this for the mere fact tempetures and humidity would have rising dramatically over a 10 year period as we emerge from this downturn. Same thing with Arizona, Florida in general. Would you want to live in such harsh  environment? \n\nExpect a population migration from the lower & Western of the US to more hospital cliamet areas. This will result in new economic centers in northern cliamets appearing as people move in. Land near water will rise dramatically in value etc,,now this doesn't mean the entire south & west will be waste lands, as there are key manufacturers and other economic areas that will flourish, example, chip plants, but I do expect the security around these economic area to increase, if only to prevent large groups of migrating people from swamping the area and overwhelming it with desperate people. There will be a dramatic shift in where we grow our food, new areas will become available as they warm up, while others close simply because they don't have the water supply or the temperatures are to high.\n\nThe southern Mexican boarder will become a war zone as hundreds of millions flee higher temperatures and humidity.

{"title": "A Rebuttal to the \"TSLA is overvalued\" argument:", "selftext": "Given today's massive selloff, I thought this was a good time to post this. It's a long post but hopefully it gives you context.\n\nThe word on Wall Street has changed over the past year or so with regards to Tesla. You see it in the MSM\u2019s narrative. The naysayers who used to say Tesla is going bankrupt now mostly realize this isn\u2019t the case (GLJ research anyone?). So now the anti-TSLA narrative is a bit of the \u201ccompetition is coming\u201d (TSLA has its lowest inventory ever this year despite years of max \u201ccompetition\u201d) but even more of \u201cit\u2019s a great stock, but overvalued.\u201dThe natural question then is\u2026overvalued compared to what? The Old dying OEM\u2019s? Here\u2019s a litany of reasoning underlying why I think a 1:1 comparison to Tesla and the other car manufacturers is silly and why Tesla deserves a far far far higher multiple compared to the dinosaurs. I tried to order them from most to least compelling, but I believe they\u2019re all compelling. I also don\u2019t discuss Tesla\u2019s other businesses (FSD, software, energy, solar, robot?) because they\u2019re somewhat speculative and I wanted to stick to the most objective measures possible.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTSLA has the highest gross automotive margins in the industry except the Ferrari\u2019s and the Aston Martin\u2019s of the world. This quarter\u2019s (Q1 2022) gross automotive margins are even higher than Mercedes' margins despite more than double the volume and without the past 6 month\u2019s car price increases being reflected yet. Its operating margin is about Triple the industry average. Why aren\u2019t they given triple the credit per car, especially since this is a sustained, long term upward trajectory and not just an aberrant quarter? Remember, this is about trends. And the long-term trends are extremely obvious.\n\n\\-TSLA financials are this great despite minimal economies of scale. It is presently 10-20% the size of the old OEM\u2019s; as Tesla\u2019s size increases, so will operating leverage leading to even higher operating margin (ie fixed costs become a smaller and smaller portion of the total costs). While some would argue that Tesla\u2019s average selling price (ASP) is too high to be sustainable at higher volumes (say millions of cars a year), the EV market has doubled every year in size for the past several years outpacing even Tesla\u2019s production and thus increasing the relative demand on all EV\u2019s. I would argue this is what is driving higher selling prices more than supply chain/material constraints. This is also seen in the secondary markets with resale value and EV\u2019s actually appreciating after sale, especially Tesla\u2019s.\n\n\\-TSLA has a number of drivers suggesting even more capital efficiency in the future thanks to things like more efficient factory layouts, more efficient build times secondary to proprietary giga casting, greater vertical integration, and increasing operating leverage from expansion. TSLA also has operational efficiency that is fairly incredible. Tesla is already able to produce many times the number of cars per year from each individual factory line compared to old OEM\u2019s who theoretically have decades more experience with the Toyota method (see VW\u2019s CEO openly admitting that Tesla can build cars \\~3x more quickly than they can). So, all other things being, equal, why doesn\u2019t that deserve a higher multiple?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-TSLA is far more efficient at investing in capital compared to just about all car manufacturers ever. As a single measure, ROIC is probably the most robust measure of a company\u2019s financial health.. As of 2022, Volkswagen is around 4.5% for the TTM. Ford is at 4.6%. GM is 2.4%. Toyota\u2019s at 4.35%  Tesla? It\u2019s at 16.7% and probably growing because of expanding operating leverage. So Tesla is able to invest around 4 TIMES more efficiently and make each dollar in CAPEX stretch 4x as far as the other OEM\u2019s. This is absurd, because unlike most of the \u201ccompetition,\u201d TSLA is growing ridiculously rapidly and somehow doesn\u2019t have to burn huge $$$ to do it. In fact, this ridiculous capital efficiency is why they were able to have EXPAND free cash on hand despite simultaneously building two of the largest factories on earth by volume and capacity AND paying off their debts to nearly zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Speaking of debt, Ford, GM, VW EACH have approximately 1000 TIMES the debt that Tesla does. TSLA could have paid off it\u2019s debt last year with a fraction of quarterly incomes as a rounding error in its statement. By contrast the old OEM\u2019s would need a 10-20 year + of only paying off their loans to pay off their debts. Ford spends \\~700 million/year just paying off the INTEREST of its \\~150 billion in debt.  The OEM\u2019s debt to income ratio is approximately 10 (higher is worse) and Tesla\u2019s is approximately  0.01% . No\u2026.didn\u2019t misplace the decimal\u2026.that is a STARK difference. Now\u2026this comparison involves a healthy caveat\u2026not all debt is bad debt. But the enormous difference comes down to being invested in the wrong technology and inefficient manufacturing techniques/Technology. It feels like comparing a healthy and profitable company to competitors that are very near bankruptcy by multiple objective measures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Speaking of near bankruptcy, the old OEM\u2019s have had year over year declining sales in volume totals for the past 5 years. Let me repeat that\u2026.5 years of declining automotive sales across all markets across almost all brands ((Toyota, GM, Ford, VW) ). Hint:  It wasn\u2019t just the pandemic. Ford for example is down \\~30-40% over the past 5 years. TSLA by comparison is one of the fastest growing companies in history growing at \\~60% by car sales per year over the past decade. And despite sticky narratives about down quarters in isolated markets, Tesla is selling every car it makes (record low-inventory this quarter of only 12 Model S plaids company-wide) despite immense expansion. In fact, it\u2019s world\u2019s share of the overall OEM market has been growing consistently. And that\u2019s all that really matters. So\u2026doesn\u2019t a growing and highly profitable company deserve a higher multiple compared to a slowly dying one?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-TSLA has access to unlimited capital in an emergency due to its incredibly high valuation. However, because of their incredible financials, they won\u2019t ever need to dilute stock again to raise capital seeing as how they have 20+ billion dollars on cash, expanded this despite the above CAPEX, and have an absurd ROIC for a manufacturing company. The OEM\u2019s, on the other hand, desperately need more cash to invest many billions into making OEM\u2019s.  \n\n\n\\-EV manufacturing has one MAJOR long-term bottleneck: the availability of Batteries. I know we\u2019re used to chips being the limiting factor, but that\u2019s more of an isolated this year thing related to Covid. Long-term, the world is going to need at least 20 times the batteries we have available to ramp up EV production to the point where ICE is actually a minority of cars sold. Seeing as how the OEM\u2019s never wanted to expand EV\u2019s (too expensive to make with too little scale, they must be sold at a loss to compete on specs, required devesting from ICE, new manufacturing headaches etc.) in the first place, obviously they never bothered to acquire long term supply contacts with battery or mineral manufacturers. Obviously Tesla has, which is why Elon is confident that for the first time ever, Tesla won\u2019t be battery constrained this year. And\u2026more importantly, it\u2019s started to manufacture its own proprietary cells and chemistries in house. Only BYD does this. BYD is also the only other profitable EV manufacturer in the world\u2026.funny how that works..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-TSLA has access to the very best engineering talent in the world. Survey after survey has shown that TSLA is either number 1 or 2 on the list of top places engineers want to work at after college. The best engineers drive innovation and change. None of the other OEM\u2019s are even in the top 10 in these surveys. This is an enormous long-term differentiator whose effects will  compound each year.-TSLA is the only major EV player with its own differentiated supercharging network. People who use EV\u2019s know what a big deal this is. Charge point and Electrify America suck and they have to accommodate every single other EV from every single other manufacturer. The latter was made by VW thanks to a fine after dieselgate and has chargers that are consistently broken and low wattage. If we are to argue that charging remains the largest sticking point for the wide-spread adoptions of EV\u2019s,\n\n\n-TSLA doesn\u2019t lose margin to dealerships and won\u2019t need to pay dealerships to sell cars they don\u2019t want to. You buy the car, the car comes to you and you know how much it will cost. This is big deal for those of us who hate the day of pain that dealerships cause us which is basically everyone. This is a small part of what\u2019s driving Tesla\u2019s incredible demand.\n\n\\-The Competition has paid (and will continue to pay) TSLA billions of dollars because they didn\u2019t make a switch to EV\u2019s fast enough. This is a negative multiple for them and a positive multiple for TSLA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary: I think a lot of the above differences come down to long-term vs. short term thinking by company management. Most members of a company\u2019s board are incentivized to show short-term profits by any means over long-term sustainability. Tesla has decided to take the longest and most optimal long-term path over showing profits, which is a short term and painful gamble. Elon famously stated that if all he cared about was making profits, they could have made Tesla profitable a decade ago by just selling Roadsters. Tesla\u2019s goal, however, is sustainable energy which famously involves \u201cExtreme scale\u201d and so being small and profitable was never the goal. Contrast this type of thinking to automotive CEO\u2019s. The car manufacturing is a terrible one with horrible margins and marginally differentiated products. The barrier to entry was simply that the business model is very risky with high CAPEX and low margins resulting in really really high debt burden. This is why the overwhelming majority of all car manufacturers ever went bankrupt for a \\~50 year prior until Tesla came along. The OLD OEM\u2019s made a solid bet that nobody would ever be crazy enough to step in and disrupt the status quo which worked out decently for them for decades\u2026until it didn\u2019t.  Now everyone seems to have forgotten how hard manufacturing 1.) At scale and 2.) profitably is because Tesla made it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a final point, I will also say this: Objective valuation is more of an art than a science. Multiple are determined retrospectively based on prior performance of similar companies in certain market conditions. We invest and make our voices heard and the analysts take notes, NOT the other way around. It\u2019s a subtle but incredibly important distinction. Comparative analysis  falls flat on its face when you try to shoehorn very different companies such as Tesla and the Old OEM\u2019s into the same category without considering context. If the supported price of the stock remains arbitrarily high (and not a short-term burst like say GME) and yet valuation models aren\u2019t questioned, than it\u2019s the analysts who are wrong and need to change. We have seen a huge reticence for this. This is probably also due to the fact that they cover hundreds of stocks instead of a few good ones. I hope ya\u2019ll won\u2019t make the same mistake.\n\nEdited for formatting/spelling.", "id": "uchmap", "created_utc": 1650993389.0, "score": 189, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "People who claim it\u2019s overvalued know nothing of how the stock market works.

Absolutely unheard of in the auto industry. Which, brings me to my first point, that margin is unsustainable long term. This will perhaps bleed into macro a little but I believe we are going to see a slow Q2 consumer wise and especially considering tax credits for other automakers how can we expect consumers to continue to have the capital to buy +50k cars when interest rates are (supposedly) increasing? This puts strain on both housing and auto, Tesla will have to cut margins to deal with this problem. So I agree they maybe shouldn't be evaluated like a traditional automaker, but as the first mover advantage moat shortens you *will* deal with that margin having to be tightened to be competitive. Tesla is great but there is no way the premium survives forever in my view. The auto industry is cutthroat with their margins and it's easy to see that with the Kia EV6 launch they really don't have much of a value proposition in manufacturing costs. \n\nSo in my thoughts, there is the ultimate risk of China competition (25% of sales), slowing consumer appetite, continued pressure by other automakers, Elon share leverage shenanigans, boring 2022 outlook, decline of credit sales, FSD promises while now finally giving up and making a robotaxi w/ lidar, raw material price skyrocketing (not realized yet with contracts as mentioned on the earnings call), and macro headwinds make this a VERY hard investment case. \n\nPersonally I have a $650 EOY PT", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for posting! Contrarians are welcome.  \n\n\nRE: Margin sustainabiliy:  I think this is tricky. There are a lot of factors here. I don't think raw materials is going to have any impact on margins at all. It'll cause symmetric increases across the industry. If anything, Tesla's dominant buying position would mean they're LEAST affected in the industry.  \n\n\nAlso, we know Tesla is sold out for a year on most car models with current pricing. So short term I don't think there's any reason margin compression will happen. But long term I do agree that prices and margins will come down somewhat realistically. But I in an optimistic scenario I think they might not too. I think it's hard to comprehend how much more cheapley in house batteries, front and rear structural casting, improving economies of scale, and improved production layout being standard will help bring down costs since Tesla's margins mostly don't have these included right now. Also. these margins are NOT with the 60k ASP's, they're only with a 54K average selling price based on Q1 2022 data (16.86 billion automotive revenue over 310k cars).  So even if costs come down say 10% from where they are right now and nothing else changes, it's still a 30%+ gross margin and nothing has changed.   \n\n\nThe other thing you're forgetting in the US is that most car manufacturers are being boosted to Tesla's detriment because of the Federal EV tax credit. That goes away soon and will also serve as another catalyst bringing up prices of other EV's relative to Tesla.  \n\n\nLastly, I really feel like people are completely glossing over how every new factory comes with next level manufacturing efficiencies. For example, batteries are \\~20-30% of the entire cost of the vehicle so making them in-house might add say a 5-10% increase to total operating margins in a few years once production is ramped up. This process has just started in Giga Texas Per the Limiting factor's very academic youtube channel, we can probably surmise we'll see another 5-10% added to gross automotive margins from a fully structural body too (this will also be another year or two out).   \n\n\nHow much margins compress is mostly going to come down to how well TSLA executes and if EV's are in demand. I think they will be. And thus I don't agree with your point there.   I truly feel most people run numbers without even considering that Tesla can do even better.  \n\n\nRe: China competition. I don't actually think the Chinese market is as important as the American one.  It may have more EV sales, but the average selling price and thus the profitability of selling cars in China will be lower than Europe or America. But manufacturing there will be cheaper with local subsitdies.  I think maximizing European and American sales and exporting from Shanghai is the better long-term strategy and this is actually what Tesla does and does dominantly. Shanghai is its export hub. Despite this... it's not that Tesla can't sell amazing well in China (they're actually number 3 and 4 in the top 10 right now behing WAY cheaper alternatives).  I suspect that going from numbers 3 and 4 to 1 and 2 isn't out of the realm of possibility if they sold more locally, but it's probably not a high priority. America and Europe will drive China's profitability for many years to come.   \n\n\nI also feel like as consumers realize EV's are amazing, the demand for them will skyrocket faster than everyone can manufacture them. I see the Chinese players as filling up most of the demand after China with the remaining share being shared between the Old OEM's and the other start ups.  As far as I can tell, despite huge advancement by Chinese players, Tesla's global and local market share has only trended up. But this is hard to predict and we'll just have to see.   \n\n\nRE: Elon..Yeah it's tough. I have a hard time with him going AWOL. But also...Elon bring a lot of brand value.

The new 4680(hopefully right number lol) cell is nice but we have yet to see what the cost benefit really is. I just think people overestimate the margin Tesla has when chip/battery shortage catches up. I agree with federal programs helping these traditional automakers more, but if traditional automakers are also offering ~300 mi range cars at the low 40k, then at best we can say they are breaking even.

Tesla quoted 50% plus, but even 20% + is game breaking when batteries are 20-30% of the EV's total cost.   \n\n\nRe: local competition: I think Ford makes a small profit on the Mach-E with the current EV tax credit incentive in place but won't disclose margins implying they're thin. Loss of the EV tax credit will lower margins 15% or so which is catastrophic. The only mach-E w >300 mile range costs 52 K,  (the cheapest is 44K not even including dealership markups)  and wouldn't be profitable at only 47 K ex credit and certainly not at 40K for many years to come, I assume that EV margins are worse than ICE. In short, you overestimate the profitability of the Ford and underestimate how expensive they are even with EV credits. I don't think it will be \"easy\" to get those margins for other autos....I think it's actually one of the most difficult things in the world.  \n\n\nRe: Tesla ditching the 25K car...Why sell a 25k car when your 50K+ cars are selling like hotcakes and there isn't a need? I think the 25k car will come when the 3 and y and cybertruck are no longer demand constrained years in the future. I think Tesla would just need to have a smaller battery with lower weight. It would have a couple of advantages...lighter with even higher core battery efficiency from wt. savings alone would bring down costs. Mostly,I think TSLA will be demand constrained for years and making  a cheaper car was only necessary when they didn't realize how unreal demand is. I think model 3 and y prices will have to come way down before it's sensible to make a 25K car. I don't think they've abandoned it, just not actively pursuing it.   \n\n\nRe: Geopolitical risk...I mean sure. But Tesla is the only US company without a domestic partner leaching IP.

Generally, theta strategies will let the value of the put drop 50%, then buy to close the position locking in the premium you've already been paid, then sell to open the next position. If you get assigned, you still keep the premium you received when you sold the put, that is locked in already. All you will \"lose\" is your collateral you put up.

This is called \"the wheel\". The idea is if you get assigned on your put your cost basis isn't $750. It is $750 - (premium / 100 ). You can then subtract premium / 100 for each time you sell a call and not get assigned further lowering your cost basis.\n\nEdit to clarify: theta loss is the buyers problem, not the sellers problem. Theta (time) is dropping the resell value for the buyer. The seller already locked in their value.

You would have to get really unlucky for it to fall below 750 before Tuesday. But a few really big things to be aware of you got wrong about selling puts, since your interpretation of selling puts worries me 1. When you sell puts, you are actually selling a contract for the obligations to \u2018buy\u2019 100 shares per contract, not sell or give up your shares. Buying puts gives you the right to sell shares at the ITM strike, meaning the SP is lower than the strike at at expiry. Selling them, you have to buy them at the strike price if it fall below and ITM, huge difference there. 2. Again, as a reminder, selling puts you are selling the buyer the right to sell you shares at that strike price, so if it goes below, you have an obligation to buy the shares. You have buying and selling puts mixed up. 3. If you need to roll out to avoid assignment, yes, I would do it while it isn\u2019t deep ITM. For instance, if your strike is 750 and it by some unexpected catalyst, it dips to to 700, you would need to buy 100 shares per contract @750, so you are looking at a net loss of -5K per contract once it is assigned. You can avoid this by rolling further out before expiry to a lower put strike (650, etc). 4. You can roll out anytime weather it is ITM or out, but if the share price goes down, you will likely owe a debit so you want to roll out to a lower strike where it is possible to get a credit and not lose any of the original premium.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3226885199546814}, {"body": "Did you end up rebuying that put you sold?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "i'm still a bit confused as I've yet to be assigned.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": " You sold a put.
