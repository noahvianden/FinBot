{"title": "Housing Will Correct But Not Crash. The Supply/Demand Relationship Is Still Massively One Sided.", "selftext": "Housing is going to correct slightly but it won\u2019t crash in a 2008 fashion. When equities fall in value during the next economic downturn housing will likely follow to a certain extent but it won\u2019t crash by any means. \n\n\u201ctHiS tImEs DiFfErEnT!\u201d \n\nTL/DR: Covid killed new home supply with supply shortages and labor force shifts. FED massively decreased home sellers through monetary policy. Work from home shifted home buying dynamic. Zoning Laws fuck over cheap housing cause no one wants low income housing near them. FED can\u2019t raise rates high enough to kill enough demand to combat the short supply cause it\u2019ll cause US debt default. Housing go BRRRR, correct slightly, then continue going BRRRR cause the US debt can never be paid off so rate hikes won\u2019t meet low housing supply will remain low for the next decade. \n\nFor people screaming that housing is doomed again need to look at how the US got into this position before assuming that the housing market is gonna go tits up. \n\nCOVID-19 and the FEDs/Governments  reaction to COVID-19 created one of the most one sided setups in the existence of the real estate market. \n\n1. The cheapest rates in history have drastically increased refinance rates for all mortgages (specifically fixed mortgages) for anyone who owned a home. If you had a pulse from 2019-2021 then you refinanced your home with cheap money. Those owners are much less likely to sell as they\u2019ve been given the deal of a lifetime for the next few decades. \n\n2. Low rates and rampant inflation reinforce point #1. Homes have increased 10%-20% in value each year for the past 2-3 years and rates have been sent up almost past 5%.  (up almost 100% from the pandemic rates) Anyone who decides to sell their home and move will have to pay 30%-40% more per month for a similar size/quality due to increased P&I on their new loans. People who can\u2019t afford the jump in financing pricing for a different home will just stay put and not sell their current home thus dropping available supply further. \n\n3. Supply shortages are still a big issue in the building space to help combat the growing demand. All my trades and suppliers send out emails weekly of the next random thing that\u2019s in short supply/longer delivery times/items being rationed. (Pex/PVC Line, HVAC Duct, Electrical Boxes/conduit, Concrete Restrictions On Certain Days, etc.) These issues combined with the labor shortage further hurt the supply side of homes as projects have been taking an average of 15%-25% longer to complete. \n\nAppliances: 12-16 month lead time\nWindows: 5-6 month lead time\nPlumbing Fixtures: 2-3 month lead time\n\nLonger lead times make logistical planning more difficult to complete projects in a timely manner. Add in the De-Globalization Situation due to the Russia Ukraine Crisis will cause everything to take longer/cost more as countries begin becoming more self-sufficient find new trade deals. \n\n4. Commodities are still up massively. Down from their peaks (lumber and steel specifically) but still up big. Production builders can\u2019t promise/deliver cookie cutter homes for a fixed price for very long as prices are changing weekly and sometimes daily (specifically lumber). This causes delays/people taking longer to pull the trigger to build homes. The custom home building industry I am in have it even worse in terms of budgeting/planning/getting clients to pay the ever changing prices on everything. \n\n5. The new work from home environment has shifted demand in certain real estate markets where existing supply can\u2019t meet the massive growth in new demand that the current builders can\u2019t can\u2019t up with even before the supply shortage began.  People value a more suburb style home now that remote work is here to stay. More buyers for less and less homes. \n\n6. Municipalities all over the country are creating/shifting how they do development/zoning laws. Single family homes are and will continue to be the main development for residential housing. Cheaper housing options are better in terms of helping supply but it is not going to happen in most areas. \n\nShould more low income housing exist? \nYes. \nDo people want it? \nYes. \nDo homeowners/people want it near their backyard where they actually live?\nNo. \n\nSad truth but it\u2019s the honest truth. Most homeowner/municipalities only want one thing in their real estate area. Increase in value. Dense housing doesn\u2019t increase value the same way single family does. Zoning laws in developing cities will continue to accommodate this idea with more single family construction because that\u2019s what drives property values higher. \n\n7. More houses coming into the market overtime will help increase supply but that will likely happen in the next 10-15 years after a larger amount of the baby boomer population has passed and their kids sell off their houses. Still a long ways away currently to speculate on existing housing prices. \n\n8. Easiest solution is to drop demand is to raise interest rates to reduce the amount of able buyers to shrink demand down to meet supply. This is the typical route to but the main concern for the FED is that outstanding US debt that our country can\u2019t service if rates pass a certain point. Debt to GDP is now 139%. We\u2019ve never been in this position as a nation. The US prides itself on \u201cpaying its debts\u201d but we are a few rate hikes away from defaulting if we push rates too far and the FED/congress will never allow that to happen. The US will never be able to pay its debts back but our leaders don\u2019t want the whole country to know that so they will continue inflating away the debt because that\u2019s their only option.\n\nOverall while housing will likely drop slightly in value this isn\u2019t 2008 where anyone with a pulse got leveraged to the tits with 6 loans on 3 houses. Prices will drop as they\u2019ve been on an unsustainable run but it likely won\u2019t crater but instead just slow down to then  continue its climb to higher highs in the future.", "id": "u64oq6", "created_utc": 1650256205.0, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|76|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u64oq6)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u64oq6)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03129735589027405}, {"body": "Lumber is also a left nut per board foot.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "I also gave my left spleen, and I\u2019m still short 30% of the lumber needed to finish my house.

That caused a demand surge, and it pretty well proved the point that what's holding back the US economy is wealth inequality causing demand destruction.  The problem is that we didn't also remove any cash from the economy to balance out inflation-we really need higher taxes on the rich rather than an interest rate increase.  Both do the same thing (remove money from circulation), but interest rate hikes destroy demand in ways that higher taxes don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo I see Washington behaving reasonable?
