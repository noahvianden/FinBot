{"title": "Housing Will Correct But Not Crash. The Supply/Demand Relationship Is Still Massively One Sided.", "selftext": "Housing is going to correct slightly but it won\u2019t crash in a 2008 fashion. When equities fall in value during the next economic downturn housing will likely follow to a certain extent but it won\u2019t crash by any means. \n\n\u201ctHiS tImEs DiFfErEnT!\u201d \n\nTL/DR: Covid killed new home supply with supply shortages and labor force shifts. FED massively decreased home sellers through monetary policy. Work from home shifted home buying dynamic. Zoning Laws fuck over cheap housing cause no one wants low income housing near them. FED can\u2019t raise rates high enough to kill enough demand to combat the short supply cause it\u2019ll cause US debt default. Housing go BRRRR, correct slightly, then continue going BRRRR cause the US debt can never be paid off so rate hikes won\u2019t meet low housing supply will remain low for the next decade. \n\nFor people screaming that housing is doomed again need to look at how the US got into this position before assuming that the housing market is gonna go tits up. \n\nCOVID-19 and the FEDs/Governments  reaction to COVID-19 created one of the most one sided setups in the existence of the real estate market. \n\n1. The cheapest rates in history have drastically increased refinance rates for all mortgages (specifically fixed mortgages) for anyone who owned a home. If you had a pulse from 2019-2021 then you refinanced your home with cheap money. Those owners are much less likely to sell as they\u2019ve been given the deal of a lifetime for the next few decades. \n\n2. Low rates and rampant inflation reinforce point #1. Homes have increased 10%-20% in value each year for the past 2-3 years and rates have been sent up almost past 5%.  (up almost 100% from the pandemic rates) Anyone who decides to sell their home and move will have to pay 30%-40% more per month for a similar size/quality due to increased P&I on their new loans. People who can\u2019t afford the jump in financing pricing for a different home will just stay put and not sell their current home thus dropping available supply further. \n\n3. Supply shortages are still a big issue in the building space to help combat the growing demand. All my trades and suppliers send out emails weekly of the next random thing that\u2019s in short supply/longer delivery times/items being rationed. (Pex/PVC Line, HVAC Duct, Electrical Boxes/conduit, Concrete Restrictions On Certain Days, etc.) These issues combined with the labor shortage further hurt the supply side of homes as projects have been taking an average of 15%-25% longer to complete. \n\nAppliances: 12-16 month lead time\nWindows: 5-6 month lead time\nPlumbing Fixtures: 2-3 month lead time\n\nLonger lead times make logistical planning more difficult to complete projects in a timely manner. Add in the De-Globalization Situation due to the Russia Ukraine Crisis will cause everything to take longer/cost more as countries begin becoming more self-sufficient find new trade deals. \n\n4. Commodities are still up massively. Down from their peaks (lumber and steel specifically) but still up big. Production builders can\u2019t promise/deliver cookie cutter homes for a fixed price for very long as prices are changing weekly and sometimes daily (specifically lumber). This causes delays/people taking longer to pull the trigger to build homes. The custom home building industry I am in have it even worse in terms of budgeting/planning/getting clients to pay the ever changing prices on everything. \n\n5. The new work from home environment has shifted demand in certain real estate markets where existing supply can\u2019t meet the massive growth in new demand that the current builders can\u2019t can\u2019t up with even before the supply shortage began.  People value a more suburb style home now that remote work is here to stay. More buyers for less and less homes. \n\n6. Municipalities all over the country are creating/shifting how they do development/zoning laws. Single family homes are and will continue to be the main development for residential housing. Cheaper housing options are better in terms of helping supply but it is not going to happen in most areas. \n\nShould more low income housing exist? \nYes. \nDo people want it? \nYes. \nDo homeowners/people want it near their backyard where they actually live?\nNo. \n\nSad truth but it\u2019s the honest truth. Most homeowner/municipalities only want one thing in their real estate area. Increase in value. Dense housing doesn\u2019t increase value the same way single family does. Zoning laws in developing cities will continue to accommodate this idea with more single family construction because that\u2019s what drives property values higher. \n\n7. More houses coming into the market overtime will help increase supply but that will likely happen in the next 10-15 years after a larger amount of the baby boomer population has passed and their kids sell off their houses. Still a long ways away currently to speculate on existing housing prices. \n\n8. Easiest solution is to drop demand is to raise interest rates to reduce the amount of able buyers to shrink demand down to meet supply. This is the typical route to but the main concern for the FED is that outstanding US debt that our country can\u2019t service if rates pass a certain point. Debt to GDP is now 139%. We\u2019ve never been in this position as a nation. The US prides itself on \u201cpaying its debts\u201d but we are a few rate hikes away from defaulting if we push rates too far and the FED/congress will never allow that to happen. The US will never be able to pay its debts back but our leaders don\u2019t want the whole country to know that so they will continue inflating away the debt because that\u2019s their only option.\n\nOverall while housing will likely drop slightly in value this isn\u2019t 2008 where anyone with a pulse got leveraged to the tits with 6 loans on 3 houses. Prices will drop as they\u2019ve been on an unsustainable run but it likely won\u2019t crater but instead just slow down to then  continue its climb to higher highs in the future.", "id": "u64oq6", "created_utc": 1650256205.0, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|76|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u64oq6)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u64oq6)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03129735589027405}, {"body": "Lumber is also a left nut per board foot.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "I also gave my left spleen, and I\u2019m still short 30% of the lumber needed to finish my house.

{"title": "Elon Musk\u2019s tweets about taking Tesla private in 2018 were false, new court filing says", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/16/elon-musk-funding-secured-tweets-ruled-false-new-court-filing-suggests.html\n\nIn a court filing out late Friday, shareholders who are suing Tesla and CEO Elon Musk over alleged securities fraud said they won part of a critical ruling in their class-action lawsuit. The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so. Tesla\u2019s stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized. The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges, but Musk is trying to terminate that agreement now.\n\nDamages from the shareholders\u2019 class-action lawsuit could amount to billions of dollars that would be paid by Musk and Tesla to those who are members of the class. The shareholders\u2019 attorneys said in the filing out Friday that Judge Edward M. Chen, who is presiding in this matter, had concluded that Musk acted with scienter \u2014 in other words, that he knowingly made false statements about having funding secured when he tweeted. This information was revealed in a request the shareholders\u2019 lawyers made for a temporary restraining order against Musk to stop him from making further public remarks about aspects of this case, as he did during a widely viewed appearance at the TED 2022 conference on April 14. Musk also said, \u201cThe SEC knew that funding was secured but they pursued an active, public investigation nonetheless at the time. Tesla was in a precarious financial situation. And I was told by the banks that if I did not agree to settle with the SEC that they would, the banks would cease providing working capital and Tesla would go bankrupt immediately. So that\u2019s like having a gun to your child\u2019s head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Musk felt he may have been unable to obtain working capital for Tesla, but confident he could muster the billions required to take the company private at the same time. Musk is currently the richest person in the world on paper, and is trying to acquire Twitter, his social media platform of choice, and take it private for around $43 billion. Musk\u2019s attorney Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in a statement emailed to CNBC: \u201cNothing will ever change the truth which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have - all that\u2019s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech.\u201d", "id": "u62jcy", "created_utc": 1650248873.0, "score": 1429, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 340, "comments": [{"body": "FYI:  It's a court filing.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28408801555633545}, {"body": "Has it been 4 years already?

During civil litigation, it's not usual for the two sides, mediated by the judge, to argue about the exact details of the facts down to the word, for months (or longer) before the trial actually happens.

Goldman Sachs: 35% chance of recession within two years", "selftext": "Historically, the gap between jobs and the labor force has narrowed significantly only during recessions, and as a result, Goldman Sachs believes the Fed's economic soft landing is \"on a tough road.\"\n\nHigh-fever inflation in the U.S. is putting increasing pressure on the Fed, and Goldman Sachs sees a 35 percent chance of a recession in the U.S. within the next two years.\n\nJust this past Sunday, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a research note that it may be difficult for the Fed to achieve a so-called soft landing for the economy. Because the Fed's main challenge now is to close the gap between jobs and the labor force, and by tightening financial policy to slow wage growth to a pace consistent with its 2% inflation target without drastically raising unemployment.\n\nHistorically, such a sharp narrowing of the gap has only occurred during recessions, and as a result, the Fed's economic soft landing \"is on a tough road.\"\n\nBut Jan Hatzius also added that a recession is not inevitable, and the normalization of labor supply and durable goods prices in the post-pandemic era can be a boost for the Fed. Furthermore, many developed countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada, have also embarked on a soft economic landing.\n\nAs for the U.S., of the 14 tightening cycles since World War II, 11 did have recessions within two years, but only 8 of those can be \"partly\" attributable to Fed tightening. And in recent times, \"soft landings\" have been more common. Get it right at Jan Hatzius, and the odds of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months are about 15%.\n\nBefore Goldman Sachs, many institutions and well-known investors have expressed the view that the Fed is difficult to complete the economic soft landing. For example, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said after the company's earnings report last week that the risk of the Federal Reserve accidentally pushing the U.S. economy into recession while it is fighting inflation is increasing. Previously, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers made another \"doomsday prophecy\", saying that a U.S. economic recession was inevitable.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that economists are gradually reaching consensus on the forecast of a recession in the US economy. Relevant survey data show that they predict that the possibility of a recession in the United States in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.", "id": "u6bmnf", "created_utc": 1650283766.0, "score": 828, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 263, "comments": [{"body": "65% chance for another decade of growth and bull market you say?", "score": 932, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly the way I see it too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was a fool taking money out after covid tanked it and it was on its way back up.

It's far more likely another factor is leading to the high inflation rather than QE. That's because QE is just an asset swap with a bank. basically, the Fed swaps a T bond or MBS in exchange for bank reserves, bank reserves are a special kind of money banks uses to settle transactions with other banks.\n\nSee, however, no money is actually added to the system just the composition of assets has changed. The bank previously had a long-dated asset (bond) and now has a short-dated (reserves) but the amount they hold whether it be of reserves or bonds is the same. This does make the bank's balance sheet more liquid, the point of this is to make banks lend more, this will obviously cause a lot of inflation in a normal monetary environment when banks rush to use up all of their reserves but, the Fed can control how much or little of their reserves banks will use to make loans by changing the IORB or interest on reserve balances relative to rates paid to depositors, if that spread is small then it encourages the bank to lend elsewhere if that spread is larger it encourages less lending.\n\nNow QE does make the banking system as a whole more liquid and thus more loans can and will be made which will increase the velocity of money (this ignoring the IORB and other factors. Despite this QE has historically not led to inflation and there's no reason to discount those cases and assume QE = inflation when all evidence is to the contrary, especially because of the things which are driving CPI like appliances, Used cars, gas, etc. Its far more likely inflation is driven by supply chain shortages and high commodity prices (which were sky high even before the invasion)\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/third-quarter-2017/quantitative-easing-how-well-does-this-tool-work](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/third-quarter-2017/quantitative-easing-how-well-does-this-tool-work)\n\n[https://www.morganstanley.com.au/ideas/all-about-the-money-supply.html](https://www.morganstanley.com.au/ideas/all-about-the-money-supply.html)\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654)\n\n[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/how-the-fed-adjusts-the-fed-funds-rate-within-its-target-range/#:\\~:text=In%20the%20current%20framework%2C%20the,funds%20and%20government%2Dsponsored%20enterprises](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/how-the-fed-adjusts-the-fed-funds-rate-within-its-target-range/#:~:text=In%20the%20current%20framework%2C%20the,funds%20and%20government%2Dsponsored%20enterprises).", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "Inflation in asset prices is still inflation.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Im not really sure what you mean by this?

QE definitely does have a psychological effect in investors which can push up stocks as well as low intreast rates that can help companies grow, but this is all indirect and not necessarily a bad thing. Banks however can't use reserves to buy assets other than bonds, stocks don't meet their capital requirements and any stocks purchased by a bank would have to be out of its Nostro account or in other words only money it makes of profits can be invested in stocks, it can't invest deposits and thus reserves in stocks.\n\n\"and when the debt it purchased is repayed, all that cash goes to the Treasury\"\n\nThis isn't true once the bond Is repaid the Fed destroys that money on their balance sheet, they don't give it to the tresurey, any profits they make are given to the treasury but once the bond is reapid the Fed either reinvents it or they destroy that money.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Fed money printing leads to looser financial conditions, so lending and money in circulation grows and that leads to asset price inflation, as you know.

This is also supported by the fact that inflation isn't uniform across all sectors, inflation caused by an increase in the supply of money sees a near uniform increase across all sectors.\n\r  \n\n\"That's why I asked if you studied economics because your comments seem to appear very confident based on academic theories of sorts or something\"\r  \n\r  \nCurrently studying finance, not economics, but I do love to read about econ and a basic level of understanding of econ is essential, but you don't really need an econ degree to find many great sources online about QE, some of the sources I linked in my OP that explain it well and I'll link them again here.

There is no reserve requirement anymore, as of 2020, the reserve requirement is zero this is because in a world with tons of excess reserves the reserve requirement is no longer useful in increasing/decreasing the number of reserves, really it has been useless since 2008 after the LSAP. I think your understanding about the Fed needing to increase the balance sheet by 2% every year is coming from the incorrect understanding that the Fed increasing its balance sheet means inflation, Inflation is caused by many factors one of which is velocity, if demand is high the Fed can shrink the number of reserves and there can still be inflation.

Either (a) the money multiplier basically does still exist, but instead of using hard legal requirements for reserves (10%, 3%, etc.), the Fed manages bank reserves (and thus money multiplication) indirectly via the IORB or (b) the money multiplier doesn't exist because banks lend as much as they want even with no reserves, and thus the IORB will have no effect on the amount of credit created by banks because no matter how much they store reserves with the Fed, they can create as much credit as they want.\n\nOne thing I don't understand is the relation of QE to this new monetary environment. I get that IORB is how rates are managed now and that it is also used to manage reserve rates (although I'm not sure how effective those are at actually controlling bank credit creation as noted above), but I've been reading that this created the 'abundant reserve' environment that allowed for IORB. Does that mean IORB requires massive Fed balance sheets, and that if/when QT is completed (if it ever is) that they will stop the IORB tactic and switch to open market operations and reserve requirements again?\n\n>Okay, ill try to correct this. There is no reserve requirement anymore, as of 2020, the reserve requirement is zero this is because in a world with tons of excess reserves the reserve requirement is no longer useful in increasing/decreasing the number of reserves, really it has been useless since 2008 after the LSAP. I think your understanding about the Fed needing to increase the balance sheet by 2% every year is coming from the incorrect understanding that the Fed increasing its balance sheet means inflation, Inflation is caused by many factors one of which is velocity, if demand is high the Fed can shrink the number of reserves and there can still be inflation. For example, we don't necessarily see deflation when the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, in fact, the Fed shrunk it by almost 20% in 2018 and we didn't see a proportionate or any deflation.\n\nAnd you're saying this is because the balance sheet shrinking corresponded to shrinking bank reserves, primarily, instead of impacting circulating currency, so it didn't cause inflation? If QE/QT just increases/decreases unused bank reserves then what is the point?\n\nHow about so-called 'asset-inflation'?

If the macro environment changes to favor the old system then I'm sure the Fed will adopt that, but there isn't really any point in rushing back to the old system.\n\nOK, after reading the article, the answer seems to be that IORB is what affects money creation, with the reserve amounts acting as a mild practical limitation for the banking sector as a whole, but a very mild limitation because they only need enough reserves to pay each other settlements and to hand out currency when needed.\n\n>I'm saying it's not a direct correlation, If you lower the number of reserves but demand is still super high you might still see inflation.

What balance sheet target is best? What are the conditions used to determine when to expand/contract/keep the same the balance sheet (i.e. the reserves)? The article seemed to indicate that expansion makes sense when interest rates are at the lower bound but money supply (via loans) is still shrinking and the central bank wants to directly increase money bypassing the bank-lending feature by purchasing assets from 3rd parties who will then use/spend that money.\n\nBut you're saying that you increase or decrease reserves to increase/decrease lending rates. Those are two slightly different things but they would seem to be separate. However, I suppose it is possible that they both are true and relevant. Large scale purchases of tbills both injects currency and lowers long-term interest rates (so I've heard). So maybe both are goals?\n\n>Well, they are chasing very specific investments banks cannot \"invest\" in things other than bonds or loans with their reserves, also remember the Fed pays interest on reserves, and thus reserves are an asset.

I'm pretty sure there's no legal distinction between investment and commercial banks anymore and banks can absolutely hold risky assets in their portfolio so long as risk-capital requirements are met. I don't think banks tend to literally buy homes and act as landlords because their banks not landlords, but they probably could invest money into REITs if that was seen as more profitable than lending right? Or perhaps they can only invest other people's money into those assets? Or maybe lending is just more profitable.\n\n>Now let's talk about lending, the point of QE is to spur lending and thus more people end up getting every type of loan from cars to homes to securities, so naturally, there will be some asset price inflation.

In two years, with a massive economic slowdown and reduction in economic output during one of those years. I don't see how that is anything other than asset inflation. I agree that asset inflation isn't necessarily a bad thing in the way CPI is. But it's still a reality, or seems to be to me. I'm open to being corrected though. It seems to me that because QE injects currency primarily to organizations that deal in assets (hedge funds, etc. that hold lots of bonds), the assets they interact with get inflated first with the hope that that inflation trickles into the consumer economy to compensate for the reduction in bank-lending. Once it trickles in, it can trickle too much or too fast, at which point it is clear that such accommodative policy is no longer necessary and QT can start. If I'm right, then QT will involve bringing asset prices back down so that inflation stops trickling out of them into CPI until asset prices are balanced and inflation can be managed with IORB again.\n\nThat's how all this seems to me at this point but I'm open to correction.\n\nThe only question left is how the bank pays for IOBR when it has to pay more out in interest then it is getting on tbills, if that is even a possibility.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"But you're saying that you increase or decrease reserves to increase/decrease lending rates.\"\n\nIt's both because it acts on both the demand and supply sides. Increasing the bank's capacity to lend is only good if you increase demand for borrowing by lowering rates at the same time. The Fed does QE to spur lending by doing two things lowering interest rates and increasing the bank's capacity to lend. By making the banking systems assets more liquid they increase a bank's capacity to lend, and remember if there are more total reserves in the system the price to borrow those reserves decreases, or in other words the price of borrowing.

This is because a bank has to keep enough capital allocated per loan. Also, the FDIC insures deposits and thus places strict rules on what a bank can do with depositors' money as well as the Volker rule which bans prop trading entirely. The bank can invest in stocks from profits it makes but it absolutely cant invest in stocks with depositors' money.

But that's not true at all I don't think, otherwise we would have full reserve banking. If a bank has 100 dollars in reserves, it might have 100 dollars in checking accounts, and say 80 dollars in loan deposit accounts. Or maybe 300 dollars in loan deposit accounts. The bank only needs enough in reserve balance to be able to supply (a) reserves to trade with other banks in settlement and (b) currency in circulation to customers as needed. That's my understanding - and since (a) is only relevant to individual banks and not the banking sector as a whole, that means that as a sector, the only bank-side constraint on bank-lending/deposit creation is their capacity to provide currency (which we require with capital/liquidity requirements). The consumer side constraint is demand, which is managed by interest rates.\n\nSo from what I've read it looks like we do want to make sure there are excess reserves to meet bank demands for currency/trading needs otherwise rates would climb above IORB. QE is about providing even more reserves than that with the hope of affecting indirect stimulating effects by rebalancing bank portfolio's. But, reserves must be kept high enough, even in a contractionary policy context, to keep FFR at the IORB, at least in the current monetary framework of ample reserves and floor.\n\nReading this was helpful for me: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/federal-funds-rate-control-with-voluntary-reserve-targets-20190826.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/federal-funds-rate-control-with-voluntary-reserve-targets-20190826.htm)\n\nAlso, this makes me think I'm right about bank money creation constraints: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm)\n\nCompare reserve balances in aggregate to M1. 4 trillion in reserve balances. 20 trillion in deposits (roughly). So there is (approximately) 16 trillion dollars worth of loan balances in private banks that do not correspond to reserve balances they hold with the Fed, which would suggests banks can loan as much as that want beyond reserves held (so long as basic requirements and capacity to provide currency) are met.\n\nAlso interesting is the BoA balance sheet here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/bankfinancials.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/bankfinancials.asp)\n\nYou'll see that they have WAY more loans/deposits than they have central bank reserves", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">that means that as a sector, the only bank-side constraint on bank-lending/deposit creation is their capacity to provide currency (which we require with capital/liquidity requirements).

If the bank doesnt have enough reserves to make a loan, they technically can credit a liability (deposit) and debit an asset (loan) on their balance sheet and this is will work fine until the borrower goes out and spends his loan, then the bank needs that amount in reserves or else they cant settle that transaction.\n\n\u201cQE is about providing even more reserves than that with the hope of affecting indirect stimulating effects by rebalancing bank portfolio's\u201d\n\nThis is correct\n\n\u201cA corridor system isn't in use anymore, that much I know for sure.

If you were right, then every time a bank lends out 100, it would have to transfer the reserves that it used as a source for that money away. But then, it also has 100 less reserves to use as a basis for lending, so if they can still lend 100 with 100 less reserves, then those reserves weren't a constraint. And that appears to be the case.\n\nI think it is helpful to think about in a normal reserve requirement environment.
