In terms of decay, theta decay is more impactful no matter what once you reach 30 days to expiration, regardless of being ITM or not. At 30 days the extrinsic value will begin to decay much faster. This is why you should always choose options IMO no less than 3 months out. I personally try not to buy anything less than 6.

Governments have put themselves into unbelievable levels of debt and let inflation go fucking mental at the same time so that they have to increase interest rates to the point they can't service that debt. Right now unemployment is incredibly low and everyone has been spending like crazy for two years but energy prices have more than doubled, the housing market is hotter than ever, commodities are through the roof, the supply chain is still mega fucked, semi conductors are so far behind demand that they won't catch up for many years, I can't imagine a bleaker set of circumstances. \n\nThe only way out of this that doesn't involve triple recessions and mass unemployment is for the magic money men to pretend none of it matters and to bullshit the numbers ala china.

{"title": "FB Earnings are Today After Market Close. Place Your Bets!", "selftext": "TL;DR:\n\n* 04/29 155P at $2.75 or less\n* 04/29 157.5P at $3.00 or less\n* 04/29 160P at $3.25 or less\n\nHere's a chart showing options volume and open interest yesterday for all the 04/29 puts on FB. I do want to point out the increased activity around $150P-$160P. That appears to be what is being priced in by institutional participants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/frkwljfg72w81.png?width=1347&format=png&auto=webp&s=6de20bdc7e5c5f526934b9e88f5ff2fbee2d88ac\n\nThe vast majority of the open interest looks to be at the $150 strike, while most of the hedging activity looks to be between $150 and $160\n\nMost of the open interest is pricing in a drop. Surprisingly someone has been buying a ton of 04/29 $120P. Maybe speculative apes?\n\nOver the last couple days in the run up to earnings, IV has gone from 40% to 160%, and will likely continue to 200% by market close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr319apt72w81.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=a83af45d80fd23c708b542ad2cfefb60670b30fc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFB is also quite far from its delta neutral (Green line). Most recently, delta neutral has been a point of resistance. That may continue to be true for foreseeable future. Notably, the increased put buying has brought delta neutral down. Source: [https://options.hardyrekshin.com/#FB](https://options.hardyrekshin.com/#FB)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eaws74gx72w81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d07b921737ec12eec7fc14f2749bb28741b7234\n\nCurrent ATM options show the probable range after market close of $166 - $190.50.\n\nI'm anticipating a drop, but still want to make money, so I need to make sure the options contracts I buy are profitable at the $150 mark, which currently represents a 16% decrease from yesterday's close. It's possible all this dropping is priced in from the previous quarter. It's also possible that Meta's headwinds have accelerated and further future statements will paint a more dire picture of the company.\n\nRemember that the cost of IV crush will be massive. So you need to pick a strike price that you reasonably expect will expire ITM.\n\nSo with that being said, these are the positions I intend to open before market close:\n\n* ~~04/29 155P at $2.75 or less~~\n* ~~04/29 157.5P at $3.00 or less~~\n* ~~04/29 160P at $3.25 or less~~\n* 04/29 160P at $4.50/share\n\nUnclear to what point I can get fills at these prices, but I'm going to try.\n\nEdit: Doesn't look like I'm gonna get filled at the prices I want.\n\nEdit2: Stock price went up and probably hit the high for today, so bought 04/29 160P for $4.50. Not ideal, but this is probably the best price I'm gonna get. Need FB stock to be at \\~$155.5/share at market open to break even.\n\nEdit3: Rip my puts.

This goes for all the big banks, so there\u2019s more money supply (loans), which means the rates and requirements for loans are somewhat eased. All of this leads to a lot more money flowing into the economy for households and businesses to spend.\n\nEasing QE then means less buying of bonds. No QE means zero purchasing of bonds. \n\nAnd QT is the exact opposite of QE. You only start QT once you fully stopped buying bonds through the QE program. In a QT program the central bank not only no longer buys up bonds, they also let current bonds mature (money has to be paid back to the central bank, reducing their balance sheet) and actively sells bonds to regular banks.

Tesla has still shown TREMENDOUS year over year and quarter over quarter growth in sales numbers, with no signs of slowing. Their demand is so insane that ordering the basic model puts you on an approximately 9 month wait, and that wait time is only getting bigger, not smaller. All the while they keep raising prices in an attempt to stiffle demand and it hasn't even worked but has given them more profits.\n\n2. They have navigated ship shortages much better then all other auto manufacturers by far. This raises costs for others who are trying to keep up, and allows them to sell more then others are.\n\n3. It is clear the the demand for EVs is only increasing at an exponential rate\n\n4. With an increasing demand for EVs, it does not matter that competition is catching up. \"BMW already has a better lineup of EV's\". Do they? If they truly did, the demand would reflect it, but they aren't selling to the same capacity. If tesla controls say 75% of the EV market, and the EV market is 10% of all cars sold, it does not matter if 5 years from now tesla only controls 30% if EVs have grown to 50% of all cars sold. They will still grow because the entire sector will grow. 75% of 10% is 7.5% of all cars sold. 30% of 50% is 17%, which is still a growth of 2x.\n\n5. Profit margins are increasing to the point of being competitive with Apple. 30% profit margins is unheard of for a car company, and is almost triple the industry average (10%)\n\n6. Robotaxi potential if (in my opinion, when) FSD is completed for real. This is a completely untapped market and whoever captures it largely first will be the leader and profit margins for this will be tremendous. Think uber but without the requirement of a driver, which is the majority of uber's cost. Instead of it being a $40 uber to go 30 mins to a bar, it will be $15-20 and half of that will be profit.\n\n7. Tesla is more then just a car company. They are battery tech. And their batteries are far ahead from everyone else.\n\n8. Supercharger network costs are lower then all other companies, and superchargers are a factor in what EV you buy. Why buy a comparable BMW Ev when the cost to use the tesla supercharger network will be 1.5-2x as much? More revenue for non-tesla EVs goes to tesla for use of their network, AND theres a big incentive go to tesla over others.\n\n9. Improved solar panel potential\n\n10. Tesla insurance has insanely competitive rates due to their data driven car that can to a very high degree predict accidents very accurately, allowing them to charge far lower then other insurance companies. They're in the process of rolling this out.\n\n11. They STILL have not spent a dime on advertising, cuz they don't need it, which leaves them more money for R&D.\n\n12. Listing in SPY and QQQ, the markets biggest indices available in the US, means that anyone buying broad market indices is going to be buying tesla indirectly. This is huge for the stock in general because it is tied more heavily to big tech and the market in general, as opposed to being an individual volatile stock that is not listed in major ETFs\n\n13. Using last quarters earnings revenue as a benchmark, and 30% profit margin which rivals apple, they are pulling in roughly half the revenue of apple with a similar profit margin. Apple at a 2.5 trillion $ market cap means that tesla at a 1 trillion $ market cap is actually cheaper then apple.
