(JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's total compensation rose to $84.4 million for 2021, up from $31.7 million in 2020, according to the bank's annual proxy statement filed Monday. The figure includes $52.6 million in option awards for 2021, up from no option awards in 2020. \"The special award granted to Mr. Dimon reflects the board's desire for him to continue to lead the firm for a further significant number of years,\" the company said. \"The board also took into account other factors, including the firm's strong performance under Mr. Dimon's stewardship since 2005, his exemplary leadership, and his significant contributions to the firm's success during his tenure.\" Dimon's total annual compensation in 2021 rose to $34.5 million from $31.5 million in 2020 and 2019. The increase was due to a $3 million boost he received in performance share units (PSUs) to $28 million in 2021 from $25 million. His salary remained at $1.5 million. Shares of JP Morgan Chase are down 14.6% so far in 2022, compared to a drop of 4.6% by the S&P 500 and a loss of 4.2% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\n\\-Steve Gelsi\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n04-04-22 0730ET\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\n**Footnote**: JPMorgan reached an all-time high of **$172.96** on October 25, 2020.
