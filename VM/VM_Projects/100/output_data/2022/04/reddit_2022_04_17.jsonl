You clearly were not prepared for the high risk that came with your possible high reward. Next time don't just look at the possibility of big dollar signs but also be realistic of what you can lose.\n\nYou are down 95% why did you let it get that bad? Options lose value as time goes on. They are an investment product you should rarely hold especially for the time frame that you were buying.

Did you really have a reason you thought it would go back up or were you just hoping for the best?\n\nIf you had enough money for 60 calls why did you not use a strategy that would have hedged your position?

{"title": "Elon Musk wont succeed in buying Twitter: short Twitter via may 13 44 puts", "selftext": "Sorry for clickbait title, nothing against Musk but he cannot succeed in buying out Twitter. Twitter will remain a public company, that status quo will continue as it has been. Republicans/conservatives will downvote me into oblivion, cry and whine about free speech blah blah, but feelings =/= facts.\n\nThesis: The takeover attempt of Twitter will fail completely, whether its through a complete buyout, or or a proxy war over the board. Furthermore, there will not be any other entities that are willing to offer an alternative buyout (that twitter will accept). As a result, the Twitter stock price will plummet back down to 30s before Musk began buying shares. Puts are the winning strategy.\n\nArgument 1: Poison Pill (shareholder rights plan) will make it nearly impossible for Musk or a consortium to gain control over the board. The moment Musk or a consortium reaches 15% ownership of the company, all other shareholders will have the right to buy discounted shares of Twitter. The result is that the acquiring group will constantly have their shares diluted, and the entire attempt will become exorbitantly expensive. Indeed, poison pills are very effective at preventing even the attempt of a hostile takeover.\n\nArgument 2: Musk's 54.20 buyout offer is too cheap. Companies of this size generally don't consider any offer lower than their 52 week high. Twitter has hired Goldman Sachs to advise them in this matter; apparently Goldman Sachs believes that the offer is too low to be considered. Additionally, the decision by Twitter to adopt a poison pill almost surely implied that Twitter also believes the offer is too low. They will not accept a bid of 54.20. To entice the board to sell the company, Musk and Co, or some other firm will need to offer a significantly higher premium, a lot closer to the 52 week high of \\~$70.\n\nArgument 3: In theory, Musk probably could afford to buy Twitter at a price the board cannot refuse, but is he willing to do so? Musk doesn't have enough liquid assets to do this immediately, he would have to liquidate the equivalent of his entire stake in SpaceX to come up with \\~45 billion dollars. To put it another way, is Musk willing to give up SpaceX to buy Twitter? My guess, is probably not. The fact that Musk is already talking about getting \\*other\\* people on board with him suggests that he is unable to, or not willing to foot the bill.\n\nConclusion: Twitter will not be bought out by Musk. Therefore, the logical thing to happen is for Twitter to fall back down to the 30s.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nMy position: Holding May 13 $44 strike puts, worth approximately 1000 dollars. If I had more money I'd invest more. Screenshots are proof of my position.\n\nNot investment advice, do your own due diligence.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3us2jq1nv5u81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfdaeccc91d8931d317a15fedfc7b3aaf395b1db", "id": "u5xaf5", "created_utc": 1650232697.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u5xaf5)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u5xaf5)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13491392135620117}, {"body": "Cramer is extremely bearish on TWTR....

There was a time in 2018ish where I had a 1:1 with my manager at the time. He came into the room all excited, saying \"INTC is about to hit $60!\". Here we are 4 years later where the stock did basically nothing (except gain you dividends), and now well below $60.\n\nBrian Krzanich was a terrible CEO, and the interim CEO (former CFO) after him, Bob Swan, was probably just as bad. When you have a bean counter leading a tech company, you're in for a bad time. He was merely delaying the inevitable. I found it strange that so many employees were so thankful for his work when he just made it worse. His bonus was heavily tied in the stock maintaining a gain in a certain percentage for a month or so, and he accomplished just that...then right after the stock tanked heavily. In addition, employees are definitely in for a bad time when a CFO (person who deals with money) is now in charge. You know he won't be signing off on many people's promotions/raises.\n\nDuring those times I've been very bearish on INTC. I work at the Santa Clara, CA campus (HQ) which has the highest COL relative to all the other Intel sites. Considering it's the bay area, there's tons of competition from companies right in our backdoor. Despite that, Intel pays relatively low compared to the market, which is no wonder why employees leave easily when they get 2-3x the money shoved in their face. It is very difficult for Intel to bring in new talent when they aren't willing to spend the money, and the same goes for current employees. \n\nThe great thing about Pat so far is that he is potentially taking the right steps to a brighter future for Intel. The most important one imo is he bumped up tons of employees base salary if you were under a certain threshold for your grade level/position, and new hires sound like they're getting massively better packages than before. Current employees are also getting big RSU refreshers. This will help to make employees happier, willing to stay, potentially work harder, and bring in new talent.\n\nIntel will also become a foundry service (think TSMC). Even if the node technology and scalability isn't close to TSMC, companies need options/alternatives. Pat is spending big money to open up multiple new (mega) fabs which won't finish for another few years. \n\nMany employees believe it's the right step in the right direction despite the risk. The market is not a fan of INTC, and we've seen many times that a great product doesn't translate to a great stock. \n\nI've held onto all my RSU grants over the years (which was in the $50-60/share range), and I contribute the maximum amount I'm allowed for ESPP (guaranteed at minimum 15% gain if you sell right away). ESPP hurts a lot more when I see the stock down because I'm putting forth my actual money from my paycheck. Obviously in hindsight things didn't work out, but my gut is always telling me to hoard my shares because if and when INTC does blow up, I don't want to miss out on it. More realistically, even if INTC does do really well, it'll probably be a 20-30% gain over the next few years. The only redeeming part is seeing a large sum of dividends, but unfortunately, I enrolled the plan into DRIP so rebuying more shares with the money I get back is losing even more value.\n\nMy advice is your money is better put elsewhere. Even if Intel becomes successful, I doubt they will do as well as S&P500/NASDAQ over the long run.
