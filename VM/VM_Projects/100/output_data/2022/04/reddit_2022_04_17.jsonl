You clearly were not prepared for the high risk that came with your possible high reward. Next time don't just look at the possibility of big dollar signs but also be realistic of what you can lose.\n\nYou are down 95% why did you let it get that bad? Options lose value as time goes on. They are an investment product you should rarely hold especially for the time frame that you were buying.

Did you really have a reason you thought it would go back up or were you just hoping for the best?\n\nIf you had enough money for 60 calls why did you not use a strategy that would have hedged your position?

{"title": "Elon Musk wont succeed in buying Twitter: short Twitter via may 13 44 puts", "selftext": "Sorry for clickbait title, nothing against Musk but he cannot succeed in buying out Twitter. Twitter will remain a public company, that status quo will continue as it has been. Republicans/conservatives will downvote me into oblivion, cry and whine about free speech blah blah, but feelings =/= facts.\n\nThesis: The takeover attempt of Twitter will fail completely, whether its through a complete buyout, or or a proxy war over the board. Furthermore, there will not be any other entities that are willing to offer an alternative buyout (that twitter will accept). As a result, the Twitter stock price will plummet back down to 30s before Musk began buying shares. Puts are the winning strategy.\n\nArgument 1: Poison Pill (shareholder rights plan) will make it nearly impossible for Musk or a consortium to gain control over the board. The moment Musk or a consortium reaches 15% ownership of the company, all other shareholders will have the right to buy discounted shares of Twitter. The result is that the acquiring group will constantly have their shares diluted, and the entire attempt will become exorbitantly expensive. Indeed, poison pills are very effective at preventing even the attempt of a hostile takeover.\n\nArgument 2: Musk's 54.20 buyout offer is too cheap. Companies of this size generally don't consider any offer lower than their 52 week high. Twitter has hired Goldman Sachs to advise them in this matter; apparently Goldman Sachs believes that the offer is too low to be considered. Additionally, the decision by Twitter to adopt a poison pill almost surely implied that Twitter also believes the offer is too low. They will not accept a bid of 54.20. To entice the board to sell the company, Musk and Co, or some other firm will need to offer a significantly higher premium, a lot closer to the 52 week high of \\~$70.\n\nArgument 3: In theory, Musk probably could afford to buy Twitter at a price the board cannot refuse, but is he willing to do so? Musk doesn't have enough liquid assets to do this immediately, he would have to liquidate the equivalent of his entire stake in SpaceX to come up with \\~45 billion dollars. To put it another way, is Musk willing to give up SpaceX to buy Twitter? My guess, is probably not. The fact that Musk is already talking about getting \\*other\\* people on board with him suggests that he is unable to, or not willing to foot the bill.\n\nConclusion: Twitter will not be bought out by Musk. Therefore, the logical thing to happen is for Twitter to fall back down to the 30s.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nMy position: Holding May 13 $44 strike puts, worth approximately 1000 dollars. If I had more money I'd invest more. Screenshots are proof of my position.\n\nNot investment advice, do your own due diligence.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3us2jq1nv5u81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfdaeccc91d8931d317a15fedfc7b3aaf395b1db", "id": "u5xaf5", "created_utc": 1650232697.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u5xaf5)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u5xaf5)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13491392135620117}, {"body": "Cramer is extremely bearish on TWTR....
