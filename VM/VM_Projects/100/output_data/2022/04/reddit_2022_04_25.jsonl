Tesla's success so far came from the \"cool factor\" when they had the premium touch screens and pushed the self driving promises\n\nFundamentally disagree on this one. It's not just about the range (although even here Tesla beats almost all other brands), but about the range per kWh. Anyone can put 200 kWh of battery into a car and end up with a decent range EV, with terrible specs, safety and operating costs. Lucid is the only one so far that is able to compete with Tesla on specs. Compared to all other brands, Tesla wins on efficiency, performance, safety, cargo capacity, software, ADAS, charge speed, purchase cost, depreciation, battery life, etc. Tesla's certainly have a cool factor, but for most people the cost of ownership and/or the better specs, safety and cargo space are a larger factor.\n\n> 2 GM has a modular EV platform and frame that all of their EVs will share, that's a significant reduction in manufacturing difficulty. The full lineup is 30 models which isn't that bad when you think on a global scale. About half probably won't be available in the US. It will be restricted to Asian markets.\n\nIt's definitely a good idea for comparable models, but I have my doubts about using the same platform for a Hummer, delivery van and a Chevvy Equinox. It seems unlikely this won't just increase the issues legacy OEMs already have with inefficient piping, ECUs, spacing of parts in general, etc.\n\nAlso, it doesn't make a lot of sense to start by building 30 different models. It would be a lot cheaper and more efficient to just start with 1 or 2 and introduce more as you start to run out of demand, the way Tesla did it and now also VW will be doing it.\n\n> 3 Their problem, like every other OEM will be securing battery supplies at a low cost.\n\nDefinitely.

At about 40 shares, the combined dividend pays for 1 share \\[share price dependent\\]\n5. You keep adding to shares you have, using the dividend to pay for more shares over time\n6. At about 1812 shares \\[stock price depending, dividend depending\\] you make minimum wage \\[if minimum wage increases: just add more shares\\]\n7. When you have enough shares, the dividend yield is minimum wage, *4 times per year*\n8. 3/4 of that money you use to live, 1/4 of that money goes to buying more shares\n9. Now Goldman Sachs works for -you-. You don\u2019t have to do jack squat and you still become rich. You don\u2019t owe the man, you own the man\n\nIn the 2008 real estate crash, Goldman Sachs owned a whole lot of toxic assets. They sold those toxic assets right before the crash, to another bank. When the crash came and the toxic assets tanked, the other bank went belly up because they now had those toxic assets on the books.\n\nGoldman Sachs is murderously serious about making money.

That same share now yields 60% more. Keep those shares and over time that share will yield more dividend.
