{"title": "As an investor i'm happy about the Cybertruck price", "selftext": "This might be a bit of a hot take but as an investor in Tesla i'm actually happy about the higher than expected prices.\n\n[At the shareholder meeting in May Elon had announced tesla would aim to make between 250,000 and 500,000 Cybertrucks per year.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-production-estimates-revealed/)\n\n[Seperately in June there was a leak that Tesla had told suppliers to prepare for 375,000 Cybertruck per year.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-suppliers-annual-production-rate-forecast/)\n\n[Finally, during the third quarter earnings call Elon seemed to stress the difficutly of ramping a new product as innovative as the Cybertruck while targetting 200,000 units per year for volume production, a target they hope hit in 12-18 months.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-200000-cybertruck-s-production-per-year/)\n\nThe latest comment from Elon on the Q3 call disappointed me. I thought the goal was eventually to make and sell 500,000 year and hoped that was still the case despite the supplier leak.\n\nHowever given what we know today, it's not surprising why they've dialed down production targets. I suspect they may also still be experiencing a bottleneck from the slower than expected ramp of the 4680 cells.\n\nThat being said i'm actually pleasantly surprised following the announcement of the new, higher, prices.\n\nWhy? Because the numbers are nearly identical.\n\nAssuming the supplier leaks are real, if Tesla can sell 350,000 Cybertrucks at an ASP of \\~$70,000 with gross margins of 20%, the gross annual profits from Cybertruck would total $4.9b.\n\nOn the other hand, if Tesla sold approx. 500,000 Cybertrucks at an ASP of \\~$50,000 with gross margins of 20%, the gross annual profits would total $5b.\n\nSo by increasing their prices Tesla can still earn a similar amount of revenue and profits while making significantly fewer vehicles (and fewer battery cells).\n\nI also suspect that Tesla will be able to ramp production to 500,000 if the demand is there but it looks like they've lowered their expectations.\n\nFurthermore, while alot of people on social media seem to be upset about the higher prices and lower specs, i think there will be plenty of demand.\n\nI've looked into this extensively and am confident that at the current price with the feature set it has, the Cybertruck is very competitive with the Rivian and all trims of Ford Lightning. On an objective basis, i believe that the Cybertruck wins in 95% of categories at a similar price point.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing some of these comparisons you can check out [this thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybertruck/comments/188pgf1/an_updated_chart_of_the_cybertruck_vs_rivian_vs/) which features a chart. The chart does not include all of the differences and i encourage you to look through my comments in that thread to see examples of some of those missing diferences which (in my opinion) are quite big.\n\nThere's also another chart made by u/Xillllix which is being discussed in [another thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/188wcul/updated_80k_ev_truck_comparison_chart/).\n\nNote that the trims of Lightning in those two charts are different, one is for the XLT and the other Lariat. While the XLT + extended range appears cheaper than a dual-motor awd cybertruck by $10k, it comes at the cost of some serious concessions (some of which i discuss in the thread).\n\nAdditionally i'm reassured by some of the other research i've done. Some people might say well but the Cybertruck is expensive relative to ICE trucks and why would someone buy an $80k Cybertruck when they could buy a $40k ICE truck? And to that i say, why don't you ask the consumer.\n\n[This data from Cox Automotive shows the Average Transaction Price accross various brands and segments for vehicles in the USA during the month of July 2023.](https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/July-2023-Kelley-Blue-Book-Average-Transaction-Price-tables.pdf)\n\nThe Average Transaction Price for a Full-size Pickup Truck was $65,595 while for a Small/Mid-size Pickup Truck it was $42,004.\n\nIn general the difference between Full and Mid Size pickups relate to payload and tow rating.\n\nA mid size pickup generally has a tow rating of 7,000lbs versus 10,000lbs+ for a Full Size. Mid size trucks generall have a payload capacity of 1,500lbs or less, while full size trucks are generally rated for 2,000lbs or more. Similarly, full size trucks are larger and have bigger engines, and therefore tend to have higher horsepower, more torque, and lower fuel efficiency.\n\nFor these reasons Tesla's Cybertruck is clearly marketed as, and competing with, Full Size pickups which as i noted above had an ATP of $65,595 last July. At $80,000 Tesla's Dual Motor AWD Cybertruck is not far off when you include the $7,500 IRA tax credit and fuel economy/maintenance savings. Depending on how much you drive, the fuel savings alone could make up the difference (ex-tax credit) in under 2 years (by my estimate).\n\nAnd the market for full size pickup trucks in the USA is large. [In 2023, Hedges and Company are estimating 2.15m full-size pickup trucks to be sold](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+full+size+pickup+truck+sales+per+eyar&sxsrf=AM9HkKkUZLL73yLFRjnosjmefiyT7H6kqA%3A1701718038708&uact=5).\n\nMeanwhile [Tesla is on track to exceed 400,000 Model Y deliveries in 2023](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike/status/1730086143599722673/photo/1) in the USA alone. [While the market for small Crossover SUVs in the USA was over 2.9m units in 2022](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2022-us-small-suv-sales-figures/). That means Tesla's compact crossover SUV, the Model Y, could command as much as 13.7% of the small crossover market in the USA in 2023, a figure which may very well make it the best selling SUV in America.\n\nFor the Model 3, Tesla is on track to sell over 200,000 in the USA in 2023.[In 2022 Tesla absolutely dominated the US small Luxury segment with a 41% market share.](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2022-us-small-luxury-car-sales-figures/) If we include [non luxury compact car sales](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2022-us-compact-car-sales-figures/), Tesla had approx. 16% of the 2022 US market share of *any engine type* (ICE or EV). To highlight just how impressive this is Tesla sold nearly as many Model 3s in 2022 as Toyota sold Corollas (195k vs 220k respectively) *despite* the [2022 Toyota Corolla starting at $20,425](https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-corolla-2022/) versus the T[esla Model-3's 2022 starting price of $48,490.](https://www.kbb.com/tesla/model-3/2022/)\n\nClearly Tesla is doing something right. And Tesla has been able to acheive this while holding onto more than 50% of the US EV market share as of Q3 2023. Testament to the consumer preference for Tesla's EVs over \"the competition\".\n\nIf there is the same interest and demand for the Cybertruck in the USA as there is for the Model 3 and Model Y, then Tesla should easily be able to sell 300,000 units per year. (15% of 2.15m = 322.5k)\n\nOf course, interest rates are high and demand for big ticket items may be lower than usual right now which could weigh on demand in the short term. On the other hand, Tesla's Cybertruck is so packed with new, novel, and revolutionary features compared to its other products (and to just about everything else in the market)... i would be surprised if interest isn't MUCH higher.\n\nIn fact, some of this interest is already measurable. [A Twitter user posted this 20 hours after the delivery event.](https://twitter.com/alojoh/status/1730859527266877798) After 20 hours, Marques Brownlee's Cybertruck Review video on Youtub had amassed over 5.9M views compared to 5.7M views for his Rivian R1T review video after 2 years, and 8M views for Ford F-150 Lightning after 2 years.\n\n[As of today Marques' Cybertruck Review video has more than 12m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxOh12Uhg08)\n\n[The BBC Top Gear Review video has more than 2.4m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uefydJUbRhc)\n\n[The Hagerty ICONS episode with Jason Cammissa has over 3.4m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6WDq0V5oBg)\n\nAnd [Carwow's Cybertruck Drag Race has 3.3m views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1v0FNR3-Xc)\n\nTo conclude, i sincerely believe that as production of the Cyebrtruck ramps and people start to see more and more of these in the streets, in their neighborhoods, and at job sites, demand for this product will be insatiable even at the current prices. And as inflation continues to subside the Fed will eventually start cutting interest rates which will make the Cybertruck as well as Tesla's entirely linup more and more affordable, demand will only increase. Some people may not like the look of it at first, but as they see more of them everyday they will grow accustomed to it. As they talk to the owners are the owners give positive feedback it'll only become more compelling. And i also think, over time the product will improve. In 3-5 years i would be surprised if the newest Cybertrucks don't have +50 miles of range compared to today's trims while also selling at lower, more affordable prices.\n\nEdit: i made some edits with the youtube review videos, viewer numbers, and final thoughts.", "id": "18atcid", "created_utc": 1701721439.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "I dont think the price point really matters all that much right now since production volume will be low for 2024 and its somewhat of a niche product.\n\nMy main concern is that they pretty much only have model 3 and Y to sell to the world.

You seem determined to justify the price while insulting me, and that's fine.  The biggest complaint from everyone is that the Cybertruck is priced too high.

Still luxury car territory.  The fuel savings are the same for every EV, so we're not counting that.  I personally think the 250 mile range is going to scare a lot of people away from the RWD, especially when the F-150 Lightening starts at $50k before tax incentives and has a 320 mile range.  \n\nFor your claim that people don't use their trucks for work, you're right.  I live in the south.  I know a lot of F-150 drivers who never haul or tow anything.  However, while they don't ever tow anything, they talk about the tow rating and payload capacity a lot whenever they compare trucks.  It's like Porsche drivers talking about top speed.  They never actually drive that fast, but they COULD, and that's what matters.  \n\nPlus, your average F-150 (or Silverado or Ram or Sierra) driver isn't the type of person to buy the Cybertruck.

This is similar to how the Cadillac and Lincoln pickup trucks fail, but the Chevy and Ford versions of the same truck at the same price sell great.  This is why Ford and GM released all of their EV trucks as their mainstream brands even though they're priced well into their luxury brand ranges.

I think the demand for a RWD EV Truck will be minimal, especially with the range. Series 300 steel is very expensive, and since this is a relatively low volume steel specifically for Tesla, there is definitely a premium. Based on the avg price of 316 SS, I'd expect at least $20k on the material alone, and that's a discount. The investment into the Gigapress was also pretty significant. Idk, I feel like the margins here might be thinner than you think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you're interested in seeing some of these comparisons you can check out this thread here which features a chart. The chart does not include all of the differences and i encourage you to look through my comments in that thread to see examples of some of those missing diferences which (in my opinion) are quite big\n\nThe charts contain some quantitative comparisons, but there are also qualitative comparison to be had. The seer by wire can be a sales motivator or denier for example, we'll just have to see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Meanwhile Tesla is on track to exceed 400,000 Model Y deliveries in 2023 in the USA alone. While the market for small Crossover SUVs in the USA was over 2.9m units in 2022. That means Tesla's compact crossover SUV, the Model Y, could command as much as 13.7% of the small crossover market in the USA in 2023, a figure which may very well make it the best selling SUV in America.\r  \n\r  \nFor the Model 3, Tesla is on track to sell over 200,000 in the USA in 2023.In 2022 Tesla absolutely dominated the US small Luxury segment with a 41% market share. If we include non luxury compact car sales, Tesla had approx. 16% of the 2022 US market share of any engine type (ICE or EV). To highlight just how impressive this is Tesla sold nearly as many Model 3s in 2022 as Toyota sold Corollas (195k vs 220k respectively) despite the 2022 Toyota Corolla starting at $20,425 versus the Tesla Model-3's 2022 starting price of $48,490.\n\nA bunch of asterisks here. Tesla definitely made significant cuts to their margins in order to push these vehicles to undercut most vehicles (when including the incentives). So while market share has gone up, how will they maintain this trajectory without hurting gains? Also, I think it's still weird the Model 3 is considered \"luxury\". The Hyundai Ioniq 6 has a similar MSRP yet nobody calls that a luxury vehicle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Clearly Tesla is doing something right. And Tesla has been able to acheive this while holding onto more than 50% of the US EV market share as of Q3 2023. Testament to the consumer preference for Tesla's EVs over \"the competition\".\n\nMixed bag. 50% could be preference for Tesla, other 50% could be driven by current cost factors, and limited availability of other options. It's still too early to know what it actually is at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>On the other hand, Tesla's Cybertruck is so packed with new, novel, and revolutionary features compared to its other products \n\nIt's not. Like Camisa stated, they all existed before, but this is the first consumer vehicle that has all of it in one package. The vehicle market was already trending in that direction, nobody wanted to be the first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In fact, some of this interest is already measurable.

Card manufacturers have done this for years with GM cards and GM Financial, etc. GE had a financial wing too for decades. Sadly MBAs and constant quarter to quarter thinking always eventually ruin good long term products or services. I think where Apple could be successful is by treating revolving credit the same way they treated the launch of iTunes. It was never meant to be a money maker (or at least not a true profit center) on its own. It was a tactic that was part of a larger long term strategy. It was meant to break the strangle hold the music industry had on how music is released and purchased to make it easier to put music on an iPod. As long as getting music into the iPod was still something that felt a bit to \u2018tech-y\u2019 for most you wouldn\u2019t reach mass adoption. Since the goal wasn\u2019t to make iTunes a business, but instead make buying and listening your music easier thus selling more iPods and eventually iPhones, it was wildly successful. This lead to a massive influx in profit for Apple over years as once people saw the simplicity it was the only way they wanted to buy music thus making Apple an \u2018AppleTon\u2019 of money. If the Apple Card is mostly about making buying Apple products easier (I use mine for buying my phones, tablets, headphones, watches, and laptops using the no interest installment plans via the card. It\u2019s bloody great. They even concierge deliver the gear to my house. I\u2019ve definitely bought and paid off more gear than I would have without the card which is what they want). If they treat it like a way to move more product and not a line of business they\u2019re looking to grow they could break the credit card industry at its core. Just like iTunes did for music. \n\nWhen I first got mine I was so impressed with the integration to the phone for payment, seeing installments easily, tracking spend, managing the debt, and the lack of fees in a lot of areas like International travel all with no extra app and additional logins. Everything tied to the TPM in the phone. Hell having no number on the card was crazy to me at first then awesome. I can re-issue my card number at will through the app without needing a new card. \n\nThe problem with credit card companies is they want to squeeze every penny out of the user. That\u2019s fine if that\u2019s your business model, I guess. Apple could make a shit ton of money just by offering a card that is very clear about what it is, is simple to use, and makes payment easy without trying to SELL me A CARD. I don\u2019t care about the prestige of a card or \u2018what\u2019s in my wallet\u2019. Sorry, Sam. I care about what the financial tool can do for me and how it makes my daily life easier. My guess is Apple is at least having some serious conversations about things like \u201cWhat if we just bought Diners Club International? They switched to the MasterCard network years ago and the only business they are really still in is corporate cards so there is a solid back end base we could buy with high spend corporate clients to balance consumer spending habits . We get all the existing infrastructure, existing card network expertise, own it as a separate company to reduce risk, and set the rules the way we want them.\u201d\n\nThey could definitely do it. I think the more likely outcome is the find a partner where they form a new company with Apple putting up a majority of the cash (and risk) and the financial services partner is the minority partner that gets to use their expertise on making the card work while getting some percent of the profit. Something like Apple creating a new card with a minority partner in financial services to ovesee the program. My feeling is the Goldman Sachs deal was Goldman wanting in on consumer lending thinking the Apple name has better consumer market penetration and Apple wanting a partner enticed by using the Apple name in a market space they aren\u2019t currently in so they would give in to some of Apples \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas.", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "I can't read that much", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR : other non finance companies have made their own credit card companies.
