But how does poor people unable to pay car loans impact the magnificent 7 stock price in the next 60 days? (That's not even a quarter.)\n\n>4: Reduced inflation doesn't mean prices went down. Everything is still expensive.\n\nRe 4: But with income rising slowly, this will meet equilibrium somewhere at new higher price. (Sure, people who are on fixed income are in trouble, but then at some point they will get COLA scaling. This is a generational problem and on geologic timescales for the markets.)\n\n>5: BTC and Crypto are mooning (money held in crypto has no value to the economy.)\n\nRe 5: To me, crypto is the scam that keeps on giving.

It was concluded that a healthy developed economy has to have debt in order for banks and central banks to have levers that could be used to steer the economy. When debt gets too low, this causes leverage problems for them. From that moment on, debt has never looked back. Not saying it is planned, but.... why fight it?\n\n>13: Recession already in progress in non-USA countries\n\nRe 13: I had to answer this question back in early days of trading experience. Does the US get driven by the world or drives the world? Turns out, the world markets follows US pulse, not the other way around. Also, it is difficult to expect that the US cares about a crash somewhere else. Most people here don't even know who is in charge of Germany or France right now. And those are big. Go down the ladder, and it's less likely that people will even react to an event.\n\n>14: The Fed won't stop printing huge sums of money\n\nRe 14: Is your thesis that the Fed has control or that they have no control? It either matters that they're printing money or it doesn't. Which is it? If it matters, then why are you betting that market forces are beyond them? If it doesn't matter, then who cares if they're printing.\n\n>15: Most people cannot afford essentials any more, will soon clamp down on spending.\n\nRe 15: I recently realized that we don't fully understand what most people can afford.
