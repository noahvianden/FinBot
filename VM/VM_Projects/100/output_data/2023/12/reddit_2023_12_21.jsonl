Do you think the market in general have a higher probability of filling the gap as price usually does return to the same level at some point? \n\nAlso what are the more important indicators to evaluate when trading equities in the tech sector? \n\nI feel as most traders over analyze, for example when trading options most newer traders look at the general basics like volume, open interest, volatility, bid-ask spreads and sizes\n\nBut do you think going into assessing short interest, call/put ratios, delving deep into fundamentals like EPS/ trailing and forward P/E\u2019s, EBITDA, extra are overkill? \n\nAs theoretical knowledge tells us we should look into these although experience shows that even if everything looks good on paper, the markets are irrational and can go in any direction at any time \n\nIn this case, would you say focusing more on technical analysts, S+R levels, institutional market sentiment (the majority of shareholders are of course institutional) and looking at higher time frames and narrowing down price action analysis to lower time frames (1yr, 1month, 1D, 4H timeframes) to asses possible future trends so you can ride the wave are more important? \n\nLastly, do you believe in the strategy of trading accumulation and distribution phases (taking small profits in the direction of when institutional traders sell off and buy positions in segments as to not cause rapid price movement and cause fear for retail) as a traders) good strategy for day/swing trading? \n\nWould really appreciate the input as there\u2019s so much factors to consider..\n\nAnd although the most important factors to consider are risk management, the ability to correctly interpret information and understanding which indicators hold more weight in affecting near term price action.. it\u2019s easy to understand these things but difficult part is putting them together to create a simple yet profitable strategy \n\nFrom my analysis, I had an idea this was a small retracement due to the long bull run from the last couple of months so of course the market has to correct at some point and secondly, futures were still in the green even due to the drop, signalling a possible trend continuation.. thoughts on this? \n\nThanks!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16454826295375824}, {"body": "I personally believe we are going to see a Santa rally before a proper correction.
