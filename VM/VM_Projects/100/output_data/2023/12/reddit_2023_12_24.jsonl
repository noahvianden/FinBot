{"title": "Barrons: Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is Behind the S&P over the past year + 5, 10, & 20 Years", "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway stock is having a disappointing finish to 2023, putting Warren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate behind the S&P 500 over the past 10 years.\n\nThe Class A shares have lagged behind the S&P 500 by about nine percentage points during the current quarter and now are up about 16% in 2023. That compares with a roughly 26% total return for the index. \n\nThe shares are up an annualized 12% in the last 10 years, slightly behind the 12.2% yearly total return, including dividends, for the index. Berkshire also is behind the S&P 500 over the past five years with a 13.4% annualized return, compared with 16.4% for the index., according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s Class A shares were up 0.3% Friday to $542,600 while the Class B stock was 0.1% higher at $356.47.\n\nThe stock is roughly even with the index over the past 20 years with a 9.8% annualized return. That is despite dramatic growth in the company\u2019s operating profits and Buffett\u2019s coup in buying Apple stock, which is showing a nearly $150 billion gain for Berkshire. \n\nBerkshire stock\u2019s lagging performance shows how difficult it is for even an investor of Buffett\u2019s stature to beat an index driven by powerful megacap tech stocks, especially given Berkshire\u2019s huge size. Its asset base is about $1 trillion.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear why the stock is lagging behind the market lately. The company is finishing what likely will be a record year for profits. After-tax operating earnings could rise more than 25% to nearly $40 billion in 2023. \n\nBerkshire\u2019s big property and casualty insurance business is humming as Geico, the auto insurance unit, undergoes a profit turnaround. Berkshire\u2019s $350 billion equity portfolio is topping the market this year led by Apple, which has gained 55% this year to about $194 a share. Apple accounts for nearly half the portfolio.\n\nThe Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, another of Berkshire\u2019s key businesses, is more valuable this quarter thanks to the rally in shares of its chief rival, Union Pacific could be worth $150 billion, in line with Union Pacific, while all of Berkshire is now valued at about $775 billion.\n\nBerkshire also is benefiting from the sharp rise in short-term interest rates since early 2022. The company is sitting on more than $150 billion in cash that is mostly invested in U.S. Treasury bills yielding above 5%.\n\nIt could be that investors anticipate lower earnings on the cash next year, reasoning that the Federal Reserve may well cut short-term rates.\n\nThere also could be concern about Buffet\u2019s age. He turned 93 in August, writing last month that he feels \u201cgood\u201d but saying he is fully aware he is \u201cplaying in extra innings.\u201d The fact that Berkshire could soon lose the leader that built the company over nearly 60 years was highlighted by the recent death of Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger at 99. \n\nBarron\u2019s recently named Berkshire as a top stock for 2024 based on what looks like a reasonable valuation at 20 times projected 2024 earnings. The company is valued at 1.4 times our estimate of year-end 2023 book value of about $390,000 per class A share.\n\nBuffett may not have many years left at the helm but he seems as sharp and engaged as ever. He could still find the elephant-size acquisition totaling $50 billion or more that he has long sought.\n\nWhile he said last year that Berkshire has no interest in owning Occidental Petroleum  , Buffett could change his mind. Berkshire continues to add to its stake and now owns about 28% of the energy company. Occidental is valued at more than $50 billion, meaning Berkshire could well snap it up.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-stock-warren-buffett-underperform-f9539619", "id": "18q43qj", "created_utc": 1703452686.0, "score": 372, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "The majority of Berkshire shareholders don\u2019t hold it for outsized gains - they hold it to avoid large drawdowns.

Buying companies is similarly difficult, with the added issue of competing with private equity that uses a great deal of leverage vs. Berkshire using equity alone.\n\nBerkshire and Buffett compound capital and deploy it well - in sync with shareholders, dividend distribution is anathema.

{"title": "Year end reflections", "selftext": "I've never posted anything useful on WSB, so thought I would take a stab at giving something back to all you regards. Here goes...\n\nFirst off, a little background. Back in 2020 Covid hit and Western policymakers literally lost their minds and embarked on MMT on a truly breath taking scale. Let's use a simple chart to drive home the point. Here is the YoY growth in M2 as per the FRED website ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ke0jg9bmz88c1.png?width=1497&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddadcfddfb53d184e4530f3a14ce8e8dd56e3ab3\n\nInflation skyrocketed and speculative assets went berserk (crypto, spacs, meme stocks etc). Of course the inflation was transitory and almost certainly caused by Covid-related supply chain shocks (sarcasm).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rhvq5j6198c1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=3de93ef0fb8a2aab425198c53b2f0fbff2744d01\n\nYou don't need a PhD in economics to know that Santa Claus isn't real, and you also don't need one to know what caused inflation (hint - it might have been handing out free money to everyone).\n\nEventually the FED decide that inflation might not be so transitory after all, and decided to rapidly increase the FED Funds rate from basically zero to just over 5%. They did this after around 15 years of zero interest rate policy where borrowers had all become addicted to free money. Another hint, people borrow a lot more money when interest rates are low and are therefore even more sensitive to increases.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1nblggkv88c1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a2e05b14a969975b13a1a2b3483c8acdf923c79\n\nAs we can see in the charts above, the M2 YoY growth has gone negative, and interest rates have risen by 5% off of a near zero base. Most investors were expecting this (quite logically) to result in an economic slowdown.\n\nNow, inflation is clearly falling (is that surprising given how far/fast monetary policy has tightened?) but the economy is apparently doing just fine because unemployment is still low. Powell has pivoted and the media is fawning all over him for achieving a soft landing (note, we haven't landed yet).\n\nMeanwhile, are there any signs that maybe we should be worried?\n\n\\- The Conference Board's [Leading Indicator Index](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-conference-board-leading-economic-index-lei-for-the-us-fell-again-in-november-302021055.html) just fell again and continues to signal a recession in 2024.- US credit and auto delinquencies [continue](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-buy-now-pay-later-splurges-raise-holiday-debt-hangover-risk-2023-12-20/) to rise.- China's real estate sector is still [imploding](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bricks-banks-chinas-real-estate-190110747.html).- German property prices are [tumbling](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-home-prices-fall-record-102-third-quarter-2023-12-22/) and Europe is heading for a hard landing.- The UK appears to be [heading](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67799713) for a mild recession.- FedEx just [slumped](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fedexs-stock-drops-as-company-trims-sales-forecast-10478d00) after a profit warning.- We just had an unusually [weak](https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/2023/11/sp-500-2023-q3-earnings-review-aggregate-earnings-reach-an-all-time-high/#) Q3 earnings season.- In the long run current valuations tend to predict future returns, and these look [pretty unappealing](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/) in the US.\n\nI could go on and on.\n\nInvesting is a game of probabilities, a soft landing is certainly possible, so is a resurgence in inflation, and so is a hard landing. I find it absolutely mind boggling how confident so many people suddenly seem to be so confident in the soft landing.\n\nI'll leave you with two parting thoughts...\n\n\\- In **November 2023** most people [thought](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more) that interest rates were going to be high for a decade or more.- In **late 2007** plenty of experts were [sure](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN26247192/) that we were heading for a soft landing.\n\nPersonally, I look at all of the data and still think that there is a real risk of a hard landing but am trying to maintain a portfolio that will survive in many scenarios. I hope that this inspires some of you to think for yourselves rather than falling for the FOMO and jumping into expensive equities because indices are surging and there is a growing chorus that you are going to be left behind in the next bull market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "18pw67d", "created_utc": 1703427860.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

Companies like Exxon and Chevron have been good for me based on dividends and strength of the companies in general. Free cash flow lots of money in the bank to withstand almost anything that might happen. That goes as many of the other tech companies as well. It really ain't all that complicated we don't need a 16-page doctrine to explain the ups and downs of charts unless you got the kind of money to set up a room like that.

They help to provide a cushion if your thesis goes wrong.\n- Be a contrarian when it makes sense. There\u2019s no point being bearish on the magnificent 7 at the moment just because most people are bullish. You might get run over by a stampede. It does make sense to think for yourself though. The simple wisdom of buying low and selling high usually requires you to buy when everyone else is terrified and to sell when most others are buying. \n- Diversify. Diversification is the only free lunch. If all your investments are different versions of the same bet, there is a good risk that you will have a big drawdown at some point.\n- Size small. It\u2019s always tempting to take a huge position as soon as something looks cheap. I usually start at around 10% of the size that I want to do so that I have plenty of firepower to keep adding if it gets cheaper. Good examples right now, I\u2019m long Singapore but don\u2019t want to get blown up if China invades Taiwan, I\u2019m short the Nasdaq but want to be able to survive another 100-200% rally.\n- Look at technicals. I used to think these were BS, but no harm in waiting for these to be on your side.  Now I wait for RSIs and moving averages to be on my side before sizing up positions.\n- Get lucky.
