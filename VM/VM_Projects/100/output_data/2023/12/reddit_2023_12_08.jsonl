Sweden has very little law regulating labor market (actually quite libertarian even if we say socialism). For example: there are no laws on minimum wage! You can start a company in sweden (very easy) and hire people full time for 1 USD/month wage (if anyone would take that) and be within the law. Then if the workers would form a \u201cunion\u201d and contribute money every month (and over time become a rich union, because it invests money in stocks) have the capability to \u201cstrike\u201d it is up to them! (the company pays no salary during a strike, instead the union will pay salaries). \n\nHowever, due to practical purposes, the state stayed out of regulation of labor market. But also stayed out of preventing union practices such as sympathy strikes.\n\nThat said, there is one main area Swedish law regulates labor market: Who can get fired. Law says Last-In-First-Out (with 2 people exempted) and that the unions have power to circumvent this rule if they approve. This makes in many ways the unions to be something companies wants. For example, if you want to fire the 10% least performers in a company no matter when they were hired, you can do that if you work with the unions. Also Unions hold back salary increases (eg max 2% in a year on average) and thus limit worker churn between companies.\n\n(the Swedish unions care about maximizing the amount of workers, not improve an individual worker\u2019s life)\n\nBtw. The unions in Sweden calculated they have enough money to strike against Tesla for 500 years.\n\nOf course, Tesla hire high-achievers that expect more pay-rise than 2% per year that don\u2019t want to be in a union. But due to \u201cLibertarian\u201d values in society, sympathy strikes are legal - and this is what is crippling Tesla atm (no postal service). \ud83d\ude0a Btw. Logic conclusion of lawsuits are that the postal service does nothing wrong, as the sympathy strike is within law and it is equivalent to force major, but also that Tesla has right to pick up registration plates themselves, i.e. when all is said and done Tesla should be able to function still but they have to pick up registration plates themselves + maybe buy one of the harbors that can receive shipments of cars (should not be a problem for Tesla/Elon to afford).\n\nOr maybe it would be easier to sign the agreement with the unions? I doubt Tesla would have higher costs (the union-mandated insurance is like 30 usd/month, and Tesla probably already have the equivalent), but in return they would be able to fire anyone that is low performing and only increase salaries with 2% per year (however they would not be able to reward top-talent, who would instead go elsewhere*) \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhat do you think Tesla will do?\n\n*) \u201celsewhere\u201d is either startup (unions don\u2019t notice/care) or abroad (US etc).", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Much of the information is correct but a CAB just set the floor.

They are being negotiated between organizations representing the employers and the unions representing the workers. They tend to be set for three years and then renegotiated for the next three years etc. Recently we\u2019ve seen two year agreements due to the uncertainty in the macroeconomic area. \n\nThere\u2019s about 650 CBAs in place that cover 90% of the companies. (Some 65% of the workforce is unionized with the majority actually being white collar workers). As many have stated a CBA doesn\u2019t mean the staff itself gets forcefully unionized since it\u2019s an agreement between the company and the unions. \n\nThe CBA also only set a baseline for the different perks and benefits meaning high performers doesn\u2019t get penalized by this system either. It\u2019s been around since 1938 so it\u2019s a pretty mature system by now if I put it that way. \n\nWhy Spotify doesn\u2019t want to sign an CBA is a bit odd to be honest. They claim they want to give stock options to their employees and this a CBA would be superfluous. But there\u2019s nothing stopping Spotify from giving stock options while also having a CBA. \n\nFor small companies they usually don\u2019t sign a CBA because the extra pension insurance and general insurance is a bit too expensive for them. Which is fine and why the unions doesn\u2019t go after startups etc where this cost is an issue. But for an established company it\u2019s more or less expected you have a CBA. It\u2019s one of the standard question a Swede would ask during a job interview and a \u201cNo\u201d would raise a serious red flag about the company. \n\nNow that Spotify is looking to cut jobs a CBA would actually also have worked in their benefit since a CBA allows for union negotiations about who to let go (it\u2019s more complicated but this is getting too long as is). Now Spotify can only lean on the labor law which says \u201clast in, first out\u201d.\n\nOh. And why strike at Tesla and not Spotify. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get there too. The unions negotiated with Tesla about this for five years before the strike. It\u2019s not something that came out of the blue. They\u2019re just not at that point with Spotify yet. The unions are very patient and do not want to come off as hostile or anti-corporate (might sound odd but the relationship between unions and corporations in Sweden is very symbiotic rather than hostile). \n\nGive Spotify a year or three to change their mind on the subject.
