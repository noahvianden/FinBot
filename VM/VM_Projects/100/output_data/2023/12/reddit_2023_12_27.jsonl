{"title": "Earnings concerns", "selftext": "TLDR: I\u2019m bearish on Teslas 2023 earnings and feel it will fall somewhat dramatically. Growth won\u2019t be there this year and with a pe of 80+ I don\u2019t feel confident in its ability to keep this valuation. Here\u2019s my post from a year ago for some credibility  https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/s/GIyZ4G9SYg\n\n\n2021 rev and earn growth of 71% and 700%\n\n2022 rev and earn growth of 51% and 128%\n\n2023 rev and earn growth (with record q4 estimates. 25B and 3B) will be ~19% and ~(-20%)\n\nThis will be the first year that Tesla did not grow a considerable amount since 2019 (which was already an outlier) and if the 19% growth estimate is correct it will lead to Tesla falling below the magic 50% growth number. \n\nThey\u2019ve also missed this 50% growth number for 2022 and most likely will miss again for 2023 in deliveries. \n\nThe company may regain this large growth number in the future due to its energy department which is doing very well. But it\u2019s not big enough to offset its fall in auto growth this year. \n\nIf we still had a pe of 35 like last year I wouldn\u2019t be worried, but we\u2019re sitting closer to 90 pe currently. I\u2019m extremely bullish on Tesla longterm, but I don\u2019t think the market is going to react well to upcoming 2023 earnings.\n\nI want to make sure everyone doesn\u2019t discount this post claiming \u201cFUD and bears\u201d so here\u2019s some proof of my belief in Tesla longterm. And that this is just to start a discussion on the topic. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/s/GIyZ4G9SYg\n\nEven if Tesla had an insane quarter and really broke the scale, they\u2019ll still at best have flat earnings y/y and ~25% rev growth. And deliveries won\u2019t be overly impressive relative to past years. \n\nI really don\u2019t see Tesla doing well following earnings. But I\u2019m not selling more than 10% of my relatively small holding which is now ~30 shares.

This latest piece vaguely and nonsensically suggests there are thousands upon thousands of disgruntled Tesla customers. It\u2019s nonsensical because it\u2019s nonfactual\u2014the reality is Tesla\u2019s customer retention is among the best and highest in the industry.\n\n**Misleading headline:**  \u201cTesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective.\u201d\n\n**Reality (buried in the article):**\u00a0 Tesla paid for most of the 120,000 vehicle repairs under warranty.\n\n**Manufactured story:**\u00a0 The customer photo represents not a failed component, but instead a **post crash component** that was damaged in the course of reducing the adverse effects of a collision. The customer was informed that Tesla was able to review the telemetry and understood there was a crash that resulted in this repair not being covered by warranty.\u00a0 Most, if not all, manufacturer warranties exclude damages caused by a crash because that is the point of insurance coverage.\n\n**Helpful context:** Tesla has the most advanced vehicle telemetry system that can identify emerging issues, determine scope, and allow for faster vehicle and service improvements than has ever been seen in the auto industry.\u00a0We take action as soon as we see a problem, something that should be celebrated as best-in-class, and is often cited by our regulators as a major safety advantage.\n\n**False accusation:** The author has conflated a noise-related (non-safety) issue with a range of unrelated and disconnected service actions.\u00a0Contrary to the article\u2019s statements based on erroneous data, Tesla is truthful and transparent with our safety regulators around the globe and any insinuation otherwise is plain wrong.\n\n**Tesla Service Principles:** a. Our service technicians and advisors diagnose, maintain and fix our customers\u2019 cars efficiently and are not incentivized to profit off customers\u2019 repair needs.  b. Tesla provides our service employees with excellent compensation and benefits packages.\u00a0They don\u2019t work off of commission like at other dealers who are incentivized to upsell or overcharge their customers. The best service is no service.\u00a0When service must be done, we fix 90%+ problems without even needing the customer present \u2013 either through over-the-air updates or with mobile service at a customer\u2019s house or workplace. To see Tesla\u2019s approach in action, one can refer to this maintenance study from earlier this year, \u201cTesla was named the cheapest luxury car brand to maintain..\u201d \u2192\n\n[https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-named-cheapest-luxury-car-110000613.html](https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-named-cheapest-luxury-car-110000613.html)\n\nThis cherry-picking approach to journalism results in missing the truth, which is a pattern in many of the negative articles about Tesla.\u00a0Using one customer\u2019s one-sided version of events as the universal experience of all customers paints a false and misleading picture of Tesla.\u00a0In reality, for every upset customer, there are hundreds more who are thrilled with their Tesla and eager to repeat their business.\u00a0The numbers don\u2019t lie in terms of repeat sales and customer satisfaction.  We strive to make every customer a lifelong member of the Tesla family.\u00a0  While others may have their own agendas, **our principles have been the same since the beginning:\u00a0to make the safest cars in the world, which are easiest to maintain, while accelerating the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy**.\n\n12:47 pm \u00b7 27 Dec 2023 \u00b7 **1.8M** Views", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Can someone reply if they see the above post - I'm testing something.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Deleted", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12877322733402252}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0886247456073761}], "tickers": ["pm", "tsla", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Show me your short position.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15937921404838562}, {"body": "It was a software update", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "What?

{"title": "$Wix is gonna be a monster pick in 2024, and I am going to continue going all in", "selftext": "In this post, I am going to use some actual logic and reasoning, some anecdotal evidence, and some degenerate logic to appeal to everyone as to why this is gonna be my #1 pick for 2024.\n\nLet's start with some degenerate logic for you guys: Wix is based in Israel. They've been getting attacked for 100 years and still managed to become a tech powerhouse. Intel just announced a multi-billion dollar investment there, and they're gonna win this War on their terms no matter what some mamby pambys crying on social media do.  When they win: Bam. Rally. So buy in for the \"Israel won the the war\" rally, coming soon.\n\nActual Logic and Reasoning: Wix is a leader in a growing and important space. There's some easy transitions into some big markets, and the area of 'no code' websites and tools are becoming a growing part of basic e-commerce sites and most low hanging fruit. Sure, there will always be complex tools needed custom built from professionals, but most restaurants, e-commerce stores, personal brands, news outlets, media brands, and anything of the sorts is where Wix shines.\n\nI am a writer, have a few of my own companies, SEO professional, news, data & analytics, ran some stores, etc. I've used and built with WordPress, Wix, and custom stacks (react), and have used Shopify, Squarespace, and GoDaddy. Basically, I've used all the options in some capacity. Wix currently has a 43% global website builder market share AND GROWING.\n\nRight now, I think Wix is quickly becoming the #1 overall option. As far as investing goes:\n\nShopify is at a forward P/E of 73, and Squarespace is at 31. Wix has a P/E of 23 and still largely depressed stock price after their fall from grace duringthe 2022 crash. (like Zoom and other stay-at-home stocks.)\n\nAs far as the competitors, I've used them all and the advantages between them are quickly fading. Wordpress used to be the 'default CMS' and #1 option for SEO. Now, in my experience, Wix is better for SEO. Let's break it down:- Shopify:  Tends to be the go-to for the e-commerce side of the house. It has a few advantages, like built-in warehousing and some other key features. But largely falls flat on many things outside of this. Wix is making some quick headway here and has apps, services, and other options here for users to build out.\n\n\\- Wordpress: Wordpress used to be the go-to CMS for anyone looking to write blog posts or news. It still is in many ways because its an 'open-source' solution. You can develop on the WordPress program to let users publish on, for example, a custom-built website that's not WordPress. But for anyone with a casual blog, or even a semi-professional basic news site, Wix is more than enough. Wix has an open source program called Velo now to compete with this anyway that I know a lot of people use. I have top-ranked stories published through Wix, and my Wix site has done better SEO-wise than many WordPress sites I've used (I know, for example, backlinks play a huge role in this, but it's just something I've discovered.)  I don't know anyone that uses Wordpress for e-commerce.\n\n\\- Squarespace: It used to be top of the line, then they just gave up.  It's like the budget option that everyone starts out with then abandons because it's terrible at everything.\n\nHere's some key points of growth for Wix:\n\n\\- Payment Processing: You can now use Wix as a payment processor. They take 2.5% and that can QUICKLY add up when you've got millions of websites around the globe. As they keep taking market share, and become a more legitimate option for medium-to-large companies, that could add up quick. It's cheaper than competitors by like .3%, so makes it easier to switch. They're already getting involved in integrating POS devices so people can use Wix to process payments in physical stores as well. So now, they can get in physical retail stores of all the companies on their list.\n\n\\- Newsletters: Everyone has a newsletter now. It's exhausting. I have like three. Wix gives you all the features everyone else has and more because you can integrate it all in one. Lots of people would, for example, use Mailchimp, Beehiiv, or Hubspot for their newsletters AND THEN have several other services for hosting their website, accounts, etc. Wix has a paid newsletter service now, which means people will now launch a website + a newsletter on their site all in one. It maxes out at about $60/month for unlimited email sends. Convert a few hundred thousands users there and you're looking at some solid rev growth of pure profit.\n\n\\- Velo: For people that want that all-in-one solution that Wix offers but using a more open-source and custom solution, Wix launched Velo. Wordpress isn't the only opensource CMS option now, and you can build out some impressive options with the site.\n\nPosition: 500 shares (on margin, for the degeneracy.)

This includes the algorithms used to analyze the data, as well as the exact wavelengths of light used and the angle of the light sources on the sensor. \n\nIn other words, they use advanced math to get a better signal from a traditional sensor, much like Apple does all that processing to make their webcams look so good. That\u2019s not reflected in BOM since it\u2019s a software component, and Apple isn\u2019t gonna change their CPU design for this. \n\nAt worst, they\u2019ll default back to a method that\u2019s less accurate, and Apple may be forced to rework the exact wavelengths of light they use as well as the position of lights on the sensor.
