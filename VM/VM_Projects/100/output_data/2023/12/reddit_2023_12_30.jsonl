{"title": "Stocks for shorting in 2024 -Would you?", "selftext": "The last quarter of 2023 (October-December) saw a strong rally in the US stock market, particularly in November and December. While various stocks saw impressive gains, the top performers varied depending on the specific timeframe and metric used (e.g., absolute gain, percentage gain, market cap). Here are some options to consider:\r  \n\r  \nOverall Top Performers:\r  \n\r  \nAppLovin (APP): +255.9% year-to-date (based on 2023 performance), driven by strong AI-powered advertising performance and positive financials.\r  \nSymbotic Inc. (SYM): +154.5% in the last quarter, boosted by rapid revenue growth in supply chain automation and AI adoption by major retailers.\r  \nNvidia (NVDA): +122.5% in the last quarter, fueled by booming data center business and optimism about AI applications.\r  \nMeta Platforms (META): +85.4% in the last quarter, rebounding from a 2022 downturn thanks to recovering online advertising demand.\r  \nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (RCL): +68.7% in the last quarter, as travel and leisure stocks benefited from easing pandemic concerns.\r  \nOther notable gainers:\r  \n\r  \nPalo Alto Networks (PANW): +48.5% in the last quarter, driven by cybersecurity demand amid increasing cyber threats.\r  \nTesla (TSLA): +44.2% in the last quarter, propelled by positive electric vehicle deliveries and production ramp-up.\r  \nPulteGroup (PHM): +43.2% in the last quarter, buoyed by strong housing market trends and favorable mortgage rates.\r  \nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD): +42.1% in the last quarter, benefiting from chip shortages and robust demand for its processors.\r  \nCarnival Corporation (CCL): +41.3% in the last quarter, mirroring RCL's recovery in the cruise line industry.", "id": "18uhn9m", "created_utc": 1703948928.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "Everyone on stocks/investing hates to talk shorting, its dangerous/risky, but there's money in it if you get it right and can handle the stress.

Whereas if you are long and something goes up 50%, then another 50%, you make 125%.\n\nWith all this said I do still find the idea of long-short portfolios interesting\n\nEdit: Actually it would be remiss not to mention the positive side of shorting, which is that you get cash, which could be deposited for 5% at today's rates, so you do get that little wind at your back (counter to that is you have to pay the dividends, if there are any). Or, if you've genuinely got a good long, then even if your short is not great, provided it loses less money than the long makes, you still win. So there's definitely a case for it.
