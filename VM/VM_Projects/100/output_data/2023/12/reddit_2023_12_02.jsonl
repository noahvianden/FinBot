Publication of this thesis makes me feel several different things:\n\n1) I feel like someone is about to make a lot of money.\n\n2) It's probably not going to be me.\n\n3) I need to visit my psychiatrist and see about getting my meds checked out.\n\nYou're not going to believe the level of regarded conspiracy hype / bullshit that this post is going to stoop to, but before we begin - let me lay out my credentials as a financial investor. Just take a peep at my P&L from today's efforts in the market:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Am I beating the S&P500? No.... I'M KICKING THE ABSOLUTE SHIT OUT OF IT. This isn't even my retirement account.

You'll have to bear (bare) with me because when I saw that I made over 8.8 thousand dollars today I immediately blew half of it on my children's preschool tuition and wasted the other half on getting caught up on my mortgage. Then I took the remaining $20 down to the local liquor store and bought a little something for myself (peppermint schnapps).\n\n[Keep in mind that the financial advice you're receiving is not endorsed by the Hiram Walker corporation.

I'm very successful and you probably wish that you were more like me. \n\nGet ready to have your mind blown. But before we progress, I need you to take a test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If you retain a financial advisor, and you think that 'BuY aNd HolD' is the best investment strategy, then you will choose one link.

Will you choose the Red Pill of financial security, where you buy high quality stocks and hold them for long periods of time? Or the blue pill, where you are introduced to new chart patterns that will make you question the very fabric of financial reality? The choice is yours.\n\nIt's an easy out, and nobody will  hold it against you. If you're uncomfortable learning the truth about how the markets work, then by all means... take [THE RED PILL.](https://www.cnbc.com/mad-money/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you still here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWake up... WAKE UP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow did that blue pill taste? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome... to the real world. A world where many people have nothing... not even a Robinhood account. Above them, some people have hundreds of dollars... enough to be secure in the knowledge that they can afford food for their family for many weeks to come. Above them, a few people own a useful tool like a bicycle, giving them the elitist ability to travel 3-4 times faster than their foot-bound peers. Some people have thousands of dollars. We're getting into rarified air here... Privileged few have enough wealth to own a home. Truly wealthy individuals have vast fortunes that stretch into the hundreds of thousands of dollars - enough wealth to allow them to do no further work themselves, and instead lean on their holdings to create value on their behalf.\n\nIn a handfull of circumstances, (normally inheritance) people are able to accumulate wealth reaching into the millions of dollars. This allows them to largely distance themselves from the struggles of day-to-day life. These people are able to afford things like 'therapy', which is a ceremony in which people pay huge amounts of money to sit on a couch and complain.\n\nBut, this is not the highest amount of wealth. No, it goes much further. There are in fact people who control 10's of millions of dollars of wealth. This amount of money, converted to rice, would yield:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If you took 10 Million dollars to Target and just bought long grain rice, you could get 1,428,571 pounds of rice. Provided they had it in stock.](https://preview.redd.it/rd0km62bfs3c1.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2518592e37395496a84a95853221be92aa96854)\n\nThe amount of energy in a pound of rice is about:\n\n[Get on the stairmaster you lazy shit. ](https://preview.redd.it/wrchsjnxfs3c1.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=7614aefa58c14d74cab28f80ec7750e9ce89a908)\n\nSo if you took your $10,000,000 fortune to target and converted it to rice, and then took it home and converted it to food, you would have:\n\n(1,428,571) x (1,655) = 2,364,285,714 calories.\n\nThat, divided by the recommended calorie intake of 2000 / day would mean that if you took $10,000,000 and converted it into energy through the purchase and ingestion of target-brand long grain rice, you would have enough energy to last you 1,182,143 days. This equates to 3,238 years or roughly 45 lifetimes for the average human.\n\nAnd that assumes you're buying your rice at retail.\n\nKnowing the above, it may surprise you that some people are hoarding even more than $10,000,000. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[You've gotta be kidding me.](https://preview.redd.it/692wvb2phs3c1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32aa8a3a47db5b9c8d07a24f875149f049da06c)\n\nLook, you can see where I'm going with this. There are a lot of people who have more money than they need to survive. But the weird part about being really rich is that it doesn't mean you want to disappear and just enjoy your rice and some peace and quiet. If wealth accumulation is in your nature then it will probably remain part of your nature even after you accumulate wealth. One of the principles of life that is most useful is the idea that people don't change.\n\nFor example, Dion Sanders had nothing to prove at the end of his NFL career, and yet here we are... he's coaching college football and starring in an Amazon series whose creative underpinning seems to stem from the fact that the word 'prime' is shared between the two relevant entities.\n\nAt some point, money doesn't matter anymore. I'll let Heath Ledger deliver the punchline to the last few paragraphs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If we're going to understand the markets, we need to understand that the people influencing it like to pretend that they exist in a dramatic universe where there are winners and losers.

No candlestick goes unnoticed. But what I witnessed today goes beyond any normal interpretation and frankly, it blew my mind.

I don\u2019t think Fisker has broad social support from retail investors in the way that GameStop does.

I would not be surprised if a hedge fund with a large and very profitable short position closes out their position suddenly, and with a series of market orders. In fact, that may be what we saw in the price action yesterday just prior to the dick and balls pattern forming.\nOne of the ironic parts of a short squeeze is that a huge price spike can sometimes actually give the company better odds of success. If the company has been authorized to float some shares into the market to raise capital, a short squeeze is the perfect place to do that. I think AMC did quite a bit of dilution during price spikes in 2021.\nThe opposite is true as well. If the price of the stock has been artificially deflated by short, sellers trying to push the price to zero, then the company is going to have a hard time raising capital if they choose to use market value shares as a vehicle to do so.\nBut all it takes is a few large short positions to close out, and it can create a chain reaction. In my opinion, the company is undervalued on a fundamental basis, and on top of that there\u2019s a 47% short interest. Certainly worth keeping an eye on! \nIn the likely event, that a epic short squeeze, never materializes, provided the company is able to survive and avoid bankruptcy, the large amount of short interest would, at the very least provide a great deal of \u201cupward, gravity\u201c similar to when a company buys back its own shares there would be a lot of additional buying pressure for a long period of time that would support the price of the stock at whatever level it decides to bottom out at.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
