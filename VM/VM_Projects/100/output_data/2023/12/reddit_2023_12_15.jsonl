The macro data and the reporting in the beige book confirm that we're only just recently seeing the demand destruction from the tightening and that much of the inflation was supply chain oriented.\n\nInflation came down 7% before the hikes had any major effect and QT really had any major impact. At least the majority of that percentage, anyway.\n\nSo... it was transitory... just... macroeconomically (meaning over years) transitory, not \"clickbait news cycle\" transitory.\n\nI still don't trust them entirely, but at the same time if anyone was looking at the data and the capital in the system and the overall dynamics, it was possible to see this outcome and pattern... we just had to ignore fear-oriented biases and think about the patterns, and the bear fearporn was very tempting if you didn't constantly reassess with that data. And people were very happy to attack people who didn't sell those bear theses.\n\nNow we have the next 6 months to get through, which I think may be one of the more dangerous periods because this is when people are looking for something to break... but at the same time we have to remain optimistic because the Fed Put is back, and the market will react to that until we can see it doing otherwise.

Yes, it's absolutely just my opinion regarding my assessment of JPOW.\n\nB. The question about the impact of tightening and the effect to CPI is not my opinion.\n\nIt's the Fed's opinion, and if they could say that their tightening was responsible for all of the CPI reduction, they would.\n\nStop and apply a little logic. If their intent is self-serving, why would they change the data to make it look like their actions had LESS effect.\n\nThis is the opposite of what happens when corrupt oligarchs manipulate data in regimes and situations where that kind of thing happens in a non-transparent way. They typically change data to make themselves look better, not less effective.\n\nBut we don't need to rely on basic logic for this assessment, because the idea that tightening cycles take up to 18 months to show demand destruction isn't a new concept, it's baked into the dynamics and always has been and shows up in every tightening cycle that exists in the past for a very simple reason: Consumers and businesses don't change their behavior until you reach a restrictive stance AND they start to feel that restriction, which means you need several months of increased debt spending before it slows anything.\n\nWe're not just savages clawing around in the muck (well, most of us, anyway) where nobody understands anything. There are dynamics and there's public data to make assessments with.\n\nI'm also aware of the change which was made to CPI last year to reduce the size of the data bucket range and push it forward. A lot of insanity happened on this sub at the time by people who don't understand basic math and statistics and data analysis concluding that the Fed was making a massive change that was going to suddenly and immediately reduce CPI to normal.\n\nPeople said that it was a secret change. That nobody knew what they were doing or how it would impact CPI (that last part was only partially true). People said the change was to fake the numbers... etc....\n\n100% of them were wrong. The math most of them were using would have failed a 3rd grade math quiz. Almost none of them knew how to do a google search.\n\nAnd in the end, it didn't have a huge impact. The change you're referring to was just bringing the data from 2 years to 1 year of a bucket and bringing it a little closer to now, which is more valid.\n\nAnd that was public information... for months... and all you needed to find it was a simple google search. And the implications, while not entirely possible to predict with precision, could easily have been predicted within a range, and it was a far tighter range than people were assuming, which was proven true when all of the conspiracy theorists were wildly wrong about the outcome and the people who did research were correct.\n\nPeople on this sub, when something happens that doesn't conform to their assumptions and wants, assume that if THEY don't understand something, then NOBODY can and it must be a conspiracy. I assure you, that is not the case.\n\nThis is public data, and we can assess it as public data on its own merits.

No one will reelect a politician that made them poorer by making things harder to pay (cutting off social benefits against unemployment, energy, food, reducing the amount of government workers, selling deficient public companies, reducing social security funds, etc.). One of the main problems we have is:\n\na) there is as much people working without legal contracts (so no taxes being payed upon their income) as people that do have legal contracts. This makes for a society where only half of the working class has to pay for every penny the government spends in all of the things I listed above via taxes. As governments realize they are not getting as much money they need to pay for all this variables, they up the taxes, which results in even more people going into the non legal contract sector (their employer and them won't pay any taxes, which results in the pay being a little bit more than if it was all legal).\n\nb) governments spend more than they have and incur in printing or borrowing money from global emergency funds, which lowers the value of our currency, producing inflation and making everyone poorer month by month. This is the reason why former governments resorted to populist measures and expansive monetary policies in order to patch the holes that this tax scheme makes in a country's economy and development.\n\nObviously we have a lot more problems like corruption and an absence of a well defined economical and political project in the long run.
