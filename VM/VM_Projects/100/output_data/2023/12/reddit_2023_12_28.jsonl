The next-best performer was Coinbase, which shot up 423% largely because of bitcoin\u2019s rebound.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve setting the stage for interest rate cuts in the year ahead and more retailers signing onto Affirm\u2019s buy now, pay later offerings, or BNPL, fear of a doomsday scenario for the company has faded. Shares of Affirm got a big boost in November after the company inked an expanded partnership with Amazon, and BNPL purchases hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.\n\n\u201cThe expectation was the consumer was going to be toast, unemployment was going to pick up and higher interest rates would destroy everything, and the exact opposite has happened on all fronts,\u201d said Tom Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital, which doesn\u2019t have a position in the stock. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you have a scenario where Affirm can start to perform.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/28/affirms-stock-quintupled-this-year-beating-all-tech-peers.html", "id": "18t2d9j", "created_utc": 1703791976.0, "score": 471, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "Broke now, broker later.", "score": 445, "replies": [{"body": "buy now poor later", "score": 58, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5249167680740356}, {"body": "[ Removed by Reddit ]", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "Argentina & Venezuela would like a word with you good sir/madam", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Don't know why you're bring downvoted, you aren't wrong.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "What did he say?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06988942623138428}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1053713783621788}, {"body": "Don't know why you're being downvoted, you aren't wrong.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09367048740386963}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.009057498537003994}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06449080258607864}, {"body": "There\u2019s a new company that finances your weed purchases online.

I don\u2019t understand how you can do so for 20 years. Knowing what I know about these listed companies, they aren\u2019t all \u201csleep well at night\u201d stocks. There are risks associated with these investments so you shouldn\u2019t convince yourself that buying at whatever price is okay simply because you plan to hold for 20 years. Unexpected things happen. The top companies of each decade continue to change. Even something as strong as Google had its moat questioned earlier in the year. So I don\u2019t see how you can do a 20 year DCF. \n\nFor example PANW is in a rising industry and I consider their offerings to be higher quality compared to some of the other cyber companies. But what if PANW starts making stupid acquisitions? Do you keep blindly buying the stock? Another retail favorite for this case is O. I predict they will see chronic underperformance if they continue DCAing into O. The business has changed so investors need to adapt and not hold onto old ideas. \n\nThe concept of DCA has been bastardized by retail investors. It is perfectly feasible and recommended most people DCA and hold for 20+ years\u2026 for broadly diversified ETFs. Not for individual stocks, especially not for unprofitable companies such as RKLB which are impossible to predict more than a couple of years out. \n\nIf you want outperformance, which I believe you do because you\u2019re taking on extra risk by buying individual stocks, you want to keep assessing if your business is still going on the right track. And if you don\u2019t want outperformance and just want to keep buying high quality businesses, just DCA into the index because those are the top companies in the world.\n\nI will close my comment by saying this: **I buy stocks and project them for only 3 years but I always HOPE the company keeps executing so I can hold it for 20+ years. I don\u2019t always DCA into them but I don\u2019t mind averaging up or down if the company continues to do well.** That\u2019s how I get my 10 baggers.

Allocating a small percentage of your portfolio to individual stocks is a wise decision, but that's due to limiting risk, it has nothing to do with the comment that these are expensive stocks. Expensive is a relative term. A $50 stock could be more expensive than a $500 stock. The expense is judged in terms of P/E ratio, where P is the price of the stock and E is their most recent annual earnings. When you buy a stock, it's not a number on a screen, it's a tiny piece of a company. Now, if I can own a piece of a company for $10, and they produce $1 in annual earning per share, that's a 10 P/E and could be an excellent investment opportunity IF that company will continue indefinitely and perhaps even grow (growth is also relative to the rest of the economy). In contrast a company with only $1 in earnings but a $50 stock price is a much riskier proposition, because that company would need to grow tremendously for it to be eventually be able to pay out dividends and increase the stock price through buy backs to reward me for my initial investment. In simplified terms, the P/E reflects the growth expectation that's currently priced into the stock. If it exceeds that expectation you do well. If it falls short of that expectation, you'll do poorly. The entire S&P500 is currently at an elevated P/E but few moreso than the \"magnificent 7.\" If you've owned any of them for a long time, sure, keep holding, but now is not a good time to buy into MSFT or NVDA, nor AMD, nor COST.
