{"title": "Opinions on AMD?", "selftext": "Hey guys. Wanted to get some more experienced people's opinions. I don't know if this kind of post is allowed or not. If not, I apologize and feel free to remove. So I'm a pc gamer and have noticed AMD has been popping off in all aspects. Almost nothing bad has been said about them this generation and I have heard and seen a lot of people moving from Intel and nvidia to AMD. I bought some calls on it since I believe it to continue to go up. These are my current options, it's not much, but I'm a beginner. And before anyone says it, I know people recommend to not do options early on and I understand why. I'm not afraid of losing the little bit of money I have in there. My goal is to get some decent chunks of change from AMD's calls and reinvest the profits into actual shares and using the original investment into calls again. Here are my [options](https://imgur.com/a/eaTExAN). The first 3 are cheap yolos that I know have a small chance. The second 2 are the ones I care about and really hoping does well.

Cost to provide the service. A charging station buys electricity and resells it for a profit. Easy. They don't have any staff. Any swap stations would have to factor in the cost to lock in X battery packs to provide Y swaps / hour. If a swap takes 5 minutes and charging a battery takes 30 minutes, then you need at least 6 extra packs to provide that service. If we were to factor in 80kWh packs, then it's an extra 480kWh that increases the cost of any swap station. And it doesn't save you time with the chargers either, as your charging power needs to be sized for peak demand. Add to that the rental cost for the space which is significant, especially in big urban environments and the maintenance cost of the swap station itself.\n2. Do you want to go into the cost to build? Fast chargers is essentially just their cost plus a contribution to upgrading the transformers, if there isn't enough spare power available. Not to mention that most charging stations are associated with other businesses like shopping malls, which means there's an incentive for them to contribute towards the cost, since the occupants of the vehicles are likely going to shop/eat there as well. Compare that to a swap station, where you need A LOT of real estate, which frankly isn't compatible at all with dense urban environments. And all of these costs come and inflate your operational cost and drive the price at which you need to sell your 1 kWh of \"charge\" higher. Not to mention that in order for the 5 minute swap to be an advantage, it needs to be very close by. As otherwise, especially in a big city, it makes no sense to drive a few kms each way, since the time saved from swapping would be consumed by driving to/from the swap station.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I mentioned, I'd be really curious to see official data on what's the cost associated with a swap station.
