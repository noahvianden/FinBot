You're assuming cash on the balance sheet has a 1:1 relationship with stock price/ market cap. It's all about how the company with less cash is working your capital efficiently.\n\nThe easiest way to explain is using an example:\n\nImagine there are two AAPL companies. Same business, same everything.\n\nOne, AAPL A, has no cash and is worth $3T or $193 per share.\n\nThe other, AAPL B, has $3T cash and in your mind should be worth $6T or $386 per share.\n\nWhich company would you invest in?\n\nThe rational choice is AAPL A. They're getting 100% exposure to AAPL's business, whereas AAPL B they're only getting 50% exposure to AAPL's business, the remainder is invested in cash.\n\nGrowth rate and earnings will be half for AAPL B. \n\nIf AAPL doubles their revenue and profits, and stock price doubles then $10k invested in AAPL A would become $20k.\n\n$10k invested in AAPL B would only become $15k + any interest on cash.\n\nIt's the same logic on why companies borrow money instead of issuing more stock, it boosts shareholder return through capital efficiency. \n\nThe company borrows so you reap the benefits of the returns minus cost of debt.\n\nPeople can easily understand how borrowing from the bank can allow them to get huge property gains with only the down payment. \n\nPeople also understand that cash in the bank not being invested is missing out on stock returns.\n\nHowever, people have trouble applying that knowledge they have to companies.\n\n\nLastly for the people who think in terms of DCF and discount rate. If you're discounting a company's cash flows by 10% and the cash on balance sheet is generating 5%, then mathematically more cash on the balance sheet has a negative impact on the stock price versus buying back stock.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Dead wrong actually!

GOOG forward P/E is 19 and AAPL is about ~30. What am I missing here? Before someone says buybacks, GOOG does $79b a year - AAPL does $90b but comparing the market caps of the companies, GOOG buyback is SIGNIFICANTLY larger as a % of shares outstanding/market cap\n\nDisclaimer: I work for Google so I'm obviously biased and compensated quite a lot in GOOG shares.

Yes, it's the majority of revenue now, but the % of Ads revenue as total revenue has been in free fall. Not really comparable to Meta which makes 98% of revenue from Ads, Googles number was I think 76% in Q3 and it's decreasing rapidly.\n\nGoogle search by itself is an almost $200B/yr business. It's almost like at the current valuation you're buying Search and getting YouTube, Cloud, Play, Pixel,  Android, YouTube Premium, YouTube TV, etc all for free. Not even considering the moonshots and other bets like Waymo\n\nIf this company were valued by the sum of its parts then it would be worth way more I think. \n\nThe Google Service (Google One, YouTube Premium/TV/music, etc) growth story has been completely ignored by investors imo and it's interesting to me because Google has by far the largest user base in the world. \n\nI obviously have access to internal data, so I don't want to leak or reveal too much, but I'm highly confident that at least YouTube is on a path to having their services (from YT premium/TV/music) comprise the majority of revenues in the next few years.\n\nSo yes I am biased but I still feel GOOG is hugely undervalued here.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["meta", "aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Apple income is all hardware too.

That customer who\u2019s bought the companies highest model cars won\u2019t be unhappy if they decide to lower the price by 34k over a year? Attack me personally as much as you\u2019d like because I\u2019m not seeing any arguments as to why investing in Tesla now is better than investing in Tesla back in 2014. Product pricing is a complicated aspect of business. The 4Ps, the 5Cs\u2026 you can\u2019t force customers to buy your stuff. 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers. I feel like I have to go back to the very basics of business to articulate why lowering the price on their top tier cars makes customer who bought them recently unhappy about the brand. But this isn\u2019t a consumer feeling sub, it\u2019s an investment sub. Their margin on their top tier cars were reduced with the price cuts. Unless you increase volume by more than 34% it\u2019s a bad business decision to reduce your price by 34% (price & demand elasticity). Off to enjoy lunch but I\u2019d recommend reading a little more and feeling a little less. These are business decisions, not personal.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Lol if 34k is a big deal to you - you shouldn\u2019t have bought the car in the first place. Seems like you stretched for it and got burned. For someone who pretends be a some sort of business/financial guru - you made a very poor decision. Next time skip the 4 seasons lunch until you have a bigger nest egg. \n\nJust for reference - my brokerage routinely fluctuates 50-60k per day. I dgaf I\u2019m about some random cars depreciation - that\u2019s what they do.  But I\u2019m sure you knew that.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your brokerage account, is a long term investment. My car is a depreciating asset. If you take the information like a business, you look at the percentage and not the dollar amount- because it\u2019s all relative. Off 2 million dollars, a daily fluctuation of 40k is 2%. 34% vs 2%. If your brokerage account decreased by 34% and only continued to decline, you may feel differently about your portfolio. If your account is less than 1 million and you have daily fluctuations of 40k, that\u2019s a 4% daily swing which is getting pretty high considering most  accounts target a 10% yearly return.\n\nAs an investor, when I see the company reduce their price by 34%, and I don\u2019t see a 34% increase in volume, at the same margins, it\u2019s a bad business decision. In terms of keeping me as a model S customer, my customer journey looks different after their pricing changed due to my perceived brand value. Value for business = price - cost. Value for customer = perceived value - price. If the car cost 60k to make, and sold for 100k, 100-60= 40k company value created. As a customer, 100k perceived value - 100 price = 0 (as a reference point). The new pricing for those customers is the new price minus how much they paid, 80k-100k= -20k.\n\nI feel like a similar mistake was made with twitter. A company that depends on volume (users) and value (interested posts vs promoted / ads) to create profit. You can\u2019t have the company be worth more when you decrease value, decrease users, and now decreasing ads.\n\nTesla does have upsides, their software has no marginal costs. If they charged for updates I can see them making up for the lost margins- but users may not like this. They also have the best charging network so opening their charging standard to be adopted industry wide was a great early decision. I think they did it in 2016 and it took 8 years for other car makers to utilize. \n\nEverything you\u2019re saying is a feeling or an insult. Talk is cheap. My news feed has 3 Tesla headlines. 1. Tesla depreciation after price cuts 2. Fleet cars (hertz) have stopped buying teslas due to depreciation & repair costs 3. CT pricing\n\nIf a fleet company buys 10,000 teslas and plans to use it for 5 years before selling them for new cars, and the cars lost an addition 10% in depreciation due to pricing, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d choose that brand again.

I'm not going back to a haggle-to-own situation ever again, if I can help it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok. First, matching supply with demand is dynamic. So, you have items in your cart and receive a notification that a product has decreased by a few pennies; that pushes you to compete the purchase. That is amazons model and they have maintained their brand value. That\u2019s pricing elasticity based off demand.\n\nChanging the price based off FP&A is not pricing off demand, it\u2019s pricing off assumptions. Whatever assumption was made, they changed it, meaning they were wrong. It isn\u2019t dynamic but more of a cash grab. I can understand that in terms of releasing a new, high demand, limited production product, like their cyber trucks.\n\nDealerships are separate entities from the manufacturer. I get avoiding them for all their flaws and I get their side of the incentive to raise prices. But they don\u2019t destroy brand value when they say MSRP is x and we are charging x+. That\u2019s not coming from the manufacturer but marketing lies the dealership is spewing. It\u2019s coming from the a middle man that wants to increase their spread. I\u2019d argue, dealerships have shot themselves in the foot by not understanding this same principle. \n\nThe price of a used Tesla has crashed. That is because the manufacturer has lowered their msrp price. A customer, who has bought from Tesla, is more likely to shop other brands when seeing their purchase has depreciated not because of demand, but because of price reductions.\n\nIn my case, why would I pay 100k+ now, and buy their same car later, when it lost so much value? And it\u2019s not perceived value but actual value. Did something happen to make a Tesla cost 34% less now than a year ago? As an investor, why would you allow or be happy with a top tier item being reduced by 34% unless the volume increase is greater than 34%?\n\nI dunno, as a former investor, and someone who owns their cars, my next purchase (not for another 5 years) is likely Mercedes or perhaps even lucid if they are still around. And manufacturers seem to recognize the dealership issue by creating a separate entity to sell their EVs directly to consumers (GM think).\n\nI don\u2019t invest based off my feelings. I buy products and services off of feelings. When someone invests, they invest in both the product / service as well as the people. Investment wise, I think their price games was a mistake. If I saw an increase in demand due to their price cuts I may still invest. As a consumer, I feel the brand hurt itself with their pricing and I don\u2019t want my purchase to be devalued so much, not because of demand, but because of pricing.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to say. I was an investor and now, am not. I\u2019m not institutional so I don\u2019t have the ability to buy at discounts and hold. As an investor, I took the massive gains and left. I have a 2023 model S I bought at the height or the market and a 2021 model y I got at the low / middle. Personally, I\u2019ll be looking at Mercedes or lucid for my next 100K purchase and won\u2019t be investing back into Tesla. Not because it\u2019s a bad car but because they destroyed their brand value in my eyes and I don\u2019t see an increase in sales greater than their decrease in price cuts.

See what happened with Netflix when their user growth appeared to slow and then grew again in the following quarters. \n\nDespite these concerns about user growth, the fundamentals continue to perform well. Free cash flow growth is almost in the double digits along with revenue and net income. Total payment volume continues to accelerate and the balance sheet is solid. \n\nNew management has stressed the importance of delivering value to shareholders through improved margins and stock buybacks. The new CEO comes from Intuit and you can see the value that was created there. \n\nThe business model is also well diversified with a Stripe and Square competitor in the portfolio. \n\nI'm buying this dip and holding on.
