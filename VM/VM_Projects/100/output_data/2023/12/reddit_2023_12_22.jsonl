Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "18obygy", "created_utc": 1703241011.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "PCE -0.1% MoM, Exp. 0.0% \n\nCore PCE 0.1% MoM, Exp. 0.2%\n\nPCE 2.6% YoY, Exp. 2.8%\n\nCore PCE 3.2% YoY, Exp. 3.3%\n\nDurable Goods 5.4%, Exp. 2.3%, Last -5.1%\n\nDurable Goods ex Trans 0.5%, Exp. 0.1%, Last -0.3%\n\nCap goods orders nondefense ex air 0.8%, exp. 0.1%, last -0.6%", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Look at that negative sign.\n\n\nWould you just look at it.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18449124693870544}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21955426037311554}, {"body": "RKLB up 17% premarket on news of government contract worth $515 million to design, build, and deliver 18 space vehicles.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "My gem stock.

That said, the red line shows that of that small proportion in collections, the amount in the red is higher. Now someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not think this is inflation adjusted, so that $1600, while high, is actually not much higher than in say 2012 or 2013. The red line is being driven up by everything getting inflated.\n- As always, [most household debt is mortgage debt](https://i.imgur.com/RNZmQ7m.png), and are mostly only given to those with [high credit scores](https://i.imgur.com/0UOCRuo.png), unlike pre GFC. More than 75% of mortgage borrowers have a credit score over roughly 720.\n- [Here are overall delinquency rates](https://i.imgur.com/hHI4YAd.png), broken down by type. Unlike in the past, currently it's either extreme delinquency or barely delinquent, not so much in the middle. And the total frequency is still very low, indicating minimal stress in consumer finances.\n- If we [break down delinquency by type of debt](https://i.imgur.com/dlC1S3s.png), you can see where stress is more common. Credit card delinquency rates tend to be highest, although they are still at pre-pandemic normal levels. There has not been a real spike in credit card delinquencies. Mortgage delinquencies are extremely rare (and they are the biggest source of debt). I don't know what's going on with student loans so I'm not going to comment.\n- [Foreclosures and bankruptcies among consumers](https://i.imgur.com/WUOYZ8y.png).\n- [Debt by age](https://i.imgur.com/tSmBmC1.png). 18-29 is very small proportion of debt, as you'd expect ([they haven't taken out mortgages yet](https://i.imgur.com/UkvKK3c.png)).\n\nAnyway there are like 40 charts in there, so have fun. I won't summarize them all. My general takeaway is that nothing here really concerns me with respect to the stock market / overall economy. The consumers who you'd most expect to experience trouble are experiencing trouble (auto loans / credit debt for those with very low credit scores).

Therefore if the others had to adjust to US standards JUST to sell in the US, they would have to manufacture either two separate sets of versions of the same car or a car that meets both the US standards and the other global standards. Both of which is more expensive than just making a car for one market.The US barely sells any cars outside their own market. Nobody really uses those large horrible pick up trucks anyway, its American market only and a few people who want to be \"different\" and therefore you see one or two of them on European roads from time to time.\n\nNot to mention that US companies often simply do not have a competing product at all. Small or efficient cars in general often are not available in the US, so keeping them outside of their market has no cost to the US manufacturers but removes a huge chunk of highly competitive offerings that would undercut them and be hugely popular probably causing the US manufacturers to shrink into obsurity if they stopped their protectionism.\n\nJust to further make my point: Brands like VW and BMW sell completely different versions of the same car in USA compared to Europe. Often the car is made to a different quality and of bigger size even though the design and model name is identifical. They are also made in the US so when Americans complain about BMWs having bad quality I really can not take that information into account when buying a BMW made in Germany by Germans with a German design for the EU market.
