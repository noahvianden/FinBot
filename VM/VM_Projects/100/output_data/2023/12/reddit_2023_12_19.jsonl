{"title": "Enough with the doomsday theories.", "selftext": "Why is everyone suddenly promoting doomsday theories of imminent collapse and despair?\n\nThere\u2019s a few issues people need to understand.\n\n1. The 2008 financial crisis happened due to financial deregulation under Clinton (glass stegal) with banks assuming too much risk. \n\nFor example sub prime lending. Wallstreet institutions taking on risky mortgages that people can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\nThe banks are now regulated under the bi partisan Dodd frank act\n\n2. Inflation \n\nThere are parts to inflation that are directly caused by the fed and some the fed can\u2019t control\n\nFed can control asset prices like buying mortgage back securities \n\nFed cannot control consumer prices, and inflation in consumer prices have more to do with supply of goods.\n\n This however can be controlled by policy makers \nLike adding china to the WTO to export inflation to 3rd world countries. (Slave factories making your iPhone)\n\nThe fed can influence the demand of goods by raising and lowering interest rates. But there no guarantee people will act the way the fed expects. \n\n3.  American exceptionalism \n\nAmerica has an advantage that other countries don\u2019t.  our technological innovation keeps us ahead of the curb. \n\nThere is no competition with apple \nThere is no competition with google \nThere is no competition with Microsoft\n\n4. Market cycles \n\nMarkets move in cycles. Markets will usually hit a peak go down and rise up again. There is no need to panic, as knowing this you can profit both ways.\n\nConclusion.\n\nThere is no reason to cite doomsday scenarios as it\u2019s unproductive. The United States is the most powerful country in the world. You don\u2019t become that with idiots running your country. While nothing\u2019s perfect.

Muddy Waters initiated a short position on Blackstone's Mortgage Trust fund due to these very concerns.  I actually think the Muddy Water short is what caused the Fed to become more dovish.  They may be trying to head off a financial calamity in private credit with their pivot and they may be very concerned about the potential impacts of a widespread failure of private credit.  Most of the private credit is illiquid and not re-priced like a publicly traded bonds and they don't have the ability, like the banks, to pledge their paper to the Fed at par like the banks do.
