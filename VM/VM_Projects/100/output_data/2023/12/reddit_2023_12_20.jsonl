{"title": "Warner Bros. Discovery in talks to merge with Paramount Global", "selftext": "https://www.axios.com/2023/12/20/warner-bros-paramount-merger-discovery-streaming\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav met with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish on Tuesday in New York City to discuss a possible merger, Axios has learned from multiple sources. Why it matters: The combination would create a news and entertainment behemoth that would likely trigger further industry consolidation.\n\n- Zaslav also has spoken to Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount's parent company, about a deal.\n\n- WBD's market value was around $29 billion as of Wednesday, while Paramount's was just over $10 billion, so any merger would not be of equals.\n\nDetails: The meeting between Zaslav and Bakish, which sources say lasted several hours, took place at Paramount's headquarters in Times Square.\n\n- The duo discussed ways their companies could compliment one another. For example, each company's main streaming service \u2014 Paramount+ and Max \u2014 could merge to better rival Netflix and Disney+.\n\n- It's unclear whether WBD would buy Paramount Global or its parent company, National Amusements Inc. (NAI), but a source familiar with the situation says that both options are on the table.\n\n- WBD is said to have hired bankers to explore the deal.\n\nBetween the lines: The deal could drive substantial synergies. WBD could use its international distribution footprint to boost Paramount's franchises, while Paramount's children's programing assets could be essential to WBD's long-term streaming ambitions.\n\n- CBS News could be combined with CNN to create a global news powerhouse. CBS' crime dramas, such as \"NCIS\" and \"Criminal Minds,\" could be combined with Investigation Discovery and TruTV.\n\n- CBS Sports' footprint could be combined with WBD's. For example, CBS and WBD's Turner Sports currently share TV rights for March Madness.\n\nBe smart: Paramount is under enormous pressure to find a strategic partner or buyer, as it's staring down a mountain of debt.", "id": "18n5g85", "created_utc": 1703106988.0, "score": 292, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "Perfect, another chance to come up with an even stupider streaming service name.
