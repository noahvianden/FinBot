{"title": "Can Tesla stock reach $500 in 2024?", "selftext": "Tesla has a remarkable history of delivering strong returns, boasting a trailing 10-year return of 2,560%. Even this year, with a 98% increase in share value, Tesla has outperformed the broader market. Despite currently trading 41% below its peak price of $410, set in November 2021, some optimistic investors are eyeing a target of $500 per share, implying a potential 100% gain.\r  \n\r  \nFor Tesla to reach this ambitious goal by the end of 2024, several factors need to come into play. Firstly, the company must demonstrate fundamental improvements, particularly in revenue growth and profitability. However, recent challenges, such as a slower revenue increase of 9% in Q3 2023 and a decline in operating margin to 7.6%, indicate a need for substantial progress in these areas.\r  \n\r  \nElon Musk attributes the challenges to an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, including higher interest rates affecting car affordability. Additionally, competition and ongoing price cuts have impacted Tesla's profitability.\r  \n\r  \nWhile revenue and earnings growth are crucial, the missing piece of the puzzle is the valuation. Tesla's current steep price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 78 poses a challenge. The stock's 98% increase this year is attributed to a 105% rise in the P/E multiple, indicating heightened investor enthusiasm.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, relying on continuous P/E expansion might be unrealistic, especially with already sky-high expectations and an uncertain market influenced by higher interest rates and inflation. To reach $500 per share, Tesla would likely need to deliver exceptional financial results, including a doubling of earnings per share between 2023 and 2024. Given recent trends like revenue slowdown and margin compression, achieving this bullish scenario appears challenging, prompting a cautious approach for investors with tempered expectations for Tesla's future performance.\r  \n", "id": "18hexgo", "created_utc": 1702467555.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Either Yes, No or Maybe!", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "I think you may be right!", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3199418783187866}, {"body": "Leaning hard NO with musk at the helm", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Out of morbid curiosity.

Time has proven that the easiest advantage to achieve is patience, the exact opposite of jumping on trends that were playing out for months. Look into trends from early '23 / late '22. Everyone was chasing dividends, SCHD, VOO. So many people predicted that META (at a PE of 13! Even after factoring in the massive meta expenses), GOOG, etc. would underperform, just as they recently had. So many people were getting into energy & oil.\n\nThese sentiments change every few months and once you see it repeat a couple times, it's obvious that the average retail investor has almost no patience.\n\nDon't chase big tech after a giant rally. Sure, buy some and build a position over time, if you're comfortable riding the long term secular trends of technology. Don't buy it because it will outperform the broad market in a month or a year. You won't be accurate with these predictions. Not for a long time anyway. \n\nThe single biggest advantage you have is patience. You don't need to answer to shareholders of your fund, you don't need short term outperformance. You can rely on quality companies that have time and time proven they can excellently allocate capital, that have dug wide moats around their businesses. Companies that yield high returns on capital and can reinvest these returns into more capital.\n\nBuild a portfolio of companies you will be comfortable to hold for decades (you can change your mind, as the world and business  changes, of course). Not by chasing trends - slowly add to your positions. If you trust the leadership of the company and you understand the business models and the incentives that power them, you won't need to worry about short term sentiment changes. If you have a diversified portfolio of companies, there will almost always be some that are on sale due to no other reason than investor sentiments and short term market trends. If you have patience, you can take advantage of market rotation by rebalancing or allocating new capital to the companies hit by the rotation.
