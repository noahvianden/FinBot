{"title": "The $17 billion wipeout of Credit Suisse bondholders has not gone down well in Europe", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/17-billion-of-credit-suisse-bonds-worthless-following-ubs-takeover.html\n\nOne section of Credit Suisse\u2019s bondholders is set to be wiped out following the struggling bank\u2019s takeover by UBS, causing them to see investments worth 16 billion Swiss francs ($17 billion) become worthless. The Swiss regulator FINMA announced Sunday that the so-called additional tier-one bonds, which are widely considered relatively risky investments, will be written to zero as part of the deal. The move has angered Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders as their investments have seemingly been lost, while shareholders will receive payouts as part of the takeover. Usually, equity investments would be classed as secondary to AT1 bonds. Therefore, the decision \u201ccan be interpreted as an effective subordination of AT1 bondholders to shareholders,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 credit strategists said in a research note published Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt also represents the largest loss ever inflicted to AT1 investors since the birth of the asset class post-global financial crisis,\u201d they added. However, FINMA\u2019s move should not come as a shock, Elisabeth Rudman, global head of financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Europe\u201d on Monday. \u201cAT1s are there to absorb losses, so it\u2019s not a surprise,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done what they were supposed to do.\u201d\n\nV\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, who was the vice president of the ECB from 2010 to 2018, commented on FINMA\u2019s announcement on Twitter, saying it was a \u201ca mistake with consequences\u201d that could lead to legal action. The Bank of England has also distanced itself from FINMA\u2019s decision, stating that the U.K. \u201chas a clear statutory order\u201d detailing which shareholders and creditors were expected to take on losses. AT1 bonds \u201crank ahead\u201d of equity investments, the statement noted, adding that they had followed this process in the unwinding of SVB UK.", "id": "11wn5a5", "created_utc": 1679328956.0, "score": 725, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 405, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah sounds like the agreed-upon sequence of failures was not respected.
