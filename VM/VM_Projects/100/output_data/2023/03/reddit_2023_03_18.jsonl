{"title": "Why First Republic Bank's Stock Probably won't Recover", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/67ffazc2jeoa1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a5af5b643532335129f44de70686e27491afdb)\n\nI did a little digging into First Republic Bank's (FRC) 2022 financials, and there are some troubling details within.  If FRC recorded their assets at fair value, they would have a negative stockholder\u2019s equity (book value) given the unrealized losses that do not appear in the financial statements (aside from the footnotes where I got the information). Their loan book is valued on the Balance Sheet at a $22 billion premium over their fair value, and their Held to Maturity (HTM) Debt Securities (i.e. treasuries and bonds) are valued at a $4.7 billion premium over their fair value. So like SVB, FRC has a large collection of assets that have lost a tremendous amount of value since the Fed started hiking interest rates.\n\nAdditionally, if FRC was to liquidate all of it\u2019s assets (aside from real property it owns, which I excluded from the analysis because real estate is not a liquid asset) in an attempt to stem a bank run on deposits, it would have a $1.27 billion shortfall based on the fair value of its assets at the end of 2022. In other words, if FRC sold all of its investments, sold its loan book, and used all the money plus its existing cash balance, it could not pay back all of its depositors if they wanted all their money back.\n\nTLDR; Stock is down over 70% this week, despite the $30 billion injection of liquidity courtesy of JPM, Wells Fargo, Citi, etc. The valuation on the stock seems to be more in line with reality now, with the book value of FRC's assets being greatly inflated compared to the fair value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\**Full disclosure, I own 30 shares of FRC.* ", "id": "11ub9bq", "created_utc": 1679104635.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Not for HTM designation which sounds like most of these banks and private funds are holding currently. \ud83c\udfe6 \ud83d\udca5", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.

{"title": "Fed Rate Hike Next Week", "selftext": "Let\u2019s say you have a bond that cost you $100 and pays 5% a year. So you get $5 every year.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say that all of a sudden, interest rates go to 10%. In that case, a new bond that costs $100 will pay $10 every year.\n\nSo who would buy your bond from you now? Why should someone pay you $100 for your bond, which pays only $5 a year, when they can get a new bond for the same price that pays $10 a year.\n\nIn order for your bond to pay the same 10% that a new bond pays, the price would have to fall to $50. That way they\u2019re getting $5 a year on a $50 investment, which is the same as $10 a year on a $100 investment.\n\nSo the dilemma for JP next week. Does he still raise or do they pause? I believe JP was dovish last meeting because they knew banks behind the scenes are in trouble. Mind you, not only banks, private funds, hospitals, schools etc. With the increasing rates, people need more cash to fund more expensive things.\n\n1. Raise rates .25 and wait and see. Each raise causes consumers to draw down cash, causing banks to sell treasuries. This is now a dangerous move\n\n2. Wait and see what else is breaking by raising 0 and waiting for the next cpi prints\n\n3. Slash fed funds rate. Things are still massively expensive, it could cause inflation to double back up. \n\nWhy I think 2 is what will happen, because people are losing jobs, things are expensive, savings are going down, credit is at  all time high. \n\nRegional banks are going out of business. No one wants to hold the bag. This is bad for local economies on the micros. If banks start failing and can\u2019t find local businesses, if affects people who pay mortgages etc.\n\nIf they do 3, it\u2019ll be an acknowledgment that they raised rates to fast. 3 could occur if they have non public information of bad financial things happening behind the scenes\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWhat do you think happens to spy?", "id": "11ulnl8", "created_utc": 1679138445.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|1915|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: It is likely that the Fed will pause interest rate hikes next week in order to assess the current economic situation.
