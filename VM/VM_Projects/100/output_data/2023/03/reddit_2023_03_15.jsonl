It was triggered by the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, which was one of the largest trust companies in New York City at the time. The failure was caused by risky bets that the company had made in the stock market, and it sparked a wave of panic among investors and depositors.\n\nThe panic quickly spread to other financial institutions, and two other trusts, the Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust, also failed. The panic intensified when a run on the Knickerbocker's depositors began, causing many other healthy banks and trust companies to experience runs as well.\n\nTo prevent the crisis from spreading further, the banker J.P. Morgan stepped in and organized a group of bankers to provide liquidity to the financial system. The group eventually put together a pool of $25 million to lend to troubled institutions, which helped to stabilize the markets and restore confidence.\n\nAfter three weeks of turmoil, the panic eventually subsided, and the markets began to recover.
