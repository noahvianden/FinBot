Morgan warns U.S commercial real estate may be the next bomb", "selftext": "When the Fed slams the brakes, some passengers are thrown out of the windshield, for example the burst of Cathie Wood\u2019s investment bubble, or the collapse of Silicon Valley bank. And according to JPMorgan, US commercial real estate would potentially be the next bomb that could explode.\n\nSpeaking at the $2.5tn asset manager\u2019s European Media Summit on Tuesday, George Gatch, CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management warned that commercial real estate forms one of the critical areas of risk in global markets after the aggressive monetary tightening by the US central bank. \n\n\u201cWe saw it (the stress of rising interest rates) in a huge repricing in fixed income, in UK pension funds\u2019 liability driven investment strategies,\u201d he said. \u201cCommercial real estate is an area of concern. We have higher interest rates for property developers, how does that impact the real estate market and lenders in that space?\u201d\n\nCommercial property values have started to slide in recent months, as rising borrowing costs have hit investors\u2019 ability to transact. Investors are keeping a close eye on real estate funds. Earlier this month, BlackRock, a world-renowned top-tier investment firm with a strong family history, went as far as to fall into a $560 million CMBS default.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackRock's US$71 billion real estate investment trust BREIT, a barometer of the commercial real estate market, has continued to trigger monthly client withdrawal caps since November last year, both highlighting the awkwardness of commercial real estate in the face of rapid interest rate hikes in Europe and the US.\n\nIn a note on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs also said the commercial real estate sector was dealing with a \u201cchallenging\u201d environment. \u201cThe recent stress in the banking sector has fuelled growing concern about spillover effects on the commercial real estate industry. With over half of the $5.6tn of outstanding commercial loans sitting on bank balance sheets, bank lending remains the primary source of funding for the sector. This is particularly the case for small banks which capture the lion\u2019s share of lending.\u201d\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Bank of America said investors in its monthly fund manager survey were more bearish on real estate than they have been since October 2020, having taken cautious positions on the asset class since September. \u201cConcerns over commercial \\[and\\] office real estate are driving growing anxiety over the sector.\u201d\n\nView more market insight on [https://www.ainvest.com/](https://www.ainvest.com/).", "id": "11yfnmx", "created_utc": 1679483531.0, "score": 430, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "This is this economic downturn's worst kept secret.

Rule of thumb is if the building is suitable, those things will amount to $100-$200 per square foot. Not cheap at all, but it gets worse. Think about two cases:\n\n* An office building in the middle of a block\n* An office building that takes a whole city block\n\nIn the first case, there are windows on only one side of the building. Office buildings address that by having wide open space across the whole floor, and by using lots of artificial light. In a conversion, you can\u2019t really have apartments with no windows at all. You wind up with narrow apartments at best, and at worst lots of unusable space against the back wall. Hopefully that\u2019s at least where elevators and services are, but even that is unlikely if it\u2019s based on central core construction.\n\nIn the second case, if it\u2019s at all a modern office building, it\u2019s almost certainly central core construction with as large a floor pad as possible. 20-25,000 square feet or more. If there\u2019s passable light on all 4 sides, you\u2019ve got a donut shape around the outside where apartments can be added. Next, work out hallways from the elevators to the apartments. You\u2019ll find that there are 1000s of square feet near the core that again are effectively unusable.\n\nWorking through this also tells you why lots of hotels in major cities feature giant atriums in the center, sometimes with glass elevators.
