{"title": "In just a few minutes this week, Powell changed everything on market\u2019s view of interest rates", "selftext": "* **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell set out a new paradigm for how the central bank views its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time.**\n* **Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.**\n* **What changed was the January inflation data, plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed\u2019s efforts to slow it down.**\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman [Jerome Powell\u2019](https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/)s prepared speech this week to Congress took just a few minutes, but it changed everything.\n\nIn those remarks, the central bank leader set out [a new paradigm for how the Fed views](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/fed-chair-powell-says-interest-rates-are-likely-to-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated.html) its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time than previously thought.\n\nThe aftermath has forced the market, which long had been looking for the Fed to blink in its inflation fight, to recalibrate its own views to coincide more with policymakers who have been warning about a higher-for-longer approach to interest rates.\n\n\u201cWe have clearly had a choreographed chorus of Fed speakers for two weeks that was getting us to that place,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. \u201cIt took Jay Powell, over the course of a very brief prepared statement and a Q&A, to get those expectations cemented into a higher place.\u201d\n\nAs part of his mandated [semiannual testimony on monetary policy](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/watch-fed-chair-jerome-powell-speak-live-in-second-day-of-capitol-hill-testimony.html), Powell spoke Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee then the day after to the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nHeading into the appearances, markets had been looking for the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at its meeting later this month, then perhaps two more moves before stopping, with the end point around 5.25%.\n\nThat changed after Powell\u2019s appearance, during which he cautioned that if inflation data remains strong, he expects rates to go \u201chigher than previously anticipated\u201d and possibly at a faster pace than a quarter point at a time.\n\nMarkets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.\n\n## When the facts change\n\nSo what changed?\n\nBasically, it was the [January inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/key-fed-inflation-measure-rose-0point6percent-in-january-more-than-expected.html) plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed\u2019s efforts to slow it down. That made Powell, who only weeks earlier had talked about [\u201cdisinflationary\u201d forces at play](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/fed-chief-powell-says-the-the-disinflationary-process-has-begun-but-has-a-long-way-to-go.html), switch gears and start talking tough again on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s adjusting to data coming in, which the entire board should be doing,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIf the facts change again through the February and March data, he\u2019ll likely become flexible on that side and not push this too far to the point where they need to break something.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Powell said he\u2019ll be watching a pivotal array of upcoming data closely \u2014 Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report, followed by next week\u2019s look at the consumer and producer price indexes.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists are holding to their forecast for a quarter-point hike at the March 21-22 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but concede that it\u2019s a \u201cclose call\u201d between that and a half point.\n\nShould the Fed have to tilt in the more aggressive direction, Goldman [warned in a client note](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/goldman-warns-that-higher-fed-rates-could-lead-to-sharp-sell-off-in-stocks.html) that it could have market impacts, with stocks selling off \u201cmore sharply\u201d and downward pressure on commodities, plus upward pressure on the dollar.\n\nStocks tumbled Tuesday then [again on Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?&amp;qsearchterm=stocks%20live%20updates) as investors grew more nervous about the Fed\u2019s future path. Thursday\u2019s sell-off, however, did trigger a shift lower in terms of expectations for a half-point hike this month, down to 58% most recently, according to a CME Group estimate.\n\n## Worries over consequences\n\nPowell faced some questioning this week over the Fed\u2019s inflation-fighting strategies.\n\nSome more progressive legislators such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., charged that the rate hikes will result in 2 million layoffs and hurt working-class families disproportionately. Powell countered that inflation also is hammering those at the bottom end of the income spectrum.\n\n\u201cThis is what he is supposed to do,\u201d Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at advisory firm RSM, said of Powell\u2019s evolving policy stances. \u201cJay Powell is a punching bag in Washington at this point. He\u2019s going to take the blame for establishing price stability. If he does that well, in the years to come he\u2019ll be venerated. People will speak very highly of him.\u201d\n\nBrusuelas is among those who think the Fed should accelerate its inflation battle with a half-point rate hike.\n\nHowever, he said policymakers could be swayed by a potentially softer jobs report and inflation data next week that reverses course and shows price increases abating. Economists expect that payrolls grew by 225,000 in February, according to Dow Jones, and there\u2019s widespread belief that [January\u2019s 517,000 surge](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/03/jobs-report-january-2023-.html) will be revised down in this report, perhaps significantly.\n\n\u201cThe economy is just too resilient at this point,\u201d Brusuelas said. \u201cThey need to generate sufficient labor slack to cool off the economy.\u201d\n\nSlack was not evident in this week\u2019s Labor Department report of [job openings in January](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/job-openings-declined-in-january-but-still-far-outnumber-available-workers.html), which outnumbered available workers by a 1.9 to 1 margin.\n\nData like that could push the Fed into even further tightening, according to economists at Nomura. The firm said future actions could include adjustments to the Fed\u2019s program to slash its bond portfolio, with one option being to remove the $95 billion monthly reduction cap currently in place.\n\nFor the moment, markets are continuing to price in higher rates.\n\nThough Powell made a special point Wednesday to emphasize that no decision has been made yet on the March rate move, markets essentially ignored him. Traders in the futures market were pricing in a terminal rate of 5.625% later this year, well above where it was before Powell spoke.", "id": "11n9fcz", "created_utc": 1678408863.0, "score": 272, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 432, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

And it can\u2019t handle a structural shift where younger workers suddenly have a major advantage by simply being in less numbers while demand is still high. Yet that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening and will only become more severe: baby boomers are retiring en masse and millennials + genZ are simply not enough to fill those positions, leading to an inevitable higher competition for workers. At the same time demand is high and getting higher since people still have access to all that sweet QE-era money and boomers are retiring with massive wealth, even more so now that fixed income assets are yielding  higher interest rate. \n\nThe worker gap may be filled in by automation (which is way more capital intensive), but I doubt that would solve all the problems and besides, it will take a while for companies to adapt. Many won\u2019t and will be outcompeted by new, less labour-intensive ones.\n\n Immigration certainly won\u2019t help either since the lack of worker problem is pretty much global, as birth rates have collapsed in most of the world since millennials and genZ have been crushed under the strong preference of boomer governments to favour boomers in all decisions.\n\nMy opinion is that at some point these central banks will have to accept we\u2019re entering a new era where interest rates need to be permanently a bit higher than they used to be and there\u2019s some inflation, which isn\u2019t a bad thing.

{"title": "I sold my 0dte spy puts too early today and I need to tell someone", "selftext": "Hi, I'd like to apply to be the head dummy around these parts...For context I swung spy calls overnight (like a buffoon but it worked out) and sold them at open at the high. I felt like a king. Immediately following after, I dumped my winnings into spy puts because why stop gambling at 10 am when the market closes at 430? So I did just that. Dumped around 600 bucks into 398 poots (I know I'm not super baller like some of these idiots in this sub)\n\nI had a rule though.... I told myself that once I hit a certain profit, I will sell half and then at another level sell the other half. I **know** 0dte contracts on spy wither away as fast as you can say \"my wife's boyfriend\". Spy dropped quick enough for me to see some profits and gaze at my phone while my boss asked when is this big project done. He could kick rocks for all I cared. I made his monthly pay in 20 minutes on my phone. Eventually spy dropped more for me to sell all my puts. I felt great I liked the price I sold at. Spy hit a reversal heading back up and I felt like I played the Wall St. Cucks in NYC. \n\nAfter showboating for a mere 10 minutes, Spy dropped......and dropped....and kept....on.....dropping. I was shocked. I was terrified to look at what my 398 puts were at. I sold at $1.00 a contract (100 dollars each for the idiots). And these contracts hit $7.00 each. I wanted to cry just thinking about it. With tears in my eyes I pulled out my calculator and did the math. It was disgusting what I missed out on. My measly $2400 cash in my Robinhood didn't compare to the $11,000 (or so) missed profit. \n\nI felt like I just got punished for listening to myself and following my rules. Why couldn't I have just let them *rideeee* out. \n\nAnyway I was so furious the entire day and just had to write this out. I may just take the remaining money and spend it on something that won't stab me in the ^(fukin) heart like these puts did to my soul. Just kidding, I dumped half my equity into Aapl calls for tomorrow. I literally cannot wait for them to expire worthless so I can quit trading.
