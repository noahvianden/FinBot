Rather, its the insane demand to be here which I doubt, will ever go away. People simply dont want to go anywhere else... Can you blame them? We have the best weather, literally, in the world. Voters, made up of people who pay the taxes for the cities they live in, dont want to urbanize their own areas. Can you blame them?\n\nThe reality is two fold.\n\nFirst, we are running out of flat easy to build land. In fact, I would say, we are practically all out of it here in San Diego unless you go east which is rather rural or build in the rocky hills which is hard. They are pushing east but you know how it is... See point 2.\n\nSecond, no one wants more people around them. They especially dont want medium or high density builds. Would you? I personally dont see a problem with this. To me, this is actually a positive thing because it means that people care about their neighborhoods and are trying to protect their quality of life.\n\nAs for investors, thats how capitalism works. These guys dont always win. Ask Zillow how their venture into RE went. They didnt do well at all. Blackstone is brought up a lot because they are targeted by right wingers who want to eliminate the environmental investment stuff and they chose BX to focus on. Thats just politics. Otherwise, they are no different than any other investment group and these guys are no where near the worst. Go see what Bain and other corporate raiders do but I digress.\n\nIt is what it is. Demand will always be high and if you do add density, you will just make quality of life worse for those who live there. Damned if you do, damned if you dont. You help one group (new residents) at the cost of hurting the other group (current residents). Id rather they dont build mainly because I feel like the current owners should have the final say and frankly, I dont want every area to be like LA. Also there is so much undeveloped land in the USA... people need to spread out for petes sake. We dont need everyone to cram into the coastal west. There are lots of really nice places to live... so maybe the price should be a lot higher? I dunno. \n\nBut back to the point, Im still surprised at the current RE action. I felt like prices needed to come down a little, and they did last year, but I also didnt expect a rebound so soon. Not with interest continuing to increase. I also figured that wages might be stagnating and disposable incomes declining which might make people more nervous, tempering the hot market... I guess not.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't feel your logic. Higher density will bring down quality of life? Have you ever been to Europe? I am not talking 40+ story towers leaning on each other. I am talking 6-10 story mixed use buildings and good public transit.\nDo you realise that low density development is so much more expensive to maintain infrastructure? Basically high density subsidizes low density.\nAnd the last, high prop taxes and home prices do in fact affect your quality of living more than if your neighbourhood has some mid rise standing around.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I have a civil engineering friend who gives me a similar argument. End of the day most folks dont like high density. They put up with it because they have to not because they prefer it. \n\nThe financial argument is a myth though. Smaller cities do just fine without being \"subsidized.\" High density does mean more tax revenue and less service sprawl (thus cheaper per population) but the downsides are obvious. If a SFH burns down, it generally only effects one household. When a person burns their apartment, many people are impacted. Similar problems with disease spread and service breakdowns.\n\nBut the worst part is crime rate by area. Though \"bad person\" rates are the same anywhere (in general), the number \"bad persons\" per area is much higher in urban areas. This along with the anonymity that comes from urban population flow, gives nasty folks more opportunities to target victims. \n\nAsk women from EU about their bad experiences on public transit and out in public in general. \n\nI have a family in Sweden and one of the mother told a story about a night she was going home after shopping. A guy followed her off the bus. She tried to walk slow to let him pass and then walk away fast to get away but for whatever reason  he just stayed a few steps behind her. When she got to the apartment, she opened the door to get in and he grabbed the door before it closed. Then he asked her \"why are you afraid?\" Imagine that... and then proceeded to entered the apartment complex with her... she then ran to the elevator and closed it quick. She said he was walking to the same elevator as it closed but it closed on time and she got away. She called the police but he was gone by the time they showed up. She doesnt know if he lived there or not but she thinks he didnt. This was in Sweden of all places... where its supposed to be nice and safe.\n\nThis type of stuff is simply more frequent in urban areas. I get less horrifying stories from my family in London and other areas but the women always have scary stories to tell. Now you tell me, is that worth it? And its not just women. I have been held up at gun point twice and both times it was at work in a high density area. My brothers wife was indeed raped in her early 20s (around 2006 I think... didnt ask) while living and working in downtown San Diego. Thankfully no one else I know was killed or hurt but man... I dont think I know any woman who doesnt have a scary story to tell. My own wife hates going to the gym because of how many times creeps tried to talk to her when working out. She wears a wedding band but certain creeps just dont seem to care. We dont realize it as men, but this kind of crap happens to females all the time and it just gets worse in places with more people. \n\nSo is the extra tax money is worth it? I really dont think so. I respect people who like urban life and I do think people should live how they like but it will be very hard to convince the average person that urban life is better than suburbs or rural... especially if they actually lived there before. You might be able to convince young folks or even rich folks who can afford the best locations and cars (despite high taxation in EU). But to put it into perspective.

{"title": "Ken Griffin\u2019s hedge fund Citadel is up again in 2023 following a record year", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/03/griffins-citadel-hedge-fund-is-up-again-in-2023-after-a-record-year.html\n\nBillionaire investor Ken Griffin\u2019s flagship hedge fund matched the broader market\u2019s performance in the beginning of 2023 following a record year, according to a person familiar with the returns.\n\nCitadel\u2019s multi-strategy flagship Wellington fund gained 0.7% last month, bringing its 2023 performance to 2.8% through February, the person said. The S&P 500\n lost 2.6% in February, but is still up 3.4% this year through the end of last month.\n\nThe stock market staged a rebound in 2023, led by beaten-down tech shares, as investors bet that the worst of the Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening cycle is over. But some big name investors like Greenlight\u2019s David Einhorn believe that stocks have more room to fall.\n\nThis year\u2019s gain comes after a stellar year for the hedge fund, which soared 38% in 2022, marking the firm\u2019s best year ever and outperforming its largest competitor, Millennium, by more than 3 to 1. Citadel has also racked up a nearly 117% return over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022.\n\nHedge funds aim to offer downside protection during market turmoil, and Citadel managed to shine during the worst chaos in the market in years. The S&P 500 tumbled into a bear market in 2022 as recession fears intensified on the back of the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate hikes to tame the highest inflation in 40 years.\n\nMacro hedge funds, those making bets around political or economic events, have fared particularly well as tighter monetary policy from global central banks stoked wild moves in different asset classes, from bonds to stocks, and commodities to currencies.\n\nCitadel\u2019s equities fund, which uses a long/short strategy, is up 2.4% this year, while its global fixed income fund is higher by 1.6% so far in 2023, the person said.\n\nCitadel\u2019s assets under management exceeded $54 billion as of the start of 2023.\n\n>TLDR, Kenny Boy is making returns that his competitors don't even come close to without explanation. There is no way this is possible without acquiring information not publicly available to his competitors OR (more likely) Citadel must be taking a lot of risks to make these returns for a hedge fund.
