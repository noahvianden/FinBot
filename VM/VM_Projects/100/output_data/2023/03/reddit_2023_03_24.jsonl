The company had increased its workforce by 38,000 in the financial year ended February 2023 to serve the increased demand in its services and solutions, it said.\n\n\u201cFor the second quarter of fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 12%, down from 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand,\u201d Accenture wrote.\n\nThe company said it now expects annual revenue growth for the fiscal 2023 to be between 8% to 10%, down from 8% to 11%.\n\n\u201cOur results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. In some cases, these conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending,\u201d the Dublin-headquartered firm added.", "id": "120o34c", "created_utc": 1679672491.0, "score": 540, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "To put this into context, the company hired 28,000 employees in the last 6 months.", "score": 436, "replies": [{"body": "Over 300,000 of Accenture's total headcount are from their India office, outsourcing is one of the three primary verticals of accenture.
