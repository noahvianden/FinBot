{"title": "Goldman Sachs: U.S. consumer sentiment is deteriorating rapidly", "selftext": " \n\nAlready negative U.S. consumer sentiment is rapidly worsening due to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nScott Feiler, a consumer retail trader at Goldman Sachs, pointed out in a March 29 article that U.S. consumer sentiment was already growing pessimistic before the Silicon Valley Bank collapse because of declining government tax refunds and record-high revolving consumer debt (such as credit card use).\n\nAnd now that the Silicon Valley Bank collapse has brought employment issues to the forefront of market attention, sentiment is rapidly turning negative. Feiler points out that employment is the biggest driver of consumer spending, and the market now generally believes that Silicon Valley Bank's problems will eventually have a greater impact on consumption, and consumer sentiment is becoming very pessimistic:\n\nAlmost everyone is certain that consumer spending will slow in March, and now investors are concerned about how long the slowdown in consumer spending will last and what response options are now available.\n\nConsumer sentiment has been deteriorating for a long time\n\nFeiler believes that U.S. consumer sentiment has been showing signs of deterioration even before the Silicon Valley Bank collapse because of:\n\n1. The U.S. government plans to cut SNAP (i.e., food stamp program) welfare benefits starting in March 2023.\n\nAccording to media analysis, SNAP is a welfare program provided by the U.S. government to low-income people in need to buy food, and the reduction of welfare benefits may affect the consumption of millions of Americans.\n\n2. Compared to the same period last year, the amount of U.S. government tax refunds has declined.\n\nAnalysis shows that the decline in tax refunds is due in part to a decline in taxpayer income compared to the same period last year, as the amount of tax due decreases and so does the amount of tax refunds.\n\n3. Revolving consumer debt (e.g., credit card use) is at an all-time high. Media analysis indicates that U.S. households may be being overwhelmed by debt step by step.\n\n4. The student loan repayment moratorium ends in the second quarter, and students will resume repaying their loans by the end of August, meaning 45 million people will begin repaying their loans.\n\nThomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies, citing analysis of New York Fed data, noted that for people with student loans that cannot be deferred, the average monthly repayment is $393, or about 1 percent of spending, after which there is a significant slowdown in spending:\n\n\"This may sound like a small shock, but the impact on income is very similar to the 'debt cliff' of 2013, with a significant spending slowdown.\"\n\nSimons noted that loan delinquency rates are currently essentially zero because students are not required to repay their loans, but delinquency rates on auto loans, mortgages and credit cards have risen recently. He said:\n\n\"The pressure on household balance sheets from the resumption of student loan payments could lead to increased loan demand, and declining loan demand was already a profitability risk for small and regional banks before the recent stress and loss of deposits. The risk will increase further in the future as household credit quality deteriorates.\"\n\nAnd in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, Feiler noted that employment issues became the focus of market attention, with employment being the biggest driver of consumer spending and the general market belief that Silicon Valley Bank's problems would ultimately have a greater impact on consumption.\n\nConsumption problems gradually emerge from the data\n\nFeiler noted that while consumer spending remained strong during the early months of 2023, over the past two weeks they have seen investors' attitudes toward consumer spending begin to shift from \"theoretical short\" to \"finally seeing it in the data \":\n\nA number of consumer spending surveys over the past two weeks have highlighted the slowdown in consumer spending in early March (including spending data from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America).\n\nThe preliminary March University of Michigan Consumer Expectations Index of 61.5 was below expectations of 64.8 and fell for the first time in four months. In the report, the University of Michigan stated that\n\nSince the Silicon Valley bank collapse has been completed before the interview for about 85% of the total number of respondents, and the regional bank crisis is likely to produce additional pressure on consumer confidence, so the final value of the U.S. consumer confidence index in March may be lower than the initial value.\n\nFeiler noted that although the savings accumulated between previous epidemics played a role in inflation, more than half of them have now disappeared and there is little room for future increases in consumer spending:\n\nI think most of the savings accumulated during the epidemic were concentrated in wealthier households, and there is still about half of the excess savings on household balance sheets, but now", "id": "125r46b", "created_utc": 1680102806.0, "score": 353, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "Consumer sentiment has been weak for a couple years at least.

The US government plans to cut programs to help people who are not making a lot of money. A 6 figure income is the only thing able to buy a home and there's very few industries that offer that after graduation from the most expensive universities in the world. Even the main industries known for their high pay are now flooded with applicants amid layoffs while also decreasing compensation packages. \n\nMeanwhile the federal government is $13,590, but in order to be able to rent an apartment, you need to have 3x the rent in yearly income which, on average, is $1876, meaning you need to make $70k in order to afford the *average* 1 bedroom apartment in the US. This cost has increased over 25% in the past 2 years. \n\nPeople on fixed incomes were being evicted from their $500/mo homes they have rented for 10+ years because the owner couldn't afford property taxes anymore because of how high real estate has increased. Property value just 3 years ago was 50% what it is now, even after the rate hikes.\n\nCorporations are buying homes at an alarming rate, even near me I saw my first \"Luxury Rental Home\" community of ~50 brand new homes that are ONLY available for rent despite being built for $150k each, something that is affordable by the average American income of $55k.\n\nThe cost of goods has also skyrocketed where in some cases just *gas* which is required to get to and from work has increased over 150% in the last 3 years, but the gas companies are avoiding any sort of controversy because they've lowered prices by 50%, which is still a 100% increase from 3 years ago. \n\nThe basic cost of groceries has increased a similar amount, to where even the recommended and highly advised budget food plan of rice, beans, and a cheap vegetable has increased from $1.50 to over $4. Microwavable \"calorie counting\" meals have increased from $1.50 pre-covid to now being over $5. Mcdonald's average single burger meal with fries and a small drink has increased to over $5 as well when it used to be a \"DOLLAR\" menu and cost no more than $2 for all of that. A pound of chicken cost an average of $3.02 in 2019 and raised to over $4.50 in 2022. Spices have also shown their price increase, on average being $0.75 near me but now costs almost $2 for Oregano. \n\nAnd people on stock/investment forums are talking about the profit margins like that's all that matters when the average person can't afford their product and companies are reporting record revenues and the highest profits they've seen for the last 15 years.\n\n----\n\nSo again, who the hell are these \"actual surveys\" surveying?

{"title": "Historical Revolt Against Dollar! A Financial Cataclysm Triggered by BRICS Alliance", "selftext": "Since the 1970s its been virtually impossible for a country to function without access to US dollars. And Washington maintained this highly-favorable status quo by putting various kinds of pressure from sanctions to election theft to outright invasion on anyone who stepped out of line. This weaponization of the worlds reserve currency has, not surprisingly, created resentment in a lot of foreign capitals. And after a long gestation period, that resentment is now erupting into a rebellion against dollar hegemony. Among the big recent events, The BRICS coalition has become the hottest ticket in geopolitics. Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa the BRICS have been toying with the idea of forming a politicalmonetary counterweight to U. S. dominance since 2001.\n\nBut beyond some aggressive gold buying by Russia and China, there was more talk than action. Then the floodgates opened. Whether due to the pandemics supply chain disruptions, heavy-handed sanctions imposed by US-led NATO during the Russia-Ukraine war, or just the fact that de-dollarization was an idea whose time had finally come, the BRICS alliance has suddenly become the hottest ticket in town. In just the past year, Argentina, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates UAE, and Egypt have either applied to join or expressed an interest in doing so. And new bilateral trade deals that bypass the dollar are being discussed all over the place. Combine the land mass, population, and natural resources of the BRICS countries with those of the potential new members and the result is more or less half the world. And now things are getting real China brokers a peace deal between Saudia Arabie and Iran, two bitter historical enemies who want to join the BRICS alliance but cant if theyre in an undeclared war.\n\nShould they stop competing and start cooperating, they could dominate the Middle East and raise Chinas clout in the region, at the petrodollars expense. An example of the press coverage is Eurasia's geo-economic integration took a great leap forward as a result of the Iranian-Saudi rapprochement, which unlocks the Gulf Cooperation Councils GCC trade potential with Russia and China. Its wealthy members can now tap into two series of Iranian-transiting megaprojects in one fell swoop through this deal, with the North-South Transport Corridor NSTC connecting them to Russia while the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor CCAWAEC will do the same vis--vis China. Only two weeks after Saudi Arabia announced an effort to establish diplomatic ties with Iran in a deal mediated by China, more news surfaced that Saudi Arabia was also planning to reopen its embassy in Syria for the first time in over a decade. Rumors are swirling that Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Syria are on the verge of geopolitical and economic agreements that sidestep the US. Russia and India agree to trade oil for rupees. Russia is now Indias largest oil supplier, with 35 of that massive, growing country's imports.", "id": "125uou7", "created_utc": 1680111129.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|25|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The BRICS alliance has suddenly become the hottest ticket in town, with a number of countries expressing interest in joining.

Everything written by the 'bot rings true to what I understand of the market(s), the 'bot just wrote it better than I could: \n \n\n>There are several reasons why the US dollar remains the primary currency for international trade:\n\n> 1. The size and strength of the US economy: The US has the largest economy in the world, which means that the US dollar is the most widely accepted currency for international transactions. Many commodities, such as oil, are priced in US dollars, which further increases its demand.\n\n> 2. Stability and credibility of the US financial system: The US has a stable financial system, and the US government has a history of honoring its debts. This has created trust and confidence in the US dollar as a reliable currency for international trade.\n\n> 3. Dominance of the US in global trade: The US is one of the largest trading nations in the world, and many countries rely on the US for imports and exports. This has led to the widespread use of US dollars in international transactions.\n\n> 4. The role of the US in international institutions: The US has played a significant role in creating and supporting international institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). These institutions have helped to promote the use of the US dollar in international trade and finance.\n\n> 5. The lack of a viable alternative: While other currencies such as the euro and the Chinese yuan have emerged as potential challengers to the US dollar, they have not yet been able to match the depth and liquidity of the US dollar market.\n\n>Overall, these factors have contributed to the dominance of the US dollar as the primary currency for international trade, and it is likely to remain so in the near future.\n \nSomething else to consider is that China has strict capital controls, limiting the free flow of capital in and out of the country. Another is the lack of transparency and credibility in China's financial markets, which may make international investors hesitant to hold yuan-denominated assets.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I don't anyone is saying the dollar will drop from 80% of trade  to 50% overnight or even in the next 5 years.  It's going to be a slow gradual change as in decades.  First, it will be small trade deals like China/UAE, Russia/India/Brazil, Russia/Saudi/China with small amounts.   In the end, the dollar will still be dominate, just not as dominate as currently.   Possibly 40-50% of trade instead of 80%.\n\nThey will analysis the benefits and consequences and decided whether to take it further or not.  The pound didn't disappear overnight either.  The dollar will still be dominate but I think countries don't want to be subjected to at will sanctions from the US.\n\nLook at all the sanctions and money printing the US has done over the last two decades.   Some of the sanctions have been dubious at best with zero justification.  We overused sanctions.  A country has to protect it's sovereignty from external threats and the dollar dominance is an external threat.\n\nFor example, the US took down a 200B company in Huawei just because it wanted to.  Was it really justified?  Were they hurting people from other countries or engaging in activities that undermine other countries?  We'll never know but on the surface, it look like US took it down because they were afraid of it's dominance.\n\nWe have many companies helping our OWN military so that excuse was hot air.

Say it isn't so! Just so you know, any data on a companies servers within the Chinese state boundry is **forced by Chinese law** to allow any authority access to the data. A Chinese agent could walk straight to the servers and take what data they wanted - legally.
