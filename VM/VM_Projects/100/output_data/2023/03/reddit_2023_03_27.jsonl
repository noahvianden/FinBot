Everything in an open market is negotiable.\n\nIt's every buyer's dream to arrange a steal of a deal. They wouldn't cave to your demand for parity, unless there is something forcing them to, like competition. And they will find any angle they can to get you to negotiate below parity.

Bad liquidity is the consequence of lack of competition.\n\nSo the decision you are often faced with, when liquidity is bad, is what is more important to you? Getting every penny of your intrinsic value, or closing the deal as fast as you can, because you need the money? Sometimes, you may decide to give up $1 or $5 of intrinsic value to close the trade faster. If you have $1000 of intrinsic value, taking $995 to close sooner might not be so bad, if you are in a hurry.\n\nIf you are not in a hurry and don't have a reason to accept less than parity, stick to your guns.

The analogy breaks down for option types, because there is no type of insurance that protects you if you *gain value* in your protected asset (home, auto, life), but there is for options.\n\nA better way to motivate the difference between puts and calls is to make the point that I just did. For other types of insurance, home, etc., the asset has value and you are protecting against a loss of value. Unlike for other insurance types, investment assets (stocks) can also gain value, and that's a problem if you plan to buy that asset in the future. So options provide insurance for **both directions**, when assets may lose value in the future and when assets you want to buy in the future gain value.\n\n> Let\u2019s say you bought a one week long XYZ put option with a $100 strike price for $500 premium. \n\nIt's worth adding that the $500 is a sunk cost.

This action is known as exercising your option. \n\nThis part is correct in detail, but wrong in application. Instead of exercising, the best thing to do is Sell To Close the put and collect the increase in premium value. The put has gained $10/share in value *at least* (it's probably more, thanks to time value). You can **sell the put** to replace the loss on the shares. There is no need to exercise, particularly if you want to continue holding the shares.\n\nSame point applies to the call scenarios. There's no need to exercise, you can just sell to close the call to profit from the increase in premium, and then apply that profit to discount the shares that have increased in price.\n\nAt the end, change the:\n\n> When describing options above, I\u2019ve mainly illustrated a buyer exercising their options.

{"title": "The world is on the \"edge of danger\" and may face three \"seismic\" changes, says Dalio in China", "selftext": "Speaking at the China Development Forum 2023, Rae Dalio, founder, chief investment officer mentor and board member of Bridgewater, said the monetization of huge debts, the huge internal conflicts caused by the divide between wealth and values, and the conflict between international powers are three factors that \"are driving all the current situations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to Dalio, the world is on the \"edge of danger\" and could face three \"seismic\" changes, \"if they happen, we could witness something we have not seen in our lifetime, but which has happened many times in history. These three forces, which began several years ago, have reached a crisis point and are driving all of the current events.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe three dramatic changes, as Dalio calls them, are, first, the monetization of huge debts, where central banks print money and issue currency to buy these debts, second, the huge internal conflict caused by the divide in wealth and values, and third, the conflict between international powers. According to Dalio, all three of these factors are now emerging to the greatest extent since 1930-1945.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDalio believes that many indicators such as real per capita income, per capita life expectancy, and nutritional levels will improve significantly in the long run due to increases in productivity and especially technology. The evolution of this upward trend is characterized by huge cyclical fluctuations, which consist of short cycles that interact with each other to form large cycles. These large cycles are the so-called \"good years\" and \"bad years.\" In addition, the events that lead to such large cycles do not occur according to a timeline, but are determined by causality, so that their occurrence is not predetermined, but manageable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDalio further emphasizes that many times, the accumulation of many short cycles to form large long cycles leads to debt write-downs and monetization of huge amounts of debt when debt ratios rise and liabilities become too large to sustain. At the same time, along with financial and economic cycles, there are political cycles within countries, and geopolitical cycles between countries, and history shows that when these three forces are superimposed simultaneously, they lead to turbulent transitions, often resulting in dramatic changes in the domestic and world order of great magnitude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDalio points out that since 1945 - since the establishment of the last new world order, the monetary order, which can also be called the world order of the United States and the dollar - it has gone through 12.5 short cycles until now, accumulating to form a big debt cycle, which is now quite high as a percentage of GDP, when Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, then began to tighten monetary policy to deal with inflation, causing cracks to begin to occur in the market, and the economy began to weaken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to Dalio, we are now entering a big international geopolitical cycle. \"What I hope is that there will be wisdom, restraint and understanding in the world and that the world will continue to be peaceful and prosperous.\"", "id": "12368f1", "created_utc": 1679879253.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|2 days ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14140532910823822}, {"body": "Dalio can 0DTE Deeze Nuts", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "Amen & Awoman\ud83d\ude4f", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Well said GerryManDur / GerryWomanDur.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16211414337158203}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.132998988032341}, {"body": "\ud83d\udc80", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11560412496328354}, {"body": "That\u2019s what my fortune cookie said", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "All my fortune cookies lately say something like.. \"you will have a day tommorrow\" \"tommorrow is another day\" \"tommorrows day will bring you a day ending in 'Y\".

Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Diversify across asset classes: Diversify your portfolio across various asset classes like stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate to reduce risk and benefit from different economic conditions.\n\n2. Focus on defensive stocks: Invest in stocks of companies that provide essential goods and services and tend to perform well during economic downturns. Examples include utility companies, consumer staples, and healthcare companies.\n\n3. Emphasize on technology and innovation: Allocate a portion of the portfolio to companies at the forefront of technological advancements, as they are likely to benefit from increased productivity and long-term growth.\n\n3.5 Invest in commodities and inflation-hedging assets: With the risk of inflation and monetization of debt, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to commodities like gold, silver, and other precious metals. Additionally, consider investing in inflation-protected bonds (e.g., TIPS) to hedge against inflation.\n\n4. Geopolitical diversification: Diversify across different countries and regions to mitigate the impact of geopolitical risks. Consider investing in both developed and emerging markets, with a focus on countries with relatively stable political \nenvironments and strong growth potential.\n\n5. Alternative investments: Allocate a small portion of your portfolio to alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, private equity, and venture capital. These assets can provide higher returns but come with higher risk and volatility.\n\n6. Leverage and short-term trading strategies: In an aggressive portfolio, consider incorporating leveraged ETFs, options, and futures to enhance potential returns. Be aware that these financial instruments carry higher risk and can amplify losses, so they should be used judiciously and with a thorough understanding of their mechanics.\n\nTactical asset allocation: Monitor global economic indicators, policy changes, and market trends to make tactical shifts in your portfolio allocations. This approach requires a higher level of involvement and may include market timing strategies to capitalize on short-term fluctuations.\nActive management: Consider using actively managed funds or working with investment managers who can adapt to changing market conditions and implement strategies that align with the outlook presented by Dalio.\nRisk management: Despite having an aggressive portfolio, it's crucial to manage risk effectively. Set stop-loss orders, maintain a disciplined approach to rebalancing, and consider using diversification techniques like investing in uncorrelated assets.\nIn conclusion, the aggressive portfolio mix and trading strategy should emphasize diversification across asset classes, sectors, and regions while focusing on defensive stocks, technological innovation, and commodities. It should also incorporate alternative investments, tactical asset allocation, and active management while ensuring proper risk management practices.

{"title": "The economy in 2023 for dummies", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThose who have borrowed lots of money to buy assets, such as banks and insurance companies, are in a lot of trouble because the assets they bought have gone down in value, meaning they have lost a lot of money. This means they are going to have a difficult time paying back the money they borrowed.\n\nThe government has to come step in and fix this situation to make sure that the banks are able to pay people back. To do this, they have to borrow a lot of money, and they do this by raising money by selling bonds (which are essentially getting loans from people).\n\nIn order to raise money by selling bonds, the government has to make bonds an attractive asset. That is, the bonds have to be a good investment, and provide good returns to those who buy the bonds.\n\nThis means that the federal reserve must raise the interest rate, because that determines the yield of bonds. Nobody is going to buy a bond at 1%, because the return on investment is so low, in fact, even losing money because inflation is higher than 1%. So the government has to set bonds at something like 7% or even 10%, because then people will buy it, because it will provide a good return even with inflation.\n\nBut if bond yields are at 7% or 10%, then that means interest rates are at 7-10% as well.\n\nHigher interest rates hurt banks because interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. And banks' whole business is the business of borrowing money. It makes it more expensive for them to borrow money to make investments. If banks have to pay 7% to borrow money, then they have to charge 8% to loan money to people. And if people have to pay high rates to borrow money, then less people will borrow. This makes banks lose profit.\n\nFor example, if you want to buy a house, and want to get a loan from the bank to pay for the house, it would be nice if the bank offered you a loan at 1%. Then, the loan to buy a house will be cheap, and many people will buy houses. If the bank is charging 8% on a loan, then getting a loan to buy a house will be expensive, and people won't buy houses (or get bank loans).\n\nSo as you can see, when the government has to raise money, they have to sell bonds, and to sell bonds they have to raise the interest rates, and when the federal reserve raises interest rates, banks must pay more to borrow money, and they must charge their customers more for loans, which means less people will loan, which hurts the bank.\n\nAnd why does the government have to raise money at the moment?   \nBecause they have to help out the banks who have made bad investments and can\u2019t repay the money they borrowed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, one must note that the banks and insurance companies are in two situations. First, they are holding assets (like holding a stock), but their assets and investments are doing poorly. Secondly, they have borrowed money to buy these assets.\n\nSo the government is going to step in and help the banks. They are going to do this by printing lots of money and raising lots of money (by selling bonds).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe big problem is the federal reserve determining an interest rate that:\n\nA - Makes bonds attractive to people as an investment\n\nB - Doesn't hurt banks too much", "id": "123xz8m", "created_utc": 1679946193.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The government has to help banks by selling bonds, but in order to sell bonds they have to make them attractive to investors by setting high interest rates.
