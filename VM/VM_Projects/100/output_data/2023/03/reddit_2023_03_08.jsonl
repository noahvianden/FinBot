It's called correlation and causation for a reason if there's nothing from A that's causing B then a relation is purely accidental. Like for example raising rates being a yield curve inversion cause and rates rise usually during stress and stress can cause a recession. Now if what you say would have a 100% hit rate if would mean that there's 100% of the times stress when rates rise and that stress 100% of the time causes a recession. Which in fact is not a fact.

If that is true, then we would generally assume a 1-month Treasury bond rate to be a little higher than 2%. This is because investors value optionality. They like having access to their money in case something better comes along, so they require extra return if they're going to lock up their money for a full month - otherwise instead of buying a 1-month bond, they would just buy the overnight bond every night for a month.\n\nSame source.\n\nNobody wants to make a long term commitment at these rates because the market expects rates to be cut again.
