{"title": "Powell has no choice but to \u2018beat inflation with recession\u2019", "selftext": "On Wednesday, TS Lombard chief U.S. economist Steven Blitz said in a media interview that the Fed will not stop raising interest rates unless Powell creates a recession and the unemployment rate starts to rise.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs35u82vboma1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6c752d120b313c40e4a60c5d2137ecbe9be9ae6\n\nBlitz stressed that in the absence of a recession, the Fed cannot estimate its interest rate ceiling: \u201cThey don't know where the maximum interest rate is because they don't know where inflation will stabilize in the absence of a recession.\u201d\n\nIn his opinion, the Fed would have to make the unemployment rate rise to at least 4.5% and possibly as high as 5.5% to beat inflation with a recession.\n\nPowell noted during Tuesday's congressional hearing that recent stronger-than-expected economic data suggests that the final level of interest rates may be higher than previously expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqtutfrwboma1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=20a92c03369c565c21fe41c9e543db004b1cc574\n\nThis hawkish tone makes the market rate hike is expected to heat up quickly, from the economic \"no landing\" argument to jump to a \"hard landing\". The bond market doubled its bets on a U.S. recession, and the inversion between the 2-year and 10-year U.S. bond yields exceeded 100 basis points for the first time since 1981.\n\nGoldman Sachs, for its part, raised its peak interest rate expectations in its latest report, with Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius noting that: \u201cRegardless of whether the Fed will choose to raise rates by 25 basis points or 50 basis points, the median forecast for peak rates in the March Economic Forecast Summary is expected to reach 5.5%-5.75%.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs also expects mixed data ahead of the March meeting. While the number of U.S. job openings fell in January, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.45% in February, rebounding from the previous value of 0.4%. \n\nGoldman Sachs therefore noted that: \u201cOur forecast for a 25 basis point rate hike in March is very overhanging, there is a risk of a 50 basis point rate hike by the Federal Reserve FOMC.\u201d\n\nSource : [https://www.ainvest.com/](https://www.ainvest.com/)", "id": "11mmy62", "created_utc": 1678350460.0, "score": 163, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "people are getting dumber and dumber, the man doesn't want to cause either a recession or unemployment, it's like saying a fire fighter just wants to get the building wet.", "score": 160, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "How many times during the last 12 times the building was on fire, and you made the building wet it did not cause the building to be flooded??", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "I believe the number is zero.

{"title": "SVB Financial Stock Plummets After Lender Liquidates Portfolio, Cuts Outlook", "selftext": "[https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-portfolio-outlook-loss-93287f3d](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-portfolio-outlook-loss-93287f3d?mod=hp_LATEST)\n\nLender SVB Financial Group\u2019s stock plummeted Thursday as it sold securities to realign its portfolio in response to higher interest rates while it manages lower deposit levels from clients who continue to spend cash. \n\n The stock (ticker: SIVB ) fell 41.9%\u00a0to $155.72 by late morning on Thursday. The decline, the steepest among companies in the S&P 500 , put the shares on pace for their largest percentage decrease since\u00a0Sept. 10, 1998, when they fell 42.3%,\n\nAnalysts shared Neutral ratings on the stock.\n\nOn Wednesday after the market closed, SVB said it sold all of its $21 billion in securities classified as available for sale, a portfolio essentially comprised of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. It said it suffered an after-tax loss of $1.8 billion, to be recorded in the first quarter of 2023, as a result. Prices of fixed-income securities such as MBS and Treasury debt fall as interest rates go up.\n\n The company plans to reinvest the proceeds from the sale into shorter-term debt to take advantage of rising rates.\n\n\u201cThe sale of substantially all of our AFS securities will enable us to increase our asset sensitivity, partially lock in funding costs, better insulate net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) from the impact of higher interest rates, and enhance profitability,\u201d SVB said.\n\nSVB is also raising $2.25 billion, including $500 million from private-equity firm General Atlantic and by offering $1.25 billion of convertible and common stock to investors.\n\nSVB, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, enjoyed a bull run in 2021 as it lent to venture capitalist-backed start-ups in technology, life sciences and healthcare, and even Napa Valley wineries, in an era of low interest rates and easy money.\n\nSVB\u2019s stock has fallen nearly 80% from its record high in late 2021 as interest rates have increased, boosting the cost of the deposits the bank uses to fund loans. The company in its press release on Wednesday said its latest actions were partly due to expectations for a continued higher interest-rate environment and partly because deposit levels have declined.\n\nGiven the current volatile economic environment, venture-capital firms have been less willing to fund startups\u2014a problem for SVB, which gets deposits from VC-backed start-ups that were earlier flush with cash. As of Feb. 28, SVB had client funds of $326 billion, a decline from $341 billion at the end of last year.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned over the last 12 to 24 months is that in a fast-paced rising rate environment, customer\u00a0deposit\u00a0dynamics are different than what we had expected,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck in a conference call with Bank of America analysts days ahead of Wednesday\u2019s update.\n\n\u201cConcern over a slow-to-recover VC environment have kept us cautious on SIVB shares and potentially remains a headwind as rates stay elevated,\u201d said D.A. Davidson analyst Gary Tenner. He rates the stock at Neutral and lowered his target for the price to $200 from $250.\n\nWedbush\u2019s David Chiaverini maintained a Neutral stance as well. The analyst said his rating is based on SIVB\u2019s growth normalizing after an exceptional run \u201cand our belief that the VC market could remain challenged for the next couple quarters.\u201d\n\nSVB company said it now expects growth in loans in the high single digits for the full 2023 fiscal year, compared with the double-digit growth it had forecast earlier.", "id": "11myayr", "created_utc": 1678383343.0, "score": 279, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "So their Margin Call moment was a few nights ago and the fire sale was yesterday.

But people look at nominal stock prices. Another issue with DCF models is the choice of interest rate, most people chose the T-bill interest rate, but that makes no sense at all. If you have a zero interest rate environment, then future cash flow is worth just as much as cash flow today, of course that is non-sense! Since cash flow today benefits the company today and can be used to invest and grow. You need an individual discounting rate for each business you analyse or you simply go by a rule of thumb solution and pick some interest rate that makes sense in your gut.
