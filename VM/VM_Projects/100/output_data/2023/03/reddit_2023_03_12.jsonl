This could potentially increase the likelihood of bank failures and financial instability.\n\nMoreover, expanding deposit insurance coverage to all deposits would require a significant increase in the amount of funds the FDIC holds in reserve. This could be accomplished through higher premiums paid by banks, but it could also result in increased costs for consumers, as banks may pass on these costs to customers in the form of higher fees or interest rates.\n\nOverall, while expanding deposit insurance coverage may provide greater protection for depositors, it would require careful consideration of the potential risks and costs involved.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My take, they bail out the businesses effected, run out of money, and little guys are screwed when their banks fall", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37368902564048767}, {"body": "Bruh i was literally asking about this exact thing\n\nAlso...\n\n\"If the FDIC were to exhaust all of its funds to cover insured deposits and needed additional funding, it would be able to borrow money from the U.S. Treasury under certain circumstances.

Since then, the FDIC has taken a number of steps to strengthen its financial position and reduce the likelihood that it would need to borrow from the Treasury in the future.
