{"title": "Don't Panic! Why FRC Is Not as Scary as You Think", "selftext": "Hello, fellow investors and FRC fans! I know you are all anxious to hear some good news about our beloved bank, especially after the recent turmoil in the market. Well, I have some good news for you: stop panicking on FRC, the alert's off. Yes, you heard me right. FRC is not going down the drain, and here's why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I go on, let me just say that I'm not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. I'm just sharing my thoughts on FRC, and you should do your own research before making any investment decisions. Don't sue me if you lose money, okay?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What happened to FRC?**\n\nNow, let's get to the point. What happened to FRC? Why did it lose so much value in such a short time? And most importantly, will it recover?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo answer these questions, we need to understand FRC's business model and the challenges it faces. FRC is a regional bank that specializes in serving wealthy clients in coastal urban areas, such as San Francisco, New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. It offers high-quality services, such as private banking, wealth management, mortgage lending, and business banking. It has a loyal customer base that gives it high ratings and referrals. Sounds great, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, not so fast. FRC also has some unique risks that make it vulnerable to market shocks. The main ones are:\n\n* \\- Client retention risk: FRC relies heavily on its deposits to fund its loans and investments. However, its deposits are mostly from high-net-worth individuals and businesses that are sensitive to interest rate changes and market conditions. When interest rates rise or the market crashes, these customers may withdraw their money and look for better returns elsewhere. This happened recently when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), another regional bank that serves tech companies and startups, announced that it had suffered huge losses due to its exposure to risky loans. Many SVB customers panicked and pulled out their money, and some of them also had accounts with FRC. This caused a massive deposit outflow for FRC, which reduced its liquidity and capital ratios.\n* \\- Interest rate risk: FRC has a large portfolio of fixed-rate loans and securities that lose value when interest rates rise. This is because fixed-rate assets pay a lower interest than the market rate, making them less attractive to investors. FRC also has a large amount of debt that it pays interest on. When interest rates rise, FRC's interest expenses increase while its interest income decreases. This squeezes its net interest margin (NIM), which is the difference between what it earns from its assets and what it pays for its liabilities. A lower NIM means lower profitability and lower equity value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese two risks combined to create a perfect storm for FRC in the past few months. As interest rates spiked due to inflation fears and Fed tapering expectations, FRC's assets lost value while its liabilities became more expensive. At the same time, as SVB's troubles became public, FRC's deposits fled to safer havens. This left FRC with a negative net worth (meaning its liabilities exceeded its assets) and a liquidity crunch (meaning it had less cash to meet its obligations).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what happened to FRC in the past few weeks. According to a Wall Street Journal report, FRC lost about $70 billion in deposits, or 40% of its total deposits, in the fourth quarter of 2022. This caused FRC's balance sheet to shrink by about 20% and its equity value to turn negative when marked to market. This means that if FRC were to liquidate all its assets and liabilities today, it would not have enough money to pay back its shareholders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The reasons why I\u2019m optimistic to FRC's future**\n\nSo far so bad. But does this mean that FRC is doomed? Not necessarily. There are some reasons to be optimistic about FRC's future:\n\n* \\- Customer loyalty: Despite the deposit outflow, FRC still has a loyal customer base that values its services and reputation. FRC has historically had low customer attrition rates (around 2%, compared to an industry average of 8%) and high net promoter scores (around 72%, compared to an industry average of 35%). These metrics indicate that FRC's customers are satisfied with their experience and willing to recommend FRC to others. This means that once the market stabilizes and confidence returns, some of the depositors may come back to FRC or at least keep their accounts open.\n* \\- Asset quality: Despite the interest rate risk, FRC still has a high-quality asset portfolio that generates steady income and low losses. FRC's loans are mostly secured by real estate or other collateral that can be recovered in case of default. FRC's securities are mostly investment-grade bonds or government-backed securities that have low default risk and high liquidity. FRC's asset quality ratios (such as non-performing assets ratio and loan loss provision ratio) are better than the industry averages and have not deteriorated significantly during the crisis.\n* \\- Capital adequacy: Despite the negative net worth, FRC still has enough capital to meet its regulatory requirements and absorb potential losses. FRC's capital ratios (such as Tier 1 capital ratio and total capital ratio) are above the minimum thresholds set by the regulators and have not been in a position out of no way. For example, FRC can adjust its loan pricing and terms to reflect the higher interest rate environment and attract more borrowers. FRC can also diversify its funding sources and reduce its reliance on deposits by issuing more debt or equity securities. FRC can also sell some of its non-core assets or businesses to raise cash and improve its capital ratios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn all, FRC still has some potential upside if the market conditions improve and the deposit outflow reverses. If the interest rates stabilize or decline, FRC's net interest margin will improve and its unrealized loss will shrink. If the market sentiment improves and the customer confidence returns, FRC's deposit base will grow again and its liquidity position will improve. If these scenarios happen, FRC's share price will likely rebound and reflect its true value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, these are not guarantees or predictions. There are still many uncertainties and risks involved in investing in FRC. There is no guarantee that interest rates will not rise further or that customers will not withdraw more deposits. There is also no guarantee that regulators will not intervene or that competitors will not take advantage of FRC's weakness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is FRC a buy or sell now?**\n\nMany investors lost faith in FRC and sold their shares at a huge loss. But was that the right move? Or did they miss an opportunity to buy FRC at a bargain price?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I explain that, let me remind you again that this is not financial advice and you should always do your own research before making any investment decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, let's get started. The key question here is: will the deposit return to FRC? \n\nThis is crucial because deposits are the lifeblood of any bank. Without deposits, a bank cannot lend money, earn interest income or pay dividends. And without those things, a bank cannot survive. So, how likely is it that FRC will regain its old day glory and see its deposit base grow again?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, it's hard to say for sure. But based on some recent data and news, I am optimistic that the deposit will partially return, if not 100% return. Here are some reasons why:\n\n* \\- First of all, according to a report from Reuters, the deposit outflows that left many regional banks reeling in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure have slowed and in some cases reversed. This shows that some customers may be coming back to FRC or staying loyal to it despite the turmoil.\n* \\- Second, regulators and watchdogs see FRC as stable enough to operate without any immediate intervention as the company and its advisers try to work out a deal to shore up its balance sheet. According to a report from Bloomberg, FRC has been in talks with potential investors and lenders to raise capital and liquidity. The report also said that US authorities are considering expanding an emergency lending facility for banks in ways that would give FRC more time to shore up its balance sheet. This suggests that FRC is not in imminent danger of failing or being taken over by the government.\n* \\- Third, FRC has some competitive advantages that make it stand out from other regional banks. As we already discussed above, it has superior customer retention rates (2% versus an industry level of closer to 8%) and superior Net Promoter Scores (72 versus an industry average of closer to 35). These metrics indicate that FRC has a loyal and satisfied customer base that values its service and products. FRC also has a diversified revenue stream that includes wealth management, private banking and business banking. These segments tend to be more resilient and profitable than traditional retail banking.\n* \\- Fourth, there has been no negative news about FRC lately. No scandals, no lawsuits, no frauds, no fines. No news is good news, right? Well, maybe not always, but in this case it means that FRC is not facing any new challenges or risks that could hurt its reputation or performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on these reasons, I think that FRC has a good chance of recovering some of its lost deposits in the following months. And if that happens, the stock price of FRC should also rebound and recapture some of its losses. Of course, this is not a guarantee and there are still many uncertainties and challenges ahead for FRC. But I think that at the current price level of around $12 per share, FRC offers an attractive risk-reward ratio for investors who are willing to take a long-term view.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what do I think you should do with your FRC shares? Well, I can't tell you what to do because everyone has different goals and risk appetites. But I can tell you what I am doing with mine: I am holding them and waiting for better days ahead. I believe that FRC is not as bad as it seems and that it has the potential to bounce back stronger than ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut hey, don't take my word for it. Do your own research and make your own decisions. And let me know what you think in the comments below. Do you agree with me or do you think I am crazy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s.

So here's my take on the possibility of GS swallowing FRC:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think GS is too busy dealing with its own problems, like the 1MDB scandal, the Archegos fiasco, and the SEC investigations. FRC is a well-run bank with a strong balance sheet and a loyal customer base. It doesn't need to sell itself to anyone, especially not to a greedy Wall Street giant like GS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides, I don't think FRC would fit well with GS's culture. FRC is known for its community banking and wealth management services, while GS is known for its investment banking and trading activities.
