{"title": "Key Fed inflation gauge rose 0.3% in February, less than expected", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/31/fed-inflation-gauge-february-2023-.html\n\nAn inflation gauge the Federal Reserve follows closely rose slightly less than anticipated in February, providing some hope that interest rate hikes are helping ease price increases.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy increased 0.3% for the month, the Commerce Department reported Friday. That was below the 0.4% Dow Jones estimate and lower than the 0.5% January increase.\n\nOn a 12-month basis, core PCE increased 4.6%, a slight deceleration from the level in January.\n\nIncluding food and energy, headline PCE increased 0.3% monthly and 5% annually, compared to 0.6% and 5.3% in January.\n\nThe softer than expected data came with monthly energy prices decreasing 0.4% while food prices rose 0.2%. Goods prices rose 0.2% while services increased 0.3%.\n\nIn other data from the report, personal income increased 0.3%, slightly above the 0.2% estimate. Consumer spending increased 0.2%, compared to the 0.3% estimate.\n\nStocks opened higher following the report while longer-duration Treasury yields declined.\n\n\"The inflation trend looks promising for investors. Inflation will likely be below 4% by the end of the year, giving the Federal Reserve some leeway to cut rates by the end of the year if the economy falls into recession,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.\n\nMarket pricing Friday morning following the inflation report indicated an even split between the Fed raising its benchmark rate another quarter percentage point or holding steady in May.\n\nThe Fed's own unofficial projections released last week pointed to perhaps one more increase this year and no reductions. However, traders expect cuts this year, with end-year pricing for the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.5%, half a point below the current target range.\n\nWhile inflation has ebbed in some areas, it has remained pernicious in others. Shelter costs in particular have risen sharply. Fed officials, though, are looking through that increase and expect rents to decelerate through the year.\n\nStill, inflation is likely to remain well above the Fed's 2% target into 2024, and officials have said they remain focused on bringing down prices despite the current bank turmoil.\n\nData released Thursday suggests that the problems in banking also may be at least under control. Borrowing through two emergency Fed lending programs decreased slightly last week, indicating that there has been no frantic liquidity dash for banks that may be undercapitalized.", "id": "127q5j4", "created_utc": 1680278712.0, "score": 357, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If a stock has really high IV and the premiums are juicy it can be really tempting but if it\u2019s not something you are willing to hold then don\u2019t do it. \n\nSecondly, I would learn about the Wheel strategy which is basically selling CSPs, getting assigned, selling covered calls on the assigned shares, getting assigned and starting over. \n\nThere is a lot more nuance to it than that but that is the gist of it. \n\nIf you are into selling CSPs and you don\u2019t want to run the wheel, you can look into selling short strangles: basically adding a short call to what you are doing. \n\nIf you start around .12 delta on both sides at about 30-45 days out and manage your positions by rolling out the tested leg then you can increase your profits. You can even roll the untested leg closer to the underlying price and trying to keep each position around .12 delta. \n\nMight be worth looking into since you\u2019ve done pretty well so far with just the short put positions. \n\nAlso, if you aren\u2019t already, start keeping track of the premiums you collect on each underlying so that if you ever get assigned you can see what your adjusted cost basis actually is.
