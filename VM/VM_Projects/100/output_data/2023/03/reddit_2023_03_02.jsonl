This isn't the same Amazon from five years ago when they looked like they were on the verge of total domination.\n\n1. They have their hands on too many projects. Good/bad thing. Good if you can scale it. Bad if it's taking forever and you're losing money in the hopes of it one day reaching the market.\n2. People have been talking about Amazon's R&D eventually coming to fruition for years now. Sorry, but some of their shit have been absolute failures. Drone delivery, how's that going? They tried to get into video game development and failed miserably with a long-term project losing money and not having enough players. I can't remember the other projects they had that ultimately were scrapped but there are many of them.\n3. E-commerce is highly competitive and low margins. That's why Amazon has had trouble with it lately. Walmart and other retailers have become very competitive in improving shipping times, prices, and item availability. I used to make Amazon orders like twice a week. I'm barely even touching my Amazon account these days. If I didn't have it for free, I would never pay. Increased labor costs, increased transportation costs, supply constraints... all have reduced Amazon's margins.\n4. AWS is a positive but cloud is highly competitive with large players willing to spend billions to compete here and growth has slowed. I think AWS is like 15% of Amazon's revenue but represented 75% of their profit. That is more negative than positive. It's unlike Apple where services is high margins but at the heart of the company, their hardware is still insanely profitable. Again, e-commerce is tough business and Amazon is finding that out now. It's too late for them to ditch it so can they find a way to be more profitable with huge retailers capable of giving them a battle?\n5. Internationally, they haven't had too much success. Difficult to replicate in foreign countries because the logistics is far more challenging when you're competing against domestic companies.\n\nPositives, services revenue is bigger than sales revenue so higher margins and less dependability on their e-commerce. Operating margins have been increasing after a terrible two years so that's a good sign. Ad services have been huge for Amazon. They should really take advantage of that. Huge growth and they have the means to scale. Large consumer base, easy target.\n\nBig issue is: Too much money being used up on projects that haven't really made any money and investors want results now. Especially when cash is hard to come by because of the rates, you can't be burning cash flow on projects that may or may not work. That's why Apple is still the cream of the crop.
