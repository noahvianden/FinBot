This is why there is no consensus.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?\n\nThe answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.\n\nIn the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.\n\nWhich brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.\n\nIn 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s...", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": ["meta", "ba", "amzn", "msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Green energy: LIN - Linde , NEE - Nextera Energy", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41821998357772827}, {"body": "Desktop Metals (DM)", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17259326577186584}, {"body": "You might consider MSFT, I think they'll acquire OpenAI of ChatGPT fame.\n\nFor chip makers, TSMC is the 800 lb gorilla people seem to overlook.\n\nCompanies to watch for a green energy play, you might consider Sun Drive and QuBERT.

{"title": "Pre-JPOW day\u2026 the dove or the hawk? 3-6-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well after two massive green days covering $10+ today started off hella strong only to find ourselves rejecting off a major 5, 15min, daily and weekly resistance at 407.3 intraday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8bncailu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7caf8ab985b53a8ca981357cb82f9c1ed49c9d7\n\nFor those of you that don\u2019t know JPOW testifies to congress tomorrow and Wednesday. This is a yearly thing that he has done since at least 2021. \n\nIn 2021 we saw a red day, however, in 2022 we saw a pretty big green day putting in nearly 2%... the question we have to ask is\u2026 \u201cwill markets listen to jpow and interrupt what he is saying as hawkish finally? Or is this going to be like the last 3-4 times he spoke where the markets had blinders on?\u201d  \n \n\nBased on the last 2 weeks of downtrend (outside of Thursday and Friday) I honestly think markets (and more importantly the algos) are more ready to accept a hawkish JPOW and are more ready to sell off depending on what he says. \n\n**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si3wu0ylu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f898b77756e444f6589dcf17c64f2d4dce73eaab\n\nTaking a look at supply and demand here on SPY daily if you remember I said one of the more short term bullish but longer term bearish scenarios was that SPY would come up and take out 405.74 demand from 2/10. We did just that today. Now what is important is what happens next. With this evening doji star pattern here and the techicals pointing to a new supply being established soon\u2026 IF spy closes below todays low there is a very good chance we are going to see this 405.74 demand turned into supply. Turning a demand into supply (resistance) is extremely bearish and would cement not only this level but would also cement a lower supply than the previous ones up in that 414-417 area. \n\nAll eyes remain on tomorrows close to see what that technical show. If we establish this 405.2 as supply tomorrow then my ultimate target realistically is 396.5 supply from 2/24. If we can take that supply (currently support) out and turn it into a new demand or reconfirm previous demand (support) at 394.88 that would be very bullish going forward. I would 1000% play a bounce from that 395/396 area back to 405. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACITON** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3xonzgmu6ma1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=1481bb182177eb80e0499a38ffd0b6f489c863c4\n\nLooking at the daily chart here everything is screaming put here. This evening doji star pattern is one of the highest probability setups for a put. If it wasn\u2019t for jpow speaking tomorrow and Wednesday and my overall lack of trust in this market and the fact that pre markets have seen some incredibly volatile overnight swings\u2026 I would 1000% be in at least a 14-30dte put. I fully expect the 400 support area (which is the daily 200ema) to be retested this week when we see a structure like this. \n\nSPY:\n\nSupply- 396.46 -> 414.13  \n Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  \n Daily Support- 404.4 -> 399.7 -> 397.8  \n Daily Resistance- 405.3 -> 407.2 -> 408.2\n\n**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kghecwxmu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f33db70929df2416ee139c1c09d383b9bb3cfa\n\nNow if you remember on futures last week we had taken out previous demand and now we are officially in a no mans land. We either need to find the extra strength to push to 4096 before we establish a new supply (resistance) short of that. OR we need to establish a new supply (resistance) and come take out lower supply at 4015/ 3991.\n\nFor me personally based on the technical and daily price action we should turn todays candle into a supply (resistance) here at 4055. Doing so will then open up a retrace to \u201ctake out\u201d previous supplies at 4015 and 3990. IF we take those out and can establish a new demand before retesting 3960 then I would like a push back to 4096. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qcfyqydnu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=68a1a182915378ea0a1d8cb1b43acc8cdf697c0c\n\ntaking a look at futures daily price action here are one could imagine the candles are similar to spy (which isn\u2019t always the case) and we are actually seeing a pretty significant reversal candle set up here too. With the SPY and Futures daily reversal set ups I would be surprised to not see a retrace to minimally 4020 tomorrow. 4020 is currently where the daily 8, 50 and 200ema sit. However, there is a chance with JPOW speaking tomorrow that the algos could do something funky which obviously would result in a breaking of technical. \n\nAgain if it wasn\u2019t for JPOW I would have felt pretty darn comfortable in overnight 25-30dte puts. But little reason to take the risk. \n\nFutures: \n\nSupply- 3990 -> 4015 -> 4160  \n Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  \n Daily support- 4050 -> 3983  \n Daily resistance- 4085 -> 4095 -> 4113\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ohkn1jou6ma1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a628091d41c598357db70ca843d8def5fb37cc\n\nOverall the VIX is still in a down trend here as you can see. However, it put in a really nice inside day today. Historically speaking inside days result in continuation but is not always the case. \n\nI mentioned on Friday that the 18.2 support touch on Friday should have resulted in a VIX bounce which is clearly did. However, that apparently did not account for the fact that SPY wouldn\u2019t care that the VIX was green all day long too\u2026 nor would it account for the fact that yields once again were elevated again while SPY was green. \n\nThe only thing that played correctly was that DXY was down just slightly today while SPY was green. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgvcj82pu6ma1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=0379884c36bc0da0fefa6ae2c1f4a1c440214e5c\n\nAbsolutely a great way to start off the week! No complaints at all. I got burnt as you can see twice in calls though. The first one I stopped myself out of when we were playing around that 406.5 to 407.3 morning/ mid day chop\u2026 I entered a call on support (what I thought was) and price action broke a key level. I took my exit and then of course it pushed to HOD. Tough bounce but was the right play and the right stop loss. \n\nOnly other loss today was a stop out when we  bounced off support and once again had a fake break down.\n\nThe morning was extremely frustrating to trade as we were seeing that VOLD was extremely bearish along with the VIX and the yields, however, SPY continued to push up. Made for some choppy trading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7qhh2npu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d026e9df963078295c57b83ce49fa2e27718157\n\nHowever, the best play of the day was the 1225am retest of 407.3 resistance. I saw it as a short opportunity and took a beautiful 9.4% win. I ended up closing for profits when we came back down and were holding 405.3 support at 1pm. I actually was looking for a bigger recovery back up to 407 again. However, EOD actually ended up being fairly bearish. \n\nI am bearish to neutral. If bulls take back 405.3 tomorrow then I would be bullish until we touch 4096 supply. However, I feel fairly confident unless jpow pumps us tomorrow that we establish a new supply and will push back to that 3990/4015 area this week. \n\nRemember after JPOW speaks we have a TON of data EOW too..", "id": "11keysk", "created_utc": 1678138811.0, "score": 125, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4437|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: JPOW speaks tomorrow and Wednesday.
