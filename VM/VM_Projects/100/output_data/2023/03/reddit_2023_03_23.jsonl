{"title": "Bank of England increase rate from 4% to 4.25%", "selftext": "The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary  policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to  sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 22 March 2023,  the MPC voted by a majority of 7\u20132 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25  percentage points, to 4.25%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate  at 4%.\n\nGlobal growth is expected to be stronger than projected in the  February Monetary Policy Report, and core consumer price inflation in  advanced economies has remained elevated. Wholesale gas futures and oil  prices have fallen materially.\n\nThere have been large and volatile moves in global financial markets,  in particular since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and in the  run-up to UBS\u2019s purchase of Credit Suisse, and reflecting market  concerns about the possible broader impact of these events. Overall,  government bond yields are broadly unchanged and risky asset prices are  somewhat lower than at the time of the Committee\u2019s previous meeting. \n\nThe Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has briefed  the MPC about recent global banking sector developments. The FPC judges  that the UK banking system maintains robust capital and strong liquidity  positions, and is well placed to continue supporting the economy in a  wide range of economic scenarios, including in a period of higher  interest rates. The FPC\u2019s assessment is that the UK banking system  remains resilient.\u00a0\n\n[Source](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2023/march-2023)", "id": "11zifbm", "created_utc": 1679573488.0, "score": 804, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "*Hanging on to quiet desperation is the English way*", "score": 255, "replies": [{"body": "The time has come", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "The song is over", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3580939769744873}, {"body": "Thought I had something more to sayeeeeaaa", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Whoaaaaaa ohhhh ohhhhhh hoooooooah whoaaaaaaah whoa whooooooaaaaa hoooooaaaa whoaaaa whoaa hooo ho", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No no\n\n\nHome home again", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "It's good to be here, when I can", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2741047143936157}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23683635890483856}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30084431171417236}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19732096791267395}, {"body": "To awaking him", "score": -6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2146572470664978}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17177215218544006}, {"body": "*Money*\n\n*Get back*\n\n*I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack*", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "My dad raised me on Pink Floyd, so I heard this in my head.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17330369353294373}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29179391264915466}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16731701791286469}, {"body": "Mr Gilmore accomplished that feat no more than an hour ago", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "Well good for happy Gil-ohhhh-my-goddddd", "score": 19, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2729320526123047}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.034373875707387924}, {"body": ">Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 10.5% in December to 10.1% in January but then rose to 10.4% in February, 0.6 percentage points ***higher than expected*** in the February Report.  \n>  \n>CPI inflation ***is still expected*** to fall significantly in 2023 Q2, to a lower rate than anticipated in the February Report.\n\nHigh quality expectations.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "hhahah I was reading that and thinking my gosh.
