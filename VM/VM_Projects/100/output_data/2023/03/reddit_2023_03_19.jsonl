And be surprised that my account value didn't dent much during recession. I just explained with doing short trades during bulls here and there.\n\nBut in reality I've been converted to thetagang. I can't take the years of bag holding of value investment. And wheeling, avoid FOMC/CPI releases and IV plays kept my gains consistent (also good profits too).\n\nHow do I explain thetagang, shorting options and wheeling to her? I want to avoid the 'shorts are dangerous', 'options are gambling' reaction without the '\"theta decay is the only sure thing in option\" jargon'.\n\nHow? Anyone done it before? Just don't want to hurt her feeling.\n\n*EDIT:* TL;DR My mom is a good old school investor. She asked me how my investments is doing.

{"title": "Learning from history, how will the Federal Reserve handle this crisis?", "selftext": "Recently, the banking industry in Europe and the United States is a pot of porridge, before the 48-hour fire bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank, followed by the deep crisis of Credit Suisse, learning from the experience of history, in order to know what measures may be taken by national regulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe roots of the Great Cry crisis and the extrapolation.\n\nThe root cause of the crisis is the interest rate hike, and the trigger of the crisis is the run effect. Silicon Valley Bank's main customer base is startups and venture capital companies. With the Fed's loose monetary policy and low interest rates during the epidemic, Silicon Valley Bank absorbed a large number of short-term deposits from technology companies at interest rates higher than the industry average, while in order to make higher profits, Silicon Valley Bank purchased a large number of long-term assets such as U.S. bonds and MBS with relatively low risk. As the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and Treasury rates soared, Silicon Valley Bank's MBS (mortgage-backed securities) prices shrank, resulting in significant unrealized losses; at the same time, rising interest rates increased the cost and difficulty of financing for technology companies and increased the demand for withdrawals. The \"short term debt and long term investment\" and over-concentration of customer structure led to Silicon Valley Bank's liquidity crisis, plus Silicon Valley Bank's self-help behavior of issuing new shares, further amplifying market panic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSleep on the history of the U.S. financial crisis and analyze the causes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the history, there have been several financial crises in the United States.\n\n1. 1792 New York Stock Exchange crash: This was the first financial crisis in the history of the United States, and the starting point of the U.S. securities market. At that time, due to the soaring stock prices, some speculators borrowed money to buy stocks, but suddenly the market price collapsed, causing many speculators to go bankrupt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2\u30011819 Credit contraction: This crisis started with the U.S. trade deficit, credit expansion and investment in Britain, and then triggered credit contraction and bank failures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3\u30011837 Financial Crisis: This crisis was rooted in the bursting of the investment bubble of many banks and companies, which led to the Great Depression, bank failures and a surge in unemployment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4\u3001Panic of 1873: This crisis was triggered by the railroad construction bubble in the United States, improper fiscal policies and the economic slowdown in Europe. It led to a cascade of bankruptcies, bank closures and unemployment, marking the beginning of a six-year-long recession in the United States.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. 1929 Great Depression: This was the most famous financial crisis in U.S. history, consisting of a variety of factors such as stock market crash, economic recession, bank failures and surge in unemployment. It lasted up to 10 years and seriously affected the global economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6\u30012008 financial crisis: This crisis consisted of various factors such as real estate bubble, high-risk loans and financial innovation. It led to the collapse of global financial markets and the bankruptcy of many large financial institutions, and is considered to be the most serious financial crisis since 1929.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn all crises, it boils down to excessive greed that makes the input-output imbalance and leads to the final collapse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow the Federal Reserve has handled crises since the 20th century.\n\nBefore 2008, the Fed mainly used traditional monetary policy to deal with the crisis, such as regulating the federal funds rate (i.e., the overnight bank lending rate), setting targets for growth in the quantity of money (which Volcker began using), and arranging regulatory tools (including moral suasion.) After 2008, new regulatory tools were introduced, quantitative easing (QE), including the Fed's first large-scale securities purchases (quantitative easing The biggest innovations of the 2008 financial crisis were the introduction of new regulatory tools, quantitative easing (QE), including the Fed's first large-scale purchases of securities (QE), and the adoption of clearer forward-looking guidance.\n\nFigure: Changes in the Fed's benchmark interest rate : 1999\n\nDuring the crisis, companies were forced to sell assets in the depressed market due to their thirst for cash, which in turn further depressed asset prices, leading to more cash shortages and even more frantic selling. Once this dynamic of bank runs and market sell-offs begins, there is a domino effect that can cause huge losses to the economy. At this point, the government had to use moral hazard to solve the financial crisis and had to take some additional risks to protect investors and institutions. Crisis Occurrence Review and Response To deal with this big crisis, the government adopted a systemic solution + a bailout package for important institutions to avoid the ashes of the financial system and even the whole economic system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn September 17, 2008, as the situation further deteriorated, Paulson and others decided that in order to protect the stability of the financial system and reduce systemic financial risks, they had to apply to Congress for emergency authorization and fiscal authority to respond to the crisis. Paulson gave everyone two rules that must be followed in solving the problem. First, policies must be simple and easy for markets to understand. Second, our actions must be decisive and all-encompassing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bankruptcy of Lehman on September 15 hit the market hard in terms of confidence in large financial institutions. on September 19, the U.S. government issued a new policy package to support liquidity and stabilize the market. The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have taken strong measures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The Treasury Department gave money market funds a guarantee with the Exchange Rate Stabilization Fund to prevent investors from pulling money out of money market funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. The Federal Reserve\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(1) Acted as the lender of last resort for all financial institutions. Issued the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Funding Liquidity Instrument (the Fed issued non-recourse loans to U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies to finance their purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds); in another action to support liquidity, the Fed announced that it would purchase the short-term debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2) The use of traditional monetary policy to counter the effects of the financial crisis on the economy. Beginning in the summer of 2007, the Fed set the pace of interest rate cuts until April of 2008. On October 8, the Fed, together with the ECB, Bank of England, Bank of Canada, Swiss National Bank and Riksbank, made a historic joint announcement of a 0.5 percentage point interest rate cut, the Bank of Japan expressed strong support as interest rates converged to zero, and the Bank of China The Bank of Japan expressed strong support as interest rates converged to zero, and the Central Bank of China also cut rates at the same time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(3) Bernanke introduced an innovative regulatory tool, quantitative easing (QE). QE1 ended in March 2010, but the outbreak of the European debt crisis left little prospect for economic recovery.\n\nSo, in November 2010, QE2 was launched, scheduled to be implemented until June 2011, buying $600 billion in long-term Treasuries. in September 2012, the Fed launched QE3, with annual purchases approaching $1 trillion, a much larger scale than QE2. and QE3 is open-ended, with no total purchase amount or end date. if the job market outlook does not improve significantly, QE3 will continue implementation until there is an improvement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. The SEC issued an order banning short sales of 799 financial stocks for 10 trading days, an order that could be extended to 30 days (the list omitted several large companies, which the SEC later added to the list).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn October 2008, Congress passed and Bush signed the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008, the core of which was the \"Distressed Asset Relief Program,\" which authorized the Treasury to spend $700 billion to guarantee assets and purchase troubled assets to help banks in crisis digest toxic assets and avoid the successive failures of large financial institutions. The successive failures of large financial institutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the question is, why not buy assets instead of stocks? The answer is, one, to help financial institutions sell illiquid assets to clean up their balance sheets and break the blockage of credit; and two, to use the purchase of assets and preferred shares to avoid nationalizing the banks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn November 19, 2008, Citi's stock price fell to $6.40 (compared to $55 in early 2007 and $29 in early 2008), and the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve negotiated and decided that the first payment of government assistance to Citi would be $5 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the FDIC would come up with $10 billion immediately after.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Federal Reserve would fund the rest of the program in the form of non-recourse loans. To capitalize Citi, the government will invest $20 billion in the form of permanent preferred stock with an 8% yield, which will be accompanied by $7 billion in preferred stock as collateral and warrants equal to 4.5% of the company's shares.\n\nThe bailout of Citibank has once again sparked public discontent, and there is no shortage of key players on the left and right saying that one should not risk taxpayer money to bail out a bank that has gotten itself into trouble, a clear example of moral hazard leading to bad consequences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can the problem of putting society (taxpayers) on the hook for the consequences be solved? One of the regulators' solutions is to expose large financial institutions to higher capital level requirements. Shareholders and executives of large financial institutions had to decide whether the economic benefits of their expanded operations would be sufficient to offset the additional burden this would entail. Effectiveness of the Bailout By early 2009, the U.S. bailout prevented a complete collapse of the financial markets and confidence was gradually restored.1. For the stock market, the U.S. stock market bottomed out after March 9, 2009, opening the way to a bull market.\n\n2. For the government, the government not only succeeded in preventing the collapse of the financial market and the economy, but also succeeded in bailing out the funds and recovering the principal and interest, realizing profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn March 2011, the U.S. Treasury announced that 99% of the $245 billion in bailout funds provided to banks by the U.S. government had been recovered, generating a cumulative $20 billion in revenue for the government. The U.S. government gained a total of $22.7 billion from the sale of AIG shares acquired during the financial crisis, with the Treasury receiving $5 billion and the Federal Reserve receiving $17.7 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSurprised where the Fed goes after Bernanke?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter Bernanke Yellen took office in 2014 with two major tasks, one of which was to oversee the continued slowdown of QE3; and the other regarding forward guidance on the future direction of the federal funds rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn September 2014, the Federal Open Market Committee released a paper declaring that QE3 was coming to an end and the possibility of rate hikes was beginning to emerge. With the return to normal monetary policy, the Fed left room for the federal funds rate, a traditional monetary policy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in fact, the rate hike cycle did not raise rates by 25 basis points until after the unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in December 2016, and the Fed's balance sheet began to contract in 2017, exactly three years after QE3 ended. (a) Mainly international developments reverberated in the United States, starting with the impact of the devaluation of the renminbi, which was followed by a tightening of the financial environment including falling stock market prices and further appreciation of the dollar that could slow down the U.S. economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo events, the economy being in a mini-recession in 2015-2016 and the UK's exit from the EU, also prevented the Fed from immediately raising interest rates. Potential financial crisis triggered by the epidemicThe outbreak of the new crown epidemic in early 2020, which had already spread in Europe in February, saw financial markets [plunge.In](https://plunge.In) the last week of February, the U.S. stock market recorded its biggest one-week decline since 2008, falling by more than 12%, and on March 9, conditions in the U.S. Treasury market suddenly worsened and the market for derivatives linked to U.S. Treasuries almost came to a halt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeasures: 1. On March 2, the Federal Reserve held an emergency conference call and cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. 2. On March 9, learning from the lessons of 2008, it took swift steps to assume the role of lender of last resort. (1) announced that it would purchase at least $500 billion in Treasuries and $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities; (2) the Federal Open Market Committee announced a 1 percentage point interest rate cut; (3) the Fed also eased the terms of the discount window to encourage banks to borrow. 3. on March 23, continued to expand quantitative easing by announcing unlimited purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises securities and reached a record $2.4 trillion in purchases in the following four months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChart: Total Fed assets \\[in millions of dollars\\] 56565656\n\nSeveral scenarios of how the Fed will handle the crisis as projected by Bean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore the financial crisis in 2008 mainly used to lower interest rates and manage expectations, after 08, the Fed usually adopts a variety of policies to deal with the financial crisis, including lowering interest rates, implementing quantitative easing, providing liquidity support and coordinating global financial policies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe following are specific measures that\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Slowing down the process of raising interest rates. The Fed usually lowers interest rates in financial crises to stimulate economic growth and increase credit liquidity, for example, in the 2008 global financial crisis, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to 0.25% below zero to stimulate borrowing and investment; after '08, in response to possible future financial crises, the Fed adopted a more flexible monetary policy framework, which includes setting interest rates at an appropriate level rather than fixing it at a certain level to reflect changes in economic conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Provide liquidity support directly to financial institutions. Provide financial support to banks by extending loans, providing liquidity support, and directly purchasing commercial paper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Focus on the supervision of systemically important financial institutions. In order to prevent systemic risks similar to the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken a series of measures to regulate systemically important financial institutions, such as implementing macroprudential policies and requiring large banks to conduct stress tests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Adopt more transparent policy communication and timely and effective expectations management for the market. In order to increase market expectations management and transparency, the Fed has changed its approach to monetary policy communication, making market expectations and decision-making processes more frequently public.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn layman's terms, it is the three axes: easing + strong regulation + expectations management.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe world of the 21st century is different from that of the 20th century, as history shows. In the past, central bankers are most afraid of inflation, but now has entered a different \"new normal\", that is, too low inflation rate is also worrying. Low neutral interest rates also limit the space for short-term interest rate cuts, seriously undermining the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuantitative easing, introduced by Bernanke during the 2008 financial crisis, and forward guidance have become two highly sought-after tools that continue to be used during the epidemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition, there is a new trend toward deeper cooperation between central banks and fiscal policy. However, the constant use of easing to cope with the crisis actually leaves a bigger crisis in the future, as the Buddha said, \"The cause of the previous life is the effect of the next life\" (The Sutra of the Three Worlds of Cause and Effect). \"The cycle of cause and effect will continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all for today's analysis.

This is because of excessive purchases of low yielding treasuries/mortgage back securities (MBS). He says to see why this happened we need a look back to America's financial crisis history:\n\n* 1792 (First time): People acted like regards excessive borrowing played stock markets and ended up broke (Think 2021-2022 Apes smooth brained)\n* 1819: Trade deficit = loaned and invested too much in Britain = like lend-lease outcome you don't get anything back\n* 1837: Bubble of banks/companies, prelude to great depression\n* 1873: Railroad construction bubble, improper policies, slowdown in economy. Huge amt of bankruptcies and unemployment.\n* 1929 (Great depression): Everyone knows what happened (2021-2022 Apes smooth brained on steroids)\n* 2008: Multiple factors, high risk loans,  highly levered financial products, real estate, subprime leading to worldwide collapse. Worst since great depression (OP missed out on Asian market meltdown, 1970's and even 1987 crisis)\n\nSo what is the point of all this? OP pointed out that before the 08 crash, the FED used more traditional monetary policies (overnight bank lending) to address the crisis at those times. However, leading up to the 08, the FED/Government slowly started to adopt looser policies to address the crisis at those time. But, in turn exasperating the next crisis with less effective tools. **After 08, the FED innovated new policies ie: QE, FED balance sheet to the moon and forward-looking guidance.**\n\nThe government/institutions ended up resorting to using moral hazard to solve the crisis. This is done by introducing bailouts and packages to protect investors and institutions. *Basically rewarding bad behaviour* in order to calm markets.\n\nHe breaks down the 2008 further, and to summarize it in layman's term the FED/government/Treasury focused too much on easing/providing liquidity to solve the crisis at hand. Leaving a bad precedent for things to come in the 21st century. Whereas in the 20th century, was focused on tackling inflation. Nowadays  in the 21st century the \"new normal\" is that too low inflation is bad for the economy. Therefore, more emphasis is made on accommodating and supporting the economy. Coming full circle to why we have the banking crisis at hand.\n\n**Edit:** Disclaimer: I know I missed a lot of things that might have interconnected other parts to make his argument more fluid and may misrepresent his overall message.
