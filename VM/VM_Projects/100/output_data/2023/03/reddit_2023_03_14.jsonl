You can go back 1000 years and it's the same pattern. Epidemics/Pandemics change economic patterns and suppress activity.\n\nSo, no... we wouldn't have been recovered by now and the Fed did what it had to. In fact, this is why every major economy in the world did the same exact thing. It would have been much worse without easing of financial conditions across the board.\n\nRecovering from the event that you suggest should have happened... it would have created even bigger geo-political instability than we're dealing with now. It's purely a fantasy and you need to let go of the imaginary faery world where there was a beautiful and clean recovery without intervention because it's completely divorced from reality.\n\nWe can debate whether the Fed did more easing than they needed to, but it's largely irrelevant because spending and debt never significantly arced up past the 2010s trendline, so it's not the spending that created the inflation. In fact, if you look at the data, we're only NOW seeing any real tightening in conditions for consumers, that's how much lag there is.\n\nSo all of the disinflation that's happened? Post-pandemic economic patterns exhausting and recovery of the supply chain, with maybe a little impact to prices from the M2 expansion, which is mostly still in banks (which is all in the Fed reports).\n\nBut all of that is irrelevant to the point I'm making, which is that the Fed deleveraging the economy through rate hikes was fine, but this happened because they hiked too quickly.\n\nIn all of their reports, they cite knowledge that the effects lag but then react to current data.\n\nIt's dumb. It's reckless. It's reactionary because they're trying to \"regain credibility.\"\n\nIt'll backfire, because the biggest impact to monetary policy is in the years in the future where bank risk departments might release the M2 pull forward. So I'm all for tightening, but they need to have done it more intelligently.\n\nThey went too fast, full stop. If they didn't, we wouldn't have banks failing because they bought bonds, which is not supposed to happen, and it happened explicitly because the Fed's rate hike curve is too quick for banks to rotate their bond ladders.\n\nThey didn't break something incidental that will have the effect of fixing inflation, they broke safe instruments... and that's not good.\n\nAlso, Darwinism doesn't mean what you think it does. In Darwin's theory of natural selection, Darwin was modeling the randomicity of genetic mutation and how winners and losers were random based on conditions. Darwin's model demonstrates complete failures of otherwise viable lines.\n\nHumanity invented civilization and economics explicitly to circumvent natural selection expressly because it's not superior... which was Darwin's ultimate conclusion, and if natural selection were superior to civilization, developing civilization wouldn't have been advantageous evolutionarily. In other words, our ability to manage crises IS Darwinism in action, and evolutionarily superior to just letting random shit happen, according to Darwinism.\n\nIt's actually kind of worth getting into the origin of this misunderstanding of Darwinism circling around \"Survival of the Fittest\" as a concept that suggests superior outcomes doesn't originate from Darwin... that comes from other theorists who fall into the Social Darwinism camp, and it's pseudo-science largely meant to justify slavery.\n\nThe branch of \"Darwinism\" that suggests a superior outcome from natural processes comes from the line of thinking that became the eugenics movement... so yeah, not really a good model.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "The system breaks down when people leave the workforce en masse as well.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, though the margins with where we are now are manageable.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.203886479139328}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2692824900150299}, {"body": "bold on you assume that we can read", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.029778068885207176}], "tickers": ["recovery", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Darwinism right?
