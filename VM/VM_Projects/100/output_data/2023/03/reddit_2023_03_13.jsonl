NOR IS THIS MY NORMAL TYPE OF POST... MERELY A DISCUSSION OF CPI DAY TOMORROW... we will resume our regular scheduled and Normal TAs tomorrow night ;) if you are a regular and dont wanna hear me ramble about CPI and stuff then skip this discussion. Again this is NOT a TA... Merely a discussion on CPI day tomorrow****\n\nhey guys! no TA tonight because i have some other stuff going on and realistically predicting where we are going isnt really worth the post... We shall see where the dust settles post-CPI and see if we are going for the 400s or the 360s leading into FOMC!   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzze1lvv0lna1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01f9ce6f516dc4b3900167d0caf59ceb8836c7a7\n\nResistance: 390.1 (1.22%) -> 394.7 (2.4%) -> 397.8 (3.2%) -> 405.3 (5.2%)\n\nSupport: 378 (-1.9%) -> 374.1 (-2.9%) -> 370.6 (-3.8%) -> 365.5 (-5.2%)  \n\n\n5% would be pretty impressive whether up or down however here is what i suspect is going to happen....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rz1yizk91lna1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e3120c59b56834bd8677e2ec99d7d29b11569423\n\nBased on my estimations here is what the numbers say and what i predict...  \n\n\nCPI YoY: numbers call for 6-6.2%... I believe we will see a 6% CPI YOY  \nCPI MoM: numbers call for 0.3 to 0.6%... i am looking for a 0.3 to 0.4% MoM reading  \nCORE YoY: numbers call for 5.3 to 5.6%... i am looking for 5.3 to 5.4%  \nCORE MoM: numbers call for 0.3 to 0.6%... i am looking for 0.3 to 0.4%.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05cujsu72lna1.png?width=1089&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a438d6fd72a5ce927fc1c1a763c7b451f138cc9\n\nmy thoughts are this and really has been this for a while... however, the bank run made me size down alot for this play but in a way also helped me... but i believe what is going to happen is the above extremely bullish print on CPI. When this happens with the bank run which has now already priced in a 32.1% chance of a 0bps hike at the next FOMC meeting (next wednesday the 22nd).... we are about to see a massive breakout. I dont know if we get the type of run we got in november with that incredible 5% green day... but i think this is setting up for a massive not only green day but a massive run into FOMC...  \n\n\nthink about this... CPI is pretty much the last key piece of data the fed will get before FOMC next week. We have PPI on wednesday but should be a nothing burger... SO if CPI is the last piece of important data then when they see this bullish print we are going to get an incredible green open. We have basically had 2 opens in a row on CPI that didnt do anything and burnt everyone. The MM has convinced people to stop playing CPI and more importantly stopped people from playing straddles now... we are overdue for a massive reaction.   \n\n\ncooler cpi opens us into a huge rally... the chances of a 0bps is going to go to about 80%+ when we get those numbers. that 0bps is going to force a huge rally. what this bank run did is actually push the fed to go faster than they would probably want to with cutting rates. \n\nits like they always say... the feds gonna hike until something breaks...   \n\n\nMy ultimate target for tomorrow is 405.17... thats a MASSIVE level to watch and is almost our upside daily supply (resistance) to watch... i think we could easily open 3%+ tomorrow IF the numbers come in as good as i expect.... If you think about it after this bank run nonsense algos are ready to burn everyone that jumped heavily into puts last week and today.\n\nNow if im wrong and we get a hot af cpi then we easily are going to see a 25bps 100% priced back in and most likely open -3% and i would be targeting the 373.98 demand (support).   \n\n\neither way tomorrow is going to be extreme volatile.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbix8nln3lna1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3e4d10c2ddc815df11589a7890051a26aaf8f86\n\nIF my calculations are correct and IF we get the standard IV pump of 80-100% and we open at 1% that would be about 400% gainer, if we open at least 2% green this should be at least a 1000% gainer... if we open 3%+ (like November) it should be about a 2600% gainer...   \n\n\nIf we open red... well TOS just got a $315 donation to hopefully prevent them from going bankrupt during this bank run so i dont have to switch brokers... Either way i only risked todays profits i have ALWAYS wanted to on a day like today buy the \"end\" of the options chain.   \n\n\ni will see you guys tomorrow night for a proper TA and analysis of where we are headed next.", "id": "11qoj1x", "created_utc": 1678747544.0, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Daddy Tom Lee over here.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "You think CPI is going to come in better than current swaps and the Cleveland nowcast?
