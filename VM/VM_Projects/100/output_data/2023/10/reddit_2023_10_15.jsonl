Ford is losing money on every F-150 Lightning it sells, despite the fact that it is selling this at a premium price. All these auto makers are optimized for building ICE vehicles, and all the factories and supply chains have to be torn down and rebuilt to support BEVs. This means years of losses as these companies come up to speed on how to produce cheap BEVs. This is the \"Valley of Death.\"\n\nI think a better comparison is with the Chinese EV manufacturers. Tesla's competition is more these companies, since they are producing decent cars, and have been doing this for some time, so they are also already fairly cheap. The Chinese companies are not showing good profit margins, but they are not showing losses on EVs like the western auto makers.\n\nIf Tesla were just a car company, they might be overvalued or around fair value at this point. They have been growing sales at a crazy rate, and still have a 5x to 10x unit manufacturing increase ahead of them (at lower revenue than that, because the revenue per unit is going to decrease).\n\nIt looks like they have a pretty good upcoming business in industrial scale energy storage. This is likely to be bigger than the autos eventually. This business looks like it is already scaling and working.\n\nEven bigger is the AI stuff. Cars driving themselves is advanced robotics. The knowledge domain translates well to developing the Teslabot, which is going to have some interesting implications for manufacturing automation, and then for lots of things that require people to do right now. \n\nIf you believe that the AI portion of Tesla has \"something\" that other companies do not (like data from 100,000 cars) and is moving closer to a general AI, then Tesla is significantly undervalued. \n\nIf you believe that robotaxis are going to make a lot of money, and some of that money is going to go to Tesla, and their general approach is scalable whereas region bound stuff like Waymo is not, then they are probably still undervalued. \n\nRobotaxis and Teslabot are still not proven and require solving some HARD problems. Of course, if Tesla solves them, this gives them something of a moat. So while this is a risk, it is a risk where there might be a big payoff. They appear to be years ahead of their competition, but the products are still not quite ready for the mass market. \n\nThe full self driving is looking really good though. General FSD is a very hard problem to solve, and it looks like Tesla might be the first to solve it. \n\nIf you think their advanced manufacturing techniques give them a cost advantage in building cars, then the big auto makers are not likely to catch them, ever, and the Chinese manufacturers will also have a hard time keeping up in terms of cost. Maybe fair value at this price. \n\nIf you own and hold Tesla through all these ups and downs, it is a good bet you aren't looking at it as merely another auto manufacturer.

The difference is the brand and Tesla's stock is one of its branded products.

Eventually if Tesla grows beyond its bounds to make robots and dominate batteries this functional overvaluation might dip down as low as a couple hundred percent. Assuming the brand on the stock remains valuable at present rates that will mean a huge return for current investors. A collapse of the brand (which can happen any time for no reason) will mean massive losses to whoever is holding the stock at the time. This risk is also factored into present day asking price.\n\nDeciding the value of Tesla is a philosophical question for the investor not something that can really be debated either way.
