I learned the most from u/scottishtrader, especially the risk management part. Special shout-out to him here, thanks for his sharing and patience in answering questions.\n\nI started my investment journey in September 2021 (around 200k). I slowly deployed the money into the stocks I liked from September to December. I have read lots of books about long-term investing and buy&hold. (Warren Buffett, Terry Smith, Philip Fisher, and so on). My B&H strategy so far is barely breakeven, and it experienced the maximum drawdown last year (-26%). My main holding was QQQ, VOO, MSFT, META, GOOGL, etc. (high free cash flow and big names). \n\nAfter I discovered Wheeling, I saw this strategy makes a lot of sense because it can guarantee I scoop up the companies or index I like with a lower price, meanwhile, I have a lot of flexibilities (take assignments, Sell deep ITM Calls, CC, cut loss, roll, etc.) From this perspective, this strategy is not much different from B&H just that it has much more flexibility. I have to add another information here, I don't have to pay tax for trading profit. People like to compare backtest results, I think this is unrealistic because I don't think anyone will all in into S&P500 or whatsoever at a specific time, and the Wheeling strategy can be adjusted. Most likely people will do DCA or try to time the market a little bit. Also, people left comments saying you will get crushed during the market crash. Isn't the B&H strategy even worse during the market crash? (less flexible and higher stock cost)\n\nI can see the wheeling strategy might lose to a super bullish year(assuming that you are already all in the market before the jump), otherwise, it will be better than B&H yearly.\n\nThinking back, I\u2019d have ended up a lot better if I started my investment journey with the Wheeling strategy (lower stock cost + cash interest + premium collected). Now I am committed to Wheeling.\n\nHowever, if the Wheeling strategy is so great why it has not been exploited earlier? Anyone has been doing this successfully for over ten years? I don't think this strategy is complicated. Did I miss something?\n\nJust want to challenge my current thought and look for a good discussion.

There are far more efficient, profitable, and safer ways to farm theta. \n\nThis guy made a great thread on it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/13spq3l/why\\_you\\_need\\_to\\_stop\\_wheeling/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/13spq3l/why_you_need_to_stop_wheeling/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nI take umbrage with the wheel, I feel it's a poor, risky, and inefficient strategy. My opinion is outlined in the reasons below. Keep in mind, this is about people running the wheel as a means of generating income, not for an established portfolio looking to up their position via CSPs or juice their returns on their underlyings that have unrealized gains for example in a neutral-ish market with CCs. \n\n\r  \nI find the wheel to be incredibly risky for its return profile. Equities are very risky assets and their primary attractiveness to investors is their huge upside potential and dividends. If you acquire shares just for the sole purpose of generating income on them via CCs, you neuter the main selling point of equities, its upside potential, just to squeeze out some marginal income whilst bearing the full downside risk. The only premiums really worth collecting are the ones on the high IV stocks which can spike down and leave you bag holding, or spike up and you miss out on huge returns all for some measly premium. And not to mention, if you have an underlying that pays a dividend, you're likely to get called out of it early so the option holder can swipe the dividend which you as the short call holder will have to pay out of your own pocket.\r  \n\r  \nSelling CSPs for income seems to be another favorite as well, not for me. The only time I deploy a CSP is if it's part of a spread like a front spread/back ratio. When I learned of CSPs it made more sense that it was an effective method of entering into a long stock position at a specific price and getting paid to do so. But rather than the CSP being a lucrative vector of entering a long position, people are just selling them to collect theta and exposing themselves to the same risk profile as a CC: all the downside risk, none of the upside potential, all for a few bucks of premium.\n\nCapital inefficiency. The collateral you have to post for a CSP could be deployed on spreads across multiple tickers, keep cash on the side to buy in case of a market downswing, the list goes on. Rather than locking up their cash to earn like $10 in theta per day they can achieve better results with spreads instead.\n\n \"Im comfortable owning it at my selected strike price\". This phrase irritates me. If you're comfortable owning it at that price then actually own it at the price, forget about rolling up and out which most people seem to like doing (might be a generalization, but I see it more often than not). Plus, being comfortable doesn't mean just slap CCs on it and cross your fingers, you have to continue managing the position from there. Maybe you sell more CSPs and average in on the way down, maybe you convert the position to something else, idk. I feel like the mentality should be along the lines of \"ok I got assigned, now Im going to manage the position as long stock\" rather than treating their shares as a mechanism to sell calls for premium.\n\nThe sheer amount of cognitive and emotional biases with the wheel is staggering. Also, upon assignment people seem to just slap on CCs and shrug their shoulders like \"oh well, time for it to go up now\". Granted this can be said about any trading strategy and speaks more to trader psychology than the wheel itself, but it seems that this sentiment is baked into wheeling for income. Then you got these people who are wheeling meme stocks posting \"is this thetagang?\" threads like their portfolios depend on it (but thats just a gripe in general).\n\nIt's very easy to get stuck. The wheel primarily works in a sideways/slightly bullish market. One bear market or a downward correction and you're sunk. All those premiums collected may help mitigate the capital losses, but you'll still be hurting bad. You have these poor souls holding onto their bags and selling CCs below their cost basis praying that they can earn enough premium to lower their cost basis and then uh-oh it spikes up and they're called out of their shares at a realized loss. There are too many conditions that have to go in the trader's favor to make the wheel consistently profitable. Granted conditions have to go in the trader's favor in general to profit, but there are too many involved in the wheel.\n\nThere are easier and better ways to make money. When it comes to farming theta, there are far less risky, easier to manage, less capital intensive, more customizable and versatile strategies to use instead of the wheel; mainly spreads. These offer more theta exposure, more delta neutrality, less gamma risk, and more methods to temper vega risk. And spreads can also be deployed in any market condition - low IV environment: buy butterflies and condors / high IV environment: sell front spreads and straddles or strangles / bearish or bullish sentiment: skew your spreads one way or another to speculate on direction / or sell an IC to stay range bound or sell a butterfly as a volatility play in either direction. All of which still require management and monitoring, but nowhere close to the amount that the wheel takes.\n\nTLDR: Solely generating income with the wheel involves bearing high downside risk with little upside potential, high opportunity costs, capital inefficiencies, and many cognitive/emotional pitfalls along the way. Spreads can achieve similar if not superior returns to the wheel with much less risk, better capital efficiency, and overall versatility.\n\nI  exclusively trade spreads on SPX and am up approx. 36% YTD.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": ">I exclusively trade spreads on SPX and am up approx. 36% YTD.\n\nDo you mind elaborating a bit more on that?

You would actually manage the position as long stock in an equity portfolio, not look to exit the position by being called out of it. Selling CSPs to enter the position is legitimate but actually manage the position instead of turning it into a strangle/selling CCs. Equities arent mechanisms to sell calls against for premium, they're volatile risky assets and should be treated as such. \n\n> If I get assigned, am taking my high risk stock play and letting B&H do its thing but at better cost basis and selling CC's to reduce cost basis overall.\n\nIf you're holding high risk stocks and selling CCs against them you're negating the allure of the stock while maintaining all risk all for a bit of premium. The appeal of volatile stocks are its tremendous upside potentials but those also come with big downside risks. So you forego the upside and maintain all tail risk just for a bit of income. Not worth it in any capacity. You can lower your cost basis a bit but not by any justifiable margins to hold such risk imo. Plus if you get assigned and the stock tanks you cant sell CCs against them at the risk of being called out below your cost basis. Quite easy to get stuck. \n\n>Feel it's just tools to better improve trading odds.\n\nHell no. \n\n>With larger account prob would not do this.\n\nOpposite imo. Large account that can form a substantial equity portfolio will work way better than a small account selling CSPs on volatile stocks.

But the big difference is the net debit/credit on each one. With a short put you get a credit and with a covered call you pay a debit. \n\nThe difference in cash is usually around the strike price x100, so $50 strike trades would have about a 5k difference in cash. Because of that difference, covered calls will make more money than short puts, and the market expects you to make up that difference on the puts by investing the 5k cash at the risk free rate.\n\nSo if you're doing cash secured puts, and you're earning less than the risk free rate on the cash being held aside, then you would usually be better off doing a covered call at the same strike instead, because on those it's already priced in that you're earning the risk free rate.\n\nBut puts are overpriced relative to the calls when there is a hard to borrow fee, for example right now BYND and VFS.

{"title": "For all the regards who have no clue what's all this Bonds and Yields talk driving the markets", "selftext": "Listen up regards, here is some quick 101 for you who don't have slightest clue what's driving the markets and why we are seeing all this news suddenly on Bonds and Yields:\n\n- **Fed led by Papa pow printed a lot of money during Covid.. like a fuck ton of money and used it to buy US Treasury securities** like (T-bills, T-bonds and T-notes). These are debt instruments on which US Government will pay them interest.\n\n- Post-pandemic we got hit by **Inflation that turned out to be not so transitory** due to Covid supply shocks (including factory closures), Russia invading Ukraine, Above mentioned money printing that was given as aid to US citizens and a host of other factors.\n\n- **Fed has only one tool in its toolbox to tame Inflation.. Higher interest rates.** It hiked from near 0% to 5% in a matter of 18 months. Practically unheard of in modern history. The previous hike in rates like this was done by Fed chair Paul Volcker.. the guy with the balls so strong and heavey, he had to weigh them using a truck scale. Seriously, search him on Google.\n\n- Higher rates mean the previous bonds sold with lower interest rate lose value. If US treasury sells a bond that pays 1% interest for 10 years with $100 face value, and then due to higher interest rate US treasury sells you another note that pays 2% interest for 10 years with $100 face value, the previous note that pays lower interest goes down in value due to higher interest rates on the newer treasuries. So the **return a bond gives a.k.a Yield goes higher when the bond prices go down and vice versa.**\n\n- Fed hiking rates and keeping them higher for longer mean **bond traders** are fearing the higher rates for longer and selling off 10 year US treasury securities. **Japanese institutional investors** are selling US treasury securities, **Fed themselves** are selling Treasury securities that they purchased during Covid to reduce size of their balance sheet and **US Government is also selling US Treasury securities** in open market to fund debt.\n\n- **This has caused 10 Year US treasury Yields to spike and hence any debt including Corporate bonds, Mortgages etc. will have to be funded using higher interest rates restricting growth of economy. Corporate Bonds are also having a major selling off due to higher yields. Higher yields also signal higher interest rates which mean Present value of future earnings goes down. Stocks are hating this and falling. Nobody knows what is going to happen next but tighten your seat belt bois as the ride is going to be bumpy.**\n\nTLDR; Papa pow printed a lot of money and purchased US treasuries. Inflation and higher interest rates by Fed to tame inflation mean treasuries decline in value and traders and institutional investors holding them are selling it. Fed is selling them to reduce their balance sheet and US government is selling them to as part of their debt funding. This is causing the 10 year yields to spike and stocks to go down.
