{"title": "How To Profit From War", "selftext": "**War impacts the world. When nations clash, your investments can change. Today, let's explore how stocks respond to war, helping you manage your portfolio in uneasy times.**\n\n[ \u00a9 Kaulto.com](https://preview.redd.it/c1lvov29h4xb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13c9590252ebebe690a177b0782ba15adad1401)\n\nWhen wars like the Russo-Ukrainian conflict of 2022 or the recent clashes in Israel hit the headlines, they also significantly impact the stock market. Here\u2019s a simple breakdown of what tends to happen, when conflict breaks out.\n\n**1) Defense Stocks Go Up:**\n\n[ \u00a9 Kaulto.com](https://preview.redd.it/z8n4sjfrh4xb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=100e7ffe9acb3a572db10b96a74e7d96155da5e5)\n\nCompanies that make weapons or military equipment often see their stock prices increase during wars \\[[source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/lockheed-martin-boeing-northrop-defense-stock-price-d78064b)\\].\n\nFor example, stocks of Lockheed Martin and Raytheon (RTX) went up during the Russo-Ukrainian war, and the recent Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8nyl7q0i4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e34d76550cfff99d8adc4d9fad0cc04eee42531\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9g2zsfr3i4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=8922e726012fe37984ad67ca8e3dd2edc6f7e07a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g73130r5i4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=cded001c72e182df528b8b01bbaa7e09a101cee9\n\nThis often happens whenever major conflict occurs because the demand for defence and military equipment rises during significant conflict.\n\n**2. Prices of Oil Rise**:\n\n[ \u00a9 Kaulto.com](https://preview.redd.it/qqg6gaxli4xb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=22d69bcdfb332bc1409eaf3d5ea836eeb91217fb)\n\nWars can disrupt the supply of important resources like oil, causing prices to rise. Because demand is the same, but supply decreases. So oil\u2019s value increases.\n\nEven if they don\u2019t export much oil themself, countries embroiled in war, disrupt oil supply chains in surrounding territory. This often increases the stock prices of companies that produce and deal with oil. For example, BP and Shell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q81f9qxsi4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc2bc73cbd51db6b4a28329395e4166320412051\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvkuz9xui4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcc34b4521ac9e387180dfdbf3aa9345b128fc3\n\n**3.

This means companies that provide cybersecurity services or tech gear see increased demand in war-time. For example, companies like Palo Alto Networks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qdxn9lt9j4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=8adf714025205e3ca50b232443ad23e4e6b01631\n\n**4.

Utilities companies provide essential services like electricity, gas, and water. Essential goods companies provide food, beverages and household goods. These resources tend to remain in demand regardless of the current environment \\[[source](http://which%20remain%20in%20demand%20regardless%20of%20the%20current%20environment./)\\].\n\n**5. Spending on Luxuries Drops**:\n\n[ \u00a9 Kaulto.com](https://preview.redd.it/kr400pbuj4xb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=edc8277ff2bfe2e71fd7369e6820c3b98dfe1636)\n\nPeople tend to cut back on spending during uncertain times. So, stocks of luxury goods, and travel companies usually go down. For example, LVMH (Luxury goods) & IAG (Airlines group).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxst72s1k4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=f21c33881331ec66e8a169b8592cba0092e8665b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hc62ihj3k4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbec9af64fc0a5572c69f3d35d4e992ec33b2ed9\n\n**War-time Summary:**\n\n* Consider diversifying your investments in less affected stocks to reduce exposure to highly volatile industries.\n* Consider stocks of companies that deal with essential war-time resources like military, oil and cybersecurity.\n* Avoid stocks of companies that deal with non-essential resources like luxury goods and travel.\n* Stay updated on world events, and be ready to adjust your investment strategy accordingly.", "id": "17j0q80", "created_utc": 1698577983.0, "score": 249, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Great summary of all the most wellknown facts", "score": 298, "replies": [{"body": "Yet I still do not know how to profit from war", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "they key is to get in before the war. gotta time it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Gotta cause it", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.01368535403162241}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13234330713748932}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.390390545129776}, {"body": "Start a war and then sell weapons to both sides.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Yet, I still do not know how to start a war. \n\nOP, is this a two parter?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Invent a religion, wars will naturally ensue, profit!", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Ok so all I have to do to capitalize here is 1) invent religion, 2) start war and 3) time start of war?\n\nIs it a 3 part play OP???", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Can I join in?
