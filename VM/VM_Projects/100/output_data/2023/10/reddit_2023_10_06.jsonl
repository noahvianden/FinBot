Actual material statements made in a Twitter space for the future of the company. The thing you have to understand is that Tesla is entirely self funded. They don't need to open up new credit facilities and take on debt to do what they need to do. They have stable cash flow post revenues, and they have like 20-25Bn shored up in reserves for unanticipated headwinds that may cause them issues.\n\nAnd Elon's statements are in relation to that. He, and the leadership underneath him cares about volume. Because economies of scale ultimately means that your COGS will be exponentially less than ownership and operational costs. The more effectively and efficiently you can make something, the cheaper is. Law of large numbers guarantees this. The industry by and large don't have very many leaders who'll straight up tell you that they'll sacrifice their industry leading margins and go negative to push volume. Those kind of statements, normally, lead to such leadership getting removed from their position by the board.\n\nHere, the investor community and the board basically are in agreement that this strategy, *if push come to shove*, is an acceptable risk because the success on the other side of it, is worth the pain. Every single Tesla sold is one less car sold by the competitor in the same space. It integrates that customer into the Tesla ecosystem, and that's one less customer likely to leave it. Tesla's primary revenue is auto, yes; but they have a stew of other verticals that this customer can then tap into downstream:\n\n* Solar Roof (anemic offering, but it exists)\n* A second Tesla\n* Powerwall\n* HVAC (future pending product, been actively talked about by Elon and upper level leadership across multiple financial and shareholder calls to the degree that all statements made are material and applicable)\n* Supercharger access (cost of electricity effectively)\n\nOver time, this is expected to grow. Other market players don't have such offerings or if they do, they aren't seamlessly integrated into the vehicle platform ecosystem--and they certainly don't augment or compliment each other.  \n\n\nSo in essence, this is Elon's strategy and why they continue to drive prices lower.

To do this would be an extremely lengthy and expensive process and the 'data' from overseas will only ever be enough to have the development/testing approved with strict conditions. If Tesla do pursue this it will likely take many years at best as they would need to also have it approved for use in each state (reflecting the different road rules, vehicle regulations, and licensing requirements of each).\n\nIm not sure I agree I am making an 'emotional' call.

Vision park assist , to me, was a mistake to bring so early and casts doubt into FSD. If vision can\u2019t accurately gauge distance to objects, or fail as much as it does, than what does that mean for FSD vision system. If they get FSD working reliably than vision park assist makes a ton of sense, it\u2019ll be better in basically every way.
