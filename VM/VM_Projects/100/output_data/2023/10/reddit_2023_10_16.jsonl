Tesla never got a deal that good. Toyota got lots of money for the initial Prius under an earlier incentive program that Tesla did not receive. For quite some time, Tesla didn't have access to federal EV tax credits that most others did... and Ford has been a major recipient of DoE ATVM funding.\n\nNow, in terms of showing favoritism, most government programs cannot favor individual companies. So CARB ZEV, credits, CAFE GHG credits, federal EV tax credits, state level EV tax credits, IRA manufacturer EV and battery production credits, EVSE charging subsidies and so forth are all equal access as long as one adheres to the rules. Now, since Tesla has had well more than 50% of BEVs sold and no ICE vehicles, in some cases, it means more credits going to Telsa. However, when there is discretion, where someone has to pick winners of grants and subsidies, Tesla often does not get such subsidies. Ford and GM are big recipients of such.
