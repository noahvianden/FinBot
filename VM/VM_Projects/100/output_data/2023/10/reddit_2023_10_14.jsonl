{"title": "JP Morgan Earnings Beat is a Red Flag", "selftext": "\\*\\*I am making this post a second time, because the moderators removed the first one for reasons not apparent\\*\\*\n\nJP Morgan's earnings beat this quarter tells only the rosy part of an otherwise devolving picture. JP Morgan reported a new net debt position on their balance sheet of $42 billion dollars, and they have taken out new debt that they owe other banks and investors over the long term up to levels not seen since 2009. This new debt is very costly, and will leave them chasing higher and higher returns to continue revenue and net income growth. How does a company like JP Morgan, a company that creates no widgets and already services most of the nation in one way or another, to chase higher returns? They will take on more risk (as they have already in the most recent quarter). I am not particularly concerned about deposit flight at JP Morgan - I think that has mostly happened already to the extent that it is going to happen. I am concerned that JPM can report financials that look the way they do in today's rate climate - and receive a standing ovation though. See the graphic below:\n\n**\\*\\*Edit to add: I see they used at least 2.27B of this long-term debt to buy back their own shares - which did help their earnings beat (if only just barely)\\*\\***\n\n**\\*\\*Edit to add: Some of the leverage activity actually relates to older/less costly debt being called/maturing in conjunction with the bank's need to adjust for more stringent capital requirements in the wake of SVB which JPM characterized as \"making bank stocks un-investable\" which you can read more about here -** [**https://www.ft.com/content/5612cba3-1580-4003-a0ac-6623cbe28ee6**](https://www.ft.com/content/5612cba3-1580-4003-a0ac-6623cbe28ee6)**\\*\\***\n\n***The question remains - why does a bank reporting revenues at 12B per quarter need to borrow at such high cost?***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrlf8ze089ub1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=4092d8679deac413b11b3435ee665a5ab5c20052", "id": "17828jm", "created_utc": 1697326813.0, "score": 320, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "So keeping up with the old American tradition of kicking the can down the street until it's too late to do anything about it.

Production 2. Batteries. These are easily conflated, as Tesla's production is largely constrained by battery availability. \n\nThis battery constraint is why you don't see them scaling semis, roadsters, and cybertrucks or building out factories faster - their supply chain isn't ready for that. They don't have the batteries. This affects other auto OEMs and is reflected in their high prices.\n\nSo, for their core auto business (e.g. 3/Y), Tesla is production-constrained; every vehicle produced nets them a profit, and they have significant work in the pipeline that will further drive margins, but they can't produce enough vehicles to meet the intersection of supply/demand curves (at which point they would no longer need to increase production).\n\nAt any given point in time, Tesla's pricing matches the demand curve for their given supply. However, this is not a demand constraint; a demand constraint is defined as follows:\n\n> A demand-constrained supply chain is characterized by low demand and high supply. Because supply exceeds demand, all demand can be fulfilled, but there is underutilized production capacity. This is a common phenomenon in capitalism; demands are met with a bountiful supply for pretty much anything, which creates constant underutilization, even when demand is high. \n\nIt is not the case that Tesla has underutilized production capacity. Demand continues to exceed supply, as evidenced by Tesla selling every car produced. The evidence is simple: Tesla production keeps growing 50% YoY and the cars keep getting sold. Also, as Tesla reaches ~30k price points, they're essentially entering a giant untapped market segment - there's a clear area for Tesla to grow into, and it's pretty obvious that market segment will favor EVs.\n\nIf you drew a simple econ 101 supply-vs-demand chart with \"price\" on Y and \"quantity\" on X, current production would be to the left of the equilibrium point; that is, demand exceeds supply.\n\n... BTW, long-term, it's also a bit one-dimensional to think of Tesla's auto sales as a simple supply/demand chart of \"cost of production\" vs \"cost of sale\". Tesla will have add-ons (e.g. FSD levels, HW upgrades) & infrastructure (energy: charging & batteries). They're clearly winning the race there right now.
