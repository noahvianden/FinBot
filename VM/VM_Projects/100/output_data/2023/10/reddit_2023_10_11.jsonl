You want to do this because you think the price of the stock itself will go up but since you are buying the contract ahead of time, there\u2019s always the possibility that you\u2019ll be right. That possibility is called time value and since the person selling you the contract is in it to make money, they are gonna charge you for that time value. \nSo you are buying the contract with real money and the contract is priced based on how likely the market thinks it is that TSLA will go up in price and by how much. \nThe price you pay for the contract is not the actual purchase of any stock, and when it comes time to buy the stock, the cost to do that is completely different than the cost of the contract. You don\u2019t HAVE to execute the contract and purchase the 100 shares of TSLA per contract, but if it goes up in price, you want to. You DO however have to pay for that contract (upfront) and you never get that money back. What that means, is that if you want to make money by buying an option, the stock price has to go up enough to outweigh the cost of buying at the set contract (strike) price. Here is an example or two:\nProfit) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $265. On expiration, you execute the option to buy 100 shares at $260 and immediately sell them at $265. $500 profit minus the $80 for the contract = $420 profit (nice)\n\nBreak even) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $260.80. You can execute, buy the 100 shares at $260, and immediately sell at $260.80 for an $80 profit but you know where I\u2019m going with this. The profit is eaten by the initial cost and you walk away unscathed. (Note that even if the stock price only got as high as $260.70, it would still be worth executing because your losses would then only be $10\n\nLoss) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. You messed up and bought the option on the same day as I bought TSLA stock so of course TSLA crashed. At expiration, the stock price is $230. You don\u2019t want to execute, because you would have to buy at $260 and then what? You could just buy them without a contract now for $230. \n\nCost per option contract divided by 100 plus strike price = your break-even point.\n\nNote that you can also make money with options by buying them, holding them until the stock price goes up signaling good things to come (increase in time value) and then sell the contract for a profit. This is dangerous because time value decreases with each passing hour and day. \n\nProfits are unlimited on calls, losses are limited to the amount you paid for the contract(s)\nThe opposite is true for puts. Unlimited losses. Don\u2019t do this.\n\nHope this is helpful and good luck!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing thank you very much.
