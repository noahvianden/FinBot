That's why Fed talk hawkish to keep inflation expectation low, but their actions don't reflect that (2 skip meetings this year, 3rd one by next week). While Powell is determined to bring inflation down before his term is over, he's only determined to bring it down below 3% by 2024, and we were basically there 2 months ago (3-month moving average PCE of 2.1%, but 6-month moving average of around 2.7%). He will for sure hold rates if 3-month or 6-month moving average core PCE stays under 3%.\n\nRate hikes haven't had the desired impact because homeowners and corporates are sheltered from rate hikes, for now. Most of them have already refinanced at low rates during COVID. That means until these corporates are forced to refinance again (starting 2024), high rates don't affect them. And when they have to refinance again (2024), we will see the true impact of high rates. If their costs go up after refinancing, they'll be forced to cut cost (fire excess workers). Then unemployment will go up. Now homeowners have an average mortgage of around 3.7% (it's 8% now).

When unemployment goes up, they have no choice if they have no job.\n\nThis is why Powell said \"maybe rates haven't been high enough for long enough\".
