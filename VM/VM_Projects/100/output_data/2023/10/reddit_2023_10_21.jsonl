So, who makes NVDA's chips?\n\n**World\u2019s largest chipmaker TSMC sees biggest drop in profit in nearly five years**\n\n**PUBLISHED THU, OCT 19 20232:00 AM EDT CNBC**\n\n***The Taiwanese chipmaker is the top producer of the world\u2019s most advanced processors, but demand for consumer electronics has plunged.***\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ticker: TSM) reported revenue slipped 10.83% from a year ago, while net income fell 24.87% from a year ago to $17.28 billion. That compares with TSMC\u2019s guidance for third-quarter revenue between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion.\n\nDuring the earnings call on Thursday afternoon, CEO C.C. Wei said that the firm expects excess inventories to continue to decline.\n\n\u201cDue to the persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions and slow demand in China, customers remain cautious in their inventory control. That\u2019s why we expect the inventory oversupply to continue in the fourth quarter,\u201d said Wei.\n\nTSMC is the top producer of the world\u2019s most advanced processors. The Taiwanese firm manufactures semiconductors for companies like Apple, and **Nvidia.**\n\n\\*\n\n**Why Is The Semiconductor Industry Prone To Boom And Bust Cycles?**\n\nThe semiconductor industry is prone to boom and bust cycles due to a variety of factors:\n\nCapital Spending Ups and Downs: The industry\u2019s cycles are often driven by changes in capital spending. When demand for a product increases, manufacturers expand capacity aggressively. However, this can lead to an oversupply if demand decreases or stabilizes.\n\nProcess Migration Glitches: The transition to new manufacturing processes can cause disruptions in the supply chain, leading to periods of oversupply or shortage.\n\nDemand Slowdowns: Changes in demand for consumer products that use semiconductors can also cause these cycles. For example, insatiable demand for a product \u2013 such as PCs in the 1980s, mobile phones in the 2000s, and smartphones in the 2010s \u2013 would lead manufacturers to aggressively expand capacity.\n\nInventory and Economic Growth: The industry cycles are also driven by inventory as well as world economic growth.\n\nHowever, some experts believe that the semiconductor industry\u2019s boom-bust cycle might be changing due to diversified demand from various sectors like cell phones, automobiles, industrial equipment, cloud computing, and more. This diversified demand and the increasing cost of supply might lead to a steadier business going forward.\n\n**Biggest boom cycle in semiconductor industry**\n\nThe biggest boom cycle in the semiconductor industry, as per Deutsche Bank Research, began in October 2019 and has been running for 29 months, which is already above the historical average of 27.7 months. This boom cycle has been driven by various factors such as the demand for chips throughout the economy, including 5G, cloud datacenters, phones, PCs, laptops, and cars. The semiconductor industry has generally done pretty well over the last two or three years with the current chip shortage.\n\n**Will AI lead to another boom cycle for the semiconductor industry?**\n\n**AI impact on semiconductor industry**\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to lead to another boom cycle in the semiconductor industry. AI applications are everywhere, from big data analytics and military equipment to facial recognition software and self-driving cars. They bring new challenges and opportunities to the semiconductor industry every day.\n\nAI has the potential to generate huge business value for semiconductor companies at every step of their operations, from research and chip design to production through sales. However, only about 30 percent of semiconductor-device makers are already generating revenue through AI/ML.\n\nAI could allow semiconductor companies to grow in value, with storage experiencing the highest growth. The AI-spurred semiconductor market is set to grow by 18 percent over the next five years.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that while AI is creating new opportunities, it also brings challenges. For example, the amount of data processed and stored by AI applications is massive, requiring architectural improvements in semiconductors. Also, it\u2019s costly to manufacture a specialized AI chip for every application.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI is likely to drive growth in the semiconductor industry, how this will unfold depends on various factors including how quickly companies can adapt and innovate in response to these new demands and challenges.\n\n**Would it be better to invest in INTC, NVDA or the SMH ETF?**\n\nInvesting in individual stocks or an ETF depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here\u2019s some information that might help you:\n\n**Intel Corporation (INTC):**\n\nThe stock closed at $35.97.\n\nThe average 12-month stock price forecast is $34.45, which predicts a decrease of -4.23%.\n\nThe earnings per share (EPS) estimate for the current year (2023) is $0.62 and for the next year (2024) is $1.741. The revenue estimate for the current year (2023) is $52.48B and for the next year (2024) is $58.66B.\n\n**NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):**\n\nThe stock closed at $454.613. NVIDIA has received a consensus rating of Moderate Buy.\n\nIs NVIDIA stock overbought now?\n\nNVIDIA stock overbought analysis\n\nYes, according to some analysts, NVIDIA\u2019s stock is considered overbought. The term \u201coverbought\u201d refers to a situation where an asset has been more aggressively bought than its fundamentals justify. Overbought conditions can last for a while, but they often precede reversals or pullbacks in the price. However, it\u2019s important to note that being overbought doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the price will go down immediately.\n\n**VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH):**\n\nThe ETF closed at $148.81.\n\nIt\u2019s based on the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 index, a market-cap-weighted index of 25 of the largest US-listed semiconductors companies. It has holdings in both Intel and NVIDIA, among others.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s important to do your own research and due diligence (DD) before making any investment decisions.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "ups", "intc", "intc", "nvda", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I feel NVDA is a great buy at these levels.

I got started heavily in stocks is 2006.  Then in 2007-2008 something big happened.....  \n\n\nThink of it like this. You haven't lost any money until you sell your stock.  Its just paper profits/losses.    I don't worry because I'm long term.  I buy and hold. Selling and buying stocks as I see deals or take profits.  I loved 2020 because I got a lot of great deals. Doubled my portfolio.  I was smart enough to only keep the solid companies though. \n\nYour holdings make my cringe.  Seems like we are getting one of these post each day now.  People bought the meme/hype stocks and now are left holding the bag.  You see, the stock market is zero sum gain.  Everyone can't make money. For someone to make money someone else has to lose it.

It will take a few years, but enough of those stocks will come back up to get you back in the black.

So all you need are a couple big winners and you will be ok. In the future try to focus on solid companies with good fundamentals.  Good PE ratios.  Those companies will have a higher value when things get bad.  Then only do a few stocks as speculations.  I'll use two of mine for an example.  CRSP and TGT.  I like the future of CRSP.  It could be a game changer as long as right wing politicians don't ban it for stupid religious reasons. I bought it at $130 and its now at $40.  I'll average down some and hold because I think its worth the risk. Just in case.  But TGT is a solid company that has great numbers.  I bought it really low  at $100 in 2020.  It then went up to 250.  Now its back down to $100.  It has a yield of 4% and a PE of 15. Its still a solid company that will be around for years to come.  It will go back up higher than ever in the future. So I'm not worried that its cheap now. Its just a better chance to buy more.    \n\nIn the future try to avoid so many stocks with crazy PEs.

I'm in a similar position but I'm concentrated in TSLA and I sell CCs to generate income which so far I've usually immediately dumped back into shares. Been doing this for >3 years now. Here's what I've learned about selling calls / puts:\n\n* I retired for a while and intended to generate income via selling weekly CCs, but that got super stressful super fast. I think at your portfolio size it is doable, but I struggled with it at ~$4m.\n* Selling margin secured puts is sorta fun, but more risky that selling CCs obviously. Something to mess around with maybe...\n* Be wary of any scheme where you feel compelled to grind out $x / time period. In my experience this mindset leads to bad decision making. Much better to patiently lie in wait for an opportunity to sell options where you are equally comfortable w/ them expiring worthless or getting exercised\n* Earlier this year I sold leap calls against all my TSLA shares and have loved NOT dealing with shorter term options stress...am now considering buying those calls back since I can probably do better selling very low risk weeklies or monthlies at this point\n* Only sell contracts you are ok with managing (rolling out if needed) or exercising. Easier said than done!\n\nGood luck!!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Congrats on the stack, that\u2019s sizable.
