Chevy and Dodge aren't doing any better. Overseas markets like the Middle East, most of Asia, and Central/South America will remain ice centered for awhile longer. It's incredibly short sighted as someone from the richest countries on earth to imagine. Toyota doesn't have the luxury of being solely marketed to greenwashed westerners.\n\nThe reality is cafe regulations are pushing affordable sensible ice cars off the US market. And all that remains are monster trucks, armored cars for the soccer mom, ego haulers, and emotional support trucks. \n\nThere's nothing about bev adoption in the west that's organic, and it's obviously detrimental to the industry. Companies like Toyota are left hedging because it's obvious Western government's regulatory schemes aren't sustainable. The only question is who breaks first. Toyota leadership actually enjoying cars and driving likely informs this worldview.\n\nTesla and most other ev manufacturers are betting on the legacy makers caving first. They're probably right. It's clear westerners have a religious devotion to appearing ecologically conscious, and the younger generations clearly couldn't give a fuck about driving or cars.\n\nSo yeah. Good cars are fucked.

California is banning the sale of all new ICE vehicles, hybrid or not, in 7 years. Europe is not far off that route either. There is zero, and I mean zero, fucking chance Toyota, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, whoever the hell, would be selling ZERO internal combustion engine cars in the entirety of Europe, California, or anywhere for that matter, in the year 2030 if government did not deem it so.\n\nBEV cars are good products. They have a market. But they are not an end all be all replacement for ICE cars. They fundamentally are not. And they probably will never be. That isn't to say they won't get better. That isn't to say they'll preform better. They already do. But they're not a replacement for ICE. The same way a motorcycle isn't a replacement for a car, and vice versa. They have different sets of abilities, but ultimately with a decent amount of overlap.\n\nIf it were not for the government clearly, obviously putting bullets in the back of ICE's head, all the other large manufactures would probably continue making some number of ICE cars indefinitely. Presumably for fun/prosumer/performance consumer cars. Much the same way American auto is still catering towards those who want a manual transmission even when it's comparatively very unpopular.\n\n\\>EVs are happening, and this as been obvious for a decade. The fact that Toyota didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t understand this will lead to their bankruptcy.\n\nYeah no shit. Everyone in the auto world knows it. But no body knows if the timeline the west is aiming for is practical. Many consumers are going to get priced out of the new car market. Hell they're already getting priced out. And used cars aren't in a better position. Hell didn't Tesla raise the MSRP on the Model 3 recently? I know there was a price change. And this is to say nothing of how shite the used market is for BEV's. My Leaf is probably worth fuck all because it only gets like 45 miles on a full charge. It's not at all worth trying to fix either. The used EV market is going to be full of many such cases. Inflating further the demand and cost of new EV's.\n\nToyota sees that consumers are not being given a choice on when and how they adopt and EV. I was fortunate enough to get to abuse the government subsidies and get a fast charger installed at my house for free, with 5k dollar gas credit, space for two cars in case I needed to go somewhere further than my Leaf could take me, and a commute that was no longer than 10 miles.
