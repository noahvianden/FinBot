( Dollar strengthens all other currency weakens )\n* Dxy up leads to sell Us-t bonds and rise in Yields.\n* Hence the stock market goes down and the dollar becomes the only safe haven.\n* Or you can chase the yields in bonds ( or park cash in mmf ) but not the price appreciation in the long end of the bonds because it won't happen for now. Remember yields are inversely proportional to price and long end moves more in price as compared to the front end in the bonds.\n\nLink to the Persistent Inflation paper : [Persistent Inflation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vnajhc9eyj6mvp0/BianchiFacciniMelosi_fiscal_trend_inflation.pdf?dl=0)\n\nRead it you \"Deflationary Economists\" I can see you lurking. xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat actually happened :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Everything played out nicely. Forex happened exactly as we predicted.\n* Dxy went up. Bonds sold off. Yields rose whereas TLT, TMF which chases price appreciation in the long end fell.\n* Even my housing DRV etf did well but one thing stayed strong. The USA stock market. It didn\u2019t even flinch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Intro :**\n\nSo therefore I am writing this letter to explain what\u2019s going on in the stock market and why is there such a disconnect.\n\nRespected Traders and Investors,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to apologize to each and every single one of you. I think in these past posts and especially in the comments I have lost a bit of calm. I get angry whenever I see people making profits in this rally or wanting to join this Euphoria in the markets. Man, sometimes I believe I must be a hell of a bad person wanting to crash this market. But then I recall two words in my mind. \u201cSPX $3200\u201d and then up only xD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo moving on, how are you doing friends? I know i suck. Nothing really happened during the V-week or maybe some forces didn\u2019t let it happen. Now I can entertain you with my wild theories why it did not happen because of \u201cChat GPT'' Feb 14 crash predictions or because of the \u201cCarl Icahn'' and his short positions. I like these stories but i think we cannot rush into such conclusions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experiment :**\n\nBut what we can do is run the math again and check if we missed something in the calculations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ftr05s50dja1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87686c06d9e7228f210f83211e94c39e370daf8a\n\nSo if you read my last letter you\u2019d know that we basically calculated all US 10yr possible yield and added 200 bps of Equity Risk Premia i.e. Erp. I think this is where I made a mistake. I never imagined Erp falling even below 190 bps. I was under the assumption it would be range bound b/w 190-225bps. So therefore we need to check with our quant guy and run the math if the stock market is really undervalued or is it overvalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuant guy :\n\n* S&P Yields >= 10yr bond yields ( Fed rate exp of 10yr +- Term premia ) + Equity Risk Premia.\n* But now let\u2019s change yields to PE and the formula becomes :\n* S&P PE ratio must trade <= 1/ S&P yields from above formula  ( It\u2019s an old math that inequality reverses )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEquity risk premia : It is basically a number in basis points what you as an investor demand from the market for a slightly higher yields than bonds.\n\nTerm premia : In future i will do a ACM model calculations if you folks are interested in. Just say the word ACM and i will know. Right now all you need to know is basically when Fed hikes rates in front end it expects the long term bond yields to rise but it doesn't. It generally falls because the markets expects Fed to make a mistake and hence the 10-2yr spread becomes -ve i.e. Inversion. But this time around some geniuses in the economics fields are saying that the 10yr is being used for collateral in banking operations. Hence term premia is becoming too negative and causing longer end duration yields to fall more and hence more inversion in the history. Now i do not know the right ans. It's up to you folks to figure out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : I will be taking historical low Erp for calculations i.e. 1.5% = 150bps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[These are the new calculations](https://preview.redd.it/octlwqcc0dja1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5272f46bf725d2cf426dffc2d772b8ce7e5e3273)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we all expect more returns from stock index coz otherwise why shouldn\u2019t we just buy bonds and therefore the new PE ratios in the above calculations came by adding S&P yields + Erp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's do a rough estimate. Current 3.7% 10 yr bond yields and add 150 bps of the equity risk premia. The max PE ratio that S&P 500 can achieve is 19.23. Meaning if we take 225 as earnings estimate ( the street consensus ) max price S&P 500 can achieve is : 19.23 X 225 = $4326.75. This resistance can fail and break if obviously a 10 yr bond yields plummets even below 3.5%. The catalyst for that would be a very good CPI report showing inflation is slowing down. A bad jobs report can do it as well but i think CPI would be the definitive proof to break 3.5%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany of you guys might be like \u201cMan i am not shorting coz there is a huge upside potential\u201d To them i would say yah i completely agree there is a risk but you need to remember i am taking a historical lowest of all lows Equitiy risk premia plus if bond yields go over 4% equities are done. Right now there seems to be a disconnect in equities. Even at current prices it is still overvalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The disconnect](https://preview.redd.it/u2pvow1q3dja1.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0a285555d0984b079c1bbf5c08abef144259743)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook at this shocking divergence. Bonds and metals all reacted to higher dollar in forex or you can also say higher bond yields. Reason being hot inflation Jan report combined with Jobs and PPI which generally leads CPI report. So i have no doubt in my mind that in upcoming months there is a risk to equities. There are only two reasons that come to my mind why stock market ain't reacting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* January due to seasonality makes these numbers look scary. So maybe market wanna confirm the sticky inflation theory with Feb jobs and CPI.\n* What if bonds are more risky than stocks and hence causing Equity risk premia to drop like a stone. What if \u201cRisk free is not risk free at all\u201d Now i know many people don\u2019t like this take and i completely agree with your 'Firesale of assets\" point. Even i don\u2019t like this idea but just think about it what other explanation there is for Erp to drop this low. Even a front end is yielding such good returns. You can buy a 6-m t bill and get 5% returns risk free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nStocks should sell off. Remember a key detail on new calculations. There are basically two models of PE and EPS. One is Wsj model where EPS is 222 and PE ratio at 18.35. The other one is multpl model which has PE ratio of 21.80 and EPS 187.07. So in all i think Wsj EPS is totally overvalued coz i saw many Earnings est come down recently according to that model. It should get repriced around March-April. As for multpl website model well it's PE ratio is too high. It's already trading around August peak of 22.02 when rates were suppose to top out at 3.4%.\n\nIn all what i am trying to say. Erp has to go up and cause sell off. This mispricing cannot last longer. PE 16 due to rise in bond yields will meet EPS 210-200 due to earnings estimate downgrade this 1st half 2023. It's just my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtnts30k5dja1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e17d1e723cb7cbcfea13350e4286fdc00c01a577\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jv61240k5dja1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13d0871b334fd873f04d94a3047ba4aeafb9b185\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7yspi90k5dja1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48760a284796a650f2a3f7d8d4321f7f2ddc2824\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utmkwi0k5dja1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f4a4ed2f7d34c0d30d91f99af813a7369ec25ee\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us68100k5dja1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa4417168d4a0ebf62f6131cd1e26e647648925e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bonus  Content :**\n\nNow i am sure many people get bored by my repetitive Q1 disaster posts. Hence it's time to freshen things up. So we all know that :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUSA\n\nJobs : March 10th\n\nCPI : March 14th\n\nFomc : March 21-22\n\nimportant event are going to be released before Fomc. Hence they are going to play a pivotal role for 50bps or 25bps hike. If report again beats expectation meaning CPI higher than expected or jobs markets still resilient it would mean Fed can do a 50bps pushing terminal yields even higher. So bonds will sell off again more aggressively. Stocks this around shall sell off as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what media likes to tell you and even the rest of the world on Yt or Twitter. I personally am a wierdo so i say i don't really care but if it causes stocks sell off then good. Right now i am more interested in somewhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08skybmx7dja1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2822beb1015ed575b5104942866fa945745c4d2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to the paper : [Ueda San Paper](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2005/data/wp05e06.pdf)\n\nYup you're thinking exactly right. I am going to talk about Japan. For those who don't know that on March 9-10 Mr Kuroda is going to do his final Boj meeting. After that he will hand the torch to Ueda san. This guy is neither a dove or a hawk but recently market is pricing him more as a dove but i can assure you he is neither. Go read his paper if you're interested about him. So what's so fascinating about Japan is many of you are thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here i present you some interesting visuals about Japan by Black Rock. Basically i write papers for Black Rock and then they publish. Haha i am just kidding. I am just too tired to write guys. I need to post this by Monday night USA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pwqy17p0adja1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=4379e05f4becde0cec10d6c1ee91800c20592d15\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bebjvip0adja1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=262063387e77affec90ac195f756454d441233d0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3i32ybp0adja1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb150e528f811559157deffcfcb330b17ade85b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR :\n\nJapanese policy makers are about to start their rate hike operations this year at least this is what the theory says when inflation is raging in the new regime. Old regime says \"Dont hike\" But remember a key detail which i think only the legendary investors on this planet knows. Mr Ueda san was the only guy in 2000 who didn't vote for a hike in policy. Yes he was a voting member of committee and yah the inflation wasn't that high. Boj still went forward w/o his wishes and did raise rates and then it was only later everyone figured out what a huge mistake that was. I think Japan went into recession because of that.\n\nLink : [Hike rate article](https://money.cnn.com/2000/08/11/asia/boj/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's see what happens this time around. So what i was trying to say is Mr Kuroda is the one we should be watchful for. He loves surprising markets. So maybe he could shock everyone and raise rates. I still don't believe he has the balls to remove YCC completely but he could easily just widen the band to about 50bps from originally 25bps that he did last to last meeting. All of this is bullish for Yen meaning Dxy goes down. Every legendary investors will short the Japanese bonds causing yields to surge and so theoretically speaking stock market of Japan should go down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrade : Buy $EWV which is basically a 2x leveraged Etf to short Japanese equities. Now it's not easy to short bonds for retail investors hence you can try your luck here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EWV : Keep adding in Golden Zone $16 and base layer of $11.30](https://preview.redd.it/14r79j86ldja1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=216d2e4a8cfe23ac4716f952560b52f28d1fe719)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : YCC removal is what causes global implications. Term premia of global bond yields will expand causing global bond yields to rise more. Japanese investors are the largest holder of Us-t bonds. So theoretically speaking they could sell them as well causing more sell off. Hence USA stock market valuations will readjust causing extra bit of sell off. It kinda happened to a small magnitude in Australia 2021. Go check for yourself. But remember it turned out to be a \"Buy the rumor sell the news event\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts :**\n\nWell to be honest guys i am sad. It is my birthday and here i am writing this stupid letter just because market did not sold off. I even forgot to watch \"You\" Season 4. Liverpool finally on winning tracks is helping me stay positive but i think i am gonna be sad if they loses to Real Madrid in home leg. I haven't even watched anime in a long time. I had planned at least four this month. But seriously what will make me more sad is if \"Pedro Pascal\" does not win an Emmy this yr. Man has been killing it in The Last of us and there is still a \"Mandolorian\" waiting to come out. Do you guys know Ashley and Troy are about to do a cameo in Last of Us. And hey btw any of you playing \"Hogwarts Legacy\" ? Man WB shares has been killing it. God hope my $PARA shares pays out nicely. Even Warren Buffet bought the dip just to play MI7 theme. Yahhhhhhoooo. Sucks! I am not paying $META anything but yah i will buy $GOOGL if it collapse -50% just like META did after Sandberg left. In all what i am trying to say\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"If people don't like buying Chinese shares and even the government are trying to ditch China so why on earth should markets go up just because of PBOC liquidity injections narrative causing global liquidity to rise.

We have to think critically about the components in the models.\n\nThe reason why is evident if you look at the delta in historical P/E ratios in that time:\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart)\n\nEver since the reversal in monetary policy that came with the end of the Volcker regime, P/Es have been trending up after almost a century of ranging.\n\nThe current methods of assessing fair value in P/E ratios largely rely on historical comps, whether to historical P/Es, historical price to earnings equivalents, or the CAPE ratio. Lots of people like the CAPE ratio because it adjusts for inflation and P/E expansion over time...\n\n...but that adjustment lags to 10 years, and assumes the primary motivator of P/E prices is inflation.\n\nThat means that any reasonable historical P/E calculation right now isn't taking into account the full addressable capital in the market after a 45% expansion of the M2 money supply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can hear the voices in the distance... \"But the Fed put's dead!\" \"No more money printer!\" \"All the free money's been turned off!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem: The Fed's never actually said they were pulling all of the money out, just that they would be restrictive so as to slow its release. 45% expansion at trend was a little over 10 years of release of capital in the reserve system, the vast majority of which is still sitting in those banks, hence the banks surviving their stress tests pretty readily.\n\nSee, here's what those people aren't taking into account, and it also explains the weird stuff you're finding in the bond market and risk premia:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Fed effectively did QE for 10 years ahead of time, and the dot plot and the current rate of reduction tell us that to achieve the level of reserve funding necessary to get back to 2%, \"restrictive\" policy in this case only means pulling about half of it, or less, out... which seems to be right where they're targeting. The majority of QT at the moment seems to be around ensuring that banks don't open the floodgates on the roughly 75% of the M2 expansion still sitting in their reserves and allowing risk to float off the Fed balance sheet, allowing banks to take some MBS and lending risk on again.\n\nBut the Fed's still holding a good portion of the MBS risk, so the banks aren't in a 2008 scenario where they might become insolvent... and in 2020 they sold off bonds to the Fed in order to increase liquidity (since you don't want to hold bonds as a collateral anchor when the US economy might lurch into a depression because of a pandemic... that's a good way for your collateral anchor to become a pair of lead boots as bond values on the market contract.\n\nBut now, with yields up, banks et al are back to buying. That 10Y bank collateralization thing? I've been calling that out for like a year and a half on here and have the scars to show for it. LOL\n\nBut that's exactly what happened. Banks are now offsetting risk by using excess capital, now freed by a more predictable Fed term rate (meaning it's easier for bank risk departments to project how much capital will be clawed back in the short term), which offsets market risk premia, which increases bank stability and allows for the provision of more margin lending since that's relatively safe due to haircut regulations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the time when fundamentals bears are expecting the market to pull back with visions of a bank liquidity crisis... is exactly the time when the banks will have the highest assurance that the Fed will not pull out capitalization at a greater rate, meaning that it's the time when Risk departments will be more likely to deploy it, as they will still have a very nice buffer even if they just deploy a fraction of that capital... meaning that on top of the 25% of the M2 expansion that already leaked out into institutions, there may be as much as another 25% of addressable capital in excess in the reserves system that we haven't seen yet...\n\n...and that's why the Fed's not worried, they pre-charged the QE line.\n\nAnd banks will be motivated to do this because they will have an ideal interest rate environment. Investors will demand capital deployment in a circumstance where risks may be lower than feared, or where it's expected the Fed may hold steady or cut back... and it's important to note that all this scenario requires is them to pause or slow and provide enough certainty for bank risk departments to be able to calculate an excess in the reserves.\n\nIn this scenario, it doesn't matter if the Fed becomes loose or not, because the only thing that matters is that capital entering the economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd this goes along with another odd historical trend, also on the historical P/E chart:\n\nMost of the fundamentals arguments suggest that we will go down in P/E \\*through\\* the decline in earnings, but instead what we see is that paradoxically P/E ratios have rocketed at the end of recessions. Some people attribute this to the Fed loosening, and OK, that makes sense... but it also just has to do with the fact that eventually dropping earnings no longer impact the already-sold-off S&P as much. I don't know that we're there yet, but that's how it works... the S&P de-weights stocks that took a bigger hit by virtue of market cap and kicks out losers, which happens over a period of 6 month cycles. Market parity eventually drags all stocks up as the market adapts and earnings drop out, triggering accelerating P/Es as earnings drop faster than stocks can...\n\n...which triggers the buying signal.\n\nNow getting back to 18/19 P/Es, to get there you need to have the capitalization and earnings of roughly 2014... does that sound right? Are we in drastic danger of an absolute collapse of the economy, or is this a short technical mean reversion?\n\nI don't have a crystal ball, so I don't know, but an America with an active manufacturing sector and lots of jobs and lots of demand may cause inflation, but that's not a recipe for an economic collapse of over 10 years of growth, even with a retraction of short term growth.\n\nSo basically, I think all of these P/E fundamentals arguments hinge on P/Es which are drastically low compared to where the Fed is telling us capitalization is going, and that's largely due to mathematical problems with the models that can't encompass the change in monetary policy.\n\nNow does that mean we rocket from here?\n\nI would agree that the next year has a lot of risk. The market can crash due to emotions, fear, etc... sure... maybe we're missing something in bank liquidity and there are bigger risks than feared... maybe the P/E thesis becomes a short term self-fulfilling prophecy before the market rockets up (I actually kind of hope that happens, more opportunity).\n\nBut will it be because we deserve to be at 2014 P/E levels because a model says so? I don't think so.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry for giving you a response you don't wanna hear. I like the idea of you destroying my model and banker's model as well which is used by pretty much everyone on street by saying what if the model is wrong. I like this approach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let me first explain the chart you sent me for PE ratio. First pt that is a multpl model. Meaning it does not align with bankers/ hfs and inst model. Your chart says PE ratio must be at 22-23x. But bankers model says it's at 18 PE. This is the first point. I am not trying to throw a shade. It's just a misconception even i made during my beginning yrs. Second pt let's say you really wanna dig that multpl model upside and down. So the way i look at is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom 1900 - 1990. PE ratio used to trade in range 10-20 range.  So anytime you want to assess what might be the appropriate PE to pay. You would simply subtract a High PE - Current inflation rate. So let's say you're in 1974 where inflation went 12%.  PE you would pay acc to multpl model is basically a High PE over 90yrs - Inflation rate. Therefore PE was 8 in 1974. Same was the case in 1980 when 14.x% inflation and 6.y PE. Okay so now we understood stagflationary decade,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's understand supply shock decade i.e. WW1 and WW2.\n\nWW2 : High PE : 22 and inflation rate 3%. So yah total 25 seems fine. But then due to supply shocks inflation came 20%. Now the PE just got cut in half to 10. And then when later inflation came down to below -ve PE ratio fell as well. Now this is an anomaly compared to stagflation of 70s. In that period of stagflation low PE with high inflation rate was the bottom. But in post Ww2 unless the inflation went -ve we did not achieved bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWW1 : Around 1915, High PE : 11 and inflation -1%. Fed started lowering rates and basically printing money for war time financing. Inflation soared to 20% and again PE got chopped in half to around 6. Markets then went sideways for yrs and did no bottomed until inflation went below -ve and Fed had to cut rates again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think there is a lot more factors involved here. 10yr bond yields and interest rate matter as well. I already did this analysis in this season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tAX3x-RJTPdKmJ2C7D9wgjTLhDvfAUgIfbhCb0UxGmM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tAX3x-RJTPdKmJ2C7D9wgjTLhDvfAUgIfbhCb0UxGmM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n You can read S02E03 where i explained these two periods in depth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what can we take away from it is. Inflation usually comes in cycle and when it appears market usually go sideways and does not go for ATH if it is supply shock driven and go ATH but then crashes in stagflationary environment. Reason being the debt/gdp ratio. But you need to remember one important thing. This is not 70's, 40s or 20s where manufacturing came and saved us with their earnings boost. This is tech driven markets and it does not like rates at 5% meanwhile inflation at 5% as well. Meaning Fed will push towards crushing inflation and bringing it back below 2% even if it means causing recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo lets do modern 1990s- 2010 analysis. High PE of 25 and low of 15 again combined with low inflation of 2% was the perfect recipe for economic boom. But whenever PE went above 30 it was a bubble. So Fed starts hiking again to stop people animal spirits behavior. PE came down to 25 and also inflation headed down. But soon companies made no earnings. It was just like a crypto bubble. So the yields of tech stocks fell, Erp exploded higher coz why shouldn't i buy bonds. Hence PE exploded higher as well. Hence that's why it was the bottom. Same goes for 2008 as well. Rise in Erp with banks failing, companies having no yields, bond looking more juicy all led to PE exploding higher just before recession. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now it's upto you to decide which story will play out this time around. I personally like the idea of lost decade i.e. a sideways markets. Play tactically and you will make money. If you're a long term investor you wait for that pain in markets around 2023-24 moments before recession and by then just simply be in bonds and eat yields. As a short term investor it's tricky. You have to use tactical strategies and hope it works out using technical + macro env + fundamentals. You could hit or miss it. It's a 50-50.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yes i agree my model is flawed otherwise everybody can make money. But one thing is certain you're not having a new bull market. It's gonna be a sideways chop for a very long time atleast till 2024-25 minimum or it just crashes -50% and make us all bears happy.

Same goes for 2008 as well. Rise in Erp with banks failing, companies having no yields, bond looking more juicy all led to PE exploding higher just before recession.\n\nI'm putting on my banker voice here: This is not at all how this works.  It's close, but it's a backward-looking misunderstanding of the process for how banks and other institutions buying bonds influences market P/E.\n\nI know, I was there, working in the banking system at the time.\n\nFirst of all, P/Es didn't expand \"just before recession\" they expanded in 2009 after the recession began, when everyone was calling for them to drop. That recession was not declared until after it had begun, so there was uncertainty as P/Es declined... basically, you get the decline before the recession, the explosion during it in large part because recession isn't news while you're in it.\n\nAgain, that crash everyone's expecting during the recession? It happens before it.\n\nJust check the graph, it's all right there.\n\nBut that's a minor issue. The larger issue is the connection you're drawing between bond yields being \"juicy\" and P/E ratios going up... and I just don't understand what you're thinking with that statement.\n\nIf bond yields are high, and elevating, then P/Es decline until banks reach the yield level that they want from bonds because, in the circumstances you laid out, stocks are ultra-risky.\n\nThat shifts prices down with earnings. The only way to get a P/E elevation with declining earnings is to either run out of sellers and/or to have an influx of buyers.\n\nIf you overlay the data, what you'll find isn't that \"bonds are juicy\" is the thing that drives P/Es \\*up\\*... that correlates to them dropping... it's when bond yields decline that P/Es start rising again, because at that point banks have found their ideal buying point and the rate of return on stocks increases. The bond yield rate doesn't have to decline much to get to that point, since all you need is for bonds to become predictable with yield, either through zero coupon or direct interest returns. It's the constant expectation of elevating yields that drives flows out of equities.\n\nSince bonds are a risk offset (risk-\"free\" money since the only way US treasuries don't get paid is if the country collapses, and then you have bigger problems) they promote riskier spending by banks.\n\nSomething specific happened in 2008, too, that drove this dynamic. With MBS risk-offset collapsing, banks turned to bonds as a collateral offset. That thing you were surprised by?\n\nThat started like 15 years ago, man.\n\nThat's how the bond market exploded $20T over like 10 years since 2009.\n\nAnd that walks hand-in-hand with the expansion of the market, and the same will happen this time because nothing's really changed with how capital is flowing into and out of the banks mechanically or with regard to how higher yields create a higher appetite for risk, but you have to get through the compression period first.\n\n>So now it's upto you to decide which story will play out this time around.

I didn't last year in my core account and that made money. I just play a hedge where I run neutral when I don't know which way the market will go and then shift when the technicals tell me to do so. I basically have a hedge fund structure that I maintain where I balance small long positions against net short/long inverse market hedging.\n\nBuying bonds and CDs right now in barbell is tempting, but you can totally play both sides of this if you're smart.\n\nAnd you also have to be ready to accept a position no one here ever seems to want to: Neutral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So yes i agree my model is flawed otherwise everybody can make money.

You see sideways chop, I understand that and agree that it won't be 2020/2021 with 30% returns... but that doesn't really take a bull run off the table. I suspect volatility will remain the name of the game, but that doesn't mean the bears are right, either, especially when the thesis is based on a model that is definitely not reflecting the fair value of P/Es relative to the amount of addressable capital in the market and the Fed data is indicating that P/E fair value is higher.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sir in all of this part 1, part 2 , part 3 series why do you think that i just randomly made things up like 1-2 months ago and said SPX will go $3200.

It turned out to be a giant mistake in my calculations but i am still optimistic for some kind of lower lows in Q1.\n\n\nThat's it. Now fundamentally you can debate with me no this has changed or that. Or how Fed will never let markets crash. Or how there are sufficient bank reserves. I totally get it. I might agree with most of your pts just because i am not really from the economics side. I am just a simple Flutter developer who just fell in love with stocks and crypto. I never read a book on economics nor did i learned any trading skills although i may have taken just one class on Ecom but i totally fell asleep.

I even made a compilation video of them speaking about economic slowdown and how everyone should just follow it instead of watching some Yt or Twitter expert or anyone else.\n\n[Legendary Investors](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DpwSUjnaRzk&feature=youtu.be)\n\n\nSo whenever i say Q1 disaster its just because i am biased.

I could have run away from those things, but I didn't... I did research, I observed patterns, I did a ton of chart work to learn to trend things I couldn't see. A lot of that came out to some really darn good predictions last year myself that predicted SPY movement in many cases down to the dollar. With good, solid technicals, you can do that... but it didn't work every time, and that's OK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's OK to get something wrong, that's how we learn. And all of those people who you listed off? I've seen some of these videos and they would ALL say that learning from our mistakes and our biases and expanding our view is the superior outcome.\n\nI had a chart last year that said that SPY 320 was on the table... then the bullish reversal trend change happened. So I get that 3200 wasn't random. I saw it in the chart in Q3 last year. So I'm definitely not saying you made anything up, just that there are probably things you're missing, like all of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So whenever i say Q1 disaster its just because i am biased. I cannot change my stance because that would be a huge disrespect to all of the people who have faithfully watched this series since last yr. So if i am wrong so i be wrong but i will try everything in my power to atleast make an attempt for lower lows in Q1 itself. No matter how bad the odds are.\n\nThere's a difference between having a conviction and holding onto a bad play.\n\nI would say your position right now is still a conviction, but this isn't a team sport. You don't generate the crash by selling your theory of it, and you can't will it into existence. Crashes mostly happen because the underlying mechanics of the market fall apart.\n\nSometimes those mechanics are economic, but usually they influence the financial system. That was true in the 10s, 30s, in the 40s/50s... in the 70s and 80s, in the 2000 and 2008 crash... in the end, they all have the unifying factor of the bottom falling out of the liquidity system.\n\nRecessions played a part in those crashes, but not all recessions resulted in liquidity crises.\n\nAfter lots of work on trending the market, I strongly believe in planning both sides of the trade.... so I say continue planning for your crash and what you would do, but also plan on what happens if you're wrong. How do you avoid loss if you're wrong? How do you profit on the other side?\n\nI have skin in that game. Last year, in Q3, I rode end of the year SPY 330 puts thinking 320 was on the table, hoping for a big payout. I kept dumping money into the position because I was sure we were on the pattern for another leg down, and it really looked like it a couple of times... but that money just wasted away because it doesn't always work the way that we think.\n\nI stuck to the bad play, and lost money as a result. Don't stick to a bad play if you can avoid it. And you don't owe your fans blind conviction in these plays... again, it's not a team sport. The team  is \"me\" and the game is \"gains.\"\n\nWhat you owe your fans is honesty, sincerity, and thoughtfulness.\n\nAnd I honestly think you do that.

My big problem on here is when people leave the thoughtful space and dig in too hard without considering the competing idea. You considered my position, and I appreciate that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> So let me first explain the chart you sent me for PE ratio. First pt that is a multpl model. Meaning it does not align with bankers/ hfs and inst model. Your chart says PE ratio must be at 22-23x. But bankers model says it's at 18 PE. This is the first point. I am not trying to throw a shade. It's just a misconception even i made during my beginning yrs. Second pt let's say you really wanna dig that multpl model upside and down. So the way i look at is. \n\nFun fact about me: I used to be a banker, working in infosec and risk.\n\nWe may be running into a language gap here, but I think what you're saying here is that the banking world and institutions use complex fundamentals analysis, not just multiple, to determine their targets and I agree with that, but the target multiple being talked about relating to the S&P 500 is still a target multiple, and we have to look at that with a critical eye.\n\nMy old colleagues and I have talked about this. 17-19 is pretty much the institutional target P/E range for the S&P 500 among most money managers... no disagreement that, and that can create self-fulfilling prophecies, but these targets also often don't hit, and to understand why you have to understand the mindset of a risk manager and an institutional investor. We're still subject to linear bias and you have to be crazy not to look at the current condition and see risk.\n\nWhat I hear from my old colleagues is that they know about the problems with CAPE/Shiller-PE and other historical multiple comps, and they're aware of the problems with under-guessing at earnings, but with the Fed in uncertain times the tendency is to accept a lower floor than what they think will actually hit.\n\nBasically, money managers are accepting bad data because in this circumstance they judge it's better not to recommend a long position when they don't know whether the floor is 20 or 17.\n\nIt just being the common banker model doesn't inherently mean it's going to end up there. Maybe it will, we're pretty close to the target... but I'm not speculating when I say that the banking model is inherently targeting a lower-than realistic fair valuation for the market.\n\nPlease feel free to expand: Is there anything of substance I'm missing from your argument here? \n\nIf there's a calculation I'm not considering, I'd love to see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> From 1900 - 1990. PE ratio used to trade in range 10-20 range. \n\nYes, that's what I was saying and what the chart says. We agree on the timeframes and the historical behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n>Therefore PE was 8 in 1974. Same was the case in 1980 when 14.x% inflation and 6.y PE. Okay so now we understood stagflationary decade,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> WW2    \n>  \n>WW1\n\nThis is all during or under the shadow of Bretton Woods or the gold standard. This is important, a big part of the reason why market P/Es ranged until 1990 has little to do with inflation and everything to do with the lack of money supply expansion, which constrains The P portion of the multiple equation.\n\nThat's why things become decoupled in 1990, because the Volcker regime was basically responding to monetary policy whipsaw after the 1970s and after Bretton Woods ended. Now I personally am not on-board with blaming the entire economic situation on Bretton Woods since I think it's more complex than that, but it has to be factored in since breaking the forex gold alignment that kept the 1st world markets on stable footing really changes the game. That opens the door to money supply expansion after the Volcker regime.\n\n \n\n>So what can we take away from it is. Inflation usually comes in cycle and when it appears market usually go sideways and does not go for ATH if it is supply shock driven and go ATH but then crashes in stagflationary environment. Reason being the debt/gdp ratio. But you need to remember one important thing. This is not 70's, 40s or 20s where manufacturing came and saved us with their earnings boost. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can't conclude anything from these historical examples. In fact, for half of them the primary mode of transportation was horses and the telephone was a new and uncommon invention. TV wasn't even in most households for most of the examples. Modern computers weren't even a twinkle in the mind's eye for most people until the 1990s and even then people would be shocked to see a smartphone.\n\nYou don't get to cherry-pick the differences in economic timeframes. You can't say \"This is not 70's, 40s or 20s where manufacturing came and saved us with their earnings boost\" and then ignore all of the extremely significant and major economic contexts that are wildly different. Just even algorithmic trading by itself changes how crashes happen as a mechanical reality.\n\nIn 1929, a whale who wants to protect themselves against a crash and who is tied in with the system was relying on a closed-loop ticker feed with lagged reads, and on transactions that if they were lucky filled by the close. \n\nNow? That same whale can shift a buying zone in milliseconds, and can acquire funds via direct wire and brokerage funding in almost as short a time.\n\nNYSE and ICE no longer just watch in awe as markets decline, they have halting rules and realtime analysis. The mechanics of the market are just wildly different than they were in your examples... hell trading now is wildly different than even it was 10 years ago. If you told an investor 20 years ago that people bought 0dte options on the regular on their phones they'd have called you a liar because it would have been incomprehensible to them, but that has a moderating influence on the patterns in the market.\n\n But back to that \"manufacturing's not going to save us\" statement. I'll buy that for the 20s and 40s, but the 70s/80s were in part due to the decline in manufacturing. The 1980s was kind of a last gasp for American manufacturing as globalization was ramping up, but the damage was already done throughout America at that point.\n\nFast forward and we're seeing manufacturing come BACK to the United States. Infrastructure spending is a huge part of the common bear case, under the claim that this will drive inflation in the United States and to be fair, that's probably marginally true. The change in salaries will reduce margins to some extent, but that's also somewhat made up in changes to transportation costs and reduction of supply chain sensitivity, but I'll accept that it's not a perfect offset.\n\nBut you can't have your cake and eat it, too... either manufacturing is part of America's story in this current economic era, or it isn't. \n\nAgain, in real economics, you can't pick and choose... you get both the good and the bad.\n\n(continued...)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

Modern high-risk, speculative tech is very sensitive to interest rates because they tend to be debt factories, but there's plenty of tech that does fine in 5% rates, which are not historically very high at all. How well a company does in that circumstance will depend a lot on their balance sheet and market dynamics, just like any other company.\n\nIn fact, I'm looking at the historical FFR and tech has done very well during 5% FFR ranges, including through the 1990s and the mid-2000s. \n\nAnd while CPI wasn't 5% then (and I agree that this matters) it did commonly trend around 3-4%. We'll come back to that.\n\nThe problem ultimately comes down to the fact that your argument is that the tech market now is more vulnerable than the tech market of the 1990s was, or as vulnerable... and that's not the case. In the 1990s, the tech market was still largely decoupled from actual business tech reality. Darlings like Netscape and Red Hat were upstarts at the time. The biggest excesses then may look a bit like the biggest excesses now, but we're also throwing in significant established names in there, like Microsoft. Tech is just much more heavily embedded in the business cycle now than it was then.\n\nSo contrary to tech being vulnerable to the rusty dagger of 5% FFRs... it's probably more resilient than it was the last 2 times this happened as an overall sector.\n\nAnd the stuff that isn't, like Roblox and Tesla and other speculative stocks tied to tech that's debt sensitive? \n\nA lot of that shit has sold off. Sometimes to the tune of 90%. \n\nThat crash you're calling for? 5% interest rates aren't news now. That crash has already happened... and it can happen again, but you have to then consider the impact to index weighing and how market parity works.\n\nTSLA, for instance, at the end of 2021 was close 7% of the weighting in SPY. \n\nNow? It's 1.64%\n\nThe simple reality is that the index has already largely adapted. All of the stuff you're calling out has lost between 3-6% of its weighting since 2021. The market has de-leveraged, and while some like AAPL remain high on the list, the weights of defensives and other strong cyclicals has increased, reducing the impact of the inflation impact you're citing.\n\nPoint blank, your thesis made sense in 2021 for a correction, it does not make sense in 2023 for a crash because it doesn't take into account how the market works mechanically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Meaning Fed will push towards crushing inflation and bringing it back below 2% even if it means causing recession.\n\nWhat the Fed means when they talk about a recession here is that they're willing to accept unemployment up to 5%, and I agree with them. Much beyond that and their other mandate will kick in.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about the Fed just beating the country into the ground to tame inflation, but it's mostly empty. The Fed is definitely not saying that and JPOW has repeatedly said they'd react if things got out of hand.\n\nAnd this situation is not binary. It's not \"the Fed tightens and the market crashes, or it loosens and the market flies.\"\n\nThe reality is that sitting at 4-5% FFR while the market expands is pretty common, even during high tech periods with elevated inflation up to 4%.\n\nAnd while 2% is a target, 4% is the real number the Fed will accept. They won't reverse the FFR on 4%, but they will stop raising on that number because they will be able to declare victory... probably even before then. That would represent a 150% reduction in inflation and a solid downward trajectory.\n\nAt that the point, the risk of overtightening is way too high and all the market really needs is predictability. I think the larger question is where we end up relating to a terminal FFR at that time... sure, if that terminal FFR is 10%, then you have a real economic problem... but it's not going to be. Hell, the odds of them getting above 6% with current data is really low.\n\nThe idea that the Fed will just relentless crash the market because they're only a few percent away from their inflation goal is a fever dream, full stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n>So lets do modern 1990s- 2010 analysis. High PE of 25 and low of 15 again combined with low inflation of 2% was the perfect recipe for economic boom. But whenever PE went above 30 it was a bubble. So Fed starts hiking again to stop people animal spirits behavior. PE came down to 25 and also inflation headed down. \n\nOK, but let's not leave out that the tech bubble coincided with a major accounting firm scandal that required the creation of major corporate accounting legislation and questioned the entire concept of fundamental valuation and 2008 didn't happen expressly due to Fed tightening but rather due to an overextended housing market where all of the risk was sitting on bank balance sheets. In other words, the exact opposite of the situation we have now.\n\nBasically, trying to tie all of this to Fed tightening is revisionist history at best. Again, we can't just ignore all the other context. \n\n(Continued...

I think we can both agree on this. If market senses war 5yr breakevens will go up and cause bond yields to go up as well. Fed will be forced to do yield curve control if 10yr starts going over 6%.\n\nIf you look at any war rhetoric man. There has been a skyrocketing inflation with sky high yields. The reason being Fed started printing money for wartime financing. This is the only reason inflation goes up. And yah i totally get your point. War causes stock market to go up. But you need to also remember markets usually drop before the start of the war. That means market has to has to drop right now and then when war officially announces we go in the massive bull run that no one will ever imagine.\n\n\nNow lets dissect this bull run of war coz i have my some doubts. Maybe you can help me out. If you look back at history. WW1 and WW2 these two wars had PE range 10-20 and when inflation comes around suppose 10%. You used to subtract high PE - inflation rate. And then it was basically the EPS boost that caused the stock market to go up massively. So now lets put this Peter Lynch theory to test. \n\nScenario 1 : War in 2023 itself. High PE 25 - Inflation rate i.e. 4-5% range. PE will never go above 20. Now you can put your favorite EPS here. Even with 250 you're maxed out at $5000.\n\nScenario 2 : War in 2024. Inflation will be 2-3%. Max PE 22. Lets say EPS grow to 270 which btw is too high. SPX will be maxed out at $5900.\n\n\nI mean is this the bull run you want ?\n\nNow circling back to Biden bringing manufacturing in Usa. You do know right that the Usa has to find workers for that. Thats inflationary and yah ofc it will boost gdp and keep labor market strong. But in all of this youre forgetting one major important detail. \nThe way Usa worked in all of the past decade is because of tech and not manufacturing. Manufacturing is what caused the stock market to go in a massive bull run in Ww1 and Ww2 but this time its tech. Tech thrives on low inflation and interest rates and hence this boosted the stock market to a 14yrs of bull run. Its the top 6 tech companies that has more % weighted to index.  So tech has to go bust when a lot of these companies will have to refinance in 2024 and that would mean the biggest stock market crash in history somewhere around 2023-24. Timing it will be so so hard. No one in this planet is that good.\nAnd after tech goes bust then we can have your favorite bull run of manufacturing. Also don't forget that a lot of these tech workers are actually immigrants who mostly come from Asia. 70% of people in Silicon valley are from rest parts of the world. I mean it would be quite funny if those workers dont protest a/g war and simply just do what they are told.\n\n\nOverall result : I dont know whats going to happen but i can tell you one thing for sure. If we are headed to inflationary world caused by manufacturing coming back home, labor markets strong, gdp strong and war then my friend youre asking for a tech bubble to pop somewhere in 2023-24. Nasdaq and S&P500 will go down. I cannot say the same about Dow Jones coz its industrial average. Housing will not pop coz inflation will remain higher. Metals, Energy and Oil will go higher as well.
