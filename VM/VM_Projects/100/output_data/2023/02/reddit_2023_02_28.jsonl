{"title": "TSLA plant in Monterrey, Mexico confirmed", "selftext": "Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.\n\nThis investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.\n\nWe don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's \"Investor Day,\" where he'll outline his \"Master Plan Part Three.\"  (source: [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexican-president-says-tesla-build-143052963.html))\n\nNot sure whether to buy calls or puts on Musk?

Toyota is already changing their strategy and working with suppliers to get more competitive with Tesla in the next 3 years (though not in sales volume).\n\nThe \"exponential adoption curve\" will happen when the traditional automakers really scale up production because that's when you'll see the Honda families and the Toyota familes etc start swapping to EVs because that is when they'll have more confidence in the product and the infrastructure.  There are lots of varying projections, but generally speaking EV is not expected to surpass ICE sales until around 2030.  In 2030 I would bet Toyota is still a bit behind the production curve (they previously announced their goal of building **3.5 million battery-only vehicles per year by 2030**, but have since talked about revising that plan so I am gussing they'll build fewer), but they will become a more dominant player soon after and given their history they will do it well and the market will reward them just like they have for ICE vehicles.\n\nTesla/BYD/SAIC will dominate for now.  Other earlier movers (like VW and Volvo and Hyundai) will start expanding sales in the mid-late 2020s but face increasing competitive pressures, and the big war will be in the early 2030s.

The price at which the underlying security can be bought or sold is referred to as the exercise price or strike price. An American warrant can be exercised at any time on or before the expiration date, while European warrants can only be exercised on the expiration date. Warrants that give the right to buy a security are known as call warrants; those that give the right to sell a security are known as put warrants.  \n\nDebt Security: A debt security is a debt instrument that can be bought or sold between two parties and has basic terms defined, such as the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and maturity and renewal date.\n\nPurchase Contract: A sales and purchase agreement (SPA) is a binding legal contract between two parties that obligates a transaction to occur between a buyer and seller.
