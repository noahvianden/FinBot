Certain ETFs, like VOO, are very low risk if you just dollar cost average over time, but every single company is risky unless you have a very good understanding of the business, products, leadership, financials, etc. You could buy the best stock in the world and still lose money on it because you didn't understand it and bought and/or sold it at a bad time.\n\nThat said, it doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in single stocks. We as retail investors have a huge advantage over institutions and money managers because we don't lose clients or targets if we underperform the market in the short term. For example, being 100% TSLA would've been a disaster for any money manager a whole bunch of times in the last 4 years, while as a retail investor you could've just held through it all and be up 10x vs the S&P's 1.5x.

You will unquestionably lose money on some (or all) of them along the way, but if you enjoy it and you're willing to do the work, it'll be a huge positive in your life in the long run.

On average, stock pickers don't outperform the market, but on average stock pickers don't do anywhere near enough research before they buy a stock.\n\nI'd wager if you did some serious research into the performance of people that pick stocks and really do the work, spending hundreds of hours researching the companies they buy and not buying 10+ different companies they barely know the basics of, you'd find that they on average do outperform the market.\n\nUnfortunately, this research has never been done, and every statistic instead includes people that are just randomly buying stocks. It's like saying \"90% of people fail at New Year's resolutions\", which is probably true, but of that 90% the vast majority probably didn't really try in the first place.\n\nIt's also worthwhile to consider how ridiculous it is to expect you can just start investing and outperform the market out of the gate. Nobody expects you to start playing basketball and compete in the NBA two years later. Like you said, it takes time to become good at something, but you won't become good at investing by just dollar cost averaging into index funds.\n\nAnd even if 90% of serious investors would underperform the market, which I very much doubt, that doesn't mean you shouldn't aspire to be that 10%. We don't tell kids \"you shouldn't be playing so much basketball, only 0.1% makes it to the NBA\". If you enjoy something and you want to become good at it, go for it. Especially if it's something that can make you as successful as investing and where you can earn money even if you underperform the market.\n\n> \"Fun\" isn't a convincing metric when investing to make money long term in the stock market, especially as OP is 16.\n\nI definitely think it is. If you can have fun while making money, even if you're underperforming the market, that's arguably an even bigger positive than investing in index funds and having no fun doing so. Especially considering how you're more likely to save money when you're enjoying investing.

One chapter that really stood out to me tells the story of a legendary art collector who made a fortune by buying lots and lots of art, including works by the likes of Picasso and Pollock.\n\n\rLink to book here: [https://amzn.to/3DITcRO](https://amzn.to/3DITcRO)\n\n\r  \nAt the end of his life, he sold his collection to the German government for $100m - a price that was seen as an incredible deal. People looked at the collection and wondered how one man could have possibly known 60 years ago that some of these artists would become enormous names. \n\nThe truth is, his tactic was simple: he bought lots and lots of art and just waited to see which pieces would be the biggest.\r  \n\r  \nThe same idea applies to stocks. Even if most of the stocks you buy don't perform that well, if just a few takeoffs, you'll be in a great position. \n\nAnd that's the beauty of the stock market - it's not just about capitalism, it's about how the world, and how nature works.

Broad based but more tech focused than VOO. Maybe slightly more risk but more upside too.\n3) Sector based ETFs like XLF for financials or XLI for industrials.
