If one could time the market, then yeah, it would be the best strategy possible. But since no one can, trying to do so will hurt your wealth. Thats why i talk against it.\n\nIm leaving retirement out of this equation because its irrelevant to my point. On the very specific occasion that one is on the point of retirement, he can either sell stocks to cover his expenses or turnover to assets that generate predictable income, such as fixed income or dividend stocks/etfs. That has nothing to do with \"sell something that went up by 50%\" though, thats two very diffferent matters and i never mentioned retirement before.\n\n>\u201cSelling when you\u2019ve made money\u201d is not necessarily the same thing as \u201ctiming the market.\u201d Timing the market is the idea that you\u2019ll get in/out of the same stock based on timing.\n\nWhat youre advocating is timing the market. It just seems youre embarassed to call it that because deep down you probably know its dumb. When you sell something just because it went up 100% youre timing the market predicting that it wont go further up, otherwise if you knew it would go up you wouldnt sell it.\n\n>The idea that we must always do the things that always 100% maximize potential profit no matter what and any other move is a poor one is one that we need to reevaluate.\n\nI agree. Mathematically that would be timing the market if you could successfully time the market. But since you cant, realistically the move that maximizes potential profit is staying invested, because then you dont miss the best days.\n\nTiming the market is something influencers sell, brokerages sell and the governament benefits from because you generate taxes. They all win, the only loser on timing the market is the investor doing it. Statistically. Thats why there are so many naive investors that think that its a strategy that should be pursued. They were led to think so by people that benefit from them trying.\n\n>Different people and their positions require nuance, and conservative moves are as valid as risky moves as long as they\u2019re done thoughtfully.\n\nGenerally speaking yes. But when the matter is timing the market, literally no one should do it. And no one can come up with a good and realistic example where timing the market is a good thing to do.\n\nPeople on retirement shouldnt time the market, they just switch from a growth oriented portfolio to a income generating portfolio. But it doesnt matter if their portfolio went up by 50% or down by 50%, they switch to income because they will need it, not because \"its the smart move to sell whats ahead on profit\".", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5320452451705933}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5254736542701721}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6080449223518372}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6375250816345215}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5255980491638184}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4891331195831299}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02943495102226734}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.008419021032750607}, {"body": "I would set stop orders in at a 10% price drop for each stock, to lock in most of the profits.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Here\u2019s been my problem.
