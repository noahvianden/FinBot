Here is a copy and paste straight from their investor relations page from their Q4 earnings.\n\n\u201cEffective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, Intel expects total depreciation expense in 2023 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion, including an approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses and a $1.2 billion decrease in 2023 ending inventory values. Intel\u2019s Q1 2023 outlook includes an estimated $350 million to $500 million benefit to operating margin or $0.07 to $0.10 benefit to EPS from this change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to operating expenses. The change in depreciable life will not be counted toward the $3 billion in cost savings in 2023 or the $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025 communicated at Q3 2022 earnings.\u201d  \n \nKeep in mind this is perfectly legal but omg does this not look complete sus or what. Their revenue and income is getting torn to shreds so they jack up the value of their machinery and equipment by saying it has a longer life span to make it look like their assets are worth more then they really are.

{"title": "The three-legged pick-and-shovel play REC Silicon", "selftext": "**Elevator pitch**\n\n* REC   Silicon is a leader in silane-based, high-purity silicon materials. In   fact, REC is the only large-scale producer of silane gas in U.S. and   Europe.\n* Two   highly strategic assets (Moses Lake, Washington and Butte, Montana) in   rapidly expanding industries (megatrends) that should benefit from   lasting political tailwinds and strong profitability outlook. The   industries being solar, semiconductors and batteries (Thus, the   three-legged reference).\n* Hydropower-based clean energy and low carbon footprint.\n* 15% ownership share of a polysilicon plant in Yulin, China.\n* Listed on the Norwegian stock exchange with ticker RECSI. Included in the OBX index which holds the 25 most liquid companies.\n* Unknown   to most U.S. retail investors, most likely because it is a Norwegian   company. Workforce are U.S. based, including management and of course   the assets.\n* Broke   their neck with the U.S. and China trade wars and their Moses Lake   plant, valued at 1.7 billion USD, had to shut down. And this is where it   gets interesting, because things have changed. The plant is now   scheduled for a restart second half this year, 2023! **So, what happened?**\n\n**Six big things happened.**\n\n1. The   world has changed, caused by geopolitical tension, and disruption in   supply chains, such as semiconductors and solar, poses a risk to   national security. More and more protectionism are introduced in both   the U.S. and Europe, and we are witnessing the importance of domestic   manufacturing and supply chains.\n2. The   Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in 2022, resulting  in  REC Silicon receiving a credit of $3 per kg polysilicon produced -   approximately 50 mUSD per year.\n3. The   Chips and Science got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of this   bill we see a huge boost in the American semiconductor industry. REC   Silicon\\`s facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by the White House   as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of silane gas  production  ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).\n4. Senate   Bill 5849 by Judy Warnick, Moses Lake. Extending a targeted 43%   business and occupation tax cut for manufacturers of solar panels and   components another five years past the original expiration date of 2027   to 2032. In addition, the bill would allow for the construction or   improvement of existing industrial buildings.\n5. Hanwha   Group, more specific Hanwha Solutions and Hanwha Corporation, recently   became the biggest shareholders in REC Silicon, now controlling 33%.   Hanwha Q CELLS, another company under the Hanwha umbrella, is one of the   world's largest and most recognized manufacturers for its  high-quality,  high efficiency solar cells and modules. Q CELLS recently  announced the  largest investment of its kind in U.S. history, and will  invest  billions in Georgia to create a complete solar supply chain in  the  United States. Hanwha's stake in REC Silicon marks the re-birth of  U.S.  polysilicon.\n6. Silicon   anodes for better batteries are materializing. It has been the talk  the  last couple of years, but finally, it is happening. It is safe to  say  that this creates an even more solid foundation for the company. As  the  former CEO once said ***They (the battery makers) have to come to us, or go to China.***   And to directly reference their website; REC Silicon\u2019s silane is the   material of choice for lithium-ion batteries - and REC is a global   leader in silane-based materials.\n\n**EV/Batteries**\n\nWith  REC Silicon holding this highly strategic position in the supply chain,   prominent players are setting up shop in Moses Lake, Washington. In  fact, right next door, and are becoming neighbours (See image posted   below).\n\nThere is not a whole lot   official information from the company about this situation, yet. We   believe it is just a matter of time before more information are made   available and public. Below is a curated list of what we know this far.\n\n* October 2020 - Group14 & REC Silicon announced they are teaming up to meet demand for the \"Electrification of Everything\" ([https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything](https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything)).\n* December   2022 - Group14 submits an application for the construction of a  factory in Moses Lake.

Wafers are made into solar cells, and then  solar  panels. By using Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology, using  one-tenth  of the electricity needed for Siemens technology, affords  low-cost  material and ultra-low carbon footprint, making its solar  module value  chain more sustainable. FBR is the patented technology of  the company,  and makes it possible produce solar-grade polysilicon in a  continuous,  rather than a batch, process. This makes REC Silicon one  of the most  efficient producers of solar-grade silicon in the world,  and their  product is some of the least expensive silicon available for  solar  panels.\n\nUsing  hydropower-based  clean energy, REC Silicon produces low-carbon  polysilicon without  emitting greenhouse gases. Compared to carbon-heavy  polysilicon  manufactured overseas that often relies on coal power, REC  Silicon's  \u201cclean polysilicon\u201d is expected to draw more demand in the  coming years  as international scrutiny over industrial emissions and  carbon  footprints grows.\n\nA quick  recap.  REC Silicon's biggest plant shut down in 2019. Without access to  Chinese  market, their lifeline got cut off. There was no solar module  value  chain outside of China. Now, almost four years later, things are  looking  brighter. Solar module value chains are forming in both the  U.S. and  Europe. REC Silicon is teaming up with Hanwha Q CELLS, for  delivery of  solar grade polysilicon. As of this writing, they have  ongoing  negotiations with Hanwha Solutions towards reaching an offtake  agreement  for all FBR polysilicon production ([https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake](https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake)).   With Hanwha Q CELLS being one of the most trusted names, and ambitious   companies in the solar industry, this is of course promising.\n\nEver   since Hanwha became the largest shareholder, they have been promoting   REC Silicon as a vital part of their bigger plan. The importance of  this  newborn partnership is certainly no secret to Hanwha, and this is   highlighted by the statements below.\n\n>*This   year, Hanwha also acquired REC Silicon, a crucial step along the   company\u2019s path to building out a full solar value chain, and expanded   its plans for its green energy businesses in the U.S. thanks to the   incentives in the groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act.*([https://www.hanwha.com/en/news\\_and\\_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/news_and_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----)*By   investing in REC Silicon, with US plants that produce special gas for   semiconductor as well as polysilicon, we are expanding our business  into  high value\u2013added core industrial materials.* ([https://www.hanwha.com/en/products\\_and\\_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/products_and_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----)*By   becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, Hanwha will expand  its  renewable energy portfolio in the U.S. and help American businesses   secure raw material critical to the solar supply chain. As global   competition over clean energy sources intensifies in the coming years,   Hanwha will work towards establishing a highly efficient, low-carbon   system to boost clean energy technology.*\\-----*Hanwha   Solutions\u2019 strategic investment in REC Silicon represents a step   towards establishing a highly efficient, low carbon solar value chain in   the US and to ensure that REC Silicon plays an integral role in these   efforts. Hanwha Solutions\u2019 knowledge, expertise, and capabilities are   expected to enhance REC Silicon\u2019s ability to take advantage of   opportunities and developing markets in the solar, semiconductor, and   battery industries.* ([https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html)).\n\nLets end this solar section with a statement from Joe Biden, on the Hanwha Q CELLS investment decision ([https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/)).\n\n**Semiconductors**\n\nREC   Silicon\\`s electronic grade certified polysilicon businesses provide a   variety of form factors for uses in high-tech energy and electronics   industries. From motor control and power conversion processes for hybrid   and electric vehicles, wind energy, and high voltage transmission, 5G   communications, high-speed trains, IoT (internet of things), and big   data to manufacturing of 12\u2019 semiconductor wafers used in memory   processors, optics, and micro electromechanical systems (MEMS).\n\nThe   Chips and Science got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of this   bill we are expecting to see a huge boost in the American semiconductor   industry. REC Silicon's facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by   the White House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of  silane gas production ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).\n\nWhile   the company is not set to benefit directly from this specific Chips  and  Science act (unlike the IRA),  this will nevertheless create  conditions  that are intended to boost demand for REC's electronic-grade  silicon.  The Chips and Science Act is intended to expand domestic  production of  semiconductor chips, which are made out of  electronic-grade silicon that  the company produces at its facility in  Butte, Montana.\n\n**Stock price and valuation**\n\n**Ticker  RECSI**, Norwegian Stock Exchange. Included in the OBX index which holds   the 25 most liquid companies. Heavily traded and volatile. A  significant  number of retail investors owns this stock in Norway. They  have  recognized the seemingly limited downside, and huge upside. REC   Silicon\\`s foundation is stronger then ever due to recent developments in   both the political and the industrial landscape. We are slowly   identifying larger investors taking place. But the stock will continue   to be volatile and manipulated by strong traders. We have never seen   treeshakes like this, and there is a great deal of psychology in play.   But we expect the float to change when contracts are signed, and we also   expect the stock to reprice significantly.\n\n* As of this writing the stock price is NOK 14 (1.4 USD), which values the company at 586 mUSD\n* Assuming 100% capacity we are looking at an annual EBITDA range of 200-400 mUSD by 2025.\n* Moses Lake plant valued at 1.7 billion USD about to restart (valued at 0 in the company's accounts due to amortization)\n* For   a business with strategic products for the U.S. solar industry and the   lithium-ion battery markets, and the know-how and experience to  consider  avenues for deeper expansion into these rapidly growing  industries, we  believe REC could have potential to command much higher  EBITDA multiples  then what the current market valuation implies at the  time of this  writing (<3x EV/EBITDA)\n* Under   the new IRA law, REC Silicon will be eligible for a $3-per-kilogram   refundable tax credit for every kilogram of solar-grade silicon the   company sells. This will have a favorable impact of $48 million per year   at full production.\n* Potential to command a very large premium on selling silane gas to anode producers.\n* REC   is uniquely positioned with two highly strategic assets in rapidly   expanding industries that should benefit from lasting political   tailwinds, strong profitability outlook and attractive funding   opportunities\n* Needless   to say, there is upside potential for this stock. Recent investment   behaviour of several anode producers are clearly indicating that a blue   sky scenario is about to materialize for REC Silicon's. In this   scenario, Norwegian brokers have indicated a fair value of NOK 50-70   (5-7 USD).\n\n**Potential short term triggers**\n\n* Signed contract with Hanwha for delivery of solar-grade polysilicon\n* Signed contracts with anode and battery producers\n* Project Riser (More on this later)\n* Yulin IPO China (REC Silicons's 15% valued at around 180 mUSD)\n* Grant   from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the development of a   supply chain for next generation batteries (REC has been recognized by   the White House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of   silane gas production). And REC has the past two years been a   participant in several meetings with the DOE for securing solar and   batteries in the U.S.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My position](https://preview.redd.it/elpflev4zkfa1.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=1722e7b37b70a2e27bc749f8ce75503b7bf9e4b2)\n\nThanks for reading - happy, profitable investing!", "id": "10qv0dt", "created_utc": 1675258925.0, "score": 306, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Currently up 32% as we speak.
