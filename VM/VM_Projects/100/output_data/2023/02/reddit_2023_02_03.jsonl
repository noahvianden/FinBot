{"title": "The most important skill you could have for trading options.", "selftext": "Feel free to add on or argue against my point here, but I've noticed a lot of tutorials on YouTube failing to include the importance of macro and micro economics with options trading. This post is really for people new to trading options, but if you don't understand how the overall economy works (macro) or how business' themselves work (micro), don't expect to get far in trading options.\n\nThere's a lot of great resources online to learn both macro and micro economics and would highly encourage anyone learning options to learn both first. Macro for example, is great for trading options on SPY, QQQ or IWM. Macro gives you an understanding of what the fed does, what inflation is, what fed rates do and how currency is removed from supply. Micro is a great for individual companies like Microsoft, Apple or smaller cap stocks however, truth be said, macro economics impacts prices more than variables associated with micro economics.\n\nI'm not sure what options traders start with if they don't understand either macro or micro, but if it's historical trend, that won't do much for you. There's limited value with statistics and forecasting unless you're buying and holding stock for several years. However, related to options, as a whole it is fairly limited because yesterday's variables impacting the market aren't always going to be today's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR:\n\nA lot of tutorials online disregard the importance of macro and micro economics. The variables impacting today's stock prices are things like inflation, how the fed handles it with rates and how supply and demand works. By understanding the basics of macro and micro economics, you'll be better equipped to forecast how markets move and why. Even though economics and options are completely separate, the fundamentals of economics are what impact on today's stock prices the most which in turn, also impact option prices. \n\nEdit:\n\n# I need to clarify a few things.\n\n1) I'm suggesting to learn the basics of both macro and micro economics. Things like inflation (CPI), fed rates and supply and demand. Not get an degree in economics. Macro and micro economics are typically year one classes for Finance and Econ majors for many US colleges. However, resources online are typically free and available to the public. \n\n2) **I'm not saying that you need to know economics in order to do options at all. I'm not saying that options is economics or economics is options.** I'm baffled that some people here think that this is what I'm saying. All I'm saying is that a basic understanding of things like inflation, fed rates, supply and demand, liquidity and so forth are all valuable tools to have in trading options. CPI, fed rates are some of (if not the greatest) variables impacting stock prices today which in turn, impact option prices.\n\n*Here's one example why understanding macro-economics is important:*\n\nImagine you see a options position on MSFT that you find to be a great play. Everything on the option side of things points to getting a large return and you buy a handful of calls on it. CPI is being announced the same day you purchase calls and you don't know what CPI is, what it's likely to look like or how it will impact prices--completely in the dark. If the data released is poor, the value of your calls can diminish significantly despite what options data originally said. You'll be completely blind sided by volatility and nothing on the options side of things will help you see it either.\n\n*Truth be said: I find it incredibly difficult to believe we have people here that are successful options traders that couldn't tell you what CPI means or what supply and demand is.*", "id": "10sq19d", "created_utc": 1675445535.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Reasons are irrelevant in the stock market.

I'm probably in the minority here but to be a successful trader trading options, you don't need to know the reasons why a stock is moving up or down.

The ecommercd has been hollowed out and turned into an advertising hellscape.\n\nThat's just not true. Amazon's main focus remains on e-commerce, and divisions such as Alexa prove that point. They make no money, but they are extremely valuable in the acquisition of customer's data that can be used to personalise the user's experience on their platform and boost sales.\n\nThe fact that Amazon's e-commerce has become an advertising hellscape is simply not a fact. Product selection is massive and keeps growing, sales keep growing, 3rd party sellers on the platform keep growing, advertising revenue keeps growing, and Amazon's ad conversion rate is at the level of the top dogs in the digital ad industry, if not higher.\n\nAmazon.com is close to the top 10 of the world's most visited websites, and their apps are highly rated on both the App Store and the Play Store. I simply fail to see what you describe as \"This phase is degradation and decline.

Amazon's e-commerce generates hundreds of billions worth of sales every year, the actual impact of such issues on the overall business is abysmal. You can in fact get a perspective of the size of the issues by simply looking at the related stats.\n\nIt is understandable that declines in stock price make people question companies and their operations, but this is not an average company.

And a hundred more revolutionary steps that young people today don't realize were novel.  \n\nI can't think of anything innovative Amazon has done in the last 10 years.

This is \"the intention to kill or harm, which is held to distinguish unlawful killing from murder\". Unless you think that his actions were specifically made with the intent to cause death/harm, and death/harm was not merely a side-effect of the intended aim, this is by definition not murder.
