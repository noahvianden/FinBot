A trader who seemingly does okay, or thinks they know what they are doing, but they lose money consistently.  It usually boils down to one of two things, or maybe a little bit of column A and a little of column B.\n\nThe first is usually an inability to adapt to a changing market/a poor market read.  In other words, you are using bearish or bullish strategies when the market doesn't call for it.  2020-early 2022 caused a lot of bad habits for a lot of people.  They were taught that buying the dip and holding on for the moon was the way.  If they employed a different strategy such as selling puts on stocks they wanted to own, the puts either expired worthless or they were assigned for a short duration until they sold their position at a usually much higher value later on.  The latter part of 2021 and early 2022 saw a fundamental market shift.  Interest rates began increasing and quantitative tightening went into full force, the job market was coming back to somewhat normalcy, and people had less cash on hand, because well, they had spent it all.  This led to a big shift in the markets because speculative plays HATE high interest rates.  Tech usually gets hammered, the market makers want nothing to do with anything spec related that hasn't proven itself over difficult economic times, and the sell offs begin.  Early signs of the writing on the wall began in the summer of 2021.  I saw it happen in real time but was too stupid to take advantage of the obvious signs of a bear market encroaching.  The small cap market was all but knee-capped.  Any pre-market news gapper was killed within about half an hour of the opening as the big money unwound their positions.  Big tech stagnated and started selling off, and so did anything relating to consumer goods.  That was kind of our first early warning signs that something was amiss.  At any rate, utilizing a bullish strategy on these stocks still seemed smart.  You were buying the very obvious dip and it was nothing but a bear trap, right?  2020 and 2021 taught us this.  Then you had a bunch of market juggernauts that were down 30-40-50-60% and it seemed like blood was in the streets and people were tripping over themselves, in massively red positions, capitulating one after the other taking fat losses.  However, those who had adapted to more bearish aligned strategies started to see these hedged positions turning more and more green and they were able to adapt to this and start profiting.\n\nThe second aspect is loosely tied to point 1, but it is still different.  Most people I have seen give up and throw in the towel have a really poor read of technical analysis.  You can wave your hand over it and say it is \"stock market astrology\" all you want, but the fact of the matter is we need some sort of TA in order to understand WHEN it is a good time to put our money on the line.  You can read all the fundamentals in the world, but if the market doesn't give two shits about the P/E ratio or whatever because it is getting massacred (see point 1), a stock can be trading below book in a destroyed sector, that won't change the fact that at that moment in time, you are probably going to lose money trying to find an entry.  Now I am not saying that it is as simple as just waiting for the MACD to turn green or the Stochastics to go oversold and you have your one way ticket to free money for the rest of your life, either.  You need to have some sort of system that means you are seeing some semblance of profit more than chance when some sort of TA thing happens.  Realistically, the stock market is 50/50 it either goes up or goes down.  The problem is, most traders have a really poor grasp of 1 and 2 and always enter at inopportune times.  Lastly, and this is tied to both of these, there are a lot of people (and I point the finger mainly at TastyTrade here) that have spoon fed newbies dogshit theories for so long that they can do it without even blinking anymore.  There is absolutely a time that you should sell high inflated IV.  When the market or stock is taking a belly flop off of a high rise or on a mission to Mars going straight up are NOT the times to do that.  They gloss over the fact that high IV does not automatically equal instant profits yet they frequently (or at least it is parroted here and in other options subs frequently) is that IV is often overstated so you want to be a seller at those points.  Yeah, cool.  Makes sense.  But IV increases during trends a lot of the times.  Why do you want to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller selling 45-60 DTE strangles or whatever it is when the stock is ripping in one direction?  This ties into that retail traders generally have a really poor grasp of TA.  If they could identify when it was likely that a trend was done, but IV is still high, then it is a good idea to begin writing a neutrality strategy.\n\nI know this is really long winded, and I am definitely going to catch some heat for this.  However, in my view, these are similar complaints I see repeated continually across many trading boards and it usually boils down to one of these two main issues.  The third is risk management, but that is on you to decide.

Volume is also another example of leading indicator since volume will tend to give hints before a price move that a large move or false move is coming.\n\nThe key is though that while price is leading, price gives false signals all the time.  We are not up against people, but computers and algorithms that can make buying and selling decisions based on computations in fractions of a second.  I would suggest going back over the daily chart of a handful of stocks and pick out a basic pattern, like a bullish or bearish hammer, a breakout, a cup and handle, whatever you want.  Keep track of how often those lead to a significant price move.  Then add even a basic moving average, like a 20 or 50 period SMA, then count again. See how many bad signals are filtered out and compare to how many times it got you in late.

I pulled back on all these intricate complicated (and even what may seem simplistic) options in general.\n\nNow: I DCA directly into 100% $SPY --> Each time I hit 100 shares I sell a \\[>/=31 </=46\\] day COVERED CALL <0.10 DELTA (\\*\\*EDITED TO CORRECT DELTA\\*\\*). \\*\\*If\\*\\* it is getting close to my strike on the off chance that $SPY just rolled for half a month, I will roll it another month+ out.

I've utilized about 5 different brokerage apps/companies/websites and being able to do this in about 30 seconds is a lifesaver for my sanity. Usually when you roll it out, your DELTA will be a bit lower, be aware. You could technically go out months in advanced but it's diminishing returns. The chances of getting shares called away is practically nill to me, esp when you consider just how high it would need to go in the span of a month, few months, a year, etc.\n\nUpon receiving that initial credit (even on the rolled options), I IMMEDIATELY purchase that dollar amount in fractional $SPY shares.

It's easy to move +4% in a couple days due to this. I would rather just take a chunk of easy premium, buy more shares and move on with my life.\n\nYou could also utilize margin to do CASH SECURED PUTS, far out and really low strikes (high DELTA). Another way you could stack fairly simplistic credit to roll into more shares. just have to watch out for this because market could fall out, you never know. You also need access to significant amount of margin due to the way margin maintenance is calculated on options. For something like a month out on $SPY around strike of $350, you would need approx $69000 in margin for a single $SPY CSP. Can also do them on something like $AAPL or $INTC or something high volume.

Anecdotal, but when I first got a Tesla the comments I got were generally positive and pretty pro-Elon. Now people ask me if I am embarrassed to drive one. I'm not, I don't tie products to their CEOs that much, but it's a noticeable shift in sentiment. \n\nPlus, if the reports out of Twitter are to be believed it also seems that this obsession with having a following is taking up more and more of his energy and time. If Ford had bought Twitter he'd have forced them to promote his cars, or maybe his Nazi bullshit, not him personally. \n\nIt's one thing to be ruthless and driven because you want power and wealth, it's another to do it because you want people to like you. The former, morality aside, can lead to impressive results, but I fear Elon is much more the latter.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2719816565513611}, {"body": "When I hear people criticize Elon for his ego.

It appears rumors might well be true and the Crap has begun to hit the fan. Apparently, In a twist of irony, the govt of Wuhan (where covid started) announced that they would have to make cuts to people's medical benefits (I.E. their equivalent of Medicare) and it has sparked mass protests outside govt buildings.

The shortfall in coverage will be made up from the younger generation now having to take their earnings and support their elderly parents and grandparents.\n\n4. That means all those young people working will not be consuming and adding to the economy and that will spell trouble for the likes to BABA, NIO, PDD, EEM, ASHR just to name a few.\n\n5. Chinese are very protective and respectful of their elders and they will not be able to watch their elders suffer so they will have to pony up the cash to support them.\n\n6. The hospital system in China is a \u201ccash\u201d system you either have the funds or you don\u2019t, the \u201chealth insurance system\u201d exists but it doesn\u2019t even factor in that\u2019s how small it is. If you don\u2019t have the cash to pay for your needs you go to the back of the line even if your hand is severed from your wrist (which I have seen in person). This means when these elderly go to the hospital and they are short on funds there is only one other source they can rely on and it will be young family.\n\n7. There likely won\u2019t be any real heavy coverage on this subject as the China govt will not want to lose face but the point I am making is at a certain point the consumption the west is expecting from the young workers WILL NOT be there as they will be pre-occupied with keeping their mom and dad alive.\n\n8. On a personal experience with an emergency health issue in China, back in 2005 I had appendicitis and an appendix that was about to burst, I went to the hospital and they took me in but as I am in the emergency room the admin ppl are swiping all my credit cards running back and forth from the examination room to the cashier making me sign all the receipts, all while I\u2019m being examined to make sure I was paid up before they sent me up to the operating room. \n\n9. I am not talking down on the system in China it's just the way the system works, sometimes good sometimes bad. Good being when I first sprained my ankle in China I thought my X-ray would cost a fortune (like in the U.S.) and it only cost $5 USD I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n10.

Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6y13euelymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c51ed1329cf8ea94bf526533d1663a16d3302322\n\nNow add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srxx5orlymia1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d2cd4793bedaaa77268f357070d2f669aabb309\n\nSomething I don\u2019t talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it\u2026 SPY rallied too\u2026 those two should not really be doing that at all.. \n\nNow something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. \n\nWe might finally be seeing\u2026 that market reaction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5xzmx6mymia1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50dec319d1cf5d32e7ac692998eee064a9e83a7\n\nNow here is something very interesting to think about\u2026 We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the \u201cend\u201d however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eabedxkmymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=631eef7cb1ecd0e3ccf1faca504758c4a467de81\n\nTaking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn\u2019t even in question. \n\nSo the question now remains\u2026 did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wjcqp88nymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eca618b6b5a7b76b5218472d9e47e902856029c\n\nNow we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different\u2026 we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. \n\nNow this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. \n\nThe biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. \n\n405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. \n\nKey SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8\n\nKey SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nypazjonymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1be014358f3a4f1f3295e827d3cb5e3edadefd8f\n\nFutures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. \n\nFutures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. \n\nWhat I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. \n\nThe big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. \n\nKey Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 \n\nKey Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zb0ddw3oymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=eacc4f3b17dcd54b78f95a7b89a781a5baa87a2e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q803ihoymia1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf0380293fe62b36ae4bd3fa5eee60c0a506c37c\n\nTesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. \n\nWe have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. \n\nTesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not\u2026\n\nHowever, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6\n\nKey Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgkubrppymia1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dafa978eb3a1ebe0137a5d556e992042dbfe80d\n\nThe VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today\u2026 this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). \n\nThis is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/femcobhqymia1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc57423fd47172dd87e74c820dbb5a5f55ec0491\n\nWith the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. \n\nInterestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c41n14yqymia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5bc53bd91ab8129387e714acf3fa119b120ceb5\n\nOne kind of interesting data point for tomorrow is the fact that the put call ratio is 2.72 for tomorrow\u2026 that is about the highest PC I have seen in weeks on SPY. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a bigger dump tomorrow and we could even end up with a bigger EOD rally too with all that put OI coming off the books\u2026 \n\nTomorrow could be one extremely volatile day\u2026\n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6acnzhrymia1.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&s=040f6df43b205c01b32d0e73a1eb6f73c887c2f8\n\nAfter a pretty crappy three days of trading this week I was very happy to close out a green day\u2026 sure its not a huge green day and sure its still a red week but going 3 for 4 today was a good day for me.
