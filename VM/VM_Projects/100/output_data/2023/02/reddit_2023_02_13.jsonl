A small vehicle cast as a single piece may not require much in the way of batteries to get the desired range, making the range penalty for the extra weight less of a concern than the manufacturing efficiencies gained.\n2. The thermals and the reliability of the 4680's may be so good (especially as we look forward a couple of years... see the Limiting Factor videos discussing the thermal characteristics of the 4680's to better understand what I am talking about here) that perhaps you can cast the pan the batteries go in in a single piece and use very thin-walled 4680's reducing the excess weight involved.\n3. Consider also size of the vehicle may dictate that you need more and more structure to stabilize things so a small vehicle the mechanics involved might mean that there is not much of a weight penalty doing it this way.\n4. Safety wise, I would think you would cast the pan part facing downwards and then have a robot flip over the whole structure and you insert the batteries that way before flipping over to complete the build.\n5. if the whole bottom part is a single structure and is sufficiently stiff enough (with a small frame this may be possible) you may be able to build up much of the interior of the car before attaching the top part of the frame and panels enabling further manufacturing efficiencies. If this is going to be for a robo-taxi, no one will care if such a process results in larger panel gaps.\n\nUltimately I would suggest you were thinking about this from an analogous way of thinking (i.e. on battery day we were told structural packs are the future so an independent structure must therefore be assumed to be bad) then from a first principles way of thinking which says to heck with the rule we just made up a few years ago as maybe it is wrong (or at least wrong in this instance).\n\nIt is possible also that you are correct, but I am speculating that there are a lot more possibilities here where choosing the correct development path (this is where Elon makes a world of a difference as compared to pretty much everyone else) may be the difference between having the most successful vehicle in history versus wasting years on the wrong thing.\n\nPersonally I am excited for March 1rst as Tesla never fails to disappoint (at least never fails to disappoint me) in their new product announcements.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Whether or not the car is smaller, we're still talking about a 5-7 foot gap inbetween the front and rear wheel wells (between the current castings)\n\nThey already cast the front wheel well casting and the rear wheel well casting\n\nYou think making a giant 3.5x longer 20,000 ton machine instead of two 6,000 ton  machines to make one giant piece with 6 foot aluminum bars between them is going to be more economical/efficient?\n\nFirst principles thinking isn't \"draw a line from 180 parts to 2, continue the line, we arrive at 1!\" it is evaluating what makes sense from scratch without making assumptions based on what we've already seen.\n\nWhat we've already seen is reduction of parts and consolidation into large castings.\n\nContinuing down that line as far as you can go to the point of parody is not first principles thinking, that is the opposite.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Guess we will find out.", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.04676352068781853}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4534667730331421}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20842358469963074}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "\"C\",\"A\",\"R\" should also be possible.

Finally: single piece casting for S3XY + CT + Gen3\n\nAll of which will require another magnitude order improvement in material science for the alloy necessary to print these castings *and* likely a gigaton press that sits in the range of 11-12,000 tons force.
