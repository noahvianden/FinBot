He issued his grim outlook for US growth stocks during a fourth-quarter earnings call on Friday, according to a transcript provided by Sentieo/AlphaSense.\n\nThe value investor said on the call that his company's stock holdings remain deeply undervalued, but he expects that to change. He noted that Fairfax's portfolio doubled in value between 2000 and 2002, while the major US stock indices roughly halved during that period.\n\nThe value investor also pointed out that despite the market's rally this year, Big Tech stocks like Amazon and Tesla are still down sharply from their peaks in 2021. Moreover, their smaller peers like Zoom and Shopify have regained even less ground.\n\n\"If history is any guide, there's more to come,\" Watsa said. \"I will note for you that the Nasdaq dropped 50% in 2000 and then dropped another 50% in the next 2 years.\"\n\nFairfax and Berkshire have several key holdings in common, including Bank of America, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum. Watsa also shares Buffett's love of highly concentrated bets: seven stocks including Blackberry accounted for nearly 90% of Fairfax's $4 billion portfolio at the end of December.\n\nSource:[https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/the-canadian-warren-buffett-warns-tech-stocks-are-more-overvalued-than-during-the-dot/em7tv92](https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/the-canadian-warren-buffett-warns-tech-stocks-are-more-overvalued-than-during-the-dot/em7tv92)\n\nThe 'Canadian Warren Buffett,\u2019 Prem Watsa, warns tech stocks are more overvalued than during the dot-com bubble - and predicts a painful selloff.\n\nIs he right?", "id": "118846m", "created_utc": 1676996266.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Yes, there is a risk that growth stocks could tumble if the economy normalizes and value stocks come back into favor.
