AMD\u2019s client PC sales also dropped dramatically\u2014a whopping 51 percent year-over-year\u2014but the company managed to eke out a small profit despite the sky falling. So why aren\u2019t CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been \u201cundershipping\u201d chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).\n\n\u201cWe have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters,\u201d Su said, as spotted by PC Gamer. \u201cWe undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1.\u201d\n\nWith the pandemic winding down and inflation ramping up, far fewer people are buying CPUs, GPUs, and PCs. It\u2019s a hard, sudden reverse from just months ago, when companies like Nvidia and AMD were churning out graphic cards as quickly as possible to keep up with booming demand from cryptocurrency miners and PC gamers alike. Now that GPU mining is dead, shelves are brimming with unsold chips.\n\nDespite the painfully high price tags of new next-gen GPUs, last-gen GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards are still selling for very high prices considering their two-year-old status. Strategic under-shipping helps companies maintain higher prices for their wares.\n\nAMD isn\u2019t the only one doing it, either.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said to investors in November. \u201cSo we have been undershipping. We have been undershipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.\u201d\n\nSince then, Nvidia has released the $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080 and $800 RTX 4070 Ti, two wildly overpriced graphics cards, and tried positioning them as enthusiast-grade upsells over the RTX 30-series, rather than treating them like the usual cyclical upgrades. AMD\u2019s $900 Radeon RX 7900 XT offers similarly disappointing value and the company recently released a blog post also positioning its new GPUs as enthusiast-grade upsells.\n\nOverall gross margin is a key metric for chip companies, which burn through a ton of cash investing in R&D and cutting-edge technological processes. AMD\u2019s market tricks helped it achieve a 51 percent non-GAAP gross margin last quarter, while Intel forecasted a terrifyingly low 34.1 percent gross margin for the upcoming quarter (hence its belt-tightening moves).\n\nThis all helps explain why street prices for standalone GPUs haven\u2019t plummeted, even as deals on desktops and laptops have started ramping up. We expect\u2014hope?\u2014that as stocks dwindle down and competition ramps up, sanity will return to graphics card prices, mirroring AMD and Intel\u2019s recent CPU price adjustments. Just this morning, Intel announced that its Arc A750 graphics card was getting a price cut to $250, instantly making it an all-too-rare tempting target for PC gamers on a budget.\n\nAuthor: Brad Chacos, Executive editor\n\nBrad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

{"title": "Amazon earnings are out \u2014 here are the numbers", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/02/amazon-amzn-earnings-q4-2022.html\n\nEarnings: 3 cents per share\n\nRevenue: $149.2 billion vs $145.42 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates\n\nIt is not immediately clear if the reported earnings are comparable to the Refinitiv analyst estimate of 18 cents per share. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers on the report:\n\nAmazon Web Services: $21.87 billion, according to StreetAccount\n\nAdvertising: $11.38 billion, according to StreetAccount\n\nAmazon likely closed out its worst year for revenue growth in its quarter century as a public company, and another quarter of single-digit sales expansion is expected, as the company grapples with waning consumer demand from inflation and a deceleration in its cloud business.\n\nThe company warned in its most recent earnings report that fourth-quarter revenue would rise just 2% to 8% from a year earlier.\n\nAmazon shares lost half their value in 2022, when higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints forced the company to recalibrate after its pandemic-fueled growth. Meanwhile, consumers continued their return to in-person shopping and pulled back on discretionary spending, adding to Amazon\u2019s pain.\n\nEven the holiday season was seen as fairly lackluster. Amazon\u2019s online stores segment is expected to show a revenue decline of 1.4% year over year, according to FactSet estimates.\n\n\u201cWhile there was an expected boost to consumer spend in late November around the Cyber Five period (the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend was Amazon\u2019s biggest ever), this uplift was likely short-lived, with December retail sales declining 1.1% [month over month], the steepest decrease in 2022,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. The firm maintains a buy rating on Amazon\u2019s stock.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy\u2019s efforts to reel in costs will be a major area of focus. In January, Amazon said it\u2019s eliminating 18,000 jobs among its corporate workforce, after cutting a number of employees last November. The company has also instituted a hiring freeze in its corporate ranks, cut some projects and paused warehouse expansion in an effort to tame rising expenses.\n\nAmazon Web Services is expected to show slowing growth during the fourth quarter as businesses softened their spending in an effort to cut costs. Cloud-computing rival Microsoft\n last week reported slowing expansion in its Azure unit.\n\nAWS CEO Adam Selipsky said in an interview late last year at the company\u2019s annual Reinvent customer conference that \u201cwe do see some customers who are doing some belt-tightening now.\u201d\n\nOne bright spot could be Amazon\u2019s advertising business, which is expected to post solid revenue growth during the quarter. Online advertising has come under pressure as inflation pushed some brands to recalibrate their budgets.\n\nBut Amazon\u2019s ad business is poised to grow \u201cat a mid-teen percentage range\u201d in 2023, even against a tough macro backdrop, as sellers and vendors continue to buy targeted product ads, according to analysts at CFRA Research, which has a buy rating on Amazon shares.", "id": "10s0w5l", "created_utc": 1675371995.0, "score": 256, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "Initially popped 2% AH and then flipped red instead on worse than expected Q1\u201923 guidance.

Here are the results \n\nEarnings per share (EPS): $1.05 vs $1.18 per share expected, according to Refinitiv \n\nRevenue: $76.05 billion, vs. $76.53 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\n\nWall Street is also watching other key numbers in the report:\n\nYouTube advertising revenue: $8.25 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue: $7.43 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.\n\nTraffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.32 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s core ad business is expected to report minimal expansion from a year earlier, and growth is likely to remain in the single digits until late 2023, based on analyst estimates.\n\nA slowing economy and competition from TikTok have hurt Google as well as digital ad rivals Snap and Facebook. Earlier this week, Snap reported weaker-than-expected revenue, while Facebook parent Meta topped estimates but still recorded a 4% decline in sales.\n\nIn January, Alphabet announced it was laying off 12,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce. The company told employees recently that more of them will be at risk for low performance ratings than in prior years.\n\nAlphabet also cut staff in its health sciences unit Verily by 15%, citing a restructuring that will supposedly better position the business to seek financial independence.\n\nPressure is mounting for Google in other ways.\n\nArtificial intelligence-based chatbot ChatGPT, launched late last year by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is viewed as posing a risk to Google\u2019s search engine. Executives teased that the company may introduce a similar product to the public at some point this year. CNBC reported this week that Google is internally experimenting with several potential products that could influence its search business.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department filed its second antitrust lawsuit against Google in just over two years, this one targeting its advertising business. It marked the first federal lawsuit against Google filed during the Biden administration.\n\nGoogle is now showing its willingness to invest heavily in live sports. During the fourth quarter, the company agreed to pay $2 billion per year for the next seven years for YouTube to own the exclusive rights for \u201cNFL Sunday Ticket.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/02/alphabet-googl-earnings-q4-2022.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "10s11tq", "created_utc": 1675372382.0, "score": 180, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Sundar not feeling so Beautiful?", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Hello my brown friend!", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0779821053147316}, {"body": "One can only hope he gets fired over this and someone more honest replaces him.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08814167231321335}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0855332687497139}, {"body": ">A slowing economy and competition from TikTok have hurt Google as well as digital ad rivals Snap and Facebook.\n\nWhere are we on that TikTok ban?", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "Google lobbyist need to get to work! \n\nTo be fair, they are battling on multiple fronts\u2026 they are well stocked, but taking casualties.", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4694765508174896}, {"body": "[U.S. House panel to vote next month on possible TikTok ban](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-panel-vote-next-month-tiktok-ban-2023-01-27/)", "score": 36, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6481520533561707}, {"body": "Basically nowhere.", "score": 28, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15265415608882904}, {"body": "I don't even have a Tiktok account and I think Youtube Shorts sucks,  I stopped watching videos on Mobile after they took the dislikes off, I only watch on PC and with the extension to show the dislikes, and on PC I have AdBlock, they would probably make more money with Youtube if Susan Wojcicki wasn't so incompetent.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5249587297439575}, {"body": "Even it\u2019s ban it will only affect the US. both tiktok and google is not US only business", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6514204740524292}, {"body": "For us normal people no ban yet.

Just keeping Google as the default search engine on Chrome is worth many billions a year. Google has paid Mozilla billions to keep Google as the default search engine on FF which has a tiny fraction of the marketshare. We're talking 65% vs 3% marketshare.\n\nChrome also gives Google the ability to drive browser development decisions, tie user accounts to the browser (and into their walled-garden), control of ChromeOS/Chromecast devices, control of browser privacy tracking decisions and ad blocking capabilities, the list goes on.\n\n\"Just a browser\" It's a platform, the 2nd most used platform in the world second only to Android.

OpenAI beat them in releasing something to the public, but Google's AI capabilities are at least on par with OpenAI. Being a massive company, Google is just less likely to release toys like that to the general public. Instead, they are more likely to integrate the capabilities into their existing products which is already happening. OpenAI has wowed the public, but that doesn't mean shit until they turn it into a profitable business that steals marketshare from the giants.\n\n>Are you seriously saying that the CEO of one of the most well funded and brilliant developer talent pools who have created paradigm shifts in computing such as the Google File System which was the inspiration that led to the creation of Hadoop or Google incubated Kubernetes which is like the defacto operating system of the cloud and despite all this the company he's running is 3rd place laggard in Cloud computing is doing a good job?\n\nThe race in cloud computing started well before Sundar.
