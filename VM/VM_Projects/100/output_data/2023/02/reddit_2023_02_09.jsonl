Their production might struggle to keep up with growth targets, their market share might decline faster or be higher than expected, you can't predict demand due to macro conditions, the self driving might fail or suddenly happen and make it the most valuable car manufacturer ever. There a so many variables that actually predicting future cash flows and when they will comes is really hard. Sure, it might grow fast, but the opposite is also possible at least and even if things pan out, will they grow by 30, 40, 50 or even 60% p.a.? \n\nAll those factors matter massively for the \"true\" value of the company.

Additionally, if you are looking at volatility as a measure of risk (which i dislike) then it is certainly very Risky.\n\nAnd for the same reason (distant cash flows) the valuation should heavily rely on interest rates.

I don't know how much premium you collected, depends on when you sold them. Maybe $8 per share per contract? That would be a credit of $1,600.\n\nTesla rose to $210 so now the calls you sold are (a) ITM and (b) worth $15.65 per share per contract, which is more than when you sold them.\n\nYou have two options:\n\n1. Buy back the options you sold. You will pay $3,130, the contracts will be gone, and you'll keep your 200 Tesla shares. This is a good idea if your investment thesis has changed and you think Tesla is going to the moon and you want to take the loss on the options now to keep your shares long-term.\n2. Let the options expire ITM tomorrow. You will be assigned on the calls, and have to sell your 200 Tesla shares at $197.5, collecting $39,500. Even though that's below the going market price for TSLA, it's above what you paid for the shares, so you will make a total profit, cradle to grave, on your TSLA shares of $39,500 - $32,000 + (whatever credit you received for selling the two options) = min. $7,500. But your shares of TSLA will be gone. This is a good idea if you want to bank some cash immediately and don't want to invest in TSLA for the long term.\n\nEdit: My advice is since you clearly don't know what the hell you're doing, just do nothing and let the options expire tomorrow evening. You'll walk way with at least $7,500 more than you had when you started, and maybe next time you'll learn what options are before you sell them.", "score": 141, "replies": [{"body": "You can then wheel it and SELL a cash secured put roll for premium until you can\u2019t anymore then buy shares.
