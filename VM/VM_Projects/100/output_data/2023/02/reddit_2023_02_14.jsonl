Airbnb reported $319 million in net income for the quarter, up from $55 million a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $506 million, surpassing the $432 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nIn its shareholder letter, Airbnb said it\u2019s seeing continued strong demand at the start of 2023. The company said revenue in first quarter will be between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, above the $1.69 billion expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nAirbnb said it made difficult choices to cut spending during the pandemic but has modestly increased its headcount over the past two years.

The company reported 88.2 million nights and experiences booked in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year, but below the 89.7 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nAirbnb said in the investor letter that travelers are returning to major cities, which has historically been one of the \u201cstrongest areas\u201d of its business. The company said domestic and short-distance travel continued to be strong, but it saw \u201ceven further improvement\u201d in longer-distance and cross-border travel during the quarter.\n\nAirbnb said guest demand and supply growth remained strong throughout 2022.\n\nAverage daily rates decreased by 1% from a year ago to $153 in the fourth quarter.

Yeah. Why else would \"data labelers\" be working at a plant meant for production? The only reason why they were hired there was to kick the hiring quota problem down the line and because it was low-level labor that literally anybody could do. It's not meant to be a career, and it's only valuable to the company for those reasons. \n\nThe problem is that people treat EVERY job like everything is meant to be a career with long-term benefits and ever-increasing pay, but some jobs are temporary and meant to be commodities. Companies enter agreements with employees at their willingness to pay, and employees should agree at prices and conditions they find reasonable and acceptable. \n\nI am somewhat more sympathetic to Amazon warehouse employees since that's physical labor in some truly grueling conditions that's materially adding to Amazon's business model with a decent amount of required training, but Tesla's data labeling team does not contribute in the same way.
