{"title": "Alibaba shares rally 6% after massive earnings beat", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/alibaba-shares-rally-4percent-after-massive-earnings-beat.html\n\nAlibaba reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that smashed expectations, sending U.S.-listed shares soaring 4% higher.\n\nHere\u2019s how Alibaba did in its fiscal third quarter, which ran from October to December 2022, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: \n\nRevenue: 247.76 billion Chinese yuan vs 245.18 billion Chinese yuan expected, up 2% year-on-year\n\nEarnings per American depositary share (ADS): 19.26 yuan vs 16.26 yuan expected, up 14% year-on-year.\n\nNet income: 46.82 billion yuan vs 34.02 billion yuan, up 69% year-on-year.\n\nAround $600 billion has been wiped off the value of Alibaba since its peak in October 2020, as a tightening regulatory environment on tech firms in China along with China\u2019s strict Covid-19 control policies, and subsequent economic slowdown, hit the e-commerce giant.\n\nAlibaba shares in Hong Kong on Thursday closed higher ahead of earnings, as investors bet that that China\u2019s economic re-opening will help boost consumer sentiment and spending, which will ultimately help the e-commerce giant. During the December quarter, China abruptly ended its strict Covid controls such as lockdowns. However, this is not likely to be fully reflected in the quarter as it took place in December.\n\nRevenue from Alibaba\u2019s biggest business, the China commerce division, which includes its popular marketplace Taobao, totaled 169.99 billion yuan, down by 1% year-on-year. The drop was driven by a 9% year-on-year decline in customer management revenue, obtained from services such as marketing that Alibaba sells to merchants on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms.\n\nAlibaba said that gross merchandise volume \u2014 or the value of transactions across the company\u2019s online shopping platforms \u2014 \u201cdeclined mid-single-digit year-over-year, mainly due to soft consumption demand and ongoing competition as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in China that resulted in supply chain and logistics disruptions in December.\u201d\n\nThe company said that it sees a rebound in China\u2019s economy and consumption.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we expect continued recovery in consumer sentiment and economic activity,\u201d Daniel Zhange, CEO of Alibaba, said in a press release.\n\nAmid a slowdown in its China activity, Alibaba has sought growth in overseas markets through its South East Asia business Lazada and through global e-commerce site AliExpress. International commerce revenue grew 18% year-on-year to 19.47 billion Chinese yuan.\n\nAnalysts are expecting Alibaba to see faster revenue growth over the coming quarters as the full effect of the Chinese economic re-opening is felt. Morgan Stanley named Alibaba its \u201ctop pick\u201d in the Chinese tech sector for the first time in three years, in a recent note.\n\nLast year, Alibaba embarked on measures to control costs in order to improve profitability. The company is trying to find a balance between costs and continuing to make important investments for long-term growth.\n\nThose efforts are paying off with the 69% year-on-year jump in net income. The company\u2019s operating margin stood at 14% in the December quarter, higher than the 3% reported in the same period of last year.\n\nAlibaba managed to reduce losses across all of its business in the December quarter, including in its logistics arm Cainiao and its cloud division.\n\n\u201cDuring the past quarter, we continued to improve operating efficiency and cost optimization that resulted in robust profit growth,\u201d Toby Xu, chief financial officer of Alibaba, said in a press release.\n\nMeanwhile, the regulatory tightening that took place over the past two years is beginning to ease, as enforcement of regulation becomes more predictable.\n\nThe company is also trying to boost the confidence of shareholders amid its stock slump. In November, Alibaba said its board has approved an additional $15 billion as part of its existing $25 billion share buyback program which will be extended to the end of its 2025 fiscal year.\n\nAlibaba is also in the process of making Hong Kong a \u201cprimary\u201d listing for its shares, paving the way for mainland China investors to trade the stock directly. However, the company said in November that the process would not be completed in 2022 as it had initially been planned.", "id": "119wjcn", "created_utc": 1677155362.0, "score": 378, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "That didn't last long Lol", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "And it\u2019s gone!", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "I've never believed that there are people in this world who don't make mistakes.

Here is what the NBER committee have said about the recession definitions:\n\nBecause a recession influences the economy broadly and is not confined to one sector, the committee emphasizes economy-wide measures of economic activity. The traditional role of the committee is to maintain a monthly chronology, so the committee refers almost exclusively to monthly indicators. *The committee gives relatively little weight to real GDP because it is only measured quarterly and it is subject to continuing, large revisions.*\n\n*The broadest monthly indicator is employment in the entire economy.* The committee generally also studies another monthly indicator of economy-wide activity, personal income less transfer payments, in real terms, adjusted for price changes. In addition, the committee refers to two indicators with coverage of manufacturing and goods: (1) the volume of sales of the manufacturing and trade sectors stated in real terms, adjusted for price changes, and (2) industrial production. The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce Department compiles the first and the Federal Reserve Board the second. Because manufacturing is a relatively small part of the economy, the movements of these indicators often differ from those reflecting other sectors.\nAlthough the four indicators described above are the most important measures considered by the NBER in developing its business cycle chronology, there is no fixed rule about which other measures contribute information to the process.\n\n**A recession involves a substantial decline in output and employment.**\u201d", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "We know housing prices jumped during covid for many reasons but definitely low rates is up there.

{"title": "Wendover Productions - How Tesla Fumbled", "selftext": "", "id": "11a1q5v", "created_utc": 1677169421.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "Copy and pasting my thoughts from yesterday when it was discussed in the other sub and released on Nebula:\n\n1) \"Consumer Reports was objective.\" It has been debunked for years now that they do not differentiate between cosmetic reliability and operational reliability, rather lumping cosmetic problems in with operational problems. Early Tesla production did have quality issues, but it is rare now that they have gotten better at it. Not only that, it's weird to say Tesla makes bad cars *just because* of cosmetic issues, ignoring all the benefits. Every product has pros and cons. \n\n2) The 2018 production ramp was bad because they were behind. This is true but is weird to call out like it is still a problem. If anything Tesla's production has skyrocketed. Last year they produced and shipped around 1.3M vehicles and aim to do around 2M this year. Also it's worded as if no production ramp before Tesla has ever gone poorly or not on schedule. Lucid and Rivian are having the exact same issues that Tesla had, yet he uses Rivian as an example as a good manufacturer in the video. Lucid just posted pretty terrible guidance around growing production yesterday. If you want the best example, [GM delayed their goal of 400k](https://www.businessinsider.com/gm-delays-north-american-ev-production-goal-batteries-2022-10) to, you guessed it, their inability to source batteries fast enough. So to highlight this problem as a current and Tesla-specific issue is very weird. \n\n3) \"Mach E > Model Y\" That whole segment comparing specs is misleading and ignores the elephant in the room of better software, better charging, and ignoring price haggling from dealers. It also ignores Tesla's much better efficiency. A Mach-E may have more range on certain trims, but only because they use a much larger battery to get the same or better range as a Tesla. This means that Tesla can use a smaller battery to get the same range which leads to less real charging time, less raw materials per car and more cars overall from the same amount of raw materials. They do way more with less.\n\n4) \"Ford F150's closest competitors being Chevy Silverado and Ram trucks showing the EV versions\" Could the subliminal messaging be any more blatant. Both those EV trucks are not slated for release until late 2024 or even 2025.\n\n5) Hummer EV, Rivian, and Ford Lighting \"massive scale\" in 2023. Maybe Rivian, if they get their costs under control. Legacy auto simply does not have the planned production capacity even through 2025 to catch Tesla, even if Tesla was standing still. If he meant massive scale relative to initial production then that would be accurate but Sam states no explicit figures here. I forget who said it, but one of the analysts covering Tesla said something along the lines of \"many automakers are trying to hop on a flight from gas car city to EV city, while not having the plan to build the airport, runway, wings, engines, and training pilots\". \n\n6) \"First moves matter.\" This is na\u00efve because it's not the only thing that matters with examples being Sony Betamax vs VHS, or Blu-Ray vs HD-DVD. Usually the best product for the best price matters, and even at that if it is available. A good example of that the GPU market. You cannot get anything high-end right now as it is unavailable, so at that point the new features and performance are moot. So even if someone introduced a better vehicle than Tesla, if they cannot produce it at scale, economics says that it will not succeed. \n\n7) He leaves out that Cybertruck starts shipping in Q2-Q3 of this year, with volume production next year. I predict Cybertruck production capacity will quickly exceed the F150 Lightning in 2024. That does not mean the F150 is a bad vehicle, nor do they compete with one another. People who have always bought an F150 will buy the lightning and people who want a recreational truck will buy a Rivian or the Cybertruck. People often make a fallacy that EVs only compete with each other, which is where this tribalism of similar brands and products comes from. EVs overwhemingly compete with gas cars. \n\n8) BYD figures include PHEV. This is publicly available information on their earnings reports and other websites. So no, they are not the largest BEV manufacturer. It just shows laziness or incompetency on his research. In terms of just BEV production (battery electric vehicles only), Tesla is the clear dominant leader in not just china but also the world. \n\n9) \"Tesla will always be a secondary player in China\". Tesla isn't even a secondary player now. Tesla is planning a true low cost mass market EV to release in a few years which will release in China first where they are designing it. And even if they were China is massive. To even be successful as a foreign company is a massive achievement in itself for the reason he himself outlaid in the video. \n\n10) MobilEye and Tesla ended their contract because Tesla wanted to use their tech for more than MobilEye was comfortable with, so while from their perspective they cited safety concerns, Tesla's side said they did not have a product that Tesla needed for its goals. Tesla then famously designed it's own Self-Driving computer because no chip manufacturer had a product that fit their needs of a low power, high efficiency computer for their specific use case of machine vision based driving. \n\n11) The FSD part is the only one I give him slack on and partially agree with. Yes Tesla has delayed many times, but it costs him nothing to criticize it because no other company is as close as Tesla, only Tesla knows how far away they are from the end product. So to say they are \"far from it\" is guessing at best. Tesla is trying to develop a true Level 4/5 self driving system that drives using eyesight just like how we do, and can be dropped anywhere in the world and figure out how to navigate like humans do. It does not use LIDAR like Waymo or other self driving companies, with the goal of being able to be easily and rapidly scaled and low cost like any piece of software can to its fleet once complete. It does not require HD maps or at the very least only requires minimal GPS locating unlike LIDAR or radar based systems. So to compare it with other companies is moot because they have completely different approaches and problems. \n\n12) \"Tesla's ruined reputation from FSD has to have an impact\". If this was true then they would not be selling so many cars. Sure there are some disgruntled customers and I sympathize with them but it has been clearly labeled as an unfinished product. It is their risk as an early adopter of unfinished tech that it is still not done. I think Tesla should allow refunds or transfer of the software to new vehicles as it would be a good middle ground compromise. \n\n13) Tesla's favorability among Democrats in Oct-Nov plummeted because of Twitter. A cherry picked stat that has nothing to do with the execution of the company and is not a 1:1 indicator of sales. We saw that in Q4 earnings their sales were not affected by the Twitter takeover like many thought would happen, yet he ignored this in his video. \n\n14) \"Republicans don't buy EVs.\" Another misleading statement. *Most* people don't buy EVs. It is still below 10% market penetration in the US and has a lot of headroom to grow. \n\n14) Conflating Musk with Tesla is a dead horse at this point. Reddit has hated Musk for years now but their sales continue to grow. No other company has such controversial CEO. I don't defend him for his actions on Twitter or his sometimes divisive viewpoints, but the average person does not care about Musk and again just wants the best product for the best price. Much of the criticism I see online for Tesla is actually just criticism for Musk. \n\n15) \"There's nothing that separates Tesla left.\" Despite listing several things that separate them from others in the video that he just used to criticize them, I guess there is indeed nothing that separates them left. Oh except maybe the charging network, superior efficiency and tech, and overall better ownership experience for an EV. \n\n16) \"Legacy acting like the adults in the room\". This is a funny statement because many of those companies lobbied for years to stop EVs from happening and even flat out cheated on emissions tests (cough VW cough). It's only when Tesla started threatening their bottom line did they suddenly embrace them. Also Musk is arguably the only one not acting like an adult, not Tesla. \n\n17) \"They could have been Ford GM and Chrysler.\" No because if they did, then they would have failed. Why emulate legacy when disruption comes from doing things differently and innovating where they don't?\n\n18) The EV company market share graph is stupid and misleading. No one expects Tesla to maintain 80% market share, even hyper-bulls on this forum. What matters is absolute unit sales. It is mathematically impossible to maintain 80%, or even 50% market share. If there are 100 million EVs made annually in let's say 2035, and Tesla makes 20 million of them, that is only 20% market share, yet that is still 10x more EVs produced than this year's projections.\n\nIn summary, the video is either willfully ignorant or knowingly malicious. It reads like a dog whistle for Tesla bears. I am getting the same vibes from this as I did from that guy [who was confidently incorrect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w__a8EcM2jI) in predicting that the Tesla Semi would fail and was not possible (which he has still not reneged on). This video takes all of the uninformed layman talking points and changes some vocabulary and adds filler to make it seem \"smart\". But even a polished turd is still a turd. The conclusions being drawn at the end do not match up with reality. I am disappointed because I started watching Wendover almost a decade ago, his content was always super polished and always interesting at the very least even if it was a little inaccurate or sensationalist.

If you have more money in the system, it allows companies to raise prices without a lot of repercussions because their is more money to buy those goods. If that extra money wasn't there, you'd have a limit on how high prices could actually go. If you're selling regular cheap ass hamburgers, your target audience will be lower/working class. If you raise your prices too much, selling hamburgers , it hurts your business because the people that buy your product (its target audience) do not have the money to support it, so you sell less even if the demand is there, simply because noone has any damn money. It puts a limit on the price if the money supply is the same, even with issues with the lack of supply of the product. The nominal amount may be more, but you aren't selling enough of it. So it makes sense to lower your prices a bit, yet still make the most profit. When you introduce a lot of excess money into the economy. Now, well, people have money to spend on that ground beef you can afford to raise those prices. the money supply allows it. There's a lot more money going around. even if their wages didn't go up. That money finds a way around the economy, perhaps in businesses even. One thing, however, that does also cause inflation is that when there is not enough supply and the demand is sky high. Though this type of inflation has a cap that is limited by money supply, at a certain point, there just isn't enough supply of money to go around to spend on your product to justify buying that product over necessites like food. like literally the only person that could afford to spend that kinda money on that product is the top 10% type thing, the average working class person could not afford to spend 20$ on a pound of hamburger, so not gonna happen without wage increases.  Wage increases can only happen when the business has the money to do so. A large money supply enables that too. Businesses naturally raise prices higher than normal because they can and they'll increase their profits. Though their is a limit even to that on how high they can raise their prices before, there simply isn't enough money to go around to buy it.  if the money supply doesn't allow it. You're not going to get large inflation across every sector at once.  It's not natural to have inflation present at higher levels in every sector of the economy, even with a lot of the supply issues with goods. The last time deflation happened, we were on the gold standard, the gold standard limits supply. So all deflation really meant that there was too much money leaving the economy and not enough coming in. This, in turn, raised the value of your gold/hold backed dollar. Which was deflation. It's not inherently bad, but it was an indicator of economic weakness. 2-3% cpi inflation was bad under a gold standard. It was the highest you'd see realisticly. Usually haooened when we added alot of gold to our supply because the economy was doing well. Until we became fiat and the money printer turned on. Look up a site called wtf happened in 1971. It has some cool graphs about the issue with going off the gold standard. Inherently, gold is outdated, but it did limit supply, which put a cap on inflation. Crypto currencies do this exact something, why I think they're inherently valuable. They're also in their infancy and not being used as a currency that's why the value of it is so unstable atm. Also if inflation goes too high in one sector, people will put their money into different things, balancing out that temporary price increase. It's sorta an equilibrium thing, prices increase over here because of product supply issues, so people are just going to put their money into other things instead like more food or whatever.

Maybe you do, but most people don\u2019t. Just like people don\u2019t care that VW was run by Nazis. The auto market is in a downturn, Tesla cut prices due to that, not because of what Elon was saying. Now tesla is rising prices again because the backlogs are building. \n\nGood luck to the people that pay more for a Ford Mustang or less for a Kia and realize there\u2019s no charging infrastructure, and it will cost just as much to charge as a fuel gas car but take longer.\n\nSince you trade ARK you may be aware of their research from several years ago on Wrights Law. Tesla continues to double production and cut costs, it\u2019s going to be really tough for competitors to enter this space and also for ICE to compete with that. Lucid is on the verge of going bankrupt. Yes I know those Ark folks are regarded. But this regard made a fortune on TSLA shares/options over the last several years because of the realization that they were onto something with their TSLA call.\n\nElon doesn\u2019t give a fuck about the share price, he wants to grow to be the biggest company in the world. He wouldn\u2019t think twice about cutting prices another 10-20% if demand softens further. Doing this will squeeze the industry and people will line up to buy. They can do this because they have virtually no debt. Very different story for legacy auto. I think investors understand this now, the stock was oversold in December due to a margin squeeze.
