Most of the recovery in the 2H of 2023 has already been priced in. Generally forward PE of around 16 are good buys, 15 or below great buys, and above 18 to be good sells.\n\nGeneral consensus among US strategists is SP500 will have a weak 1H2023 and a strong recovery 2H2023 to end the year slightly up at around 4100. At the beginning of the year, I found it hard to believe the bottom could be put in with so much agreement in the consensus.

Why it can't trough earlier is because you never know the magnitude of the slow down until you actually enter one (how do I know it's just a slow growth instead of a mild recession, or a severe recession?). Also, when you get into the summer, the 12-month forward earnings estimate will start to incorporate a lot of 2024 earnings.\n\nClearly depending on the magnitude, the trough level is going to be very different. And summer is really only the start, or a few months into the slow down. That's when they anticipate market will look ahead 6 months forward into the economic recovery, bottom out, and then begin to go up.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good points.

{"title": "Alibaba LEAPS (1,500%+ Potential Return)", "selftext": "# Severe Mispricing in Alibaba Long Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide an argument for the purchase of LEAPS in Alibaba. I will justify this trade by demonstrating that the aforementioned tranches create an abnormally favorable risk/reward profile due to Alibaba\u2019s unreasonably low valuation, which will be demonstrated by financial analysis, an analysis of all the major risks to the value of the underlying security, and an analysis of growth factors due to macroeconomic as well as company-specific factors. Additionally, low implied volatility further improves the risk/reward profile. In recent years, options have become tightly associated with gambling. This paper, however, will show that purchasing these LEAPS are not a gamble, but rather an investment; that is, unlike in gambling, where the expected value is almost always negative, I believe the likelihood of gain far exceeds the likelihood of loss, in spite of potential returns exceeding 1,000%, and losses being capped at 100%. This paper can be used to formulate a concentrated bet on Alibaba that mitigates risk by risking less capital than a much larger purchase in the underlying security (which would be necessary to have the same potential gains).\n\n# Thesis Distilled Into Actionable Information:\n\nA fair value estimate of Alibaba\u2019s current share price, using conservative inputs, visualized below, yields a price of **$294.33 per share**.\n\nIn order to ameliorate the risk of this model being overly rosy, or unforeseen problems, I will discount 25% from my simplified intrinsic value calculation when choosing the strike price for LEAPS. On the flipside, contracts will only be sold when the share price reaches 25% above the fair value estimate, or otherwise held until expiration.\n\nStrike Price: \\~$220.75\n\nExit Price: \\~$367.91\n\nContract Price: $953.00\n\nContract Value at Exit Price: $15,000\n\nP/L: 1,474%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**19th Dec 2025 $220**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/capjwyuykgga1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=f940bd8aba641d449ec04e52e9fd139a6d84b7fa\n\n## \n\n# Revenue\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utrb7w9zkgga1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff72165e10a23b085f749a9ea353febad4765fa9\n\n# \n\nAlibaba\u2019s revenue, visualized above, has grown dramatically over the past decade. In fact, since 2014, the year of its IPO, Alibaba\u2019s revenue has grown from $7.7B USD annually to an impressive $125.8B USD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bxp1kt0lgga1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e791d23238618e46be811bf607c2690b30bd2ef\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn spite of its revenue increasing 16x in this period, its stock price, which more than doubled initially, has meandered back down to a price only 2.7% above its November 2014 high. An undiscerning investor might argue that this increase in revenue, as well as the downstream improvements on earnings and other financial metrics it caused, was priced into the stock (i.e. investors expected this increase, and therefore it is sensible for the stock price to remain relatively unchanged). My refutation to this is simple\u2013no reasonable investor could possibly expect any company to grow this much, this quickly. Instead, the enormous discrepancy in price between 2014 and 2022 says one of two things\u2013that Alibaba was dramatically overvalued in 2014, or Alibaba is dramatically undervalued today. The first case, quite simply, is absurd. If valuations in 2014 were overvalued to the extent that a 16x increase in revenue was priced into the stock, then the 2020 highs of over $300/share would represent extreme mania. The rest of this paper is to prove that the latter case is the correct one.\n\n# Earnings\n\nIn the analysis of Alibaba\u2019s earnings, I should first begin by examining the earnings of the past five years and create a price to earnings ratio that corresponds to the average net income in this time period. This smooths out the effect of one-off expenses or windfalls, as well as any variables that may affect earnings temporarily without affecting the overall outlook of the company.\n\nHistorical Data\n\n5 Year Average Net Income: 15.4B\n\n5 Year Average EPS (Current Share Price): $5.82\n\nP/E (Avg 5y Earnings) = 20.34\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyqfi5g3ngga1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6085f9f7c90b0df93cfc2d5686a1bb43cc4769b\n\n## Future Analysis\n\nOn average, analysts forecast that Alibaba\u2019s EPS will be $6.32 for 2023, with the lowest EPS forecast at $5.83, and the highest EPS forecast at $6.81. On average, analysts forecast that BABA's EPS will be $7.03 for 2024, with the lowest EPS forecast at $6.60, and the highest EPS forecast at $7.47. In 2025, BABA's EPS is forecast to hit $8.56 (min: $8.13, max: $8.99).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4qrhog4lgga1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f264238d1441f85901dc18ea66c26c7e480ecc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAlibaba total assets for the quarter ending September 30, 2022 totaled $240.746B.\n\nAlibaba total liabilities for the quarter ending September 30, 2022 totaled $89.941B.\n\nAlibaba book value = $51.01 / share\n\nAlibaba has accumulated $74.2B in cash\u2013this could be deployed in numerous ways that are beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAlibaba Stock Buybacks:\n\n* Were Alibaba to use its entire $74.2B cash hoard in order to buyback stock, it could buy back 23.7% of the stock, reducing its P/E (Past 5 years) to 15.52, it\u2019s P/E (Future 3y) to 12.34, and it\u2019s P/E (2025) to 10.55\n\nAlibaba\u2013with all its associated infrastructure, intellectual property, assets, employees, goodwill, established brands, and existing businesses, has an earning potential that is valued at its current stock price less the book value (liquidation value). In other words, Alibaba\u2019s ability to generate profits indefinitely into the future is being valued by the market at $67.37/share x 2.65B shares =\n\n$178.34B\n\n# Benjamin Graham Formula\n\nThe Benjamin Graham Formula is a formula used for the valuation of growth stocks. Based on the study of various methods, Graham suggested the formula as a foreshortened and simple way to produce figures fairly close to those resulting from more refined mathematical calculations. The formula is as follows:\n\nV\\*=EPS (8.5+2g)\n\nWhere\n\nV\\*= the value expected from the growth formulas\n\nEPS = trailing twelve months earning per share\n\n8.5 = P/E base for a no growth company\n\ng = reasonably expected 7 to 10 year growth rate\n\nImplementing the appropriate values from Alibaba\u2019s financials, we get\n\nV\\*=$6.32 (8.5+2(15))\n\nV\\*=$243.32 / Share\n\nAlibaba Book Value = $51.01 / Share\n\nPresent Value = V\\* + Book Value = $294.33 / Share\n\n# Risks\n\n## Delisting\n\nOne of the biggest fears surrounding Alibaba is the possibility of it being delisted from the NYSE. There are two parties that could hypothetically cause this to happen. The first party is Chinese regulators. China has forced companies to delist in the past (DIDI) due to the fear of data breaches. This shouldn\u2019t be a major concern for shareholders of Alibaba, as delisting seems unlikely given the China-U.S. audit agreement which has already been carried out without rumor of auditing issues. Additionally, even if China did force Alibaba to delist, shares would be available OTC and on the Hong Kong exchange. As a result, options contracts can still be executed, and shares purchased at the strike price can be sold OTC or converted to Hong Kong shares at their full value.\n\nRecently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) announced that it had concluded its audit review of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. By all accounts, the review went well. The SEC completed its work ahead of schedule, indicating that the inspections went smoothly. Today, the PCAOB further announced that it had received good access to Chinese companies\u2019 books after \u201cthorough and systematic testing.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to say for sure that the total review went well (there\u2019s more to audits than just \"accessing\" things), but the swift conclusion and glowing comments suggest that the SEC is about to hand investors some good news.\n\n## Regulation\n\nWhat started with Alibaba founder Jack Ma publicly criticizing Chinese regulators, turned into a year-long \u201ctech crackdown,\u201d or at least what the business media has portrayed as such. Between Ant\u2019s planned IPO getting stymied and it being forced to restructure in line with the CCP agenda , to the 2.8 billion-dollar USD anti-monopoly fine Alibaba was given, Alibaba\u2019s market cap has fallen over 60% from a high of over $800 billion USD in October 2020 to recent lows of just over $300 billion.\n\nThe goal of the crackdown is to promote common prosperity, ensure data security, and stopping monopolistic practices. Although hurting Alibaba\u2019s bottom line (and share price) temporarily, a lot of what the CCP is doing may actually benefit the Chinese people, and ultimately may end up helping Alibaba grow long term. Moreover, Alibaba has been taking steps to try and please the CCP, including pledging $15.5 billion USD to the common prosperity goals, changing monopolistic behavior, and attempting to sell their Weibo stake to a state-owned company.\n\nThe risks from the CCP are real, and while there have been whispers that the crackdown is easing in 2023, no one can know for certain what the CCP will implement day to day. These risks are included in my valuation of Alibaba by adjusting cash flows as necessary.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe scale advantage of being the largest player in the ecommerce market has become more and more apparent in countries like the U.S. with Amazon, making ecommerce appear to be a winner takes all game. This fact can be attributed to the following reasons, among others: the platform that sells the most will almost always have the lowest price; the platform that sells the most will almost always have the lowest logistics cost; the more sales you have, the more you can invest in software; the more scale you have, the more variety of products you will have. The somewhat lopsided ecommerce market share distribution in China reflects the idea that the advantages that come along with scale results in fewer, more dominant companies- in 2021, Alibaba had a 47.1% share of the ecommerce market in China, compared to JD.com with a 16.9% share and Pinduodu have a 13.2 % share. The following table shows the top 6 companies in China, ranked by retail e-commerce sales, 2019-2022:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w5o71p6lgga1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8cb43b622f6795379ade194bc48f7670fc2a53\n\nOfcourse, ecommerce appearing to be a winner takes all market and Alibaba\u2019s as of yet dominant market share does not necessarily entail that Alibaba will be the monolithic giant that emerges from the Chinese ecommerce market. Rather, it reveals two important facts that are almost equally compelling to an investor: Alibaba has room to grow, and it holds significant advantages in doing so.\n\nWhere the analogy between U.S. and Chinese ecommerce markets fails is that in China, there seems to be a more democratized access to logistics platforms. Whereas in the US, Amazon does not open up these capabilities to competition, Cainiao, the Alibaba-owned smart logistics network that does more than 50% of all package deliveries in China, has opened up their logistics platform to other eCommerce players. Consequently, the investments they make into providing fast, same day or next day delivery to most Chinese cities can be leveraged by many other players. However, although Alibaba will open up their Cainiao network to other competitors, they price it, and financial analysts believe they will do so differently, thus implying that Alibaba can retain its dominance on its own terms. So, in any case, the \u2018whale\u2019 may very well pull away here too, eventually.\n\nIt\u2019s worth going into more detail how Alibaba fairs against JD.com, its largest competitor in China. JD.com is a direct-sales retailer that uses a model similar to Amazon. In contrast to Alibaba's ecommerce model, JD.com warehouses, markets, and ships merchandise directly to Chinese consumers through its national shipping network, which includes a last-mile delivery component throughout much of the nation. With direct control over its supply chain, JD.com has developed a reputation for authentic products and reliable, fast shipping. Alibaba, on the other hand, has long battled an association with counterfeit goods among both domestic and international customers and brand owners. To address these concerns, Alibaba established a dual operation strategy by creating two platforms, Taobao and Tmall, Taobao being a platform for small vendors, and Tmall being a platform exclusively for major brands.\n\nNot only has Alibaba closed in on JD.com\u2019s reputational advantage, but in its growth has has created various other significant edges of its own. The first is that Alibaba has significantly higher margins than JD.com. The second, Alibaba is a much more diversified company. While JD.com\u2019s sole focus has been ecommerce, Alibaba receives significant revenue streams from Alipay, its online payment platform, and Aliyun, its cloud computing platform.
