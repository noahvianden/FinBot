MSFT has known nearly a decade of flat earnings before it reinvented itsself and earning exploded around, 2018. None of that future outcome was in any way guaranteed and in no way was that information somehow included in a P/E ratio. Ignoring your hindsight bias and going back to a snapshot of a stock screener in 2009 would likely reveal many such \"low p/e\" opportunities that you would have been more likely to select if p/e was your sole criterium with far less beneficial outcomes. Just like last year when this subreddit was advocating buying ZIM at 2 P/E which was one of the lowest ratios in the market back then. It is currently trading at 0.4\n\nP/Es are simply not comparable between companies, they are dominated by earnings cycles, company reinvestment, capital structure, company types and management decisions.\n\nThe only way to decently value a company, and include some forecast of how not only earnings, but also margins and capital structure could develop is by doing a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\n\nSo, without going into too much detail, lets look at what Amazon's P/E is hiding just for next year:\n\nProjected total net earnings are about $14 billion, while AWS alone could account for **$25bil** in profit (assuming 25% growth rate [lowest yearly growth rate in the past 5y was 29%] and 25% margins [5Y avg margins are about 28%], 2022 AWS net profit was $22.8b). So going off of net profit alone in a P/E, you're already assuming net negative margins on domestic and international revenue and by calling it \"expensive\" based on P/E, you are thus implying these things cannot ever improve, even though domestic sales averaged a 4% margin over 2017-2021.\n\nLets makes some assumptions and estimate revenue for next year per segment:\n\n- domestic sales grow 5% in the next year [avg 5Y growth rate was about 22% with 13% as the lowest in 2022] to approx $331b\n\n- international sales grow 15% [avg 5Y growth rate was about 17% with -8% as the lowest in 2022] to approx $135b (please note that due to the negative margin projections, higher growth actually means a *more* negative impact on earnings in this case)\n\n- AWS, like I said earlier, grows 25% [avg 5Y growth rate was about 38% with 29% as the lowest in 2022], to $100b\n\nWith these numbers we can arrive at the analyst consensus of $14b net earnings by assuming following margins (example):\n\n- **-1% on domestic** totalling -$3.3b net income [avg 5Y margins about 4%]\n\n- **-5% on international** totalling -$6.7b net income [avg 5Y margins about -2.5%]\n\n- **25% on AWS** totalling $25b net income [avg 5Y margins about 28.6%]\n\nDo you notice how these projections are bordering on pessimistic and likely very possible to improve? The exceptionally high sensitivity of net income to the majority of amazons revenue (due to have margins around the breakeven level) makes margin improvements have an enormous impact. So what would the next year would look like if amazon managed to return to its average margin of 4% on domestic, and just breakeven or abandon international at 0% margin? Earnings instantly would go up to $38bil, a 175% improvement and it's P/E would instantly drop to approximately 26 at current prices. I'm not saying this is likely to happen, as it is clearly not currently the top priority of the company to maximize profitability.
