Quite a lot of gainporns that i have witnessed come from really rich people that have a seperate account where they have theyre \"playmoney\" on and do high risk trading. When it works out -> gainporn, when it doesnt -> lossporn. Ether way they havn't lost anything because for them its just change. (Perhaps that info should be pinned under the subrules or something).

Consumer spending is going to hit a wall this year as defaults rise (they are) and interest payments balloon in size. The irony here is that credit card spending is help keeping inflation up, which the fed will fight by hiking interest rates more, which in turn adds to the record consumer debt levels we have on the books. At some point, that cycle breaks down, consumer spending falls, and that impacts quarterly profit reporting and markets slump. Markets are in for a wakeup call this year even beyond being wrong on where the terminal fed rate was heading.

Interest rolls over here in Canada if you miss min pays, but you can file for hardship and the government will \"pay\" the interest on your behalf and adjust your minimum payments on a sliding scale. If you are unemployed with no income they pause your payments, if you are disabled they make the min payments for you as well based on a 10 year amortization. If you never recover from the disability the loan is forgiven, or if you're chronically unemployed/underemployed with less than 25k (I think?) a year income, they forgive the loan after 10 years of total freezes/supports. \n\nPeople have bigger problems if they took loans, graduated and can't make more than 25k a year. \n\nAs of now though or federal loans are interest free, the provincial portions in half the country still bear interest. My interest bearing portion is prime plus 1% or something, so 7.7% right now. I've been way more aggressive on it as a result.

And, for me, I never felt really hindered by the payments I had to make, not significantly. There was always a way to reduce/stop payments when I didn't have a good job and low income, and the min pays were always reasonable. I always had the option of going fixed but the fixed rate was prime +2 forever and until recently the variable rate was always sub 5%.\n\nPlus a 15% tax deduction based on interest amount paid too reducing practical interest by a couple points.\n\n0% interest is nicer but our system never felt oppressive.

Basically, if you have a rough patch early but then get high income later the system expects you to repay when you have high earnings.
