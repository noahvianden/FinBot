This is selling at any price regardless of valuation, possibly due to margin call, making the valuation actually cheap. Historically this vix has gone from between mid 40 to 70 at the bottom, so I pick 40 as a conservative minimum to make sure I don't miss it. I think during COVID the vix actually got to 80 or something. The vix also peaked at 36 both times in June and Oct, so that seems too predictable for a market bottom. June showed some large gap downs, looking like some capitulation. Had it continued to gap down for a few weeks, I think that would have been the bottom.\n\n We've seen a forward PE of about 15 at sp500, using consensus forward PE at the time (the consensus 12 month forward operating earnings have dropped by around 2% since then). This also happened in June, but of course June's forward earnings consensus was higher than in Oct. This is slightly cheap, but definitely not fire sale level. No one knows the trough of forward earnings, but sp500 will generally bottom before earnings reach its trough. Historically sp500 have bottomed at ranges between  8-15 (too lazy to check the actual range). I will pick consensus forward PE of around 14 to be conservative and not miss the bottom. If you use a guesstimate of where the forward operating earnings will bottom at, I think you will have to use a higher PE multiple, at least 16+. So while the valuation got slightly cheap, I don't think it was enticing enough to truly be at the bottom. \n\nWith all this said, if you believe the US will not enter an economic recession, it's conceivable that 3500 sp500 was the bottom. Though not super compelling, 3500 sp500 could be a reasonable valuation for a flat earnings growth year. Also, even if you don't enter an economic recession but profit margins compress significantly, which is what fed Brainard wants, you could also see sub 3500 sp500 at the bottom. But if you believe the US will enter a recession, even a mild one, 3500 was way too high of a valuation to be the bottom. I'd say at the highest 3400, and much more likely to be quite lower.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Most of what you describe has happened already, just not the the absolut extreme you \"predict\". The big difference to the GFC is that today, a) ETFs make up a significant portion of the market and b) there are much more people in the market. This props up the multiple of all equities by some, hence it makes no sense to state that we need to return to below shiller PE to hit bottom. The shiller PE rises over the decades as more people are onboarded. Shiller PE mean is therefore lifted substantially. Almost everything except many consumer staple value stocks are cheap right now. It is the exact same situation as always, stuff is cheap but people want it cheaper and they come up with x reasons why it is going to get cheaper. Maybe it is and your return will be greater, maybe its not and your return will be smaller.\n\nI think it doesnt make sense to look at historic indicators of bear markets because the entire market is different today. Even macro is different. One would have to look back more than 40 years to find a remotely similar situation, even though a lot of factors are still different today. In 10, 20, 30 years does it really matter if you bought at 3800, 3600 or 3400? Doesnt it make more sense to just buy, set & forget and live your life?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I didn't say shiller PE. Shiller PE is a hugely backward looking and should never be used when the economy is transitioning between cycles. Furthermore, because there was so much demand brought forward during COVID, and that is a fact, using any backward looking metric is guaranteed to look \"cheap\". It's only cheap if you assume things will keep going the way it went, which is clearly not the case. We've already seen tech companies hugely guide down their forward earnings. Everyone assumed they could keep growing rapidly like they did during COVID, although slightly lower. \n\nI said consensus forward operating earnings PE. And I'm only using PE because I dont want to go over dcf valuation on Reddit, but the DCF valuation also says more or less the same, although I'd never use dcf to predict a bottom, because everyone knows the bottom always overshoot fair value. Using multiples is a very lazy way of masking all the underlying factors in valuation that have changed in the last 15 years. And why are you bringing in only GFC? All of your reasons were regurgitated in 2022 by everyone on Reddit, saying stocks usually rise when fed hike rate and such, but at the end of the day valuation matters. If the risk free rate goes up by 3% in 8 months, there's gonna be a huge repricing. In fact, a large portion of the drop in 2022 was purely caused by the repricing of 10 year rate. \n\nBtw, before you say no one can predict the future, any sort of valuation you do on companies or sp500 requires you to predict the future in some way, either on future earnings, growth rate, etc. CEO, big banks must constantly try to predict the economic future and manage their risks accordingly. \n\nDoes it matter if you bought in at 30-40 percent discount? Sure it does if you have decades of savings. Using your argument, I actually wouldn't have cash right now since I never would have sold at 4800, so it's kinda pointless. It doesn't matter if you're 23 and have basically 0 savings, but not everyone is like that despite the very common assumptions by all redditors. Also, everyone says this time is different before every recession. What's different? How does that difference impact my prediction? I can use that same argument to say maybe sp500 won't go up. Maybe it'll stay stagnant for decades, or even go down, since this time is different right? After all, the assumption that sp500 will go up are all based on historical trends, and if you're assuming valuation doesn't matter, and this time is different, there's really not a reason to why sp500 should go up.\n\nYou're saying the increase of passive investing causes the market to be more overvalued (propped up multiples) than historical trend. Doesn't that negate the core beliefs of passive investing, which is for the most part the market is efficient and fairly priced, and there's very little edge active investing can gain?

Wood revealed Thursday that she took some profits in Exact Sciences and put much of those profits into Tesla.\n\nTesla has made big price cuts on its vehicles, first in China and then, on Jan. 13, in the U.S. and Europe. Wood said the aggressive price reductions will help the company stay competitive.\n\n\u201cTesla is going to be very aggressive in pricing,\u201d Wood said. \u201cTesla can afford to do this. It\u2019s got the lowest cost structure and is innovating we believe the most aggressively. The other auto manufacturers are going to compete.
