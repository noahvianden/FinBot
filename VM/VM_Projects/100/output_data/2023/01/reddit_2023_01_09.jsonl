Shares of the yoga pant maker fell more than 10% to $295.21 in premarket trading.\n\nThe company said it expects gross margin to decline 90 to 110 basis points in the fourth quarter, compared to its previous expectation of an increase of 10-20 basis points. Lululemon, however, said it expects fourth-quarter net revenue to be in the range of $2.66 billion to $2.70 billion, compared with its previous range of $2.61 billion to $2.66 billion. It also expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.22 to $4.27, compared to its prior expectation of $4.20 to $4.30.", "id": "107flgp", "created_utc": 1673274141.0, "score": 663, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "I remember Lulu was $60 few years back and tanking hard.", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Meaning their profit is not sustainable.

{"title": "Wayfair Can Only Kick the Can For So Long", "selftext": "TLDR: I think Wayfair is going to run out of cash in the next 18 months.  With no assets, it\u2019ll have difficulty refinancing the 2025 debt leading to either insolvency or unfavorable terms.  I\u2019m selling call credit spreads.\n\nAfter BBBY announced near term ongoing concerns despite debt not being due until 2024, I wanted to see who\u2019s next.  Wayfair\u2019s income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows are as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen.  \n\nI\u2019m posting my due diligence to a public forum to encourage discussion and see if I\u2019m missing anything in my investment thesis that Wayfair\u2019s common stock goes into the low teens in the next 18 months.  Wayfair will run out of cash or have large equity dilution due to negative cash flow from operations and the requirement to refinance the 2025 debt.\n\nMost of the numbers I\u2019m quoting come from Wayfair\u2019s 10Q and investor presentation linked below.\n[10Q](https://s24.q4cdn.com/589059658/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/82b3ed5d-3592-48d4-8ecc-86ec6d90e1b2.pdf#page3)\n\n[Investor Presention](https://s24.q4cdn.com/589059658/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/Q3'22-Investor-Presentation.pdf#page3)\n\nCash flows:  Wayfair burned through $1.1 billion in cash and short term investments in the 9 months ending September 30th.  Wayfair has $1.28 billion in cash and short term investments remaining on hand.  If the next 12 months are as bad as the last 9 months, Wayfair will need to raise cash.  My opinion is that the housing market will see a slow down in transactions in 2022.  The rise in mortgage rates has reduced home affordability, while home sellers stubbornly refuse to lower prices leading to less houses selling.  Wayfair\u2019s revenue should be correlated with housing transactions as furniture sales are largely correlated.\n\nCurrent Ratio: Wayfair has cash now, but current liabilities completely offset resulting in a 1.0 current ratio. $1 billion in accounts payable is $670 million larger than accounts receivable.  The low current ratio will lead to low liquidity if negative cash flow continues.  An asset-light business model is ideal for profitable companies with manageable debt levels.  With Wayfair, there will be very few assets to secure additional loans after it burns through the existing cash.\n\nLiabilities:  Wayfair\u2019s bond holders give Wayfair an exceptionally low interest rate in exchange for a conversion option.  Some have referred to it as free money.  It might have minimal impact on cash flow today, but it\u2019s transferring ownership of the company from the shareholders to the bond holders.  The notes are essentially a call option that pays dividends.  Page 11 of the 10Q has the details.  $3.1 billion in notes with $200 million due in 2024 and $1.28 billion in 2025.  The coupon rates are below inflation with 2024 at 1.12% and 2025 at  0.625%.  If the bond holders weren\u2019t getting the conversion option, I think interest expense would increase $300 million annually.  \n\nAs 2025 approaches, I think the conversion price will have to be significantly reduced and the interest rate significantly increased, both a negative to an investor buying common stock at today\u2019s prices.  If the 2025 note holders play hardball, I think they can force extremely unfavorable terms to the point that they will own the company rendering the common stock worthless.  I think as cash depletes and EPS remains negative, Wayfair will be in violation of covenants, but I got lost in the SEC files before I could prove this out. \n\nStock buybacks:  The statement of cash flows lists $75 million spent on stock buybacks this year. Those shares were repurchased between $136 and $305 per share. Management is wasting cash. A company with negative shareholder equity should not be buying back shares.\n\nEquity based compensation:  Wayfair paid $355 million in stock to its employees in the first 9 months of this year. The market cap is only $4 billion.  If that continues for another year it\u2019s 10% dilution.  Cash flow is being propped up by paying employees in stock.  10% of market cap is about as high as I\u2019ve seen for equity based compensation.  There\u2019s only 6 million remaining shares authorized for compensation.  Either employee compensation will have to decrease or Wayfair will have to pay a larger percentage of compensation as cash.\n\nAnalysts Estimates:  Analyst estimates have 2023 EPS at -$4.56 on flat revenue.  The original path to profitability required Wayfair to scale up to a level that was sending truckloads of merchandise to each major city.  \n\nFlat revenue isn\u2019t going to allow Wayfair to grow to profitability.  Cutting back to profitability is the only option.  I\u2019ve seen the argument that Wayfair\u2019s loss is less than advertising suggesting that Wayfair could cut its paid advertising and rely on organic sales.  Wayfair is already touting a high % of sales are coming from repeat customers.  That\u2019s management\u2019s spin on the inability to acquire new customers despite spending $353 million on advertising in Q3.  At that ad spend, active customer count is down 22% YOY.  If Wayfair cuts ad spend, revenue will decrease leading to lower gross margin dollars.\n\nMy position: My argument isn\u2019t unique.  33% of the float is short.  The stock is down almost 90% from all time highs.  However, it is up 35% off it\u2019s lows.  I have a 2/17 $45/$60 call credit spread that expires just before earnings.  I intend to roll this out 45-60 days for the next 18 months.\n\nFeel free to poke holes in the investment thesis.  Or better yet, make suggestions on how to improve my credit spread.

I think NVDA or AMD could get hit hard if they don\u2019t execute perfectly. For this reason I chose a supplier of Wager Manufacturing equipment. In this way I am playing the same space without taking the same risk (IMO). The company I am in trade at an attractive valuation to the market with a small dividend. \n\nAnother way to mitigate risk is by buying the stock and selling CCs or CSPs against your position to generate income/lower cost basis. But don\u2019t do this unless you know what you are doing. A credit spread can also achieve this. \n\nBest of luck!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Amd is more diverse.

This business has a lot of jargon so it can be confusing.\n\nIt sounds like you bought a call on SPY at price X.  Since then SPY is above X however your contract isn\u2019t worth more than you paid for it.  If this is what you are saying you just had your first lesson in extrinsic value.\n\nThe price of your contract has 2 major components:  intrinsic value and extrinsic value.  If SPY is above your strike price it has intrinsic value.  But that\u2019s only part of the story. If SPY is also higher than when you purchased your call then your contract also has a rise in intrinsic value which is good for your trade.    \nHowever there is extrinsic value that is primarily time and implied volatility.  The more time left on your contract the more extrinsic value.  But time always moves forward so your time is always decaying.  How much depends on how close you are to expiration.  A contract with 2 days left decays faster than one with 2 weeks left, which is faster than 2 months left.  So you don\u2019t just need a move in the right direction, you need that move as soon as possible because as time goes on you need more of a move to be profitable.\n\nThen there is implied volatility.  Think of this as speed, especially downside speed.  It is a reflection of the risk of price movement.  So around big events IV can be higher since that event could move the stock.  That risk can come out once the move is done.  A recent example for SPY this week was the CPI print.  If you bought before it came out, you may have paid more due to higher volatility.  Then when the news came out so did a chunk of that risk because the news is known.  So if IV dropped like it did yesterday, your call may have lost extrinsic value which lowered the price.  \n\nNow I can\u2019t know your situation for sure as there\u2019s not enough detail however my best guess is that the biggest reason is that your extrinsic value dropped more than your intrinsic value gained.\n\nHope this helps.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your response I appreciate it.

You can roughly see the extrinsic value by looking at the price of the same strike put.  That\u2019s a trick traders use to get a rough value.\n\nThis is why 0DTE is a lottery ticket.

The fact that it trades at a higher premium than just the difference between the underlying's spot price and the strike price is a result of the fact that the underlying's spot price can move between now and expiration, and the market isn't sure where it's going to move to or by how much.  IV is just a way of interpreting the magnitude of that extrinsic value.\n\nSo if stock A is trading at 50.00 and a 30 DTE, 49 strike call is currently at 1.50, while stock B is also trading at 50.00 and a 30 DTE, 49 strike call is currently at 2.00, we say the difference is because of implied volatility, meaning it must be because the market thinks B is going to make a bigger move in the next 30 days than A is.\n\nBut there's no way to say \"1.24 of that 1.50 is time value, while the remaining 0.26 is IV.\"  That wouldn't make sense.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5833022594451904}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5816608667373657}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6069052815437317}, {"body": "They are intertwined.

XYZ stock is $100 and you want to buy it for $90, so you sell a $90 put for $1 and pat yourself on the back for that $1 of free money you get vs. a limit order to buy at $90.\n\nThen the stock drops to $69 and you are assigned, being forced to pay $90/share for something that is only worth $69/share. That $1 of \"free money\" is not going to make you feel very good for being $21/share in the hole.\n\nTL;DR - the short put strategy for buying shares cheap underestimates the downside risk.\n\nFor the covered call, people just have tunnel vision there. They only look at the value of the call, not the net value of the entire position. Sure, your XYZ $90 strike call that paid you $11 credit is going to make you feel great if XYZ falls from $100 to $99.50, but if it falls to $69, again, that $11 of credit is not going to make you feel better for bag holding a huge loss on the shares.\n\nThey counter with, it's better than bag holding a $21/share loss if I just had XYZ shares with no covered call, and that argument seems persuasive, but ignores the upside part of the story. What happens when XYZ *doesn't* fall to $69, but instead rises to $120?

But this is just a more complicated way of saying that OTM calls are cheaper than ITM calls. The leverage comes from the lower cost of OTM calls, when all calls deliver 100 shares.\n\n* Higher interest rates benefit calls more than puts, since you spend less money on a call vs. 100 shares, and the cash you don't spend can be invested at the risk-free rate to earn interest. Whereas the comparison for a put is *shorting shares*, and since shorting shares *gives you cash* that you can invest at the risk free rate, the more cash you get, the more you benefit from interest rates. Since a put is leveraged vs. 100 shares, you get *less* interest benefit from the lower cost of the put.\n\nNow that we have the breakdown, you could conclude that an OTM call gets more benefit from rising interest rates than an ITM call, by virtue of there being more unspent cash left over by buying the OTM calls vs. the ITM call that can be invested at the risk free rate.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ah, I can't believe in all my reading of options I've overlooked the first point. \n\nThat's what wasn't making sense to me: if otm are \"practically\" just higher leverage why do they have a higher breakeven?

I assume the data they use is publicly available.\n\nFor instance, they are inferring based on statements like this:\n\n- Examination of trade-level data on this day shows several large deep-in-the-money (ITM) put trades in AMZN with total volume exceeding open interest by a wide margin, **eliminating the possibility of closing activity**\n- The most active contract, the 1/23 125 AMZN put, saw nearly 99k contracts trade, compared to 9,275 contracts open at the time. Open interest the next day was little changed.\n- The incidence of heavy volume in deep ITM contracts with no resulting open interest is indicative of a strategy employed by the largest market participants to minimize exposure to early assignment. Commonly seen in deep ITM calls ahead of an ex-dividend date, this type of activity creates large blocks of open interest that are immediately assigned by another party. The net effect is that early assignment on original short positions is avoided based on the percentage pro-rata allocation method used by OCC. Another effect is a sharp spike in the equity put/call ratio that is nondirectional and unrelated to typical option use cases.\n\nAlso, I've seen statements on how when large put/call sweeps are noticed in the market, you can kind of guess the bullish/bearish sentiment based on how it transacted with bid/ask:\n\n- calls at the ask    = bullish\n- calls above the ask = moar bullish\n- calls at the bid    = bearish\n- calls below the bid = moar bearish\n\n- puts at the ask     = bearish\n- puts above the ask  = moar bearish\n- puts at the bid     = bullish\n- puts below the bid  = moar bullish", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Right.

For one thing, your scenario assumes they hold both long shares and long calls. That's not very typical to begin with.\n\nIf the intention of the calls is to exercise, you can treat 100 shares as interchangeable with 1 call, for the purpose of nominal share exposure (ignoring delta weighting). So from that perspective, selling *either* the shares or the calls reduces exposure.\n\n> I think I've just described the whole definition and point of options\n\nNot even close.\n\nThe point of calls is leverage. If 100 shares cost $50000 and 1 call costs $25000, the call gives you 2x leverage vs. holding shares.\n\nThe other point of calls (and more typically, puts) is insurance. If you have a short share position and you are worried about losing money if the shares go up, you can insure your short share position by buying calls. In the other direction, if you have a gain on your long shares and you want insurance against losing those gains but want to keep the shares risk-on for further upside, you buy a put at the current share price.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to explain.

Coffee plants are a naturally occurring shared resource, but overconsumption has led to habitat loss endangering 60 percent of the plants' species\u2014including the most commonly brewed Arabica coffee.  \n>  \n>2. Overfishing  \n>  \n>As the global population continues to rise, the food supply needs to increase just as quickly. However, overhunting and overfishing have the potential to push many species into extinction. For example, overfishing of the Pacific bluefin tuna has caused an all-time population low of approximately three percent of their original population. This not only endangers the Pacific bluefin tuna, but also risks further marine ecosystem endangerment as a result.  \n>  \n>3. Fast Fashion  \n>  \n>Overproduction by fashion brands has created extreme product surplus to the point that luxury brand Burberry burnt $37.8 million worth of its 2018 season\u2019s leftovers to avoid offering a discount on unsold wares. Furthermore, as new trends emerge rapidly within social networks on the Internet and social media, consumers are constantly purchasing new clothing items and disposing of old, out-of-trend items that ultimately end up in landfills and contribute to pollution.  \n>  \n>4. Traffic Congestion  \n>  \n>Traffic congestion is one of the best-known modern examples of the tragedy of the commons. According to a study by the Harvard School of Public Health, air pollution from traffic congestion in urban areas contributes to more than 2,200 premature deaths annually in the United States alone. As more people decide that roads and highways are the fastest way to travel to work, more cars end up on the roads, ultimately slowing down traffic and polluting the air.  \n>  \n>5. Groundwater Use  \n>  \n>In the United States, groundwater is the source of drinking water for about half the population, and roughly 50 billion gallons are used each day for agriculture. Because of this, groundwater supply is decreasing faster than it can be replenished. In drought-prone areas, the risk for water shortage is high and restrictions are often put in place to mitigate it. Some individuals, however, ignore water restrictions and the supply ultimately becomes smaller for everyone.\n\nThese are modern issues and not just issues with communication.

That seems like a radical over simplification of the issue at best.\n\nIt\u2019s a clusterf right now. Attributing inflation primarily to individual spending habits ignores scores of other contributing factors.\n\nNot the least of which, in this case, is we have corporations making record profits right now where there\u2019s not necessarily a clear indication them raising prices is as closely linked to rising production costs as they want us to believe. They\u2019re obviously price gouging because they can get away with it. Meanwhile, as an individual, I have no choice but to buy gas, pay rent and purchase food staples at whatever prices I\u2019m given\u2014I need to work, I need a roof, and I need to eat, so these aren\u2019t discretionary purchases.

I\u2019m saying this issue is complex and making it reductive to the individual is such a tired neoliberal clich\u00e9.\n\nPutting it charitably, raising rates is a really lousy policy tool for combating inflation not only from the standpoint of long term economic viability but also just in terms of fairness plain and simple. Because ultimately the wealthy will inevitably find a way to make a profit no matter which side of the market cycle they\u2019re on. Recessions are a buyer\u2019s market.

Higher minimum wage can lead to increased consumer spending, as workers have more disposable income to spend on goods and services. This can in turn stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\n\nHowever, some argue that increasing minimum wage can also lead to negative consequences, such as price inflation and job loss. Businesses may respond to higher labor costs by raising prices, which can lead to overall higher costs of living. In addition, businesses may decide to reduce their workforce or automate jobs in order to offset the higher labor costs.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing interest rates can be used as a tool to address inflation and maintain price stability. Higher interest rates can discourage borrowing and encourage saving, which can help to reduce demand and slow down price increases. Increasing interest rates can also lead to a stronger currency, which can make exports more competitive and attract foreign investment.\n\nHowever, increasing interest rates can also have negative consequences, such as slowing economic growth and increasing the burden of debt for borrowers. Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive and discourage investment, which can lead to slower economic growth. In addition, individuals and businesses with existing debt may struggle to afford the higher loan payments that come with higher interest rates.\n\nIn conclusion, both increasing minimum wage and increasing interest rates can have both positive and negative effects on an economy.

It had little redundancy protection, and the several crashes could have been completely avoided if Boeing had of either tested and fully thought through the MCAS system, put a bit of money into developing a better more modern flight control, or even just telling airlines about the MCAS system, and explaining MCAS in the planes manual. Pilots had no idea MCAS even existed, and Boeing tried to keep MCAS a secret because it was such a poorly thought out system, then had to embarrassingly admit that they intentionally left MCAS out of the manuals.\n\nFor that, I think they\u2019re a sleezy company, and I don\u2019t trust them in their future engineering. If they could let MCAS slide (when insider staff had already voiced their concerns about it, but were effectively told to shut up), I really can\u2019t trust that Boeing won\u2019t cut corners with another poorly thought out system.\n\nAlso, the 737 Max was just a poorly designed plane, that was rushed and desperately put in production, to try and rival airbus\u2019 A320 Neo. Like the 737 was awfully thought out compared to the a320 neo, it\u2019s actually comedic.\n\nAirbus wanted to improve upon the a320, their short haul airline option. They completely redesigned the fuselage, to make it bigger, it could carry more fuel, fit more passengers onboard and go faster, and to accompany all of this they had bigger, better engines.\n\nBoeing\u2019s answer to this was to take the 737 (their short haul airline option), change absolutely nothing, not even alter the fuselage, and just stick some bigger engines on it, but to fit the bigger engines under the wings, they just moved the engines forward instead of altering the wing design to house the engine, this was a terrible mistake because it shifted the weight balance wayyy forward, which was a big contributor to the pilots not being able to save the planes when MCAS failed, because the plane naturally wants to nosedive due to the poor weight balance of the plane\n\nMCAS was essentially speaking, the poor flight control system designed to counter this fact that the plane constantly wants to nosedive due to the weight imbalance, so when the badly designed flight control system was slapped on the plane to allow the badly designed engine mounting to even work, it was a recipe for disaster\n\nHow on earth can you trust this company to not cut corners in the future, and not even just cut corners, but do so without even thinking it through?\n\nWhat this shows is that airbus once again, proved themselves to be better. The A320 Neo is better on every stretch of the imagination compared to the 737-Max, especially considering airbus was the first to make the jump on improving their a320, and prioritising passenger safety over cutting. Airbus has been better for years. Boeing isn\u2019t innovative at all, their only saving grace is that their name is the biggest, and it\u2019s \u2018MURICAN! so naturally the US government will try to keep them afloat regardless, because Boeing is an American national pride and it would be incredibly embarrassing for congress if Boeing fell out of popularity and airbus, a European manufacturer, ruled supreme in america.\n\nAirbus > Boeing on every stretch of the imagination.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Another Max will crash.
