The tension between him and democrats was building ever since opening the California Tesla factory after the first set of covid lockdowns(around the time when Texas and Florida were opening up, but California and New York were going draconian). In parallel to that, there was some tension over him being anti union. This led to things like Biden not inviting Tesla to the EV summit, which Elon disliked and publicly called out. Tesla put self driving in people\u2019s minds, and Elon overpromised FSD delivery date, and eventually was the first to release the beta to the average person. To absolutely no one\u2019s surprise, every single crash was highly publicized(and will continue to, even long after self driving is safer than humans), which made Tesla look irresponsible, despite most cases being due to distracted drivers.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what exactly went down between him and politicians, but all the aforementioned clearly led to a lot of nastiness. Government probably fucked with him with investigations, regulatory reviews, dragging out permits, etc. and he kept poking the politicians. Media being heavily with democrats, always reported on this in a bad light, and Elon in turn kept hitting back. This eventually culminated to Elon saying democrats are very nasty and he\u2019s done supporting them or doing things in democrat controlled states.\n\nThis is about where attacks on him went into overdrive. Then Twitter purchase happened and the overdrive went into overdrive. Nonstop hit pieces were/are a regular thing, and the Twitter purchase is certainly cannon fodder. Elon also loved trolling oversensitive people, which didn\u2019t help his situation. \n\nSo, if I had to point out what exactly was the tipping point were he got on the bad side of the average redditor, it was the covid saga. People were really mad he kept the factories open and was saying lockdowns are bad policy. People were VERY emotional about this subject.

It was impressive that the company produced 3,493 cars during the quarter, but investors will wonder why only 1,932 vehicles were delivered.

We will have to wait and see if the company decides to cut the price of its luxury EVs.\n\nIn positive news, Lucid\u2019s stock price has risen about 32% in 2023 as tamer [inflation numbers](https://learn.tryq.ai/articles/impact-of-inflation-on-stock-market?utm_campaign=Forbes&utm_medium=article&utm_source=Forbes) have led to the return of investors to growth stocks. This was also in addition to the positive news of Lucid exceeding production expectations on electric vehicles in 2022.\n\nWhat made the over delivery even more impressive was that the company increased production in the fourth quarter to the point that the one quarter reached almost half of the production for the entire year.\n\nAnother bit of positive news for Lucid was a cash injection of [$1.5 billion last month](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/20/tesla-competitor-lucid-raises-15-billion-majority-from-saudi-sovereign-wealth-fund/?sh=bd7f3c74d10d) due to an equity offering.

Difference, is it only takes 5 - 10 minutes to fill up your gas tank vs. multiple hours to charge your vehicle. If you have a hybrid, they typically get the same mileage as a diesel. If not, more.
