The tension between him and democrats was building ever since opening the California Tesla factory after the first set of covid lockdowns(around the time when Texas and Florida were opening up, but California and New York were going draconian). In parallel to that, there was some tension over him being anti union. This led to things like Biden not inviting Tesla to the EV summit, which Elon disliked and publicly called out. Tesla put self driving in people\u2019s minds, and Elon overpromised FSD delivery date, and eventually was the first to release the beta to the average person. To absolutely no one\u2019s surprise, every single crash was highly publicized(and will continue to, even long after self driving is safer than humans), which made Tesla look irresponsible, despite most cases being due to distracted drivers.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what exactly went down between him and politicians, but all the aforementioned clearly led to a lot of nastiness. Government probably fucked with him with investigations, regulatory reviews, dragging out permits, etc. and he kept poking the politicians. Media being heavily with democrats, always reported on this in a bad light, and Elon in turn kept hitting back. This eventually culminated to Elon saying democrats are very nasty and he\u2019s done supporting them or doing things in democrat controlled states.\n\nThis is about where attacks on him went into overdrive. Then Twitter purchase happened and the overdrive went into overdrive. Nonstop hit pieces were/are a regular thing, and the Twitter purchase is certainly cannon fodder. Elon also loved trolling oversensitive people, which didn\u2019t help his situation. \n\nSo, if I had to point out what exactly was the tipping point were he got on the bad side of the average redditor, it was the covid saga. People were really mad he kept the factories open and was saying lockdowns are bad policy. People were VERY emotional about this subject.

It was impressive that the company produced 3,493 cars during the quarter, but investors will wonder why only 1,932 vehicles were delivered.

We will have to wait and see if the company decides to cut the price of its luxury EVs.\n\nIn positive news, Lucid\u2019s stock price has risen about 32% in 2023 as tamer [inflation numbers](https://learn.tryq.ai/articles/impact-of-inflation-on-stock-market?utm_campaign=Forbes&utm_medium=article&utm_source=Forbes) have led to the return of investors to growth stocks. This was also in addition to the positive news of Lucid exceeding production expectations on electric vehicles in 2022.\n\nWhat made the over delivery even more impressive was that the company increased production in the fourth quarter to the point that the one quarter reached almost half of the production for the entire year.\n\nAnother bit of positive news for Lucid was a cash injection of [$1.5 billion last month](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/20/tesla-competitor-lucid-raises-15-billion-majority-from-saudi-sovereign-wealth-fund/?sh=bd7f3c74d10d) due to an equity offering.

Difference, is it only takes 5 - 10 minutes to fill up your gas tank vs. multiple hours to charge your vehicle. If you have a hybrid, they typically get the same mileage as a diesel. If not, more.

{"title": "Google is panicking! Google Calls In Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for A.I. Fight", "selftext": "A rival chatbot has shaken Google out of its routine, with the founders who left three years ago re-engaging and more than 20 A.I. projects in the works.\n\nLast month, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s founders, held several meetings with company executives. The topic: a rival\u2019s new chatbot, a clever A.I. product that looked as if it could be the first notable threat in decades to Google\u2019s $149 billion search business.\n\nMr. Page and Mr. Brin, who had not spent much time at Google since they left their daily roles with the company in 2019, reviewed Google\u2019s artificial intelligence product strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the meetings who were not allowed to discuss them. They approved plans and pitched ideas to put more chatbot features into Google\u2019s search engine. And they offered advice to company leaders, who have put A.I. front and center in their plans.\n\nThe re-engagement of Google\u2019s founders, at the invitation of the company\u2019s current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the urgency felt among many Google executives about artificial intelligence and that chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nThe bot, which was released by the small San Francisco company OpenAI two months ago, amazed users by simply explaining complex concepts and generating ideas from scratch. More important to Google, it looked as if it could offer a new way to search for information on the internet.\n\nThe new A.I. technology has shaken Google out of its routine. Mr. Pichai\u00a0declared a \u201ccode red,\u201d upending existing plans and jump-starting A.I. development. Google now intends to unveil more than 20 new products and demonstrate a version of its search engine with chatbot features this year, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times and two people with knowledge of the plans who were not authorized to discuss them.\n\nAt the same time, Alphabet is scaling back its work force. On Friday,\u00a0the company said\u00a0it would cut about 12,000 jobs after a hiring spree during the pandemic and amid concerns of a slowing economy. The layoffs were designed \u201cto ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote in a note to employees.\n\nThis is a moment of significant vulnerability for Google,\u201d said D. Sivakumar, a former Google research director who helped found a start-up called Tonita, which makes search technology for e-commerce companies. \u201cChatGPT has put a stake in the ground, saying, \u2018Here\u2019s what a compelling new search experience could look like.\u2019\u201d Mr. Sivakumar added that Google had overcome previous challenges and could deploy its arsenal of A.I. to stay competitive.\n\nSince stepping back from day-to-day duties, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin have taken a laissez-faire approach to Google, two people familiar with the matter said. They have let Mr. Pichai run the company and its parent company, Alphabet, while they have pursued other projects, such as flying car start-ups and disaster relief efforts.\n\nTheir visits to the company\u2019s Silicon Valley offices in the last few years have mostly been to check in on the so-called moonshot projects that Alphabet calls \u201cOther Bets,\u201d one person said. Until recently, they have not been very involved with the search engine.\n\nBut they have long been keen on bringing A.I. into Google\u2019s products. Vic Gundotra, a former senior vice president at Google, recounted that he gave Mr. Page a demonstration of a new Gmail feature around 2008. But Mr. Page was unimpressed by the effort, asking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it automatically write that email for you?\u201d In 2014, Google also acquired DeepMind, a leading A.I. research lab based in London.\n\nBut several new companies, including You.com and Perplexity.ai, are already offering online search engines that let you ask questions through an online chatbot, much like ChatGPT. Microsoft is also working on a new version of its Bing search engine that would include similar technology, according to a report from The Information.\n\nGoogle Calls In Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for A.I.

If we start getting traffic at the scale of Google, they cannot sustain this model because of the increased costs, in terms of infra and API costs. OpenAI, with limited traffic, goes down occasionally when the traffic is too high. When was the last time Google or even Bing returned \"Timed out due to too many requests\"? Google already deploys a lot of models, and they have done a whole lot of cost-benefit analysis of training and deploying these models.

It is not even close to that, frankly.\n\nCompanies mentioned in the post such as [you.com](https://you.com) or [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai) most probably use the API for search results. As the traffic to these platforms increases, it will not make monetary sense to keep using these APIs.\n\nLet us say ChatGPT is integrated into Bing, how does Microsoft monetize that product?
