Whoever said that probably confused a lot of people.\n\nYes, for long options, more extrinsic value is good, less extrinsic value is bad.\n\nHOWEVER, because a vertical spread combines a long and a short leg, higher extrinsic value benefits you *only* on the long leg. On the short leg, it makes you lose more money, because the buyback cost of the short leg becomes higher.\n\n**Not to mention that the statement is not entirely correct.** You can gain more than the max profit at expiration if the extrinsic value of the long leg goes up a lot more than the extrinsic value of the short leg, or even if the extrinsic value of the short leg stays the same or goes down slightly. This isn't normal, usually extrinsic value of both legs move proportionally, but occasionally there is sufficient volatility skew between strikes for them to move apart enough to generate more than max profit.\n\nThis can also work against you and create a situation where you lose more than max loss at expiration.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for clearing this up for me, it makes sense now.

So in order to sell something you don't own, you have to pay cash collateral up front. This is a kind of \"honest money\" that protects the broker from being left holding the bag should you end up losing money on the short trade. It's a promise to cover the short at some future date, backed up with actual cash.\n\nAs it turns out, the collateral requirement for a vertical spread is *not* the assignment value of the short leg, as you might guess, since that's the collateral for a cash-secured put for comparison. Instead, it is the width of the spread, because in the scenario where the short leg loses money and is at risk of being assigned, the long leg *must* have gained value. It's freakishly unlikely for the long leg not to gain when the short is losing. So since the long leg basically makes up for some of the loss, the collateral requirement is lower for a vertical spread. The broker is less at-risk for being left holding the bag.\n\nIn fact, this interaction between the two legs is why a vertical spread is considered a defined risk structure. Because both the upside and downside are capped with a vertical spread.\n\nFinally, I just gave the $1 wide example, which is typically the narrowest spread.

You're not suddenly going to get assigned the day the share prices rises above 80.  Before expiration, options have extrinsic value.  In order for you to get assigned, someone has to exercise, and it doesn't make sense to exercise an option that still has extrinsic value.\n\nThe one exception is if there is an upcoming dividend.  In that case, if the value of the dividend exceeds the value of the corresponding put (i.e., the put with the same strike and expiration,) you are likely to get assigned the day before the ex-dividend date.\n\nhttps://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000435205-what-is-dividend-risk-", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5990985631942749}, {"body": "> I own well over 100 shares of SCHD, so that would mean I am selling a covered call, correct?\n\nIf they are both in the same account, yes.\n\n> if the share price never hits $80, nothing happens on feb 17th correct?\n\nNot exactly. It doesn't matter if it \"hits\" $80. What matters is what the call is worth from one price change of SCHD to the next, and what the price of SCHD is after market close on expiration day. If it is one cent over $80 or higher, your call will be assigned and 100 shares will be sold for $80/share. If it is $80 or less, the call expires worthless and you keep all of the initial opening credit that you received, as well as the shares.\n\n> if the share price reaches $80 or more at anytime between now and feb 17th, they can exercise the option and I receive $80 per share, regardless of what the current share price is?\n\nTechnically, you are correct that your call could get assigned early, but it is extremely unlikely. Whoever exercised early would be throwing money away, and who in their right mind would do that? If the call is worth $1.69 and they only get $1.60 from exercising, why lose $.09 for nothing?\n\nUnfortunately, since SCHD pays dividends quarterly, there is a higher risk of early assignment near the ex-div date, which appears to be on calendar quarter cycles.

My cashflow is around 10K a month to play with. I still work a full-time W2 position making 155K per anum. So this 10K a month of REI cashflow I can leverage without any real regard for safety into more capital, hence why im doing options, I dont rely on the money outside of investment.\n\nI picked up a scanner a while back for a few hundred bucks, and run my own through finviz. Generally ive been trading things like spy, qqq, nvda, msft, tsla etc... looking for volatility. Ive been waiting for open, wait for volatility to subside somewhat and find a clear direction. Ive been using MACD, RSI and MA 200 as far as technical indicators. At the start of the move I think its going to make ive been just buying calls or puts trying to keep it simple.

So ill take a bunch of small losses, before I hit a big move either up or down with a call or put, and then I close it out around 3/4 of where I think it will hit.

The trap is that you feel like with double the money for the same collateral, it is easier. \n\nIf your max loss is $500, I probably wouldn't trade SPX and instead use XSP/SPY. \n\n$500 represents 0.01% of SPX movement. If you don't just papertrade but actually learn how it moves, you can tell 1-3% movement is common. This means that your wing will be fully breached easier. \n\nConsider these with assumption SPX closes at 4000 today: \n\n+3850/-3900P (Option A)\n\nor \n\n+3895/-3900P (Option B)\n\nIf SPX truly gaps down in a week to 3900, it probably could move another $5 to 3895 and you would realise full loss. On the other hand it is less likely for the 3850 option. It is important because rolling for a credit can only happen if you have not realised full loss. Once you are at full loss, rolling will cost you debit unless you move your strike up... \n\n\nIf I were playing with $500, I would then play something like:\n\nXSP: +385/-390P\n\nThis is pretty much the equivalent of Option A. Whereas Option B would be something like +389.5/-390 if such thing existed... \n\nRolling is mostly psychological... as long as it is still a credit move I understand... but remember that the delta will be different. Rolling with the same strikes will be disadvantageous because unless the Index/stock corrects, the rolled options will have higher delta against you. This is to say, \"Sometimes, just let go...\"\n\nHad SPX gone to 3894, and you rolled your +3850/-3900P to another week, the delta for the short will not be 0.2, but rather 0.4 or 0.45... This also means that the value of your credit will \"stick around\" longer. \n\nWhen delta is low (OTM options), value burns faster... When delta is high, the value to close will stick longer. Meaning that realising profit takes longer...\n\nEdit 1: \n\nSpeaking of \"neutral\" expectations... Know that when selling credit spreads, you still need to be directionally right... *On expiry*, you don't care much if SPX is 3901 or 4901... But if you are directionally correct, and SPX shoots up from 4000 today to 4100 in two days, your put credit spread will be profitable much faster, and you free up collateral...

There are Getting Started links at the top of this page that will help.\n\nHere are a few quick facts to get you started, but please do the reading.\n\n* If you are debit trading, which means paying to open, you want to buy low and sell high. That's the whole game in a nutshell. So for both your trades, you want to sell to close for a higher price than your originally paid. That's really all there is to it.\n\n* If you *can't* sell to close for a higher price, like your put example, you have to decide whether to cut your losses now or continue to hold. Continue to hold **IF AND ONLY IF** there are fact-based reasons for you to believe you'll make enough money to both cover the loss in initial capital AND make you a sufficient profit. This is almost never the case once a trade starts losing.\n\n* As a beginner's rule of thumb, never exercise.\n\n* As a beginner's rule of thumb, never hold options through expiration.\n\n* Later, when you have more experience and are ready for more advanced trading, you can modify those beginner rules.\n\n* Limit price is the price you want *or better* to close (or open, for that matter). So if you bought for $1.00 and want to get a 10% profit, you can set a limit order to close for $1.10. That means you will get *at least* $1.10 when the closing order is filled.

Closing a long option that was bought to open requires selling to close it.  How to sell to close will look different in each broker application.  Speak to your broker about how it works and possibly take some broker specific training.\n\nA limit order indicates you are dictating the amount you are willing to pay (debit) or receive (credit) when making the trade.

Anyway the stock market never works the way I think it would, and I got assigned @ $25 and have been holding the shares until now.\n\nI started working the Wheel, kept doing Short Calls every month, the worst moment was the stock was down to $14, but my Short Call was doing alright, even when it reached $14 I am still like breakeven in the case if I sell all my shares @ $14. Sometimes I am forced to roll up because I am too close to the strike price, but nothing serious so far so good.\n\nUntil the end of December, the stock market started to rebound, at that time the stock price was around $21, and was seeing a lot of big green days. I also learned this from Reddit, the best time to do Short Call is during the big green day, and I been seeing a lot 5% 10% rebound in a day for this stock, so I tried to be safe, did 35 contracts of Short Call @ $28 expires 30th January for like pennies, hoping there is no way to rebound 33% by end of January.\n\nAgain the stock market never works the way I think it would, this month I didn't have much sleep lol, the only good night sleep I can have is during the weekend where the market won't open in the next morning. I watched it climb step by step every 3 days, $22, $24, and then to my Short Put assigned price $25, last week was $26, then last Friday was $27.5 geez. And the price for today is $28.3 lol. Still got 2 more trading days left before expiration, but I couldn't watch it anymore, and I can't guarantee the stock will close below $28 next Monday, so I closed all my Short Call contracts and am now lining up for next month February with lesser contracts Short Calls. With my Short Call winnings for the past 7 months, and with the shares I already have from $25, I don't really need to do a lot of Short Call contracts for February to make up the loss.\n\nSince I only got assigned for 1 contract @ $25 seven months ago, when I did 35 contracts Short Call I was using a margin account. I never really done that many before, and I learned that I need some sort of security deposit in the account to allow me to do so. And during mid January, when it was very volatile, the trading system helped me close positions automatically due to lack of funds in the account. Sometimes I can react in time and make deposits to avoid closing automatically (back then I still believed there was no way it's gonna reach $28). And those deposits weren't cheap, in total I had to chip in another 130K into the account just to stop it from closing more of the contracts.\n\nThe question and advice I am asking here is what would you have done if you were me?\n\n1. Why I did 35 contracts for pennies back then was I was trying to make back some loss from other trades I done before.\n2. I did thought of rolling up during mid January, but back then the option prices were way too high, not realistic at all, so I waited till the last week of this month, hoping the time value goes down, and when I close the positions today, it was at least 100% cheaper if I close during mid January (and back then it was just $25, still thinking no way it will reach $28)\n3. Another dumb thing I should have used my 130k funds better was to invest in other stocks instead of working on this Wheel and miss out opportunities.

You can use a [pricing model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) (like the equation you came up with, but *much* more complicated) to come up with an estimate of the price the contract ought to be at some future date, but the market doesn't have to abide by that estimate.\n\nUpon expiration, the math gets much simpler. All time value goes to zero and only intrinsic value is left, so your equation simplifies to:\n\nValue = Stock Price - Strike Price (assuming the stock price is above the strike by at least $.01).\n\nIf the stock price is at or below the strike upon expiration, the contract is always worthless.\n\n> If that's not the case, and the contract is still just worth $(300 - Decay), then shouldn't I exercise the contract and then sell the shares for profit? I'd be making $(200 - Decay) profit.\n\nYou paid (adjusted) $8 for the call. You make a profit when you can sell it for more than $8. That's it. That's the whole story for profit/loss trading contracts. It has nothing to do with exercise.\n\nLet's say you buy the call for $8 and decide to immediately exercise. You pay $90/share to receive 100 shares with a market price of $95. If you immediately sell the shares, you net a profit of $5/share. *But you paid $8 for the contract*, so you end up with a *loss of $3/share* upon exercising. Not looking so good anymore, right?\n\nMore details about why exercise is not the point of trading contracts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourex", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7789017558097839}, {"body": "Your option value is the bid price obtained on the open market.

Can you please translate what you did?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It is a debit spread\u2026 best used when you go OTM and reduces the BEP.\n\nIf I were bearish, I could sell call credit spread with exact strikes -68c/71c, for 205 premium. but this would be ITM Call Spread, and this makes it more likely to be called early. Notice how with -68/71c I would begin with a credit of 205. With -68/71p I begin with a debit of 95 in hope to win max 205\u2026.\n\nBut -68/71p is better because both legs are OTM and thus reduces the chance of being called early on my -68p leg\u2026\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. A 71P would have costed me 1.90 this noon, which would have made my BEP 68.10. But then I simultaneously sold 68P for 0.94. This gives me 0.95 entry cost, and notice now BEP is at 69.05. Will close for >= $0.70 profit (70 bucks).\n\n2. With same strikes, a call credit spread would net you (roughly) same upfront premium... but -68/71C would both be ITM call credit spreads. In earnings week, starting with ITM legs could be exercised early. Rare, but more possible. \n\nDrawbacks: \n\n1. anything involving short legs will not realise max profit until expiry or until they move significantly below 68. If AMD opens at 67 post earnings, I would not immediately realise 2.05 profit.\n2. if AMD opens at 67 post earnings, I would open with reduced profit even though I am super correct. you notice how my profit target is low, that's because I do not want this to retract to 68 or 69 by Friday...\n\n**When do I choose a call debit v put credit or put debit v call credit if they are the same just reversing when profit is received?** \n\nFor simplicity, let's compare put debit v call credit because we are bearish in this example... I would open a put debit when I am sufficiently bearish, but don't like the BEP. Thus, I dare to play OTM Put. \nWhen I am just \"regular-bearish\" or distrustful of recent rally, I go with OTM call credit spreads. Notice both plays would have been OTM. I would not have opened -68/71C this noon because it would have risked the 68C being called. \n\nWith credit spreads, the logic is you put money where your mouth is. This reduces buying power temporarily. Had I opened ITM -68/71C, I would have put $300 in the market, while getting a refund of $205 upfront. I am fighting to get $95 back, whereas with put debit, I give the market $95, with hope to get $205 back (at most).\n\nI cannot justify going ITM put debit, because now you are risking a lot more, just to get a bit of money. That does not make sense. At that point, do call credit (which would be OTM with the same strikes as you would have with ITM Put debit). \n\nYou cannot be too safe either. The conservative move would be to get at least 50% potential return, to close at 25% return... Why is that? Because as I told you, this would not realise full profit, unless AMD moves to $60 or $55 on E+1. It probably will not. If I play $100 to win $2, that would not be worth my time.  \n\n\nEdit: Cost now using real money + further explanation.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05682039260864258}], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2662302851676941}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42993345856666565}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24741172790527344}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5663812756538391}], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2692990005016327}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05637165531516075}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14453727006912231}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10112116485834122}], "tickers": ["amd", "intc", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Hello, i am very new to the options coming from Spot (mainly forex).

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.\n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 58% and 79%.

I would invest in Nvidia but the PE ratio is too high.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I\u2019m Hurting rn", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good day to double down", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "did that yesterday hahahah", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2643350660800934}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24283313751220703}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1201012134552002}, {"body": "Fuck it 20 contracts at 20c", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13961473107337952}, {"body": "In with 50 contracts", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15539591014385223}, {"body": "I just bought calls at a higher strike.
