People are just gonna keep unloading all their bags when market rallies then get into bonds that pay a guaranteed return.\n\nEDIT: Spy calendar spread, spy puts, Netflix call spread, TSLA puts", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": ">I said weeks ago, i saw a path to exit the bear market....\n\nYou lost what little credibility you had with this self plugging", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5298814177513123}, {"body": "Bear market doesn't end with VIX sitting at 19.8 lol It should spike to somewhere around 40-70 then it will complete bear market.
