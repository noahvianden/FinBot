{"title": "Ford is going to increase production and reduce prices of Mustang Mach-E in 2023, competition is going intense.", "selftext": "Ford announced price reduction of Mustang Mach-E ranges from $600 to $5,900. The price cut looks like a counter measure to Tesla\u2019s massive price cut. Earlier this month, the EV giant Tesla announced a big price cut, putting Model Y, the main competitor of Mustang Mach-E, a price of $53,490 and $56,990 for long range and performance versions without any options. Where previously, the starting price of Model Y was high as $65,990.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nv1ia3d5bdfa1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=754cf793986009bbe2b88b945f40f147fc8f7264\n\nBefore the price cut of both two, Mustang Mach-E had some price advantages over Model Y, but now, price advantage is almost none, they are on the same page. Could imagine that the competition is going intense with these two.\n\nTo ease the pressure on the foreseeable competition, Ford also announced that it\u2019s going to significantly increase the production, though no specific numbers are mentioned. Yes, they better do that to survive in the competition\u2014\u2014a serious drawback of Mustang Mach-E is that the long waiting time for delivery. Based on its website, the estimated waiting time ranges from 18-22 weeks, that is 4-5 months. Whereas Tesla only needs to wait for 1-3 months. Ford\u2019s production seems to have a hard time meeting the demand by looking at the delivery time, if this issue gets relieved as the production increase, Tesla is going to have another competent rival.", "id": "10px53c", "created_utc": 1675166110.0, "score": 346, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "And dealerships will still add dealer markups so the consumer gets fucked no mater what", "score": 151, "replies": [{"body": "How do we short these fucking dealerships?  \n\n\nI'd imagine sooner or later cars will be sold and traded mostly online.

First of all it assumes that rate hikes will be effective at controlling inflation - which frankly seems like quite a stretch to me, given the feds track record, not to mention the fact that inflation is mostly a result of supply side issues like a restriction of oil, which interest rates can do nothing to address specifically. Second, even if it does moderate inflation by wrecking the economy, that might be good enough for those who can keep their jobs, but if unemployment skyrockets that is a tough trade-off to have to make, and to say the Fed \"doesn't give a sh*t\" seems to me to apply just as well to raising interest rates, which may well lead to a lot of people losing their jobs.\n\nBut more broadly, it is just not right to blame the fed and interest rate policy for the structural issues in our economy. Interest rate changes cannot reverse inequality. They can't reform the tax system to be more progressive. They can't address supply side issues by making new investments. They can't even really control inflation, because if the government chooses to radically dial up or down deficit spending, that is going to have strong inflationary and deflationary impacts respectively. And make no mistake, raising interest rates is regressive. It gives people who already have money and opportunity to earn \"risk-free\" income through government securities. That's a policy choice our government makes. It doesn't have to pay above zero interest rates; it doesn't have to issue interest bearing debt at all.

{"title": "Apple\u2019s expected to post its first revenue decline since 2019 on Thursday", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/30/apple-expected-to-post-first-revenue-decline-since-2019-on-thursday-.html\n\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to post its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2019\u2032s March quarter when it reports earnings on Thursday. There are a few contributing factors.\n\nThe company couldn\u2019t build enough of its high-end iPhones when its primary assembly facility in China was shut down for weeks during Covid lockdowns. Customers in many regions noticed as early as November that Apple couldn\u2019t promise Christmas delivery of a new iPhone.\n\nApple gave a rare warning to investors that month explaining that production issues would result in lower shipments than \u201cpreviously anticipated.\u201d It was a data point that caused many analysts watching the stock to cut their estimates.\n\n\u201cWe believe the peak impact of the disruptions was felt in early to mid November as wait times hit an extreme level (link) as the wait time in the US for the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max reached 34 days while wait time in China at the high-end hit 36 days,\u201d UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in January.\n\nAnalysts polled by Refinitiv expect Apple to report just over $121 billion in revenue in the December quarter, which would be a slight decline from the company\u2019s $123.9 billion from a year ago.\n\nBut the problems aren\u2019t Apple-specific. The PC and smartphone markets are slumping as consumers and businesses digest sales from the pandemic and cut costs to prepare for a possible recession.\n\nThe smartphone market saw an 18% decline in shipments in the fourth quarter, according to IDC, the worst decline ever recorded by the market research firm. The PC market fell 28% in the fourth quarter, according to the company. But many investors believe that Apple is outperforming its competitors even in a contracting market.\n\n\u201cWhile the state of consumer demand remains a near-term concern, we believe the underlying drivers of Apple\u2019s model - a growing installed base and spend per user - remain intact, and that the strength/stability of Apple\u2019s ecosystem remains undervalued,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note earlier this month.\n\nHere\u2019s what Wall Street is expecting, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates:\nRevenue: $121.19 billion\nEarnings per share: $1.94 per share\niPhone revenue: $68.29 billion\niPad revenue: $7.76 billion\nMac revenue: $9.63 billion\nOther products revenue: $15.26 billion\nServices revenue: $20.67 billion\n\nApple hasn\u2019t given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty first caused by the pandemic. However, the company usually provides a few data points that can give analysts a sense of how it\u2019s doing.\n\nInvestors want to know whether the shortage of iPhone 14 Pro models in the December quarter will drive demand in the March quarter now that supply has improved.\n\nAnalysts expect just over $98 billion in sales in the March quarter, according to consensus estimates, signifying slight year-over-year growth.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe it\u2019s well understood that Apple\u2019s March quarter revenue should decline at a less-than-seasonal rate due to the pushout of iPhone demand from the December quarter to the March quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Woodring wrote in a note last week, \u201cthe consumer electronics spending backdrop remains challenging, with tablets, PCs and more discretionary products (i.e. wearables) all facing continued demand headwinds.\u201d\n\nBut if consumer confidence erodes in the face of higher interest rates and shrinking savings around the world, then Apple could suggest to investors that the company\u2019s March quarter will be slow.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t expect the resumption of detailed guidance typical of Apple earnings prior to Covid, we expect the commentary to be cautious regarding Product demand across the board,\u201d UBS\u2019s Vogt wrote.\n\nIf management commentary is soft, investors looking for a silver lining might want to look at Apple\u2019s services business, which is profitable and has been growing strongly for years. However, several data points in the fourth quarter, including Apple\u2019s own App Store payouts, suggest a significant slowdown in App Store growth, although analysts are split on its severity.\n\nThe App Store is one of the largest components of services, but it\u2019s only a part of the business, which includes online subscriptions, warranties and search licensing fees. Apple shares could push higher if services such as Apple TV+ and Apple Music look like they\u2019re generating a higher percentage of Apple\u2019s revenue, D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in January.\n\nServices are expected to total $20.67 billion in the December quarter, according to Refinitiv estimates, representing a 5.9% growth rate.\n\nAnalysts will also watch to see if the strong dollar continues to hurt Apple, given that so much of its sales are overseas. During the December quarter, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen all weakened compared to the dollar. Apple management previously said the strong dollar would be a 10 percentage point drag on sales growth.", "id": "10pkib2", "created_utc": 1675128939.0, "score": 1116, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Let Tim Cook", "score": 472, "replies": [{"body": "Apple country, let\u2019s ride! \ud83d\udc34", "score": 142, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s sad this comment isn\u2019t understood here.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Ehh you\u2019d be surprised There are dozens of r/nfl browsers here!", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Mr Big Cook", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02967342920601368}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12699714303016663}, {"body": "You know Mr. Cook\u2019s alter ego don\u2019t you?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07367324084043503}, {"body": "As a Broncos fan I'm pretty stoked on it", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.015709679573774338}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06610941886901855}, {"body": "Hell yeah brother, cheers from nasdaq", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21760699152946472}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Time to get Tim Apple back", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Tim Apple for the win", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "God Blesse Tim Apple", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "\ud83d\ude02", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11179082095623016}, {"body": "He took a PaY CuT leave him alone \ud83e\udd23", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2853962182998657}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2028212547302246}, {"body": "Doesn\u2019t matter you never bet against Tim apple buying calls", "score": 256, "replies": [{"body": "Yep you need to trust him because he knows what he is doing and he is really good player at it.\n\nIt is not only not the first time that he is been in this kind of situation.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "The new and deproved VisuallyImpairedMod", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11120825260877609}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.012730375863611698}, {"body": "Shatgpt has entered the chat", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06748698651790619}, {"body": "Lmfao is this a comment from a human?

{"title": "Snap shares plunge on weak revenue as company again declines to provide a forecast", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/31/snap-earnings-q4-2022.html\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did:\n\nEarnings per share: $0.14, adjusted, versus $0.11 expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts\n\nRevenue: $1.30 billion versus $1.31 billion expected, according to Refinitiv \n\nGlobal Daily Active Users (DAUs): 375 million versus 375.3 million expected, according to StreetAccount\n\nAverage revenue per user: $3.47 versus $3.49 expected, according to StreetAccount\n\n\nRevenue in the quarter was up slightly a year earlier. Like social media peers Meta and Twitter, Snap had a rough 2022, as a slowing economy led businesses to slash their digital ad budgets and Apple\u2019s iOS privacy update limited targeting capabilities.\n\nIn a letter to investors, Snap called it a \u201cchallenging year\u201d that was marked by \u201cmacroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes, and increased competition.\n\nFor the full year, sales rose 12% to $4.6 billion in 2022. And for a third straight quarter, Snap said it wouldn\u2019t provide guidance for the next period.\n\n\u201cOn the monetization side, we anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging, as we expect the headwinds we have faced over the past year to persist throughout Q1,\u201d the company said in the letter.\n\nIt\u2019s an ominous start to fourth-quarter earnings season for ad-supported internet companies. Investors will get a clearer picture of the state of the online ad market later this week. Facebook parent Meta reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, followed by Alphabet and Amazon on Thursday.\n\nMeta shares dropped 2% after Snap\u2019s report. Pinterest, which releases results next week, fell almost 5%.\n\nSnap said it\u2019s refocusing investments to concentrate on growing its community and engagement, accelerating and diversifying its sales growth and developing augmented reality technologies.\n\nAs executives told analysts several times last year, the company\u2019s online ad platform was built to be easy to use and to enable brands to quickly launch campaigns. But its simplicity also meant that companies could quickly pause campaigns, severely impacting Snap\u2019s finances.\n\nSnap announced in August it would lay off 20% of its workforce of over 6,000 employees. The company also shelved several projects during the year, including its photo-taking drone and Snap Originals premium shows.\n\nSnap shares plunged 81% last year.
