Along with a previous price cuts announced in October and recent incentives, the China price for a Model 3 or Model Y was down 13% to 24% from September after the recent move, Reuters calculations showed.\n\nTesla has also cut prices in South Korea, Japan, Australia and Singapore.\n\nAnalysts had said the China price cuts would boost demand and deepen the pressure for its rivals there, including BYD to follow suit in what could become a price war in the largest single market for electric vehicles.\n\nTesla's main market is the United States, and its second largest market is China.\n\nTesla missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter deliveries.\n\nLast month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said \"radical interest rate changes\" had changed the industry-wide outlook and that Tesla could lower pricing to sustain volume growth, which would result in lower profit.", "id": "10amo8n", "created_utc": 1673588970.0, "score": 367, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 325, "comments": [{"body": "Basically the cars are near what they were in 2020 after several rounds of price increases.
