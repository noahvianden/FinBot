An option represents a contract that allows the holder to enact the contract at time of expiration if the contract is itm. This is called exercising a contract. Before retail was biggest option player, options were used to hedge positions. For instance, if you thought tesla ER later this week was not going to go well and had 500 shares of tsla, then you could buy 5 put contracts to hedge your shares in case the price nuked. (each contract represents 100 shares if the strike price is in the money at time of exp). The majority of option players now are (especially 0 dte) are just ppl gambling. So for instance, today the market opened and I had a 183 call that expires tomorrow on QQQ. All today as the market fluctuated it moved 150$ up and down. I ended up selling it at break even - but the point is, at one point I was actually up over $100 on it, but thought the indice might crack above the current bear channel (top resistance at 283) so held onto it. Others probably sold at that point for a profit and then whoever bought it next is buying it thinking the market might break above that resistance too (just like me). Unfortunately, they would not have done so hot this afternoon with that option. Just think of each option contract as 100 shares of intrinsic value (minus daily theta burn and other factors) once the equity price is past the strike mark for the option in play. In the case above, once qqq went above and beyond 383, my option should theoretically have an intrinsic value of the difference between my strike price (383) and the current price (lets say $384) - so would have a intrinsic value of 1$X100 shares = 100$ + premium (the further away from exp the larger the value of the time premium associated with the option). I hope this helps.
