It operates this plant today with a key cell supplier, co-tenant and co-investor in the factory, Panasonic.\n\nThe sprawling factory is known as GF1, Giga Nevada or the original Tesla Gigafactory. It primarily manufactures and supplies Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, vehicle assembly plant with high-voltage battery packs.\n\nRepublican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo revealed details about Tesla\u2019s plans for expansion in the state early on Monday. Tesla confirmed the plans on Tuesday ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings update, which is scheduled for Wednesday after markets close.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk held a ceremony in Nevada in December to kick off deliveries of the company\u2019s Tesla Semi to a key early customer, PepsiCo.\n\nTesla first announced its plans to produce the Semi in 2017, and had a targeted start of production in 2019 that was delayed until 2022. The company is not yet manufacturing a high volume of Semi trucks, but is making some at the Nevada Gigafactory.\n\nFans and critics of Tesla have been posting images of Tesla Semi trucks emblazoned with Pepsi Frito Lay branding that they\u2019ve seen on the road since that announcement, including some broken down on the shoulder.\n\nTesla has yet to reveal publicly how much each truck costs, and did not say how many it has produced or sold in its fourth-quarter deliveries report.\n\nThe company is expected to share further details on its Semi program in its Q4 earnings call.", "id": "10kmuai", "created_utc": 1674611399.0, "score": 297, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "Their next step will be to start buying mines for copper and lithium.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Price of copper has gone up a lot this last month and is forecast to keep increasing.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Elon recently said there's plenty of copper production and that lithium refining is the biggest concern.

It's all about marketing. That's the only thing Elon is good at... well mostly. \n\n\nNumbers that matter are at the very end of the report after 8 pages of photos for you crayon eating monkeys. \n\n\nTESLA IS AN AUTO MANUFACTURER! Even in their comparison charts that's what they compare themselves to. But what they don't compare is apples to apples. Automotive gross margin of Tesla is on a decline after a year where they had the highest prices before they had to cut prices at the end of 22 and beginning of this year. \n\n\nWith lower prices, their margin is going to drop even more. Now add a slowdown in economy to the mix where they will have lower demand, Tesla has probably just posted their best earnings for the next 4-6 quarters. \n\n\nThis is probably peak Tesla in this cycle. Now let's look at their cashflows. Tesla claims to have enough cash to get through the hard times. This quarter alone, they have used up 15% of their cash from end of Q3. \n\n\nTesla also has an increase in inventory which is not huge but not a great sign. If everything is going so great, we need to see the opposite. \n\n\nTL:DR This is a warning post for those of you who think Tesla has dropped \"enough.\" When you compare it with other auto manufacturers you see the disconnect. Sooner or later TSLA will be valued just like other auto manufacturers.
