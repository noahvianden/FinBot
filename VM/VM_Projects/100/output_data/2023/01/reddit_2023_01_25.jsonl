It operates this plant today with a key cell supplier, co-tenant and co-investor in the factory, Panasonic.\n\nThe sprawling factory is known as GF1, Giga Nevada or the original Tesla Gigafactory. It primarily manufactures and supplies Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, vehicle assembly plant with high-voltage battery packs.\n\nRepublican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo revealed details about Tesla\u2019s plans for expansion in the state early on Monday. Tesla confirmed the plans on Tuesday ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings update, which is scheduled for Wednesday after markets close.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk held a ceremony in Nevada in December to kick off deliveries of the company\u2019s Tesla Semi to a key early customer, PepsiCo.\n\nTesla first announced its plans to produce the Semi in 2017, and had a targeted start of production in 2019 that was delayed until 2022. The company is not yet manufacturing a high volume of Semi trucks, but is making some at the Nevada Gigafactory.\n\nFans and critics of Tesla have been posting images of Tesla Semi trucks emblazoned with Pepsi Frito Lay branding that they\u2019ve seen on the road since that announcement, including some broken down on the shoulder.\n\nTesla has yet to reveal publicly how much each truck costs, and did not say how many it has produced or sold in its fourth-quarter deliveries report.\n\nThe company is expected to share further details on its Semi program in its Q4 earnings call.", "id": "10kmuai", "created_utc": 1674611399.0, "score": 297, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "Their next step will be to start buying mines for copper and lithium.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Price of copper has gone up a lot this last month and is forecast to keep increasing.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Elon recently said there's plenty of copper production and that lithium refining is the biggest concern.
