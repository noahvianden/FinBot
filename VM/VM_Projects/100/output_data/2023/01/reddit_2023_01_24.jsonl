{"title": "Tech Layoffs, Signal?", "selftext": "There\u2019s been a lot of news about tech layoffs in recent weeks, just thought I\u2019d collate some of the big ones and put some context in as well:\n\n- Google / Alphabet. Ended last year with about 188,000 employees. Announced cuts of 12,000 recently. Leaves them at 175,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\n- Microsoft. Ended last year with about 221,000 employees. Announced cuts of 10,000 recently. Leaves them at roughly 211,000. Comfortably more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\n- Facebook / Meta. Ended last year with about 87,000 employees. Announced cuts of 11,000 recently. Leaves them at 76,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\nSo my takeaways are:\n- The headlines of \u2018woah 10,000 jobs cut\u2019 sound like a lot. And they obviously are and each of those jobs is a person who now is out of work, not minimising that. But in % terms they\u2019re not that big a reduction when you see the context of how big these workforces are.\n\n- All these companies are still comfortably larger in terms of headcount than they were just 2 years ago. Facebook is double the headcount it was in 2018. Google and Microsoft aren\u2019t quite 2x as big but aren\u2019t far off.\n\n- Revenue and profit haven\u2019t fallen at these giant co\u2019s yet but they seem to be cutting in advance of that happening based on their own forecasts or expectations. \n\n- Obviously there\u2019s plenty more tech companies out there that have announced cuts but these are a decent proxy for the sector cause of their size and cause we can compare where they were 5 years ago to now (cause they\u2019ve been around for a while).\n\nDo you think there\u2019s more layoffs to come?
