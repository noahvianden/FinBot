As you can see in the screenshot, a month ago, the odds were at 35.1%, a week ago it was at 62.6%, yesterday it was at 76.7%, and today, once we received the inflation report, that number has flown to 92%.\n\nSo with that being said, even though we haven't heard anything concrete from the Fed as to whether they'll go for a 25 or a 50 hike, it looks like the market has made up its mind.\n\nThe risk here is obvious. If Powell does decide to go with another 50bps, then there would be a massive sell-off.\n\nAs a side note, the bond market continues to price in a fair chance of rate cuts in the later half of this year. There is only a 10% chance being priced in that the Fed rate is >5% by EOY. This is at a big contrast to what Powell has been saying which is a) No rate cuts in 2023 b) Plan to stay at 5.25% for some extended time.\n\nIn other words, the bond market doesn't believe in what Powell is dishing out, and the market believes that Powell is bluffing.\n\nSource: [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)\n\nEdit: Adding more numbers\n\nFor the March 2023 Fed meeting, the market is pricing in a 18% chance that there will be no rate hike. Meaning that the bond market sees a 18% chance of there being a 25bp hike in Feb, and that will be the last hike. But there is a 80.2% chance of there being a 25bp rate hike in Feb and another one in March. If we see the market trend higher over the coming weeks, I would expect to see that 0bp hike in March rising higher than 18%.", "id": "10a624f", "created_utc": 1673546436.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 264, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds like a good set up for JPOW to tackle a rally with a 50 basis point hike.", "score": 480, "replies": [{"body": "My cash reserves are waiting for the bloodbath", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "Dude same but my fomo is getting out of control", "score": 43, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23936647176742554}, {"body": "You should start buying best of breed dividend companies", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "My portfolio is 80% divi stocks and my monthly contributions all go towards those", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Care to share any favorites?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "MSFT, O, ARCC, MO, CSCO, PFE, AEP, INTC, UNP, WPC are my top holdings.

There are still too many variables that are playing against a lasting decrease in inflation (job market being a huge one). I don\u2019t think we get .25 until at least the fed meeting after this month\u2019s. Powell has been vocal about the fact that the market rallying doesn\u2019t help the fed\u2019s efforts and this is too easy of an opportunity for him to pull the rug with another .50 hike.

Energy may trade higher for a while and that could add noise to this trend near-term, but energy usage is largely a product of demographics \\* energy efficacy. The reality is the countries which consume the most oil today will have flat or declining populations over the next few decades. Meanwhile green energy solutions and overall energy efficiency will continue to improve.\n\nAgain I've been saying this for a while now, but the market now finally seems to understand the longer Powell waits to pivot the lower rates will need to go.
