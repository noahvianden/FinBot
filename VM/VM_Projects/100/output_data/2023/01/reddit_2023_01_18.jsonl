Responsible people must make risk vs reward decisions all the time. We should not glorify people who take undue risks especially when it comes to their children. \n\nFor example, I think I would be a great mayor of my town. I think I have the abilities to do the job well, I tend to get along with people (outside of reddit \ud83d\ude43), and I would enjoy the work. However I also have kids to support and bills to pay, so I'm not willing to give up my good paying job to work for the city government, nor am I willing to dip into my savings to fund a political campaign, which might fail. So I stay with my current employer even though I think I have more potential as a person in another path. Totally sensible outcome that prioritizes what matters.
