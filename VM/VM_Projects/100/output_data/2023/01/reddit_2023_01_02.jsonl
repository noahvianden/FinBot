Neither Berlin or Austin hit their 5k per week targets by year-end, but in the grand scheme of things who cares? They\u2019ll be there in a couple months. \n\nThe markets are a mess and nobody is trading this hellscape, so deliveries be damned - let\u2019s focus on what actually matters. Tesla telegraphed the unwinding of the end of quarter wave, production is more important.\n\nAs it stands they still haven\u2019t built up enough inventory to smooth the wave. We know they hit a logistics limit for quarter-end in multiple markets, but they still haven\u2019t got enough inventory to smooth that yet. The discrepancy between these numbers will continue for several more quarters. This will lead to more doom-mongering because suddenly Telsa has inventory available, but speaking from personal experience of this quarters delivery wave, not much has changed in the past few years. I traded my Tesla for a fresh one on the 22nd December, there were multiple trucks unloading while I was there and talking to the team they were doing over 100 deliveries per day from that location, but they\u2019d run out of vehicles and had nothing available a week earlier.

They\u2019re now at 1m cells every 8 days, from a million cells in 8 months in February. And that still appears to all be from Kato.

This year was considerably better as I was up 10.8% while the SP500TR was down 18.3%.\n\nThese returns are after all transaction costs (only option contract fees) and account for a 15% tax rate on qualified dividends and a 40% tax rate on option premium.  \n\n3.8% of the outperformance came from dividends, 4% from option premium, and the rest from appreciation of the underlyings that formed the core portfolio (heavily buoyed by a 35% healthcare and 13% oil allocation).\n\nThe underlyings in the core portfolio were:\n\nSymbol & Percent Of Account\n\nABBV  6.61% \n\nBEN  0.72% \n\nBMY  8.82% \n\nBTI  1.63% \n\nCAH  2.09% \n\nGILD  2.34% \n\nHPQ  1.83% \n\nIGGHY  0.13% \n\nJPM  3.65% \n\nLEG  1.76% \n\nMMM  4.90% \n\nMO  6.23% \n\nMRK  9.07% \n\nNTDOY  0.71% \n\nOGN  0.11% \n\nPEP  2.46% \n\nPFE  6.98% \n\nPM  9.65% \n\nSLV  0.60% \n\nSWBI  1.18% \n\nT  2.51% \n\nUNM  1.12% \n\nVTRS  1.06% \n\nVZ  4.83% \n\nWBA  4.07% \n\nWBD  0.44% \n\nWU  1.88% \n\nXLE  5.96% \n\nXOM  7.51%\n\nThe majority of the premium came from selling 10 to 20 delta strangles or wide iron condors on SPY, IWM, QQQ, TLT, GLD, and XOP with SPY representing the overwhelming majority of premium followed by TLT and GLD with IWM/QQQ/XOP barely making a difference because I did not end up using these for most of the year other than a little at the beginning.\n\nI adapted Tasty strategies to meet my needs for simplicity and spreading risk across time.  \n\nI sold options at 42 DTE (not 45) , managed at 40% profit or 21 DTE and I spread my buying power across 3 weeks.\n\nFor example, let's say I had enough buying power to sell 9 SPY strangles, 3 TLT strangles, and 3 GLD strangles.  Here is what I did:\n\nWeek 1: sell 3 SPY strangles, 1 TLT strangle, 1 GLD strangle all at 42 DTE, and enter a GTC order to buy back at 40% profit\n\nWeek 2: sell 3 SPY strangles, 1 TLT strangle, 1 GLD strangle all at 42 DTE, and enter a GTC order to buy back at 40% profit\n\nWeek 3: sell 3 SPY strangles, 1 TLT strangle, 1 GLD strangle all at 42 DTE, and enter a GTC order to buy back at 40% profit\n\nWeek 4: manage any of the strangles still left from week 1 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE\n\nWeek 5: manage any of the strangles still left from week 2 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE\n\nWeek 6: manage any of the strangles still left from week 3 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE\n\nWeek 7: manage any of the strangles still left from week 4 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE, etc...\n\nThis became a very simple way of keeping these trades going and took very minimal effort.\n\nThere were many times in the year when I thought the market would take a large move one way or the other and so I switched to selling wide iron condors ($5-10 wide wings in TLT/GLD and $10-20 wide wings in SPY).  Prior to the election and through almost all of December I took all options off because I was convinced there was going to be a tremendous downward move in the market.\n\nBoth of these decisions (switching to iron condors and pausing selling options for about 2 months toward the end of the year) cost me because I wasn't even close to being right and my strategy would have continued to be profitable.  If I had just kept going I probably would have had an additional 20% option premium gains.\n\nThere were a few times my condor wings were tested to the upside and I ended up managing them by rolling or switching from one $10 wide to two $5 wide.  I didn't enjoy this at all and it probably would have been much easier for me to manage these if they were just strangles. \n\nI have portfolio margin on my account but I used a tiny fraction of my buying power, never exceeding a notional value of shares controlled via options higher than 1x my portfolio and being way under that for most of the time. \n\n**What went right:**\n\n* My strategy was very simple to implement and didn't take much time (a few minutes every Friday)\n* I collected 6%+ in option premium (4% after taxes) which makes the efforts of the past 3 years worth it since I believe I have done so in a way I can replicate in the future using a fraction of the time it has taken me in the past\n* My underlyings really helped me finish out the year with a gain and were responsible for most of my outperformance compared to the S&P 500\n\n**What went wrong:**\n\n* Every time I de-risked by switching to iron condors or stopped selling altogether because I was certain the market was going to crash, I was wrong and I lost out on a significant amount of premium because of this - I estimate premium collected would have been closer to 5% instead of 4%\n* My option premium collected would have been about 4.5% instead of 4% it wasn't for all the contract fees\n* Losing iron condors are much harder to manage than losing strangles\n* I wanted to do some tax-loss harvesting to offset premium gains but I ended up chickening out because I don't want to be out of the market and have one of my stocks jump on an earnings release or something.  I would have had to have sold 25% of my total portfolio just to come up with enough losses to offset my premium gains.\n\n **What is next:** \n\n* I feel like I have a fairly refined system now and I don't need to make major changes going forward. I'd like to use a bit more of my buying power and be a little more disciplined about sticking to the strategy despite my opinions of market direction.  I know that naked strangles are far easier to manage than iron condors but this is tough for me because I still feel like the market has the potential for a large drop that would blow past a 20 delta put.  Right now the best I can think of is that if I am going to change the way I act based on this opinion instead of iron condors I either sell fewer strangles each week and/or sell at closer to 10 delta than 20 delta.  \n* I am looking into a more commission friendly way to sell premium but I really don't want to switch brokers to RH or WeBull for this.  I may just see how much I save by not doing iron condors and see if that makes a difference.\n\nMy list of those to thank is the same as in my 2021 post so I won't repeat that here.

This happened to me earlier in the year on SPY and IWM.  Here is how it would work:\n\nLet's say IWM is at 182 and I have a contract that is 180 short and 190 long call.  I would roll that out in time and switch it to two contracts that are 182 short and 187 long.  This uses the same buying power but collects more premium.  If some time passed and IWM was 184 I would roll out in time 2 contracts that were 184 short call and 192 long.  This adds risk to the trade but at least lets me use time and market fluctuation to my advantage.  With each roll I would also sell the corresponding put spread to collect more credit and would stop looking for a profit and would just buy things back whenever I could break even.\n\nI know that is not necessarily the best way to manage a trade since I could probably have ended up in the same spot over time if I just took the loss and re-sold a new iron condor but mentally it felt like I was \"not losing\" even though all I did in reality was open several sub-optimal trades that I never would have if I hadn't started off trying to fix a loser.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6263890862464905}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1624654233455658}, {"body": "That\u2019s impressive!
