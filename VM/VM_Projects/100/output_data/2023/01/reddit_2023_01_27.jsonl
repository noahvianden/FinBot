A lot of people seem to be putting blind faith in that by 2025 Intel will have their fabs built and making money cause thats in their roadmap.

They are pouring massive production capacities into energy storage, which would not be possible if they were short of batteries. Also, some people are expecting more future margin ($/kWh) on energy storage than on the car business, so it would make sence keep the car business growing at \"only\" 40-50% and prioritizing the storage business when there would be a lack of batteries (or demand in case of a severe recession).
