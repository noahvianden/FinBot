If many don\u2019t pay or simply cannot pay, what long term effects will this have on the economy? Will it ruin their credit and if so what long term effects will that have on the borrower.

{"title": "Costco Wholesale Corporation. (COST) Stock Review 01/15/2023", "selftext": "As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advice. Always do you own due diligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions and hope to have a civil discussion.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company\u2019s business model\n\n\u00a7 Costco is a vertically integrated wholesale club store and ecommerce site. To access the store, you must be a member which comes with an annual fee.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? \n\n\u00a7 The company collects revenue through selling goods and services as well as its membership fee.\n\no Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or at a regular interval?\n\n\u00a7 As a staple retailer their goods are purchased very frequently and across all economic environments. Their core merchandise categories are Food and Sundries, Non-foods and Fresh Foods.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n\u00a7 No. They have an interest coverage ratio of 50x and operate with $0.42 of debt for every $1.00 of equity.\n\no Is their balance sheet well suited for a downturn and why?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. They consistently have positive operating cash flow and are in a staple business. Additionally, they have \\~$11 billion in cash as of last quarter. They operate with a Cash Conversion ratio that ranges between -2 and 6 days indicating their highly liquid inventory and cash management.\n\no Are there any large deviations in Operating Income and Operating Cash Flow and if so, why?\n\n\u00a7 No, OI and OCF margins are nearly identical over short- and long-term averages.\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. Despite having relatively low debt, they have stunningly high ROEs. They averaged 27% whereas the consumer staples industry overall is at 7.8%. This occurs while they are still able to grow revenue at nearly a 10% clip over the past few years.\n\no Are there major company specific risks?\n\n\u00a7 None that I am aware of.\n\n\u00b7 **Can the company be replicated?**\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n\u00a7 Costco has industry leading scale, vertical integration and a no-frills model leading to a low-cost provider position.\n\n\u00a7 Scale: Costco has far fewer products in their store compared to other retailers but is one of the largest volume stores. This gives them enormous pricing power. If you are big laundry, would you want Costco to drop you?\n\n\u00a7 Their vertical integration is probably the least understood advantage of Costco. For example, Costco orders directly from the manufacturer and meets their orders at docks or has them directly dropped off at their stores. Additionally, Costco Wholesale Industries, a division of the Company, operates manufacturing businesses, including special food packaging, optical laboratories, meat processing and jewelry distribution. These businesses have a common goal of providing members with high quality products at substantially lower prices. This also allows them to avoid markups that other retailers pay as they don\u2019t have these investments. \n\n\u00a7 By owning the production and having a strong store brand in the form of Kirkland Signature, they have additional leverage to squeeze excess costs from other product providers. In other words, Kirkland is preferred to many name brands meaning Costco can pass if they don\u2019t feel terms are agreeable. \n\n\u00a7 According to Craig Jelinek, the Company's CEO and director, \"Costco is able to offer lower prices and better values by eliminating virtually all the frills and costs historically associated with conventional wholesalers and retailers, including salespeople, fancy buildings, delivery, billing and accounts receivable. We run a tight operation with extremely low overhead which enables us to pass dramatic savings to our members.\"\n\n\u00a7 Putting it all together Costco operates with a gross margin of 12%, a net margin of 2.5% with ROEs of 27%. The staples industry has a 30.7% gross margin, 4.3% net margin and ROEs of 7.8%. \n\n\u00a7 All this value is enabled by their membership fee. You could think of the operating business as a massive non-profit but the membership as pure profit. Roughly 90% of their profits can be attributed to revenue from the membership fee. Given the tremendous value of the membership, they have significant pricing power to raise it. Especially with \\~92% retention rate, this implies the average customer stays with them for 12.5 years.\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n\u00a7 Costco got its start in 1983 and since then has only continued to gobble up market share. In an industry that has almost no switching costs and has been upset by the internet, Costco remains a pillar of financial strength.\n\n\u00a7 Above I made the argument that Costco is the low-cost provider. The obvious challenger to this is Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart by comparison operates with a 25% gross margin (double Costco) and ROEs have averaged around 16% over the past 5 years (little less than half of Costco). Walmart\u2019s higher margins are not being borne out with higher returns on equity. Costco really is king!\n\no Is technology likely to serve or harm the company?\n\n\u00a7 I don\u2019t believe so. Costco\u2019s strengths are really being the low-cost provider. It does seem that Costco is lagging in ecommerce and delivery to homes. Having said that, low-cost provider is a timeless trait (assuming it upkept).\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n\u00a7 Absolutely not. Costco has about $20 billion of equity on the books. Costco offers a unique blend of low profit margins and high returns on capital. For a would-be new entrant, the low margins without scale are likely to be a fairly difficult hurdle.\n\no Are there structural reasons why the supply of new competition is likely to be limited?\n\n\u00a7 No, there is nothing unique about the industry that would stop competition. While I just argued that competing with Costco on price is likely to be a losing battle, there are many other ways retailers can offer value to customers, such as convenience or service.\n\no Are there structural reasons why customers are likely to stay with the company?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. Costco has cemented itself as the low-cost provider. As mentioned above, this has enabled customers to on average stay with the company for 12.5 years.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n\u00a7 Most of the model is based on the combination of simple businesses at scale with a willingness to adhere to a no-frills model.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n\u00a7 Retail has always been a blood bath of changing industry leaders. Having said that, I don\u2019t see any obvious challengers to disrupting their low-cost provider position. They seem to be outcompeting Walmart as Walmart has focused its efforts on convenience to take Amazon on in ecommerce. \n\n\u00b7 **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, revenue has gone up every year in the last 10 and earnings have nearly gone up every year in the last 10.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n\u00a7 It will likely be close. In recent years, growth has been well more than 7%, but prior to covid, growth was mixed around the 7% figure. Costco is well loved in China and expanding there giving them a long runway.\n\n\u00b7 **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? \n\n\u00a7 Yes\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n\u00a7 Yes\n\n\u00b7 **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n\u00a7 Costco currently pays a dividend of $3.60 per share. I will assume a $3.80 dividend going forward for the next 3 years.\n\n\u00a7 Share dilution has been minimal. I will assume a 0 to 0.25% increase in shares over the next 3 years.\n\n\u00a7 Analysts estimate that revenue ending 08/31/2026 is expected to be $297.9 billion. Given the steadiness and predictability of their model I will assume revenues will be 5% above and below in the bull/bear case.\n\n\u00a7 Costco\u2019s FCF margins have been around 2.25% over the last decade. I will assume a 2 to 3% bear and bull margin for a midpoint of 2.5%.\n\n\u00a7 FCF Yields have historically been around 1.8% to 3.8%. I will assume the same.\n\n\u00a7 Putting the above together we get an estimated value of $629 in August of 2026.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n\u00a7 A company with the consistency of Costco isn\u2019t likely to need a high a discount rate to warrant purchase. For me, an investment in Costco should be expected to yield 8% or more. Given its current price of $485, this implies an annual return of 8.15% per year. To that end, per my assumptions it seems that Costco is fairly valued.\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:COST](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:COST)\n\nInvestor Data: [https://investor.costco.com/overview/default.aspx](https://investor.costco.com/overview/default.aspx)", "id": "10cl5i5", "created_utc": 1673792819.0, "score": 445, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "Everything you said makes makes sense and is all technically sound, but 2 things that need to be said about Costco are:\n\n\u2022 Brand affinity & love: Costco has earned consumer trust through many years and deliberate strategy.

But Costco has been stagnant in feature growing their tech side(app,  online shopping,  scan and go, order pickup, managing their delivery and associated features online etc). I would argue members mark quality is equal to Kirkland as a brand. Both stores are incredibly similar in layout, services, and product. Sam's club is more consistent while Costco is more sporadic by design.

Don't know anything about BJs.\n\nScan and go is really different than self check out. Covid also made order pickup an expectation and Costco won't manage that.

Sam's club is also cheaper than Costco on the product side. \n\nThat said, they appeal to 2 different demographics and Costco may keep that upper middle class market that keeps their profitability higher. The average income for members is feels pretty different as well. Costco also has a bigger international market from what I can tell(china,  Japan,  NZ etc) where sams club doesn't really have a market. Costco used to be separated by their quality of treatment of employees and their wages being higher than a lot of minimum wages. Their wages are stagnant now and the current CEO is less employee friendly. Both my local Costco and Sam's club have great staff but I think Costco might lose some of that appeal that led them to have highly motivated members.\n\nThis is just the perception from someone who uses both regularly.

Additionally, warehouse management software companies are starting to shift towards integration with autonomous mobbile robots, automated picking and transit systems, etc. Essentially there are three or four technologies that are going to be unlocked in the next 1-3 years, AND the centralized management systems for material movement and logistics are becoming more integrated.\n\nTLDR: the one thing I disagree about is Costco will not be served by new tech.

Also Sams is investing heavily in having self checkouts and app based checkouts. Site to store is a thing for Sams and you can order things off the website to be picked up in store. Costco really doesnt have anything like it. Thats said I see cashiers as faster and more efficient, but Sams has some benefits.
