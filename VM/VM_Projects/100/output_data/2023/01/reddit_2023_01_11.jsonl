{"title": "CPI Prediction and Analysis\u2026. 1-11-23 SPY and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Twas the eve of CPI markets put in a nice low volume green day to day. Roughly its standard $4 +/- move. \n\nLets take a look at my predictions for CPI. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w0xsbxizhba1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cfc36747f832ad3e779c90fff2ed9b8ae0ce3b1\n\nCurrently I expected a bear on everything but CORE MoM. The one oddity going into this CPI is that the Cleveland fed has an oddly high MoM CPI/ CORE estimate. They are estimating about 0.5% for each. Which for CPI MoM is about 0.5% higher than Bloomberg and consensus and for CORE MoM is 0.2% higher than its estimates. The standard variance is about 0.2% however we have seen a few 0.3 to 0.5% variance outlier this year. \n\nIn my opinion main focus is going to be on CORE YoY. As long as CORE YoY comes in lower I expect a decent green 2-2.5% green open. However, IF CORE was to come in unchanged especially with a miss on CORE MoM I would brace for a 2.5-3% red open. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oy162ntkzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b820821a2f15e12b039ed79beaaac087982bd31\n\nInterestingly JPM is calling for a green day (85% probability) IF CPI YoY comes in below 6.6%. Currently per my estimates we have a 66% chance of CPI YoY being 6.5 to 6.6% and a 33% chance of it being 6.7%. \n\nJPM has weighted their probability correctly (granted their reactions usually are 100% wrong) correctly the last 3 or 4 CPIs. Will be interested to see if they are correct today. They are pricing in a much lower reaction than the least 2-3 CPIs. \n\nFor instance December CPI their \u201cgame plan\u201d had a 70% chance of a beat with 50% chance of a 2-3% rally and 15% chance of a 4-5% rally. In November they had waited a 65% chance of a green day with 40% chance of a 1% to 1.5% rally and a 20% chance of a 2.5% to 3.5% rally. ( I tried to find their October prediction but cant). \n\nThis is the highest percent probability of a green reaction that JPM has given spy. The most interesting thing about tomorrow is looking at overall IV and options premiums for similar positions I played last time everything is very \u201ccheap.\u201d Granted last CPI we were faced with back to back CPI/ FOMC so everything was really jacked up but even compared to November a similar position for tomorrow that one would have played for Decembers is about 50-60% cheaper. IV is also about 20-30% lower than previous. The way I see it markets are NOT pricing in a huge reaction like the last few CPIs. Which is honestly surprising being that the last four CPIs average a +/- 2.6% open and all the CPIs from this year average a 1.8% +/- open. \n\nWe are either being set up for a huge let down like May which opened at -0.02% or options are going to pay out extremely well at open tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31kawdalzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae450370433ff7a834864880222451fe6335df1\n\nGonna keep this brief as we are gonna most likely see some sort of 2-4% +/- move and we will pick up where the dust settles tomorrow. The biggest thing to note on the daily is that we have the daily 8 and 20ema crossover which is extremely bullish going forward (regardless of CPI). In addition we broke through the possible channel resistance and with a beautiful cup and handle forming, closing back within the previous 393 to 402 channel I would not be surprised to see us close well within the 400s tomorrow. My key targets are 402.3 (+1.7%) -> 405.2 (+2.4%) -> 410.3 (+3.7%). With a great market reaction to CPI tomorrow we might actually retest the resistance that markets established last CPI. The \u201cbear market resistance\u201d line sits at 401.5 if we break through and close over that tomorrow I would officially say the downtrend is confirmed over and that we are in either a very long consolidation (which most bear markets do see) or we are starting a VERY slow up trend (not to be confused with a bull market returning). \n\nSpeaking of bear/ bull markets\u2026 tomorrow (or later this week/ next week) IF spy breaks back over 417.73 (5.6%+) or SPX breaks back over 4189 that effectively ends the current bear market per definition (its considered a \u201cbull market\u201d when the ticker moves up by more than 20%). \n\nWhile I remain fairly bullish for tomorrow and I really do think we are going to have a pretty impressive green day tomorrow (3-4%) I am cautious that we may have been led out to pasture with this one. If we were to react negatively to MoM or something else for CPI tomorrow the reaction is going to be extremely bearish. I would not be surprised to see -4 to -5% red day tomorrow if ALGOs choose to go that way. Key support I would watch at 390.1 (-1.4%) -> 382.6 (-3.3%) -> 378 (-4.5%).\n\n381.4 is the current red bull channel support that I am watching if we do get a huge red day but hold that support we could still end up on a bigger bull move. \n\nThe other pending question for tomorrow is can the markets actually find the strength to hold a rally intraday and after CPI? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pain8stlzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc81f0b637a60cf4905f97e9e21beb845cec600f\n\nTesla remains an unknown. While when it broke through 123 that was extreme bullish the fact that it loss that momentum and actually ended up closed effectively on the channel resistance is not as bullish. I am relatively bullish on Tesla regardless of the market. This is the first time we have had 3 back to back closes over the daily 8ema since the beginning of December. We have not had 4 closes over the daily 8ema since the last week of October. \n\nCurrent momentum gives Tesla a push to test resistance at the daily 20ema and the broad blue bear channel support at 134.4 tomorrow (+9%). However, if we get a bad CPI it will lose this black bull channel and the daily 8ema again I would not hesitate to open some next Friday DTE puts on tesla with the likely hood we see it break $100 early next week. \n\nThe way I see it looking at most tickers is that everyone is absolutely on an edge and tomorrow we might FINALLY get a push off or from the edge. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9i8dg7pzhba1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f3c41f095aef28793c98777b276a7e0103d6938\n\nRelatively speaking a 2.43% green day on the VIX is pretty minimal going into CPI. The day before December CPI had a 9.6% spike for reference, however, Novembers barely spiked 2% also. The fact the VIX remained low despite an important and volatile day tomorrow is one of the main reasons we have such cheap premiums. \n\nI still think with algos catching onto good data the call side will pay out very well tomorrow, however if we get a deep red open and a really negative algo reaction with the VIX at 21 we should expected an easy 15-20% spike on that which is going to rocket premiums and the payouts are going to be pretty incredible. \n\nI will be tuned in to the charts at 830am to see what the markets bring us! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srn3px8nzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=48fd98ae3f4f22ed042407c5f25050eb7a09f6e4\n\nSomething else to note is that we have Harker speaking who is a voting member but is considered neutral to dovish speaking at 730am before. We also have bullard who is currently seen as the most hawkish FOMC member (but non voting) speaking at 1130am and at 1240 we get Barkin who is also hawkish but non voting. \n\nWe also get more jobless data at 830am also. There is a lot of data for algos to unpack at 830am . I still favor a bullish reaction especially if we actually do get a negative or 0% MoM CPI. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxqzcpmnzhba1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=f378a541c5084cc8d876ba4d3dbb5f921dda4f04\n\nToday was a total crap shoot of trading. The premiums for 1, 2 and 6dte were so inflated cause of CPI that it took such an incredibly large move up to net any real profits. For instance a 2dte that I watched and held partially had a total $1.2 move and only saw 11% gains max. That should have been a pretty easy 25-30% win. \n\nThe trend was also so slow and for most of the day we traded within a $2 range that we weren\u2019t able to get the big moves we needed to spike premiums. Today in hindsight was exactly like yesterday. High volatility with selling volume in the morning followed by a recovery and a slow move green all day long. It showed tons of weakness but never could get the reversal. \n\nRegardless of watch CPI brings tomorrow\u2026 I just hope it brings movement back to the markets and we can break out of this two month long consolidation.", "id": "109jd7z", "created_utc": 1673479324.0, "score": 160, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "I have puts, so my guess is we have a green day tomorrow.", "score": 168, "replies": [{"body": "I have calls...\n\n...so we trade flat and we both loose \ud83d\ude02", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "And I'm selling both.
