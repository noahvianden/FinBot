{"title": "Meta repurchased shares at the exact wrong time in FY 2021. Now is the time for aggressive stock buybacks.", "selftext": "Full article at SA.\n\n>Meta could fairly easily afford to repurchase $10B of its shares each quarter, especially if the company were to recalibrate its investments in the Reality Labs business. Based off of Meta Platforms' Q3'22 cash flow statement, the company spent $6.35B on Class A stock buybacks in the third-quarter and $21.09B in the first nine months of FY 2022. In FY 2021, however, Meta Platforms repurchased $44.54B of its shares and the company did so at a significantly higher valuation. The tech company paid an average of $330 per-share in FY 2021 and therefore paid a massively inflated price to buy back a ton of its own stock just when the stock price peaked.\n\n>Plotting Meta Platforms' stock buybacks against the P/E ratio shows that Meta Platforms repurchased a ton of its shares at the exact wrong time: when the pandemic and advertisers temporarily inflated the firm's revenue growth, Meta Platforms' market cap was at an all-time high\u2026 and when the stock was historically expensive.\n\n>\tMeta Platforms is trading at $120 right now and the share price hasn't been this low since the start of 2017 (with the exception of the October/November 2022 draw-down) and, at a P/E ratio of 15.2 X, I believe Meta Platforms is at an attractive valuation level to warrant a material up-size in its stock buyback. At the end of the September-quarter, the tech company had $17.78B in its stock authorization remaining, and Meta Platforms could very well exhaust this program in FY 2023. Right now is possibly the best time since 2017 for Meta Platforms to reevaluate its capital allocation strategy and buy back more of its stock while reducing its investments in the Reality Labs business.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Meta redirect Reality Labs spending towards aggressive buybacks?", "id": "1027i7o", "created_utc": 1672750541.0, "score": 430, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 401, "replies": [{"body": "Let me teach you how to trade with my million dollar strategy.

Tesla is making money, while the others are losing money, though.  As an example, what happens if Ford falls?

We watched the whole union-baiting play out.  But even with that gone, this theoretically gives Ford, GM, and Stellantis a bit more wiggle room, even if Tesla is going to be the big winner.\n\nThings got a little weird at the end of last year, though, when it became clear that pretty much anybody can get this money as long as they jump through a hoop or two.\n\nThe political ramifications are going to be interesting to watch as the primary battles in the U.S. start to shape up at the end of this year.  This program is going to cost somewhere between $5 and $10 billion for just the first year, and if inflation does not come back down, people might start asking extremely uncomfortable questions about why so much of that is going to foreign carmakers.\n\nFinal thought: it's unlikely that the IRA is going to help the legacy carmakers all that much.  Tesla is the only one with the production to really take advantage of the money-machine.  GM might see a bit of a boost as well, but they have shown an incredible ability to squander every opportunity they manage to scratch out of the dirt.  \n\nEveryone else still had the old subsidy active.  So all this really does is take the most efficient EV maker and suddenly throw $7500 per car at them.  This means that Tesla has an extra $7500 margin to play around with while the rest of the industry is going to have to sacrifice a good chunk of the subsidy \\*they were already getting\\* just to keep their market share steady.  They were already losing money, so it's unclear just how far they can take this.\n\nPlus, I do not know what the dealerships are going to do.  Even if Ford, for example, were to drop prices, the dealerships might just choose to take the difference for themselves.  We'll have to see what happens there.\n\nSo this was a lot to write to just say \"I agree with you.\"  We'll have to see if people figure out that this was just a bailout.

The nice thing about the dealership model is it allows ultimate price discovery and price discrimination. If EV demand tanks during a recession you will see dealerships moving EVs for as low as they can. If dealerships are still jacking up prices that is a good sign, as it means EV demand is healthy and still has room to run.\n\nAgree the politics of this is going to be interesting between now and Nov 2024. We are very focused on the vehicle aspects of the IRA, but Biden's massive spending program has opened up huge fields for debate.

I bet even if every Tesla bought FSD at that cost it still wouldn\u2019t be enough. They\u2019d need an expensive subscription.\nSelling the thing at 15K is a big ask right now. and that\u2019s with most people assume that was for something that will eventually fully self-drive.\nIf the wide release is just semi-autonomous people aren\u2019t going to want to pay. \n\nIt\u2019s a cool tech demo like the Asimo robot or the many many cool tech concept cars that car companies have made over the years.

Plus, Elon and company made it seem like 15K was a steal as it would cost more when it was \u201cdone\u201d. So many people were paying for the ability to actually have a fully self-driving car.

Here are some general guidelines to consider:\n\n\\- If you are in your 20s or 30s: You have a long time horizon, which means you can afford to take on more risk. It may be a good idea to allocate a higher portion of your portfolio to stocks, which have the potential to generate higher returns over the long term, but also come with more volatility.\n\n\\- If you are in your 40s or 50s: You may be nearing retirement or have other near-term financial goals, so it may be a good idea to start thinking about preserving your wealth. You may want to consider reducing your exposure to stocks and increasing your allocation to more stable investments, such as bonds.\n\n\\- If you are over 60: You may be in retirement or approaching it, so preserving your wealth and generating income will likely be your top priorities. It may be a good idea to allocate a larger portion of your portfolio to less risky investments, such as bonds and cash.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and every investor's situation is unique.
