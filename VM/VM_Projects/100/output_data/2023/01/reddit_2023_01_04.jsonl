Amazon began telling investors in October 2021 that it had built up its warehousing and air freight capacity too much in response to early pandemic demand. \n\nThe middle of this year started to reveal casualties elsewhere in the company. **Amazon shut down its physical bookstores and some Amazon Go convenience store locations. It jettisoned its Amazon Care health care service on doubts it would ever be profitable.

For the quarter, total units rose about 41% year over year.\n\nEV sales rose more than 62,000%, but the huge increase was driven by lower EV sales in the fourth quarter of 2021, when sales amounted to just 26 units. GM had stopped selling its [Chevy Bolt EV](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-seat-belts-51671630718?mod=md_stockoverview_news&mod=article_inline) until it had a complete fix for a supplier-caused battery problem.\n\nFor the full year, GM delivered 2,274,088 vehicles in the U.S., including 39,179 EVs. Total 2022 sales grew about 3%, while EV sales jumped about 58%. The almost 2.3 million units delivered for the U.S. in 2022 remained well below prepandemic levels. GM delivered almost 2.9 million vehicles in the U.S. [in 2019](https://pressroom.gm.com/gmbx/us/en/pressroom/home/news.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2020/jan/0103-gmsales.html).\n\nSupply chain problems and a shortage of semiconductors have constrained global auto production for years.

Dealer inventories are low, pricing is higher, and profit margins are solid. GM is expected to generate an operating profit of about $13.3 billion in 2022. It generated $8.4 billion in 2019.\n\nWall Street projects GM will earn about $10.7 billion in operating profits in 2023.\n\nGM also sells a lot of EVs in China, mostly in partnership with the Chinese auto maker [SAIC Motor **600104** **0.00%** ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/600104?countrycode=cn).

However, a closer look at the current state of FSD technology suggests that it may be at least a decade before Tesla\u2019s FSD is fully functional.\n\nOne of the primary challenges facing FSD technology is the need for extensive testing and validation. Autonomous vehicles rely on complex algorithms and sensors to navigate roads and make decisions, and these systems must be rigorously tested in a wide range of conditions to ensure safety and reliability. According to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it could take up to 10 years for autonomous vehicles to be fully validated for widespread use (NHTSA, 2019).\n\nAnother challenge is the need for significant infrastructure improvements. Autonomous vehicles rely on high-quality mapping data, real-time traffic information, and robust communication systems to function properly. These systems are currently lacking in many parts of the country, and it will likely take several years to build the necessary infrastructure to support widespread adoption of FSD technology.\n\nAdditionally, there are regulatory and legal hurdles that must be addressed before FSD technology can be deployed on a large scale. The NHTSA has released guidelines for the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles, but these guidelines are still in the early stages of development and may take several years to be fully implemented (NHTSA, 2019). In addition, liability issues related to autonomous vehicles are still being sorted out, with some experts predicting that it could take up to a decade for the legal framework to be established (Bryant, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, while Tesla\u2019s FSD technology may be making progress, there are still significant challenges that need to be overcome before it can be deployed on a widespread basis.

However, a closer examination of the current state of autonomous driving suggests that it may be decades before Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology is fully functional and widely available.\n\nOne reason for this is the complexity of the problem that self-driving technology must solve. Autonomous vehicles must be able to navigate roads, make decisions, and react to unexpected events in real-time. This requires an extensive understanding of the physical world, including the ability to accurately perceive and interpret objects, people, and other vehicles. While Waymo has made significant progress in this area, the company\u2019s self-driving technology is still far from perfect. In 2018, Waymo\u2019s autonomous vehicles were involved in 37 collisions in Arizona, many of which were caused by human error (Kilinc, 2018).\n\nAnother reason for the slow progress of self-driving technology is the need for extensive testing and validation. Autonomous vehicles rely on complex algorithms and sensors to function properly, and these systems must be rigorously tested in a wide range of conditions to ensure safety and reliability. According to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it could take up to 10 years for autonomous vehicles to be fully validated for widespread use (NHTSA, 2019). This suggests that it could be at least 25 years before Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology is ready for widespread adoption.\n\nWaymo is not the only company facing these challenges. Other competitors in the self-driving space, such as Tesla and Uber, have also encountered setbacks and delays in the development of their autonomous driving technology. For example, Uber\u2019s self-driving program was suspended in 2018 after one of its autonomous vehicles was involved in a fatal collision in Arizona (Kramer, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, while Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology has made significant progress in recent years, there are still significant challenges that need to be overcome before it can be deployed on a widespread basis.
