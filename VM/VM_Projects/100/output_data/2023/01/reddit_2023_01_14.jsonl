{"title": "inflation cooling, but....", "selftext": "Newbie here. We've all seen the news that inflation is cooling, yet the FED announced a continuation of rate increases into the foreseeable future. \n\nWorst of all, despite the ease of inflation, prices for everything remains historically high, will remain high for at least another year or two and is further eroding financial mobility by consumers, which will only continue to hurt the economy since consumers are the driving force of the economy by 70%. \n\nMoreover, my suspicion for substantial corporate layoffs remain on the horizon as corporations will be looking to reduce headcount to offset the impact of the 15% corporate tax rate that started this month. Historical studies show that layoffs don't positively affect shareholder value, usually. At times it's effective though.\n\nCan someone with knowledge here, not another newbie, explain why we should expect to see improvement in the markets and economy given my outline? What am I missing that we should expect bullish improvements vs more volatility? Personally, I think we're seeing one last uptick before a larger contraction hits, but again, I'm too new to this.\n\nThank you in advance.", "id": "10bxw9t", "created_utc": 1673726660.0, "score": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
