The price of TLT will increase at a rapid rate if that happens due to rates and also short interest in the fund itself.  You also capture dividend yield, currently a bit under 4%.  The bond market is likely to be down for the 3rd year in a row in 2023, which is the first time in history as far as I can tell.  Markets are seldom down more than a few consecutive years in a row. \n\nThe other strategy would be to move an increasingly higher percentage of your portfolio into higher yielding short term notes as the rates are increasingly inverted, as in when the these yields, like 3-9 months, are higher than longer term yields, 5-30 years.  Then you would move them back over to longer term yields (or TLT) when they uninvert.  I have a ladder that I keep up every week, spreading my bonds over time, so that a percentage of them expire every week or two.  Then just move the bonds as they mature to the end of the ladder where the sweet spot is (highest rate or close to it).  \n\nThe rates/returns are not sexy, but they have teeth over time and losses are minimal, or in the case of short term notes, virtually non-existent.  My TLT trades were actually down earlier this year, starting from 103 down into the 80's, but all the premium from selling CSPs and CC's, along with the TLT dividends made up for much of the losses from the fund, and then when the price started rising just a bit, my P&L turned green and TLT hasn't even held 90 at that point.

That's basically the same kind of underlying that you can trade diagonal spreads with, but you'll tend to be in a much better position, both in terms of limiting risk, and giving yourself a chance for a bit of leverage if you want it. The wheel is especially silly because when the stock trends down, you get stuck bag holding and when it's going up, you don't have enough delta to take advantage. With diagonals, usually your downside risk is limited, and gamma starts to work in your favor, so if the underlying moves past your long strike, you can buy back in when the trend turns around and be in a better place. \n\nSo I might have an underlying trading for 100, I bought the long call 6 months out at the 80 strike for 22 and sold a 40 day call at the 105 strike for a buck. If the underlying suddenly drops to 80, my long call probably still has 6, maybe even 8 or 10 bucks of extrinsic left, and if I think the underlying will turn around, maybe I sell it, buy the 65 strike for 18 bucks or so, and if the underlying gets back up to 100, I'll actually be in pretty good shape.\n\nIf the same thing happened with a wheel, I probably had almost the whole 100 of exposure to carry the trade, when the underlying fell out from under me, my gamma sucked and didn't cushion the loss at all, and there isn't a great way to take advantage of it if I expect the underlying to get back up to 100 except wait, because if I move my short strike down to get the theta decay, I lose the chance to take advantage of the bounce.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the informative and fair answer.

There are better ways to enter into stock positions and there are undeniably better ways to trade options. It looks great on paper, which is part of why it's attractive to new traders.

I decided, after December deliveries hit a record of 15,815 cars, to YOLO all of my money into NIO without considering any other factors like macroeconomic situation, Chinese politics or the fact they didn\u2019t make a profit yet.\n\nObviously now, four weeks after my purchase, it\u2019s time to think about my investment.\n\nTo minimize risk a bit I\u2019ve decided to take a longer time frame, \u20ac22,000 on 1/24 $14 warrants (my tiny brain tells me there\u2019s no risk at all), \u20ac21,000 on 6/23 $16 warrants (could lose half of my investment which is okay) and \u20ac2,100 on 3/23 $15 calls (risky but compared to the rest a \u201etiny\u201c amount).\n\nYou guys see there\u2019s already a profit made but I wouldn\u2019t be here if I was a reasonable and rational guy. All positions are still OTM and I can see all of em reach ITM status until beginning of March.\n\nLet me explain why (my thoughts are one dimensional so better don\u2019t follow if you are attached to your money):\n\nThere are no exact numbers of deliveries for January yet but you can get a picture of approximate numbers if you take a look at weekly registration numbers. We need to know there were 9,652 cars delivered in January 2022. This needs of course to get beat to move the price.\n\nFirst week of January we count 2,818 registrations in China, second week 2,963. Makes 5,781 until January 15th. So far so bad. They are still struggling a bit, but the amount of deliveries is ok considering the problems China had and has lately. To make things in January worse Chinese new year holidays were last week from 21st to 27th. So for sure not the best month in their history. But that should be priced in. And I think despite all the negative factors they\u2019ll still manage to beat last years deliveries easily and from here on it\u2019s getting started.\n\nFirst let\u2019s take a look on last years deliveries:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3mvav2r92fa1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f92238fc67394c56277b80de9ca3e2f2ae130de2\n\nWe see horrible numbers in February 2022. If NIO just keep staying at the level they\u2019re at the moment (\\~2,900 registrations per week) they will grow approximately 90% YoY in February. If they increase and go beyond 3,000 deliveries per week like in November and December 2022 already we face more than 100%. The stock market likes growth of 100% and more. Why should they get back at the level from December you may ask. Shanghai just recently (yesterday, so most probably not priced in yet) extendet it's $1,500 subsidies for EVs until December 2023. And it's starting on February 1st again. NIO is pretty big in Shanghai already. Interesting side note btw:\n\n>*The policy was first released in Shanghai last May and was valid until the end of 2022.*\n\nNIO hasn\u2019t delivered less than 10,000 cars per month since May 2022 and hopefully never will again and their outlook is around 70-80k cars in H1 and 140-150k cars in H2 of 2023. CEO Li was talking about at least surpassing Lexus in China (around 200k) in 2023. They are pretty confident about at least 50% growth.\n\nAnd to talk about profitability eventually, \u201eNIO is still losing money, but mainly due to R&D investment, and the company's gross profit has largely covered its overall operating costs, according to Qin.\u201c\n\nInterview from president Qin Lihong from January 26th 2023.\n\n[https://cnevpost.com/2023/01/28/nio-president-further-details-sub-brand-nio-phone/](https://cnevpost.com/2023/01/28/nio-president-further-details-sub-brand-nio-phone/)\n\nI won't start talking about many other aspects that could be bullish or bearish (phone, battery swaps, Neopark phase II and the sub-brands ALPS and Firefly, etc.) so no real DD at all. I just wanted to share my YOLO to get you guys excited for a potential nice loss porn you can fap to or a good gain for me I can fap to.\n\nSee you in Valhalla", "id": "10ol8ww", "created_utc": 1675032673.0, "score": 214, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|69|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: YOLO'd into NIO options at the beginning of February and I think they're a pretty good investment.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "should I invest in nio or not?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13944151997566223}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2385767251253128}, {"body": ">Hello dear regards, while Tesla is going to the moon there are companies that could benefit from tailwind.
