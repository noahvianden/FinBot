The stock market tracks after-tax corporate profits so if companies keep reducing forward earnings estimates for future quarters then the market can go lower.  Look at the S&P 500 as one big company and estimate its yearly earnings and then figure a multiple on that. Historical multiple for the market averages about 17x.\n\nJP Morgan expects the S&P earnings to drop 9% and come in at $205 per share for 2023.  A 17x multiple of that puts the S&P at 3,485.  A 23x multiple puts the index at 4,715.\n\nYardeni does excellent research.

Real wage growth (not nominal wage growth) over the last 3 years has been incredibly modest, and follows a few decades of completely stagnant real wage growth. Wages would have to increase at a much, MUCH higher rate to account for the massive fall off in purchasing power for the labor force for years now. Real incomes per capita have also fallen off a cliff over the last two years, as while wages may have gone up, overall GDP per capita has been entirely eaten up by inflation. The last time a wage-price spiral became an issue was in the 70s, when a rapid real rise in wages occurred for over a decade straight.\n\nIn any event, this report found that wage growth slowed more than expected. Low wage growth and continued net increases in jobs, would be on the dot for a soft landing. Right now, most economists are forecasting recession, and hundreds of thousands of jobs being lost every month by the middle of this year. If we can avoid that and keep on track for the last 5 months of CPI data, inflation will reach ~2% without causing significant job losses. That would be nirvana for markets and for investors.

{"title": "Thoughts on Amazon", "selftext": "Operating income for amazon for all of 2021 was $24.8B on revenue of $469B. Operating income for the TTM is $12.9B on total revenue of $502B. I suspect, as I've been saying for the past year, 2021 will be the highest pure eps for Amazon for at least 2021-2025. Despite it's more than 50% decline in stock price, it's PE ratio has pushed up to 74 because it's earnings have been absolutely decimated. The difficult part for amazon is that it's about to lap Q4 2021 where it netted $11.8B from it's Rivian investment to prop up the eps by a huge magnitude. In Q4 2022 it'll prob take a roughly $700M-$1B loss again from Rivian, but this time it's operating income may also be down. That could cause a MASSIVE shortfall in terms of eps for the TTM. Think about it, in Q3 2022 it's eps were $0.28, then in Q2 2022 they were ($0.20), Q1 2022 ($0.38), and the dangerous part (like I said), in Q4 2021 they were $1.39 because of Rivian. So, if you look at the trailing 3 quarters because those are what matter (for a TTM PE ratio), you are down a negative ($0.30) eps. Do you think AMAZON will have a GAAP eps of greater than $0.30? Remember that it's going to take another +/-$1B loss from rivian.
