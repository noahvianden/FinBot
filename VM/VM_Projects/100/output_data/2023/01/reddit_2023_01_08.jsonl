All Chinese stocks have been rallying to the moon. \n\nTwo years ago China was not viewed as uninvestable. Little changed about the investment system in China. It\u2019s still authoritarian, VIE structure, the CCP can do what it wants. It\u2019s always been this way. Yes short term crisis like the real estate bubble and tech crack down have occurred, but China is mostly the same as it was 2 years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve been pounding sand for months about the amazing opportunity China presents. It was extremely undervalued even with risks considered. Now that I\u2019ve been proven right and China stocks are rocketing, will people finally end this overly pessimistic fear mongering? The choir will come out with the same tired points about how idiotic it is to invest in China. \n\nAs of now, the naysayers have been proven wrong. BABA is performing wonderfully despite the noise. \n\nI just want to know how much longer the sheep will keep avoiding China before they fomo in. It\u2019s not too late to jump into Chinas recovery. This is only the beginning of a long rally back to fair value. \n\nI know most commenters are going to berate me. But to the few wise ones with open minds, consider what the criticism argues vs the current price performance. The share price completely contradicts this uninvestable narrative. The bears were saying this same crap before asset prices nearly doubled. China is going to experience a massive bull market rally.

I mean, you\u2019re  investing in a stock for the long run. When you look at China, you have to see if it\u2019s future is good, and the company.\n\nAnd you have an example of Baba, but that doesn\u2019t represent the whole story. It doesn\u2019t represent China as a whole. For example evergrande went bust, was one of the biggest companies in China. You might argue that there is a lot of corruption, but **wake up**, there is a boat load of corruption there. Yeah you could argue then that evergrande doesn\u2019t represent the Chinese economy, but that\u2019s the same with Baba basically.\n\nOkay, you ignored what I said previously, so you look at the company. What do you find? You visit and look over the stock, that is relatively unknown, but it has good books as listed in their website, that is in Chinese. You have to understand what the business does, and is it legit etc. In China, there a lot of fraudsters trying to scam you with shell companies (this is serious, one of my uncles dad got his entire net worth destroyed by investing in his \u201cbuddy\u2019s \u201c company.\n\nYou being in a different continent also makes understanding a business difficult. They might have a website that explains what they do, but it\u2019s in Chinese. Or it is a big Chinese company and has an English website and you understand what it does, okay move on to the next step of stock review.\n\nState of Chinese economy. You have to think what state it is in rn. The economy is not great for sure, the aging population, the debt crisis and a billion other problems that plague their economy. The us economy is not that good rn, and you don\u2019t see people buying in tesla stock or apple. **Why would anyone buy into the Chinese economy then?** You might argue they are very cheap, but *don\u2019t ever forget, a stock that has fallen from 1000$ per share to 69$ per share can still drop to zero*\n\nYou said that people would be biased, but you have to answer some basic questions before buying a stock.

{"title": "We are going up this week! $SPY", "selftext": " Up, down, sideways?! \n\nGood afternoon fellow traders!!! A pretty noneventful week last week IMO overall market wise as we were in a range most of it till an exciting Friday to bring us home!!!\n\nI\u2019m going to share my analysis of the SPY for the coming week to see which way we may go.\n\nTo start us off let\u2019s remember Thursday the 12th we have CPI reports, this will likely bring some type of reaction either way from the SPY, so keep that in the back of our minds.\n\nStarting with the micro let's analyze the price action of the last week. Below is a 6M day chart. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sx7akppevaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=351c682035d461c629e16c21bac253dfb1f338ca\n\n \n\nThe action Friday really shakes things up here. An above avg range day on above avg volume, with a strong daily candle close. \n\nTechnically speaking this 380 level has been a line in the sand for the last 9 months. Let\u2019s look at the chart below and see its importance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5n74l3uevaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=443671ec76095e99b92bc96eb234fb9777989d05\n\n This 380 level, as well as 410, have been my two key levels in play for the last 9 months. As you can see 380 support was first set back in May of 2022, offering a sharp reversal back to 410 before retesting the support area of 380 once again. \n\nEach subsequent time we\u2019ve come down to this support area we\u2019ve had the same outcome. A reversal to the upside. The main difference between the prior times we\u2019ve spent down in this demand zone is how long until a reversal? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16zek28zevaa1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e95aad0c4694ae3f8c262ac5c519e93ac366bc9\n\n The next key level we are coming into is 390. This is going to be in my opinion the place to watch whether we will go higher or lower in the coming weeks. At the very least this week I expect to test the 390 level pretty early on in the week. Either Monday or Tuesday. Depending on the price action at 390 this will give us more information on the next move. If we see some topping signs here and a failure to hold 390 then I am expecting a move such as this. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jiv3n5k4fvaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=0808f981db0fa6abf172a970c03697079942e46e\n\n \n\nHowever, if we can break and hold 390. Then I\u2019ll be expecting a move similar to the last few times we reclaimed 390 as support back in July as well November. If we can get a move like this then I\u2019d expect at a minimum to test the descending trend line I\u2019ve had drawn for quite some time, at around 400. At max, a retest of the 410 area and hopefully our first higher high.\n\nLastly, let us look at some higher time frame weekly charts to see exactly what in my opinion may or may not be a good time for all of this to turn itself around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it4ojh57fvaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=1499670999ebcd376a81ba406de78eefb929900c\n\n \n\nSo as we can see in this weekly chart. I\u2019ve tried to portray via colors the significance of the swing highs and lows that have been set the last year. In red we have bearish trends, lower highs, and lower lows. Green ovals are our attempts of reversing this trend with either a higher high or higher low. The sole gray oval is neutral as it is yet not validated as a higher high or lower high until we see what the next attempt at it is. \n\nAs of now, we are in the first position since last year to possibly rotate this trend and create a reversal. If we can break and hold 410 to the upside and then set a higher low to 380 after it pulls in then we will for the first time since 2021 be making higher lows and higher highs once more. What happens after that we do not know!\n\nTo wrap this up, In my opinion, I think we have some upside in the SPY earlier on in the week good for at least 2% to the 395 area. What we do after that will be key to whether or not we head higher to 400+ or see 370\u2019s. So I will be watching mainly if we can flip and hold the 390 support once more and that will dictate my bias. \n\nLastly, remember CPI numbers report Thursday which are bound to create some type of reaction in the markets. Again, in my opinion, if we come in under estimates I believe markets should rip off of that report, showing that even at Christmas time inflation can still start to fix itself and give participants hope the next Fed meeting will be good news. However, the odds of that happening may be pretty low so watch for the flip scenario to happen.\n\nGood luck and happy trading!!!", "id": "106ruxu", "created_utc": 1673206190.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|4 days ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: I think we have some upside in the SPY earlier on in the week good for at least 2% to the 395 area.
