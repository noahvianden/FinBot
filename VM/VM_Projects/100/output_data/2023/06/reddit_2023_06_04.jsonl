{"title": "ARKK is set to surge at least 86% in the next 1-2 years", "selftext": "After being cast aside for the past 2 years and forming a strong basing pattern, ARKK is all set for it's next bull run. The blue zone highlighted on the chart is what's known as an order block, which is an area where institutional buy orders are congregated. Order blocks are formed when large institutions want to establish a long position in a stock, but lack the liquidity to do so. To get around this, they first initiate a small short position, driving the stock price down, triggering stop losses. They then take the opposite side of those stop loss orders, establishing their substantially larger long position. During the 2020 bull run, the institutions were making huge profits on their long positions, but were losing money on their short position. Thus, the institutions took profit on their long positions, driving the price of ARKK back down to where they first initiated their short position to close their short position for either a tiny loss or no loss at all. Now that the institutions have likely closed out all of their short positions, there is nothing left to stop ARKK from going up. This almost perfectly coincides with inflation peaking and the eventual Fed rate hike pause. For those who didn't buy during the 2020 mania and only began accumulating in the recent 1-2 years, congratulations on your future well-deserved profits. Price target is $84.65 in the next 1-2 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmde6uxu4x3b1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d79f791437c51f95efd054b328e679fe0fa17b7", "id": "13zz6qk", "created_utc": 1685848455.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|37|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: ARKK is about to go on a bull run as the institutions have likely closed out their short positions.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.690435528755188}, {"body": "Got it calls on NVDA", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "I'll be happy for you if you make money from that.

This shows that Intel has a superior design team and they are able to compete even though they don't have the same manufacturing advantages as AMD.\n3. Nvidia's first generation GPUs (ARC) were indeed competitive with last generation Nvidia/AMD cards, and next generation cards from both companies will likely be better with driver updates and new features added by manufacturers such as AIB partners..

The best investor - Warren Buffet doesn't invest because of hype, he invests because of company fundamentals because he's over 90 years old and has 70+ years of experience and knows that hype like this is completely meaningless in the short term, or is just in its infancy right now. AI was invented in the 50s, and our modern perception of AI has been around since the 90s and has been in everything from robots, lunar rovers, toys, cars, games, chessbots, etc since the late 90s and early 2000s, and we're only talking about it now. What investors are talking about now is generative AI, which doesn't seem very profitable at the moment, nor do any of these companies really have a plan at the moment from profiting off it. Do you really believe that Microsoft's Bing AI is going to take over Google??? If you do then that's funny, they haven't even implemented ad revenue or targeted advertising into it yet, and even if they did they're using ChatGPT's AI which consumes so much power it costs $0.20 per response, which is insane. I don't care about the AI hype, remember the goddamn dot com bubble hype???? Or the MBS hype???? Or the 1920s wall street hype????
