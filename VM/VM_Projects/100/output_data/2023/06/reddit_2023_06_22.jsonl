{"title": "Don\u2019t Trade Options", "selftext": "If you don\u2019t have a written plan. The goal of this post is to share personal mistakes in my early trading to hopefully encourage others down a different path. \n\nPeople tend to hate those kind of statements because it makes us feel inadequate and that we\u2019re doing something wrong. However, I can unequivocally say, transitioning from trading off the dome to writing a plan is massive and probably one of the largest changes to my trading success. \n\nI started trading in high school, so I scoffed at the idea of having to write things out. I figured I could just look at my logs, adjust based on what I saw, and do just fine. Looking back 16 years, I want to slap my cocky naive self. \n\nOptions are incredibly complex products. And millions of people try their hand at it and we know the majority fail. The arrogance I had, thinking that as late teen, early 20 year old I would just be able to successfully deploy without a written plan or log is literally wild. \n\nIf the idea sounds like work and annoying to do - you\u2019re spot fucking on. AS IT SHOULD BE. Just because the barrier to enter into trading is SO LOW, don\u2019t allow that to lull you into a false sense of security. \n\nThe real benefit of a trading plan isn\u2019t using the finished plan as a reference, although it is a good one. The benefit comes from the rigor put into creating one and the exercise itself. Similar to when I was giving a 5 paragraph order as a Marine Officer - I very rarely would crack open my plan to remind myself what to do in a scenario. I didn\u2019t need to because I knew it cold from building and delivering the plan. Same exact goes for trading. \n\nIf you have a plan or pieces of one and want some feedback, post it here and let\u2019s have a constructive dialogue about them. If you don\u2019t have one, below is a simple outline to get you started. \n\n1. Orientation. What is the goal of your trading? This should be quantified. We should also force ourself to answer: Is my goal realistic? WHY do I think it is? How can I track whether it is or not?\n\n2. Portfolio deployment. How do you intend to use your portfolio, manage risk, assess markets, etc. \n\n3. Tools. This can be everything from notes, TA/FA tools, chart setups, market functions, etc. \n\n4. Strategy Outlines. This breaks the strategy down into a full lifecycle, in depth. What\u2019s the idea of the strat? How does it make money? How does it lose? How do you manage PnL? How does that affect expectancy? What deltas do you use? Why? How do you scale?\n\n5. Tracking. This is where we track and quantify our ideas, questions, and assumptions. This enables unbiased analysis and optimization. \n\n6. Audits. I\u2019m a firm believer in having people I respect look over my work to poke holes, identify gaps, confirm rigor. \n\nYes it\u2019s work. Yes it\u2019s worth it. This is how I\u2019ve maintained a 20% CAGR for over 15 years.\n\n\nEDIT: It seems we need to add context, because many have a broken sense of market potential. \n\n>I see \u201c20% would make him one of the best money managers\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s no way someone can make that return\u201d or \u201cyou did that during a bull market, who cares\u201d\n\n-This mindset simply gives ourselves an \u201cout\u201d on our own performance and is a lazy way to excuse ourselves from actually trying to get better. \n\n-If we chalk something up to luck, chance, or throw it away as impossible, there\u2019s no imperative for us to look more closely at ourselves. \n\n-Moreover, you\u2019ll find that fund managers are the wrong benchmark to compare good performance against. They tend to underperform for many reasons. \n\n-I highly encourage you to monitor the results of the US Investing Championship. I have for years. I am a solid, consistent trader and am proud of my performance but this will give you a much better idea of what \u201creally good\u201d looks like. \n\n-To elucidate the point, let\u2019s take a look at 2023 YTD USIC performance:\n\n1. Erik. 17% \n\n2. Money manager, top (3) returns:\n    a. Stock division: 22.7%, 15.4%, 12.8%\n    b. Enhanced growth (derivatives): 16.8%, 14.6%\n\n3. Non-money Manger, top (3) returns:\n    a. Stock division: 121.8%, 90.7%, 89.2%\n    b. Enhanced growth (derivatives): 182.7%, 65%, 38.2%\n\nI hope people take the time to do research on what\u2019s possible, what\u2019s likely, etc. I couldn\u2019t care less what people think about my performance, but I\u2019m hoping to open people\u2019s minds to using real information to create their perception of possibility vs repeating what they\u2019ve heard somewhere.", "id": "14fsp3e", "created_utc": 1687406296.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "\"I started trading in high school\"\n\n\"This is how I\u2019ve maintained a 20% CAGR for over 15 years.\"\n\nSo, you have been part of the 15 year Zero-interest rate Bull market since the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nI don't want to threadcrap but this looks like some Options + Motivational Seminar combo.", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "\u2026stock market CAGR over the same \u201czero interest rate bull market\u201d time period is ~9%.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Eric\n\nI have watched 49 of your videos including the latest on the Simplified Covered Strangle.\n\nI really triple watched the Original 3-part Covered Strangle video series to understand thoroughly what you were doing.\n\nBUT, my point is that I didn't have to write down a thesis to start a Covered Strangle on a stock/index.", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21134167909622192}, {"body": "Are you talking about buying options or selling options?

On and off on my approach as that was never my main source of income. I\u2019m approaching 60 yo now.\n\nLast year I got \u201cdistracted\u201d by crypto and lost 80% of my savings (yes, I\u2019m an idiot). I closed my 20 year successful business 3 years ago due to competition, declining revenue and because we had enough to retire.\n\nNow I\u2019m not employed and trying to pursue an $80k / year income to pay the basics for the family, from the much smaller amount that is left.\n\nI\u2019m trying to learn for the first time in more depth the option strategies.

ADHD is a bitch.\n\nI know that I want and need $80k / year to live as we are, without eating out, traveling and owning a car (we are doing that right now for the past 8 months and we are perfectly fine with this lifestyle) and even then, $80k is needed to maintain the \u201csimpler lifestyle\u201d we have now adopted.\n\nWent from having no mortgage to having one. Schwab called 2 years ago with an offer for near free money to invest. Another mistake in hindsight. Took margin for the first time. All the don\u2019ts specially being retired.\n\nOn the positive side, I have now learned to control my fomo much more. I\u2019m being conservative with allocation but I find myself wondering if I should try and become an active trader and not have any buy and hold assets, a mix of both, or only buy and hold and pray. The buy and hold hurt me last year and I blame myself for the margin account balance, TSLA long calls and the crypto misadventures.\n\nTrying to find a new MO that will get us the needed $80k a year.\n\nI moved my accounts from Schwab to TD and have been using Thinkorswim for the past 2 months and really enjoy it.\n\nIn May I lost $300. In June I made $13,000. But I know I tend to do well on bull markets and struggle with position side, exits and still enter some trades impulsively.\n\nIn May I started with Iron Condors. Made $3,000 with 1 Costco IC, lost $5,000 with 1 GOOGL IC but lately have been exploring spreads. Also wondering if I should try and be a SELLER only of bull / bear spreads.\n\nI have allocated, so far, about 1/4 into buy and hold, dividend paying stocks but the dividend income is very low (~ $2k a year). \n\nIf you have anymore advice for my particular situation, please feel free to send some help my way.

But, for people who manage wealth or need some of their investment capital for something important, their are significantly more risks in the global financial system than usual.  Most people don\u2019t know how to risk manage, when risk management is important.\n\nI do think there is 100% chance of recession, and anyone who can\u2019t see that is under-informed.  But that doesn\u2019t mean there will be some substantial market pull back.\n\nI do personally believe there are specific risks that could warrant a big pull back and ignoring them is stupid, but using that info to short the market or buy puts is also stupid.  Real investors who are bearish just adjust asset classes to manage risk, they don\u2019t Yolo puts.\n\nThe banking system is in trouble, and they have tightened lending drastically, which always limits growth to some degree, especially depending on the length of tightening.  It has 100% correlation in terms of when banks tighten past a certain level on the SLOOS report for more than 2 quarters, that there is a hard landing recession afterward.  Most people on here try and find one big event that could cause markets to pull back and that is impossible to predict.  But I am concerned that there are many risks to the banking system and that more banks will probably fail due to death by 1000 papercuts.  Will that cause markets to correct?  Probably.  Does that mean people should stop investing and yolo puts?  No it doesn\u2019t.  \n\nDepending on how much you are actually trying to learn I\u2019m trying to build a list of concerns I have to bounce off of fund managers and CFAs and I\u2019m happy to share that on Reddit.
