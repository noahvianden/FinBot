BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.\r  \n\r  \nThe losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.\r  \n\r  \nThe value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio.
