That CORE YoY and MoM hasn\u2019t budged off 5.5% and 0.4% for quite a long time. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kphobxtmcn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=02614bba2e569fc64f609c9018fbb58b9e6572b7\n\nI am going to keep this brief as CPI will move us and FOMC\u2026 we will see where the dust settles\u2026\n\nBut today actually is incredibly bullish on the daily\u2026 why? Because we actually turned the 429.68 supply from the August 16th top into a demand (support) today\u2026 that means now 430 is actually considered supported and \u201cjustified.\u201d\n\nTo keep it simple upside target is 437.87 demand and downside target would be new 429.86 demand. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4jadpbncn5b1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f2b6f724be118010c3b93fc9aed6acd5f15902\n\nWe remain in this black bull channel which gives us an upside target of 438.1 tomorrow (support from April 21 2022) and then in the case of a drop 429.8 is not considered strong support. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 429.13 -> 445.34  \n Demand- 429.86 -> 437.87  \n Support- 430.9 -> 429.8 -> 429.2  \n Resistance- 433.91 -> 435.7 -> 438\n\n**FUTURES**\n\nNote- TOS rolled its contract over the weekend so I will be holding off on charting any levels or sharing that here until that is done\u2026 by Friday we should have a more normalized chart on futes to update and share.\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l984ugvncn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b8315b8545c283c7b97333741e2a20bbea0c14c\n\nWell after QQQ put that demand in at 349.06 we now are pushing through that 354.95 supply and resistance area that was incredible resistance all of last week. \n\nWith a break through that and 357.09 the upside target is 361.7 demand\u2026. From there we have a bigger upside target of 369.32 and 371.41. \n\nIn the chance that we retrace tomorrow on QQQ the support would be 357.09 and major support at 354.95\u2026 \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 354.95 -> 357.09 -> 369.32  \n Demand- 349.06 -> 361.7\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk51mrbocn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa2db80ed460d8a680bd4ab2b4dcfb75a23fbb6\n\nSo what do we have here\u2026 well of the last 5 CPIs this is the highest level the VIX has closed the day before CPI is released\u2026 Actually this is the highest the VIX has closed up (percent wise) since December CPI.\n\nNow what happened on those days? Well on March 14th SPY opened 1.33% green and on December 13th CPI SPY opened 2.8% green\u2026 what does that potentially mean? Well potentially we could get one of our biggest SPY opens in a very long time\u2026 I personally still do not think the risk to reward of swinging anything is worth it though\u2026\n\nI think for myself that in order for SPY to see a bigger green day and open tomorrow we need to see CORE YoY below 5.5% (it has been stuck between 5.5 and 5.6% for the last 4 readings) and we realistically need a surprise print in the 3s\u2026 if we get both of those I do confidently feel that we could see a 1% green open and potentially push for a 2% green day\u2026 that would give us about a 438.14 open and a close near 442.5\u2026\n\nHowever, if CORE remains high and if we some how get a miss on CPI YoY (higher than 4.1%) than I actually especially with CORE missing) would not be surprised to see a flat to red open. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tthd3uocn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=06a931672a110d2959debabecbf1d080c30ad04f\n\nThe only thing I got right about today was a big VIX move up\u2026 I never would have imagined that SPY would put almost a 1% green day in while the VIX puts it biggest day in since May 4th\u2026 (for instance on May 4th spy closed -0.71%). \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl0oc59pcn5b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d87b46ebba2b3d60c7f680d4c4ff0b0b5141bdf\n\nToday was definitely not it for me\u2026 I continued to get slammed today and honestly today felt a lot like Thursday of last week for most of the day\u2026 \n\nAs a technical trader I have said multiple times that I look for SPY, VOLD and VIX to all be in congruence before I take a trade\u2026 today was yet again another time where we found that we were not in congruence\u2026 the biggest issue was definitely the VIX\u2026 watching the VIX pump with SPY is incredibly mind boggling. \n\nOverall small red day and not a big deal as I feel confident I can recover tomorrow as long as technicals move well again\u2026 \n\nIn the end remember not every day will be green\u2026 the days that play well to your strategy is where you should capitalize\u2026 however, days like today that your strategy struggles remember risk management is the key to success. IF you cant manage losers and red days well the green will never outweigh the red.
