Investors exited with the Nasdaq 100 Index poised for its best half since the last six months of 1999.\n\nThe rally in US stocks stalled this week as investors digested Jerome Powell\u2019s outlook on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve chair said more interest-rate increases may be needed this year, at a time equities have been climbing on hopes that rate hikes would end soon.\n\nHartnett said that although crowded positioning and strong investor sentiment aren\u2019t an impediment to the fresh upside, there\u2019s a bigger chance of a downside than the upside this summer. His team sees a maximum upside of 100-150 points versus a downside of 300 points for the S&P 500 before Labor Day in September.\r  \n\r  \nHartnett correctly predicted the selloff in stocks in 2022 but has been caught on the wrong side this year with his bearish calls.\r  \n\r  \nAlso this week, Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said the market now resembles the tech boom of 1999 and 2000, which didn\u2019t end until tighter monetary policy had roiled stocks. JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Marko Kolanovic said US equities are in for a tumultuous second half of the year as the lagging impacts of aggressive monetary tightening by the Fed catch up to the economy.\r  \n\r  \nTo be sure, Hartnett said investors are \u201cstuck in growth stocks,\u201d like technology, because banks and commercial real estate still \u201chave bad recession vibes, especially in light of renewed central bank hikes.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWeekly asset flows highlights from BofA\u2019s note include:\r  \n\r  \nAmong equity regions, US stocks had the first outflow in four weeks at $5.7 billion, Europe had $2.6 billion of redemptions and EM stock funds saw $300 million pulled out. Japan had $2.4 billion in inflows.\r  \n\r  \nBy style, US growth had $3.7 billion of outflows versus $200 million of redemptions for US value\r  \n\r  \nFor sectors, financials had the biggest inflows while tech and energy had the largest outflows", "id": "14gvd4t", "created_utc": 1687517449.0, "score": 252, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Hear that everyone sell your tech stocks so BofA deez nuts can get cheaper prices!", "score": 372, "replies": [{"body": "uh tech stocks are overvalued", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5651883482933044}, {"body": "Ah, the classic 'sell now so I can buy low' tactic.
