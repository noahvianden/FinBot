Ironically, though the rule didn't anticipate no-fee stock trading and the rise of Robinhood, PDT has kind of accidentally held the line on excessive trading frequency and market churn induced by no-fee retail traders. GME notwithstanding.\n\nSo for the SEC to lift the PDT rule, they'd have to replace it with something else that takes the modern Robinhood situation into account. Perhaps there needs to be two separate rules, one to restrict frequency for the sake of market stability and another to limit leverage risk that is independent of frequency.

I wanted a margin account, not for the extra leverage, but to be able to trade as little or as much as I wanted (again, its my money to lose if I want as an adult).. Luckily, I was able to make it work even though I felt the PDT made it take much longer to get to 25K, but where I really see it hurting people, and where I think the REAL issue ends up being is that so many people end up \"holding\" their position much longer than they should have, praying it will bounce back in their favor BECAUSE, if they close out their position, they will have to wait TWO days for settlement to trade again, or have one less day trade on a margin account for the rolling five days.. so they hold.. and thats what ends up really blowing up their account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets all be real here, any smart trader knows they need to be disciplined and cut losses immediately if the trade doesn't go their way (and we know from stats that a good trader hits at approx 70% accuracy, on average), meaning 30% of the time, the trade needs to get cut and cut fast.. and here where the problem is with PDT.  If you have 2K in your account as a new trader, its really hard to grow your account unless you are using most or all the 2K to trade.. so, if you have to cut the trade, its now 2 more days until you can trade again while you wait to settle.. which is is the reason most new traders HOLD their trades, and end up bag holding and then eventually cutting it anyway.  Imagine if you can cut the trade quickly, saying you lost $5-$20 on the 2K because the trade hit your stop loss as an example, you shouldn't have to wait two days or only be able to do this 3 times per week for being smart and making the right decision, which is where traders feel like they are getting punished with the PDT rule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, if it helps, I took a different road..  I made a promise to myself that I would use a cash account (I only had $4000 when I first started, to invest), and my promise was that I would wait for what I believed from all my studying, was an A+ set up, and I would punch half (2K) on a trade.. and no matter what happened, win or lose that day, I would not trade again until the following day, where I would use my other 2K, IF I SAW an A+ setup..  this made it to where I could trade every single day at least as I grew my account.  The rest of the time, I would paper trade but I would only trade it as if it were my real money, on one of my two A+ setups, as the day went on.. ( I also had a completely different broker that I used to paper trade any other strategy that I was trying to learn and play around with but my main account and my main paper trading account were always kept sacred to me and taken with the utmost seriousness. and lastly, I took on some side hustles, doing whatever I could to make extra money and I would take that extra money and always put it right in my main account to grow the total account balance..  with my winning trades, with cutting my losses quickly, and with adding whatever I could top my main account, I was finally able to get to 25K and the rest is history.  It was definitely a journey and I had to e really patient which isn't part of my personality. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you want it bad enough, you will do whatever it takes...  finally F\\*CK the PDT rule.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8027112483978271}, {"body": "I think it\u2019s insulting to have a PDT sign in front of my account name.

Michael James McDonald on Seeking   has recent article, where based on sentiment things he thinks should go higher.  His charts have quite the track record.   We had 4 extreme bearish short-term buy signals in last year and have never been past midway to a sell signal, so he thinks we go back to prior highs, which are about 10% higher before going down.   All we need is +.25% for an official bull market.  I tend to agree.  BTW,  IWM way stronger today than SPY and QQQ.  Makes some sense, the weakest part of the market in last year.\n\nOn his longer-term chart, a double signal, and in 2009 we only one signal, 2022 was quite a bit more bearish sentiment wise than 2009.

A \u201ctextbook\u201d recession refers to two continuous quarters of negative GDP growth.\n\nNotably, Bannister had claimed earlier that the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) would not declare a recession in the first half of the year, according to the report.\n\nWall Street is divided about the possibility of a recession. For instance, DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said it looks increasingly possible the U.S. will tip into a recession.\n\nHowever, Gundlach's take stands in contrast to Goldman Sachs' prediction about the economy.

And its the year 2031.The pull factor will be insane for this type of combination of products.\n\nAnyways, moonshot idea kind of thing - but I do not believe Tesla will be able to pull much from the infotainment system if this does actually become a thing - which it seems it will. Only factor would be if you can off-load compute to the PC hardware of the car, but I would assume Apple locks that down to be only with Apple Products. Tesla will still make bank off of FSD, but the Tesla Car will not be an App device like the Apple Store if this comes to fluition - just my 2 cents.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions, cause this is freaking cool. VR may finally be entering mainstream and should be factored into how it would interplay with FSD.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people claiming motion sickness and thereby abandoning the idea. Remember that the VisionPro has a 4K \"seethrough\" viewing experience, meaning motion in VR will align with motion in R. This should completely remove the motion sickness you would feel while playing games, working, etc. in VR we know today. Too many are throwing the baby out with the bath water in here imo.

Initially all of these guests or analysts would say that ***yes*** *they expect rates will be kept higher* for longer **BUT**, if there's a \"recession\" or a \"significant\" slowdown. The FED will need to be accommodating and could cut rates as far back to 2020 levels to be \"supportive\" of a rapidly slowing economy.\n\nNow don't get me wrong it's absolute BS about the 0% rate, and hopefully the FED would never entertain it again. The problem is that there are some analysts, hedge fund managers, etc who thought because of the recent banking crisis the FED should already be cutting rates. Which, I find it ridiculous that these \"experts\" would be making such suggestion just cause a few poorly managed banks went under. The FED should start throwing water (oil) at the fire by immediately cutting rates significantly to prevent potentially future \"disasters\" (These banks deserved to go under honestly). Their justification to why they said rate cuts should be introduced or rate hikes should be paused asap followed by rate cuts, was because \"*the banking crisis will take care of inflation because we'll experience a credit crunch soon*\". I think I saw an article recently suggesting that lending hasn't even slowed down much... \n\nAnyway also didn't help that Janet Yellen and the FED came in and bailed out the banks and set up facilities to backstop these bad actors and others who are on the verge of going under too. It gets even worse when Yellen went on to strongly suggest they would support the majority of the banks should another crisis happen. Therefore, with moral hazard introduced, these same analysts/hedge funds are getting emboldened to think that even if we go into a \"recession\" or \"slowdown\" regardless of inflation, FED/Treasury will bail out the economy. This leads them to one conclusion, \"Significant Rate Cuts on the horizon\". That's why I was being sarcastic going by each month making nonsensical scenarios, because this whole scenario is illogical, but hey hedge fund managers/analysts/experts all think we can only got to moon cause we got momma Yellen and papa Powell to bail us out no matter how unjustly these bad actors deserve such help.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

{"title": "Why Now is a Great Time to Go Long UVIX and Make Money", "selftext": "Hello my WallStreetBets brethen, I\u2019m back again with a money making post (3rd time). Those who followed me on my last two plays made money (check them out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137ivem/dpst_go_long_make_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/134s4uk/uvix_play_go_balls_deep_make_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)). So, it\u2019s time to buckle up, fellow degenerates, because I'm about to lay out a YOLO-worthy thesis on why now is the perfect moment to go long on VIX and UVIX! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f I just loaded up myself with 970 shares of UVIX at an average cost of 6.30. \n\n\ud83d\udca5 The Diamond Hands Case for VIX and UVIX \ud83d\udca5\n\nVolatility Party: The current market environment is like a wild party where volatility is the life of the dance floor. While a lot of events that occurred recently have calmed markets (debt ceiling increased, AI hype carrying earnings), there is still a lot uncertainty brewing in the global economy. More importantly though, there are key news cycles and geopolitical events that will occur soon that will result in a prolonged spike on the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) and its leveraged counterpart, UVI. They are poised for an explosive move to the upside. \n\nWhile the market may be buzzing with optimism and bullish sentiments surrounding company earnings, it's important to consider a different perspective. Underneath the surface, there are several factors that could cast a shadow of doubt on the rosy outlook. If reality fails to meet the sky-high expectations, disappointment could grip the market, leading to a spike in the VIX. Uncertainty looms, and any signs of weaker-than-expected earnings, missed revenue targets, or cautious guidance could ignite fear among investors. The VIX, known as the \"fear index,\" would respond accordingly, reflecting heightened market volatility as traders scramble to adjust their positions and protect themselves from potential downside risks. Remember, even the brightest stars can falter, and it's essential to consider both sides of the coin in our perpetual quest for \ud83d\udcb0. \n\nFurthermore, the sustained rally in the S&P 500 in recent weeks suggests to us that retail and big money investors may be keen to take profits at the first sign of weakness.\n\nTiming Is Everything: Timing is crucial in the world of volatility , and it couldn't be more perfect than now. Vix and UVIX aren\u2019t buy and hold forever types of stocks, they\u2019re a buy at a nice price then sell on the spike. VIX and UVIX are trading at 52wk lows (new low made today). At the time of writing, VIX is going for 29.36 while UVIX is going for 6.32. A juiciest of entries if I\u2019ve ever seen one. \n\nAs we've seen in the past, volatility can strike without warning, catching the unprepared off guard. The current macroeconomic landscape is misty, and inexperienced sailors and their portfolios will inevitably be blown off course. \nAs the winds of volatility howl, allow VIX to become your compass, protecting you through the stormy seas of the stock market (as a hedge) or towards untapped riches (as long only).\n\nTLDR : Buy VIX or preferably UVIX (shares preferable, but options dated 1 month out for added risk and leverage. This is WallStreetBets after all! \ud83d\ude0b). Don\u2019t buy higher then 6.90. And the lower it goes from where I bought for UVIX, (6.30), the juicier the entry is for you.
