In Pfizer\u2019s case, they were middling along with a handful of great joint ventures with other large pharma companies, but mainly were seen as \u2018the virus\u2019 company. \n\n\nEnter Covid, they went from clearing a modest amount of free cash flow each year, and trying to lay the track right in front of the train to keep things moving each year\u2026 to more than doubling their free cash flow for two years. If things continue with Covid never happening, Pfizer does just ok. With Covid and the vaccine, it was one of the largest windfalls in corporate history. \n\n\nThe CEO of any company has a few choices with their cash. Stock buybacks, dividends, M&A, debt reduction, and increased cap ex. Pfizer has done all of these. The sentiment on Pfizer that \u2018the party is over\u2019 is underestimating the cash flow they\u2019ve infused from the companies they\u2019ve acquired. \n\n\nIf you are Pfizer\u2019s largest competitor (Bristol, Roche, Merck, etc) are you excited that your largest rival got nearly $60 billion in free money and acquired five new companies? Or are you upset? I would be upset. \n\n\nPfizer does have execution risk, as does any large cap pharma player. That\u2019s part of the game. The game just became heavily tilted in Pfizer\u2019s favor three years ago. \n\n\nAs for \u2018no organic innovation\u2019, I\u2019d ask that you read their quarterly report and explain how multiple drugs passing through various phases of FDA trials is \u2018no organic innovation\u2019. Of all the pharma companies I\u2019ve covered, Pfizer is easily the most transparent about each drug\u2019s trial. You just have to be willing to do the homework. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, many companies\u2019 fates are decided by how well they accumulate and utilize capital. Pfizer has been one of the best capital accumulators in history the past three years, their utilization has been just what most analysts have looked for with this found money.
