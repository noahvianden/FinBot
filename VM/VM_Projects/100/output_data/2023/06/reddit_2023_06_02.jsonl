VIX isn't continuous like a stock, it has a term structure like commodity futures. It has contracts that expire weekly, but the important ones are the ones that expire monthly. When the nearest VIX contract expires, you'll notice that the spot VIX number either gaps up or down to match the next month's VIX, which becomes the spot. This is called a roll.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSpecifically, when you say \"buy more long term puts,\" all you're doing in betting on term structure. If you wanted to play spot VIX going up, you would play near term options. Otherwise, you're implicitly paying for future VIX months.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy does that matter? Normally, VIX is usually in contango, meaning future month's VIX is higher than current VIX (this makes sense).

The \"VIX\" most people look at/refer to is the nearest expiration VIX (spot VIX). Spot VIX uses an average of 30 day options prices on SPX to calculate implied volatility.

The VIX corresponding to that is actually 18.27 (very simplified), **NOT** the ~14 VIX you see. Let's say you buy this put, and tomorrow, the spot VIX flies to 30. What you will see when this happens (happened in March as well), is that the VIX on the September 2023 puts is VERY likely going to be less than 30. When this happens, it's usually a black swan event, and the term structure flips into what we call backwardation (less volatility as time goes on).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo sum up, each options expiration has a different \"VIX\" associated with it.
