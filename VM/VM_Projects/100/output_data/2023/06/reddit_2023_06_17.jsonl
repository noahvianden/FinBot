It's mainly targeted for beginners. **Full disclosure:** I'm a beginner too and I currently use RH. I've started trading only 6 weeks ago. But now I'm rapidly outgrowing RH. My biggest beef about RH is that their charting capabilities are inadequate. To make things worse, their \"advanced\" chart view doesn't refresh properly in real-time so I have to hit F5 key to refresh if using Firefox/Chrome/Edge on my laptop. I'm going to transition to TastyTrade soon. RH is actually very good for beginners and passive users. But active users like myself who have plans to day trade after reaching $25k, RH sucks.

Their latest 10-K seems to talk about something different:\n\n>The process by which avocados are purchased from growers differs slightly across our different sourcing regions. In California, avocado growers are provided daily field quotes, on a per pound basis, for most fruit. These quotes are based on the variety, size, and grade of California avocados and are calculated based on our expectations of how much we believe we will sell the fruit for, less our anticipated costs and desired margin. Ultimately, we pay/settle with our California growers once a month. The purchase price we pay for fruit acquired from Mexican growers is generally negotiated for substantially all the fruit in a particular grove. The Mexican avocado crop will typically have three to four blooms in a single year. Once a purchase price is agreed to on a daily basis, the fruit is then harvested and delivered to our packinghouses located in Mexico. Based on the size and quality of the fruit harvested, the final settlement with the grower on the respective day\u2019s harvest takes place approximately 14 to 21 days later. We also purchase fruit directly from third-party Mexican packers as a supplemental source to balance inventory or fulfill priority sales orders. In such cases, the already packed fruit may not be packed in a Calavo label but will be packed to our standards for shipment to either our customers\u2019 or our operating facilities. Peruvian and Colombian avocados are primarily handled on a consignment basis, in which the price we pay for the fruit is usually calculated as a percentage of the net selling price less certain charges for distribution and value-added services.", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4330558776855469}, {"body": "I love avocados and can\u2019t wait for my tree to start giving me that sweet green!", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36109909415245056}, {"body": "\"We're prepared to sell you $5 million in Credit Default Swaps\"\n\n\"Can we make it $100 million?\"", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I am at a confidence level where i'd bet 100mil on the downfall.  \n\n\nSadly my margin isn't enough.

Bought Sept2021!\n\nSold $MRNA for about 300% profit (less than $2,000!)\n\nand sold $TSLA for 300% at $24,000!  I was too excited so i sold after holding for only less than 2-3 weeks\n\nit subsequently went up to about $130-$140 level per contract.  i sold way too early.  i had what would have been a one in a lifetime lucky position.  It was my ONLY 2nd options calls trade ever up til that point (i learn from Reddit actually!)\n\nanyway my Calls was like $1500 for Mar2022.  when $TSLA was about $350-$420 level. No one believe $TSLA could hit $1500, NOT even me.\n\nBasically I missed OUT on an 57x-59x return.  Will never see something like that again. Happy with the $24k -$8k cost = $16k gain. BUT could have been $490k gain! i Missed my chance/God given opportunity to heading to be a millionaire! \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\n\nI bought it for 'fun' and it was cheap.  It was my 2nd call ever.\n\nanyway....taking profit is great.\n\nBUT with $TSLA momentum clearly heading to $300-$320 level IMO (NOT Investment advice)\n\nI would hold.  I maybe the only trade you have that will give you 5x-6x from here. That's $300k + return bruh\n\nI currently own 3 call contracts $245 for 8/2023.  yea. stupid me. should have bought more. But i did NOT want to risk too much. its a $4500ish purchase.\n\nI will hold until 2-3 days before expiry to sell (hopefully at a big win!).  hopefully I am correct and get my 3x return! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAnyway, the issue with new investors is we HOLD Losses too long and we Sell the winners too early from My experience.\n\nYOU DO YOU.  I DO IT MY WAY. i learned the hard way. I missed out on close to Half a Million dollars WIN in Sep2021!\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nps - i just went to find the trade in my statement to prove my point - just trying to share my story Buddy.\n\nGuys. pls don't judge. NOT Flexing at ALL\n\nI was Stupid. Dumb.  stupid and scared. It was my 2nd Calls ever.  trigger happy to grab profit.
