Increasing tax doesn't sustainably increase government revenue since increasing tax slows economic growth and the individuals / companies with the most to lose will often just leave.

{"title": "Why every single recession guess is completely wrong", "selftext": "You have probably heard \"oh look the vix is so low the market must be ready to just decline!\" or \"The chart is tracking 2008!\" or \"The chart is tracking the great depression!\". \n\nI assure you all of these ideas are rooted in fantasy and common pattern searching you could line up to a number of years that also don't matter. \n\nEverything hinges on the fed. Historically, fed hiking cycles are bullish and the pause cycles are also bullish. Pause cycles also typically last a long time. They do not just pause for 3 months and start cutting rates. If there is any takeaway from this post, its that you cannot go full bear until the fed simply tells you to do so by cutting interest rates for the first time. \n\n RATE HIKE CHARTS\n\nMay 16 of 2000, the Fed reached a peak rate of 6.5% after having raised interest rates for years leading into the tech bubble.\n\nHere is an example of that price action leading into the final rate hike:\n\n[ Weekly chart Jan 1998 to May 16 2000 DURING HIKES ](https://preview.redd.it/at96wzpsz66b1.png?width=1857&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d0c3c960004423075aa7d5c0fef9ee73618fa8a)\n\nAs you can see during the hike cycle of the tech bubble, there was a 22.54% draw down and this only ended up being a great dip to buy as the market only went up as high as 63.44%. For us that would be like going from 348.11 in Oct 2022 to 568.95 by March of 2024. As you can imagine, anything under 500 is actually a discount historically. \n\nHere is the housing crisis during its rate hike cycle: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Housing bubble hike cycle](https://preview.redd.it/k7rv6gvt076b1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d16faa50640ade4f67d236521c64ea4ee3c440)\n\nOur chart for our hike cycle is actually an outlier as you can see it  has been overwhelmingly bearish and just starting to turn bullish: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2022 Hikes began in March.

It ended the year down 8%. As you can see, this period of time did not see any troubles until about July. But those troubles were just brushed aside and the dip was bought. Feel familiar? \n\n Now here, the fed paused from June 29 2006 to to Sept 18 2007 which means for 1Y 2 months 2 weeks and 6 days, the going rate was just 5.25%. They laugh at Powell suggesting it will pause for \"years\" but the expectation has to be at least almost a year or more. Here is the price action during this pause:\n\n[Housing crisis Pause. ](https://preview.redd.it/3kns426u176b1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e61e52655c20e6d769f7dbc5fcb1e974b805b01)\n\nAs you can see here, the fed pause was just bullish. You had a few \"crashes\" on the way up. But the trend was only up and remained that way. This contradicted the pause cycle from the tech bubble but both only saw rallying during its initial phases. \n\nWhat all of you bears have been looking for is a fed CUT.

The pause cycle is a coin  flip between a flat market that ends down on the year or a multi year uptrend. But the ONE THING that is in common with all crashes is that the fed starts to CUT and that 1st CUT is the most bearish signal you could possibly hope for as it means something is actually wrong and not just speculatorily wrong. \n\nUse this information how you will.
