So, as of right now, I have made money today.\n\nYou didn't say if the calls are long or short, so I can't say anything about the calls. For the puts, IV crush hurts long contracts but helps short contracts. Your \"sold puts\" are short contracts, so IV crush is helping you. IV crush is particularly bad for meme stocks like AMC.\n\nHere's an exaggerated example that might help explain. Suppose the $5 AMC puts were being sold for $69. Even if AMC went to zero, that $5 gain on the puts isn't large enough to recoup the $69 cost of the put, so the long put holder loses money. The short put holder laughs all the way to the bank, because they essentially have a guaranteed $64 profit, even if AMC goes down the chute.\n\nThe analysis below is for long contracts, but if you just inverse everything this says, it's the same explanation for short contracts.\n\n**FAQ: Why did my options lose value when the stock price moved favorably?**\n\n* [Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Okay thank you a lot.
