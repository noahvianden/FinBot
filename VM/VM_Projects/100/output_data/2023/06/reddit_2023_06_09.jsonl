I could be wrong too so keep that in mind. \n\nIn the previous comment I said it was *relatively* low; that same option would have been a lot more expensive if volatility was higher. If volatility rises, that long strangle could be worth more regardless of which direction it moves. The hope there is that volatility increases before theta erodes the value of your call and put. \n\nOn the short side, that premium may not look like it\u2019ll cover the long position now, but again, if IV increases you\u2019ll be able to open each short position for more. If you use a tool like optionstrat.com you can adjust IV to see the change in premium. If you buy your long position at low IV and sell at high IV (all else equal) you profit. It\u2019s the inverse of selling an option at high IV and buying back at low IV. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s best practice to not wait until expiration on your shorts and close early, common advice is around 50% profit. Theta decay is non linear and you\u2019ll make more opening a new position. \n\nThis is a premium intensive play and requires more active management than just a short strangle. Not sure what the technical name is, maybe double diagonal or poor man\u2019s short strangle.  *Not saying it\u2019s the best answer here either*, just a way to think about things if you\u2019re concerned about IV being too low to engage in your typical plays.\n\nAt the end of they day though, you need a thesis. If you don\u2019t know which direction it\u2019s gonna move, but you think it\u2019s gonna move, that\u2019s buy a strangle or straddle. If you don\u2019t know which direction it\u2019ll move and don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna move, sell a strangle or straddle.
