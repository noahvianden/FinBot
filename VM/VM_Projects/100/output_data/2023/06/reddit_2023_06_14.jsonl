You either add or trim based on the valuation you feel comfortable with. But when something is going parabolic is means it can crash down just as easily at some point. \n\nSo let's say you had jumped in pre earnings at $300 and bought a bunch of shares, and now you had this crazy move, you probably want to hedge, especially if you plan on holding thru next earnings cycle. You can use a stop limit on your shares, but that doesn't protect you from a giant gap down, and it could be a head fake and you get stopped out only for it to keep running. \n\nSo you would use options to hedge. At this point you are up $130/share and you decide you want to walk with at least $100/share in profit. So you would buy puts at $400 to protect any downside lower than that. To offset the cost you would sell calls. If you sell the $465 call to offset the put cost there is always a chance is blows past it though. So you have to determine how much premium you are willing to outlay.\n\nBlowing past your $465 call isn't a bad thing though, you still made a lot of money. If you have the conviction you can just reopen the trade, or buy a call, whatever. \n\nBut let's say it didn't blow past the call... And it dropped to $410, you could close the call you sold, for a fraction of the price you wrote it for, and have no upside limit if it ran the next week. If the next week it was up to $450, you could write a new call at say $500 and roll your $400 put with a much further expiration for virtually no new premium basis realized. \n\nNow let's say it is consolidating around $450 for a while and looks like it is topping out and you decide you want to pull the plug, you are good exiting at $450 instead of the worst case of $400. You will end up closing that call for a profit because of theta decay (unless IV was up for some reason, but usually IV will be lower in a consolidation period outside of earnings or the like). You will close your shares and put, or sell an ITM call and keep your put on.\n\nIn terms of future entry, just pick the price you would be happy to purchase the stock outright and sell a put at that strike. If it doesn't get there you keep the premium, if it does you get the premium and the shares at the price you wanted. This doesn't make sense though when you are saying you want a 50% discount. The time value of your money on such small theta premium would be pointless. The returns in bonds/CD would be better.

This happens on both sides of the aisle. This is not news. The Twitter files did not discover this fact. If anything the Twitter files provided details about the governments interaction with Twitter and, to people who are experienced in these things, it turns out it was rather modest.\n\n13 years ago conservative judges in the Supreme Court court ruled on behalf of a Republican organization named Citizens United that it was now ok for corporations, labor unions and other wealthy individuals to use money to directly affect the outcome of elections. \n\nThis opened the flood gates for special interests to buy elections by drowning out voices that are not backed by large amounts of money. This ruling has been substantially more beneficial to Republicans as their policies are friendly to corporations and generally against the average constituents. Especially, in local elections where Republicans have since dominated. \nIt was also Republicans who pushed the FCC to pass the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which allowed media companies to expand unregulated. For example, Clear Channel Communications went from 40 to approximately 1200 radio stations and Sinclair Broadcast Group, an extremely conservative outlet, has come to own or operate nearly 200 television stations in some 100 markets covering more than 40 percent of American households. \nInstead of local ownership with a diversity of views, we now have homogenized, cookie-cutter media divorced from local concerns.\nThis goes way deeper than Biden, who was not in government, and Trump, who certainly was, requesting posts be removed from Twitter.

That means it's restrictive in a real sense. While inflation is coming down, mostly due to changes in the supply chain, the restriction of expansion of bank reserves into the market is also, to some limited extent, helping to slow economic activity.\n\nThe Fed does not want to push that needle too far. What they want is a slightly restrictive environment, rather than a rush to putting funds into the overnight repo.\n\nSee, as long as the overnight repo is extended, then banks use that rather than buying bonds, and then bond issuances have a larger impact to the economic outcome because the higher yield moves money out of private and public markets, resulting in a situation where QT's effect on reduction in economic activity snowballs until you don't have control of it anymore.\n\nBasically, every hike you do after you're restrictive has a multiplicative impact on the outcome, so now that we've hit this point, they're being more careful about pushing future hikes.\n\nThe truth is we're probably done with rate hikes, more or less. The Fed is only keeping this on the forecast because it's jawboning. They wouldn't have to do this, but the YoY comp will not benefit from very high levels of inflation 1 year previous like the first 6 months of this year did... which means inflation can moderate, but the relative impact will be less favorable to a lower number.\n\nForecasting 2 possible rate increases keeps the option open if inflation goes up more than expected on the comp, and that gives them a way to react from a credibility perspective IF by then the economic indicators aren't flashing a recession.\n\nIf they aren't, then we get some cushion from the impact of rate hikes, because slightly higher inflation on the back half just due to the comp math and a stronger economy means that you have enough space on the restrictive balance to push another 25 or 50 bps slowly onto the stack... so what they're basically saying is that the math right now does not support a rate hike, because that could push the economy into a recession.\n\nIf inflation doesn't go up more than expected, or we have weaker outcomes in the economic cycle, then they will not hike.\n\nThat totally explains today's price action, btw. The first release pushed the terminal rate up, and bond markets shot up to account for the relative increase in yield competition. Then, once they hit their position in relative real yield, flows reversed. The market sells off as flows go to bonds, bond flow increases bring down the yield, returning flows to stocks and putting \"buy the dip\" back into the reality.\n\nBasically, it took all of about 30 minutes for the market to digest the news of a new terminal rate. The actual difference to institutional balance sheets, once account for rate offsets in new bond buys, is basically nothing.\n\nSo if you're asking if what happened today was bullish or bearish, it's bullish because the risk-free rate of return is more predictable now than it was before. No one's going to look at this terminal rate change as meaningful to the cost of capital, and the pause is the greater factor. That's the signal that we're basically done.\n\nHaving said that, I think SPY 440 is a natural place for a pullback given it's the top of the channel, so I don't know that there's much to gain from a long from here unless we break above 440 with force... which could happen, but my predilection is that there will be some chop in the nearterm.\n\nEdit to add: Also, don't take the 2% target number that seriously. 2% is very hard to get and JPOW knows that. The reason 2% is the stated target is because it's the 2010s benchmark. The actual difference in prices between 2-3% is negligible and well within the growth space for our economy. Even 3-4% inflation is fine, especially with a downward trend and moderation happening in activity.\n\nKelly Evans today demonstrated the problem with the reactionary thinking when someone suggested the Fed would be fine with 3% on CNBC. She gasped and said \"OMG, that's 10% inflation in 3 years! That's too much!\"\n\nThe first conclusion I came to was that Kelly Evans can't do basic math, because 3 years of 3% inflation is 9%, not 10% LOL... all humor aside, the truth is that in a \"2% year\" you'd often have periods that rode above 2% and in a \"3% year\" you'd often have periods below that. It's basically impossible to hit the target perfectly, and the Fed has no intention of doing so in reality and the reality is that it's not a 6-9% difference between a 2% and 3% target, it's much more narrow in real terms.\n\nSo while we will be keeping the rate higher and restrictive, that's not unexpected and the Fed is not actually signing a suicide pact with the market over an arbitrary 2% target.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "This was an incredibly helpful and perfect response.
