That aside, it lacks a lot of the polish in features that Tesla has in terms of software and so forth. \n\nPreferences about looks and features like autopilot aside, you just have to deal with the fact that it's a Gen 1 product, and you have to be willing to live with all the problems a Gen 1 product comes with. \n\nI have one of the earlier Model 3s, but the new Model 3s are vastly better than the one I have. But even the Model 3 I have is a huge step up from the earliest Model S cars in terms of tech, features, and comfort. I haven't had to repair a single thing that I didn't do to the car myself by mistake. \n\nI think if the Rivian is a car you don't have to rely on and you have the funds, it seems like a fantastic vehicle.

He's criticized how it's built, loves certain features, and at the end of the day, he still has multiple cars, he has technical expertise to address any problems he has himself, and money is not necessarily an issue since he probably can write off some of it as legitimate research for his own business.\n\nHe loves it as a toy, and he has more than 1 car that's basically a toy for him.\n\nI mean, look at this thread:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/13amx7q/repair\\_costs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/13amx7q/repair_costs/)\n\nThis is not to shit on Rivian. That being said, you have to just accept the fact that you're going to suffer as an early adopter of any Gen 1 product from any company regardless of whether or not another company has figured out all the kinks of features and manufacturing on their side. First iPhone 3 or 4 iPhones were magical, yes, but they had plenty of problems, including broken lock buttons, much more fragile displays (which the industry over time addressed), a limited ecosystem, and even lost signal if you just simply held the phone as intended. iPhone 6 was so thin and made of soft aluminum that it just bent from normal use.\n\nWhen something the price of an iPhone breaks or needs repair, you can ride it out and just simply replace it slightly earlier by starving a couple of meals and not getting as many coffees for a month. When a 90k+ car breaks, you have to take PTO, figure out transportation, use a loaner car or Uber, and either pay high insurance monthlies or premiums or/and even then still pay 2-20k for repairs while your car is out of commission for 1-2 months, not 1-2 weeks. Early Model S, X, and even 3 had similar issues because Tesla was still at a phase where it was ramping and figuring out manufacturing and trying to maximize cash flow. \n\nIt just is what it is. Sandy has said multiple times that if you have to choose only one car, it would be the Model Y. The Rivian is fun because there is no pressure on him for the car to perform perfectly in all scenarios. If he had to rely on it? Different story.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sandy's main problem with the Rivian is charging.

The fact that Sandy is credentialed has nothing to do with the fact that the car to him has nothing to do with his livelihood or can actually meaningfully impact his life negatively financially or otherwise. If Bill Gates had one of his boats burned down, he\u2019d probably just use the next boat he has.\n\nSandy has stated multiple times that he enjoys it as one of 3 to 5 cars he has. I\u2019m not shitting on Rivian here. Just that if it is your primary vehicle and you don\u2019t have a lot of money, you\u2019re probably going to go through way too many headaches as a Gen 1 car for it to be worth it.

{"title": "STAG WHEEL is BACK!!!", "selftext": "What\u2019s up TRAITORS!!!!!!!\n\nYou thought I was dead didn\u2019t you? You thought beta-gang prevailed and the STAG WHEEL defeated.\n\nINCORRECT.\n\n\nNot only am I back, but I\u2019m bigger, better, and more TREASONOUS THAN EVER BEFORE! I\u2019ve spent the last 2 years grinding, collecting premium, and stacking beta gang suicide notes as I march on to WORLD DOMINATION.\n\nFor those of you that have been living under Iraq for the last few years; the STAG WHEEL is my PROPRIETARY wheel strategy that\u2019s TAKING THE WORLD BY STORM.\n\nThere is some nuance, but the gist is this: sell a cash secured put, use the premium to buy shares of the underlying, repeat until you get assigned, and do the same thing with covered calls.\n\nInstead of premium, you collect free shares. When you have 100 free shares you start a second STAG WHEEL. Then a third, and a fourth, etc.. until you basically own the entire world.\n\nIt\u2019s a revolutionary concept developed while in the throes of an Ayahuasca trip. And who is the mad architect of this game changing strategy? \n\nu/racefapery, GENIUS, and sire to you all.\n\nDue to OVERWHELMING PUBLIC DEMAND, I\u2019m r-instituting my regular updates of my STAG WHEEL demo account.\n\nIt all started a couple years back, PLTR was just under $30. I Started a stag wheel, and a few weeks later, the market started to crash on me.\n\nI held fast, sticking to the strategy, collecting free shares all the way down to $5 and reveling in the elevated premium during most of the downturn. I cleared 100 free shares in record time, and started selling 2 contracts at a time. \n\nLet me tell you, the STAG WHEEL gets punished more than other strategies during once in century fed rate cycles that include multiple, over 100% increases. But I held the line.\n\nWhile beta-gang was crying about their losses and abandoning ship, your hero battened down the hatches and prepared to go down with it. I stayed at the helm, knowing that after the storm has passed, the ship would emerge better prepared than ever to commit SERIOUS TREASON\n\nAnd now here we are, I started with nothing but $3000 in cash, and now I have almost 274 shares of PLTR, as well as 126 shares of UWMC.\n\nI\u2019ll soon be writing 3 contracts a week on PLTR, drastically reducing the time it takes to get to the next 100 free shares. This is where the STAG WHEEL really starts to pick up, as it compounds on itself exponentially, eventually I\u2019ll be writing 100 contracts a week, compounding ever faster. \n\nI actually passed into the green several months ago, thanks to all those $6 shares I picked up over the last 8 or so months.\n\nI\u2019m now looking at PLTR coming back into fashion, he stock price rising, and we\u2019re ready to enter the type of market where the STAG WHEEL has its greatest advantage: slowly up trending markets.\n\nI\u2019ll post a detailed breakdown of the last 2 years soon, it\u2019s been a wild ride, lots of edge cases to discuss, a lot of rare scenarios occurred that I want to share with you, and a lot of other stuff that you should know.\n\nMostly though, it\u2019s been a long, depressing, grind, collecting a free share or two every week, week in, week out, with the stock just going down the whole time.", "id": "14e0xyb", "created_utc": 1687235596.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR\n\nI've been doing a shit strategy that didn't make a dime for 23 months.

Here are some reasons why:\n\n-\tRelations between the U.S. and China did not sour under Obama due to wolf warrior diplomacy. Wolf warrior diplomacy is a term that describes China\u2019s more assertive and aggressive foreign policy under President Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2012, near the end of Obama\u2019s first term\u00b3. Obama\u2019s policies toward China were generally based on the principle of engaging China as a major international actor and seeking cooperation on issues of mutual interest, such as climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, and global economic stability\u2074. Obama also tried to balance China\u2019s growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening U.S. alliances and partnerships with countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and Vietnam. This was part of his broader strategy of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy toward Asia\u2074.\n-\tBiden has not continued the same policies as Trump. Trump's policies toward China were more aggressive, unpredictable, and unilateral than Obama's. They aimed to contain China's rise and challenge its behavior across multiple domains. However, they also resulted in more tensions, mistrust, and instability in the U.S.-China relationship and the broader international system\u2075. Biden's policies toward China are still evolving, but they seem to blend some elements of Trump's and Obama's approaches. Biden has maintained some of Trump's tariffs and sanctions on China, but he has also signaled a willingness to cooperate with China on issues such as climate change and pandemic response. He has also sought to restore U.S. leadership and credibility in international institutions and alliances that involve China, such as the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization\u2076.\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 6/20/2023\n(1) Biden Sees Progress With China After Blinken Meets With Xi. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/biden-sees-progress-with-china-after-blinken-meets-with-xi/ar-AA1cLymL.\n(2) Obama\u2019s past and Biden\u2019s future with China - Brookings. https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/obamas-past-and-bidens-future-with-china/.\n(3) Biden\u2019s China Policy Blends Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s, Top Aide Says. https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-china-policy-blends-obamas-and-trumps-top-aide-says-11620160559.\n(4) Joe Biden\u2019s China policy will be a mix of Trump\u2019s and Obama\u2019s. https://www.economist.com/china/2020/11/19/joe-bidens-china-policy-will-be-a-mix-of-trumps-and-obamas.\n(5) 'Hell of a job': Biden's reaction and 5 other takeaways from Blinken's trip to China. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/hell-of-a-job-bidens-reaction-and-5-other-takeaways-from-blinkens-trip-to-china/ar-AA1cMe53.\n(6) Biden: US-China relations on the 'right trail'. https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/biden-us-china-relations-on-the-right-trail/ar-AA1cLD0h.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6422778367996216}, {"body": "thanks?", "score": -11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0294650848954916}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Straight from the mouths of CCP\n\nCheers", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20743422210216522}, {"body": "Hey you seem kinda smart, can you help me understand what it is about Shenzhen that's so advantageous?\n\nMy buddy listens to this guy, I forget his name, but some kind of former political big wig with a book and always touring, anyway this dude basically says constantly that China is fucked, but like in all these fancy geo political reasons that sound logical but always felt to me like they were oversimplifying reality.\n\nSo, anyway, since I don't know shit about China, and my buddy acts like he knows everything about it because he listens to a YouTuber, any extra info you could direct me to would be helpful lol.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'll give you an example.\n\nApple decided it wanted to manufacture the first Mac Pro in the United States.

It's operating inside a pressure vessel that is 14.7psia with a 65-80f controlled climate.   \n \nWhich is well within it's design parameters.   \n \nAs for the, weird, assertion that the controller interferes with the subs systems. Wot? First off that's a design issue for the sub, not the controller, and the assumption could easily be made that no, it does not interfere with the subs systems since the shb has made many trips previously.  \n \nThe issues with the sub design are numerous. From battery issues to loss of comms to no backup plan to no manual valve for an emergency raise.. none of those issues seem to be the functioning of a mass marketed controller created by a company that likely has 10s of thousands of hours behind the testing of their product.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5250858664512634}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.376016765832901}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37689483165740967}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3868512809276581}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5399397015571594}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4498586356639862}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6308292150497437}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.581396222114563}, {"body": "I mean, at least it's Logitech!\n\nThey could've really cheaped out!\n\nLooks like it's wireless, though.
