{"title": "I singlehandedly saved the market...AGAIN", "selftext": "Hello all, it's been a while. I'm sure there are a bunch of new faces around here and it has been 2 years since my one and only post in the subreddit so, before reading this post, please check out this one -\n\n[I singlehandedly saved the market by fading myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwpky1/i_singlehandedly_saved_the_market_by_fading_myself/)\n\nI've done it again, I saved the market. This post is a little overdue, but a few weeks ago I bought a single SPY put assuming that the debt ceiling would be hit and America would default on it's debts. Since I made that play, it, of course, did not happen. Now SPY is approaching ATHs and the American money machine is pumping. Inflation went down for the 11th straight month and is at its lowest point in years. The future is bright all because of 1 single SPY put.\n\nSome of you may be saying \"Well, that was a stupid play. It was never going to work! The government would never allow a default on their own debt, this guy is an idiot.\" To that I say, how sure are you? Would you bet your life on that? Perhaps the soul of your firstborn? I know this works because it happens time and time again, this was actually the first trade I've made since my last post. I sacrificed $10 so that you all could make $1000. I saved every American's retirement account, their kids college funds, and for what? Nothing. I am a simple man who seeks no thanks, I only search for the right thing to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u31oz576et5b1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c270ed29d75765a862dbae2b7fc77d7ded9e2a29", "id": "148jsvg", "created_utc": 1686674837.0, "score": 729, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I made the ultimate market call and saved everyone's money by buying a single SPY put.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.671242356300354}, {"body": "Thank you for your sacrifice noble regard.

However, with daily DMI completed to the upside and rejecting the red bull channel resistance we could actually look for a retrace to back test support at 360.5 and 357.09. \n\nDepending on what happens tomorrow QQQ is set up to put in a new daily supply (resistance) off this daily candle at 363.26\u2026 that would open up the opportunity to come back and test 357.09 and 354.95 to take out those supplies and retest the daily 8ema before putting in a new demand (Support)\u2026 \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 354.95 -> 357.09 -> 369.32 -> 371.41  \n Demand- 349.06 -> 347.93\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xo6ntu0ptu5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=689bb8afe3e01c09ecc97560e3e2bcabb3b49f87\n\nNow on the daily VIX here we did close out a nice double top and rejection off the daily 8ema at exactly 15. \n\nIf the VIX was to fall tomorrow we most probably would put in a new daily supply at 15\u2026 which would open up an opportunity for the VIX to drop back to that 13.62 demand\u2026\n\nI have a theory and its complete tinfoil permabull fuel type of stuff\u2026. I was thinking about it and clearly market wants to go up and clearly its not sensible long term to fight this bull trend\u2026 so I was thinking the fact that the VIX was at precovid lows and back in the 13s really made it difficult for the VIX to go much lower which really makes it difficult for SPY to go much higher\u2026 what if with CPI and FOMC back to back and a nice pump on the VIX\u2026 that this is the vehicle SPY needed to pump to 440-450 now\u2026\n\nThink about it\u2026 SPY loves to unwind with the VIX and despite an 8% pump yesterday SPY did not drop lower\u2026 what if not when the VIX unwinds back to the low to mid 13s SPY finally has the momentum to push this to that 450 area? \n\nJust a thought\u2026 \n\nHowever then I take a look at the FG index and I see it sitting at 80\u2026 the 2nd highest level its been in the last year\u2026 Actually since July 2021\u2026 the FG index has only seen 80 or higher two times now. \n\nLets take a look at that once again\u2026\n\nNovember 9th 2021 the FG hit 77 and SPX was $4685\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $4513 and an FG index of 25 on December 1st. That would be a 3.8% drop. \n\nDecember 1st 2022 the FG hit 76 and SPX was $4077\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $3850 and an FG index of 37 on December 29th 2022\u2026 That would be a 5.9% drop.\n\nFebruary 1st 2023 the FG index hit 82 (the highest level in the last 2 years) and SPX was $4119\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $3856 and FG index hit 23 on March 13th 2022\u2026 that would be a 6.8% drop.\n\nSo on average over the last two years when the FG index has peaked at these levels\u2026 SPX has seen a 5.5% drop over 19 trading days\u2026 \n\nThat COULD mean if we are peaking here at FG 79 and SPX $4369 then we COULD see a drop to $4128 or SPY $412.5 by July 12th\u2026 However, if SPY pumps to $440 tomorrow that could look more like SPY $416\u2026 \n\nThis all plays into my theory that tomorrow FOMC will be a local top and Thursday minimally (perhaps Friday) could be a juicy retrace\u2026 \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xyv8utnptu5b1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=8773fa96e010ce623eefd78ce43209b6e4f7ea99\n\n(note that last call on SPX was a 1dte not sure why it says 2 thats an error)\n\nI am actually incredibly pleased with myself today and my trading results\u2026 I pretty much went into today thinking that \u201cthis retrace is an opportunity to go long on a call\u201d now of course I took some puts and I did win nicely on some of those puts\u2026 today was low % win types of day because 0dte premiums were so high in the AM and then when you switch to 1dte your premiums are so juicy you don\u2019t see much of a win\u2026 \n\nOverall though a great day of trading where I was able to make up all of yesterdays losses and then some\u2026 \n\nI have said it before and ill say it again\u2026 risk management is the key to success and profitability\u2026 Yesterday I struggled for sure and had a red day\u2026 however, I was able to successfully manage and mitigate those losses to the point where one trading day got me back to green and back up over my daily profit goal (if you subtracted yesterdays losses from todays wins). \n\nI look forward to trading tomorrow and some of the volatility that will follow with that!", "id": "148qba9", "created_utc": 1686692164.0, "score": 185, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "My money is on a pause but Hawkish JPow, mention of data driven future hikes, admittance that they\u2019re not happy with the core CPI print, and re-emphasis of no rate cuts this year.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine that after yet another high core print the fed is very happy with the current situation.", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "Im very curious what he is going to say.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I really think the student loan payment pause ending is going to have a major impact on inflation.
