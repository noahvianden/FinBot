{"title": "My current Taiwan Invasion Fund.", "selftext": "I was thinking of setting up an Taiwan Invasion Fund incase China decides to invade Taiwan. Currently. I've got: Intel (30%), Raytheon Technologies (20%), General Dynamics (20%), Lockheed Martin (20%) & Northrup Grumman (10%). Since an invasion would effectively wipe TSMC off the markets, Intel would be poised to take-over microchip production/supply in U.S markets. AMD would likely go under or be forced to buy chips off Intel. Lockheed Martin does quite well selling air defense systems & is primary manufacturer for the F-35s. General Dynamics supplies a lot of the armoued vehicles (Abrams, Bradly, M10 Booker, etc) which would be needed to retake Taiwan and/or invade Chinese mainland. Raytheon works on a lot of high-tech military systems for naval, land & sea including radar & advanced sensor tech. Northrup Grumman has a lot of good stuff, but has too much invested in the comercial space sector IMO (including ULA). Since the war would likely transition into space, I don't see this side of their business necessarily doing too well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: *Deemed unethical*", "id": "16h8voz", "created_utc": 1694566735.0, "score": 106, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|8|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I have a small amount of $ to invest in a Taiwan Invasion Fund via stocks.

Taiwan is democratic and was capitalist long before China. Neither their economy or politics are controlled by the CCP (except for not declaring independence, of course). \n2. Taiwan's military is completely separate from the PLA, and are actively planning to defend against a potential Chinese invasion. Taiwan buys US weapons explicitly to repel a Chinese invasion. That's not something that a US state would be able to do, for example (not even Texas).\n3. If China actually controlled Taiwan, they would not allow a separate President. There would instead be a provincial leader.\n4. The vast majority of Taiwanese citizens are opposed to re-unification (especially after the brutal crackdown on Hong Kong).\n5. The world didn't intervene when the Hong Kong protests were suppressed, because Hong Kong really *is* part of China (since 1997). Similar aggression against Taiwan would be actively opposed by countries like the US, Japan, and Australia.\n6.
