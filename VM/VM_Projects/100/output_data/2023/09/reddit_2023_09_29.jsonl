{"title": "Microsoft Reportedly Tried to Sell Bing to Apple in 2020", "selftext": "Microsoft executives tried to sell the company\u2019s Bing search engine to Apple around 2020, pitching the deal as a way for the iPhone maker to replace Google as the default search engine in Apple\u2019s Safari browser, Bloomberg reported. The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.\n\nThe revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Google\u2019s deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsoft\u2019s alleged sale effort appears to bolster the government\u2019s contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.\n\n[https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-reportedly-tried-to-sell-bing-to-apple-in-2020](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-reportedly-tried-to-sell-bing-to-apple-in-2020)", "id": "16v5j80", "created_utc": 1695974436.0, "score": 730, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "\"Apple now receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments \u2014 up from $1 billion a year in 2014 \u2014 in exchange for building Google\u2019s search engine into its products.
