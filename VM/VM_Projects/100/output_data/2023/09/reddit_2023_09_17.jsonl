{"title": "Taking out personal loan to buy 1-2 year leap covered calls while paying it back with regular income and cashing out or rolling over at expiration?", "selftext": "I recently turned 28 years old and have decided that I will basically have no life in 2024, 2025 and possibly 2026 in order to work 15-16 hour days everyday. I have been doing this for most of 2023 already so I know I can do it and I know how much it sucks. I am aware of the downsides of working this much but I figure short term hating your life is worth it if it means long term prosperity.\n\nI will be taking home $8k per month after taxes from work assuming I\u2019m able to consistently get these hours week in and week out. The pay is consistent and predictable but there are variables. I probably net after all my personal expenses around $6-7k per month.\n\nI originally wanted to buy covered calls expiring 2 years out each month with my income, that way if it drops I can average down. But the problem with this is, it will take about 8-12 months before I get to about $50k worth and if the stock moves up then I\u2019m screwed. I'm not worried about it dropping much to be honest.\n\nSo I thought why not take out a $25k 48 month loan, and make $3,000 monthly payments on it. But take the lump sum and buy into the position. That way I\u2019m locked in. I would then use the remaining amount left from my income to continue to buy the same CC each month. To be honest, I probably wouldn't qualify for this type loan until mid to late 2024 which is when I expect my credit score to finally recover. I would do the plan discussed above until I can qualify for the loan.\n\nI\u2019m looking at $coin. I don\u2019t think C is going anywhere, and I think Coinbase is basically going to be the last man standing in the US. Also the premiums are ridiculous. I am not a C guy.\n\nI\u2019m looking at airlines such as $aal, $ual, $dal, and $luv. Yes I know, airlines have been historically terrible investments but the US is basically consolidated and the industry is incredibly cyclical. Prices almost always begin to rise in anticipation for travel season and then drop after. Southwest is not going out of business for one. Only issue is the premiums though, they are really low. I think airlines will drop another 10% across the board which I guess will give me time to save up and accumulate.\n\nI'm also looking at banks and financial services companies such as $jpm, $bac, $gs, $c. I really like $jpm and $gs but they are still really expensive, I would want a 15% drop before I jump in. Traditional banks also don't have a bunch of premium either.\n\nI have included a list of some all the play's I am considering.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\n$coin 150CC exp 2026. Premium $23, max profit $9,054 (152%), breakeven $59.46.\n\n$coin 100CC exp 2026. Premium $33.35, max profit $5,137 (105.6%), breakeven $48.63.\n\n$coin 80CC exp 2026. Premium $38.90, max profit $3,692 (85.7%), breakeven $43.08.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$afrm 25CC exp 2026. Premium $11.525, max profit $1,214 (94%), breakeven $12.86.\n\nI have telling anyone who would listen that Affirm is a great stock to buy and swing. I thought the fair value around this time last year and throughout 2023 was $12.50. So the covered call having a breakeven around that price is great. The only risk I see is Apple encroaching and basically taking the market right from under them in the US market. Also Klarna steadily increasing their presence. Affirm stock is also incredibly volatile as I have learned and can and does easily move 2-5% daily, 10-20% weekly, and sometimes 30% within a month.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$sofi 10CC exp 2026. Premium $3.525, max profit $446 (80.5%), breakeven $5.54.\n\nSofi is a company I have been watching for years and have traded over the years. I think the company will probably hit $20 within the next 5-10 years but will most likely stay range bound between $5-12 within the next year or two.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$aal 12CC exp 2026. Premium $2.25, max profit $291 (32%), breakeven $9.09.\n\nEven during the depths of covid, $aa did not drop below $8 so I feel like the risk/reward is favorable compared to other airlines which are still significantly above covid low's.\n\n$luv 27.5CC exp 2026. Premium $7.85, max profit $566 (25.9%), breakeven $21.84.\n\nSouthwest is essentially at it's covid lows with more room to drop. I probably wouldn't touch this until it's around $25-26.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$rivn 25CC exp 2026. Premium $10.575, max profit $1,139 (83.68%), breakeven $13.61.\n\nI think Rivian will survive and will probably go on to get close to $50 within the next 5-10 years. I bought in at $12 and was waiting for it to hit $10 before jumping in but that did not happen, bottomed at $11.68 and I have regretted not getting in ever since.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$pltr 15CC exp 2026. Premium $6.325, max profit $599 (66%), breakeven $9.01.\n\nPalantir is a company that I think will survive. The government space is slow but has tremendous moats and longevity. Its commercial AI projects look promising but will most likely take 2-5 years to play out. At a $9 breakeven, the risk/reward is not bad.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$ttwo 140CC exp 2026. Premium $36.30, max profit $3,339 (31%), breakeven $106.61.\n\nThis is a play on my expectations for strong demand and sales for the new installment for GTA (Gran Theft Auto videogame). Only issue is that I think the stock could drop another $10-15 and the payout is really low, for 15% risk, I would want more money otherwise I'm better off dumping money into spy.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$spy 440CC exp 2026. Premium $71, max profit $6,763 (18%), breakeven $372.37.\n\nThis does not seem attractive at all considering how expensive the contract is, and that we are near 52 week highs and I expect a 10% drop at some point. But Spy margin requirements are incredibly low, the stock pays dividends, and simply owning shares could set me up for a low time.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$snow 160CC exp 2026. Premium $58, max profit $5,566 (53%), breakeven $104.34.\n\nI like Snowflake and it's got a sticky product that will last the next 10 years. Only probably I have is the price. I think this is a $130 stock that's currently trading for $160. Could also easily drop to sub or slightly below $100. Databricks if it IPO's will likely have better upside and risk/reward.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$mstr 340CC exp 2026. Premium $144.825, max profit $14,404 (74%), breakeven $195.96.\n\nI am a bit surprised the risk payout is not as great as you would imagine, only 74% considering this stock has a 90% margin maintence. This would be a pure C play but at only 74%, it seems coinbase a slightly safe play although not strictly C.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$meli 1,400CC exp 2026. Premium $435.50, max profit $43,884 (46%), breakeven $961.16.\n\nMeli is South America's Amazon. It is incredibly expensive but still growing. My concern is on price and would want to buy in if the stock drops to $1,000. It's currently trading just below $1,400. Also should a depend recession occur, the stock could easily cut in half but I don't see that happening. The margin maintence is 40% and I could buy one covered call per 8 to 12 months and just forget about it which would make life easier for me.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$snap 10CC exp 2026. Premium $3.40, max profit $424 (73.6%), breakeven $5.76.\n\n$snap 15CC exp 2026. Premium $2.19, max profit $803 (115%), breakeven $6.97.\n\nSnap is not going anywhere in the short term and is generally a good swing trade. Leading up to earnings the stock has risen $2-3 for the last 3 quarters before dropping $2-4 each time immediately afterwards. ATM CC seem like a reasonable risk/reward but 15 strike seems pretty attractive. Worst comes to worst, Snap gets acquired probably for $15.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "16l85k0", "created_utc": 1694975233.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.29, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "If you hate working 16 hours right now wait till you are working 16 hours to pay back a stupid 25k loan + interest for years after you took it out and lost it on a whim.\n\n\nDont take risks with money that isnt yours", "score": 117, "replies": [{"body": "I thought you were only supposed to take risks with money that isn\u2019t yours", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way!

Coinbase is just ridiculous premium wise.\n\nThe $25k loan would be paid off after 9-10 months and I wouldn't be able to qualify for it until the first 6-8 months (I think sometime in May 2024) which by then I will have already saved that much in cash (well not cash since I would be buying covered calls monthly) anyway. \n\nOnly downside I'm seeing is a huge drop that no one anticipates which brings up margin call risk especially early on but that also depends on the stock, its margin maintence, PNR and the current EPR.

The 3 year loan is paid off in 1 year. But it locks me into the position. It saves me almost 5 months.
