I also added $DIS into some of my friend\u2019s portfolios since I\u2019m gaining more confidence in their execution. I have not allocated any $DIS into the portfolio of my elderly friends/family.

The company is absolutely excelllent but this year, the stock price barely changed. I\u2019m only up 11% on $BN year-to-date. But it doesn\u2019t matter that the stock barely moved compared to the rest of asset management businesses such as $KKR because I actually want my businesses to have their stock price \u201cno change\u201d while the business continues to execute so I can keep buying more for cheaper. You must know what you own otherwise you\u2019ll do foolish things \u201cif no change.\u201d On another topic, if you don\u2019t believe in a company that you bought, the worst thing you can do is wait for it to bounce up so you can sell at break-even.
