Note that this is not some random agency, drug czar or senator recommending we reschedule it. This is part of one of two formal procedures that are able to reschedule a drug. Biden started this process last year on October 6th.\n\nThe two formal procedures are:\n\n1. Congress rescheduling or descheduling it. This was hardly worth even typing, congress doesn't pass shit at the moment. However, this will need to be done if congress ever wants to deschedule or tax weed.\n2. The current process done through the HHS and DEA.\n\nThe current process being done has 3 major time consuming steps:\n\n1. HHS reviews the medical values of the drug and recommends a schedule (1-10 years)\n2. DEA also review the drug, and in the past has always come to the same conclusion as HHS (3 months to 5 years) **<-----WE ARE HERE**\n3. A part where they let the public comment on the potential new schedule (3 months to 2 years)\n\nFor example, here is a drug that was rescheduled [with some gibberish name](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/21/2022-25212/schedules-of-controlled-substances-removal-of-18). No point in reading it, the words in that article are too big for most of you. However, following the procedure the steps took the following amount of time:\n\n1. 2 years\n2. 6 months\n3. 1 year\n\nNow then, if we are on step 2., how is it possible that we reschedule by the end of the year? **Turns out the DEA is going to skip step 3 entirely.** Skip to DD 3. if this is all you care about.\n\n# DD\n\nHere are the four major reasons I'm confident the DEA will reschedule by December (ordered from least to most convincing):\n\n**1.** Elections are happening next year. You know whens a great time to do something that is largely favorable among Democrats/Independents/Republicans? The holidays. It gives some politics you can talk about with your family that is less likely to rip them apart than almost any other topic. The Democrats will see this as a huge win, and while the process is technically entirely independent of the government, we all know that is never entirely true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.** It was [reported](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/feds-aim-to-finish-cannabis-scheduling-review-this-year-top-biden-official-tells-marijuana-moment/) in June that the head of HHS said that them and the DEA were:\n\n\u201cworking together to try to see if we can give the president an answer that\u2019s based on the science and the evidence. Stay tuned. We hope to be  able to get there pretty soon\u2014hopefully this year.\u201d\n\nNow originally when this was reported, i thought it probably meant just the HHS portion would be done by the end of the year due to how long the process is. However, knowing now the the HHS portion came out only 2 months after he said that, i doubt that is what he was referencing. Knowing how long anything takes in governments, this research was already done by that point for it to be passed off 2 months later. No reason for him to make a prediction of \"hopefully this year\" at that point. That leads me to believe he was talking about the full rescheduling. Now how would that be possible with how horrendously long the process takes? That brings me to my third point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.** You know whats a great thing to look at to understand how the DEA will handle weed? The drug made out of weed that they rescheduled 5 years ago from schedule 1 to 5 - [Epidiolex](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/28/2018-21121/schedules-of-controlled-substances-placement-in-schedule-v-of-certain-fda-approved-drugs-containing). Because reading is too hard for most of you, I'll summarize it:\n\n* Some people believe that the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) and an international treaty known as the \"Single Convention\" forces any drug in the Single Convention to be in Schedule 1 or 2 due to a court case before i was born. As seen by this rescheduling, this is not true. They realized they could reschedule it wherever they wanted as long as they made up random rules for the drugs if they put it in 3/4/5. \"control the drug in schedule III, IV, or V, and simultaneously amend the regulations to require a permit to import or export Epidiolex.\" Basically, as long as they told people they weren't allowed to import or export it they could reschedule it wherever they want. They will do this for weed as well.\n* Turns out, the part of the CSA that forces them to deal with international treaties allows them to **literally skip any part of the process they want**. \"Thus, in such circumstances, the Administrator is not obligated to request a medical and scientific evaluation\" and \"Thus, section 811(d)(1) expressly requires that this type of scheduling action not proceed through the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures\". That means they can skip both the first and last steps if they wanted. They don't skip the HHS recommendation because then they'd have no clue where to put it, but for rulemaking you know what they said? They said fuck the last part of the process and straight up rescheduled it. You know what they are going to do with weed? Fuck the last part of the process. No one wants to have to deal with multiple months of hearings listening to how weed turned their kid away from god after he injected it into his veins.\n* When was the HHS recommendation presented in this case?  \"HHS most recently updated its medical and scientific evaluation and scheduling recommendation for the Epidiolex formulation by letter to DEA dated June 13, 2018.\" When was the rescheduling done? \"Effective September 28, 2018.\" For those bad at dates, that's 107 days. 107 days from weeds HHS recommendation will be December 15th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4.** The guy i blew behind the Wendy's was a DEA agent and gave me insider info because i did such a good job.\n\n# Other Catalysts\n\nI'm too lazy to write up a post about these, but there are a few other things that could happen in the near term to spike weed company prices:\n\n**Safe banking** \\- Senate will probably pass this in the next two months. Who knows if the House will bother to pass it, or if it'll get successfully snuck in with other legislation (NDAA/Farm Bill) though. The next step here will be if they schedule a markup for the bill [here](https://www.banking.senate.gov/markups).\n\n**Uplisting** \\- Currently the American weed companies only trade on the OTC market rather than the Nasdaq, and most investment companies are not allowed to own the stocks. OTC market sucks dick, I accidentally spiked the stocks multiple percent when buying them not realizing how illiquid they are. Safe Banking/Rescheduling may be enough to let investment companies start touching these stocks (no one is quite sure yet), bringing in a ton of capital. This is the only catalyst mentioned that actually impacts the fundamentals of the Canadian weed companies as it will also let them start trying to build up their companies in the USA as they are currently avoiding it due to needing to de-list from the Nasdaq if they try.\n\n**Earnings** \\- In the past couple of years, the majority of weed companies earnings have been absolutely atrocious.

{"title": "Bullrun incoming?\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udcc8", "selftext": "Hello my little retail investors, today I became aware of an interesting, perhaps not unknown phenomenon. It seems like there is going to be another Bullrun. If you take a closer look at the course from 1962-1974, you will notice that the course took place in a specific period. In 1980 the phenomenon began to emerge in new proportions and the price multiplied as never before. But if you compare the course from 1981 to 1989, you can see that it is very similar to the course from 1995 to today. So if you trust this chemistry, you can assume that it won't be long before this event could repeat itself to the same extent in the next 2-5 years. If not even more violent. You have to keep in mind that this developed very similarly, but over a longer period of time. My theory would be comparable to a volcanic eruption. When more pressure builds up over a longer period of time, the final explosion is the most powerful. If before it took 40-50 years for the stock market to triple or quadruple, from 1980 it only took 10 years. In 1980, the USA started lowering its key interest rates again, after having had to fight inflation beforehand. If you think about it again, you realize that exactly the same thing is happening. After the key interest rates fell again, the stock market shot through the roof again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u90jbe7gcfnb1.png?width=1711&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b7c22eb4c6fc23e07b53c25b8bd9b5a9a5f402f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9faq8f7gcfnb1.png?width=1711&format=png&auto=webp&s=38274e8a7275e5ceaa5f36422b20552cf337a633\n\n **How exactly are key interest rates related to the stock market?:** \n\nHigh key interest rates are usually good for stock markets or alternative investments such as cryptos. Because the money that is borrowed now has a higher interest rate. As a result, companies are borrowing less money, including investment firms. After all, the market is in an environment in which it does not have good conditions for growth. From the moment the key interest rates fall again, the markets react very quickly and positively. \n\n If you now look at the 10-year US bonds, you can see that they are at a very high level. You get a 4% return, so to speak. This has risen sharply since the end of June. If you now look at the stock market, it fell by 4% in this period. A reallocation of money is taking place, so to speak. Many investors and investment firms are switching because the 4% return over 10 years is very good for them. In March, bonds began to fall more sharply again, but at the same time the stock market rose rapidly. They even correlate at exactly the same time. One can therefore conclude that the key interest rates will be lowered in the future. When exactly this happened is of course unclear.\n\n[10-year US bonds](https://preview.redd.it/x1midp689hnb1.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=77e58b6689eddd32f26a41f084e447a2d0ed6cad)\n\n[bonds began to fall more sharply again](https://preview.redd.it/1van09me5hnb1.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38702092a1d397ae71f39859475511bb2db5a6f)\n\n[ the stock market rose rapidly](https://preview.redd.it/qpzr44gd6hnb1.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a395895adb4bf6b7aaba8e8e59fe25f7aebdb05)\n\n**2. Possible signs of a Bullrun:** \n\nThe abolition of the gold standard should also not be ignored. But what exactly is that? Currencies used to be tied to gold. In other words, you couldn't print as much money as you wanted today. This had to be backed with gold. In 1973, the United States abolished this, but promised to reintroduce it soon. After monetary policy was completely turned inside out, a world was created in which an infinite amount of money could be printed. The decision to end the gold standard brought a great evil upon the people. Money no longer had its original value, it simply became a promise that the paper had value. This created artificial inflation and solved every problem with printing money. However, there are also positive aspects. Virtually every country in the world has enormous debts that can never be repaid. At the same time, the amount of money in circulation is constantly increasing over time. Means more money will exist. This has ensured that investments such as real estate, commodities or stocks will always increase over time. In addition, the theory of eternal increases is circulating due to current monetary policy and this is exactly the case at the moment. The more money there is, the more will be invested in assets sooner or later, which in turn drives prices up. This refers to the entire market. ETFs and indices are the best examples of such cases. These will only increase over time as there is more and more money. An unprecedented increase in the money supply could be seen right at this point when it began to rise more strongly. After the gold standard was abolished, the amount of money in circulation increased rapidly and a large portion ended up in investments. This is still the case today. In the past, one could often observe that whenever the situation seemed to be at its worst, a big bull run followed. If you look at this objectively, you can see that the key interest rates in the USA are slowly reaching their end. Of course, it could be that these are increased one or two times by a small 0.2%. However, inflation is almost at the desired 2% (currently it is just over 3%). Over time, the key interest rate will be lowered again in the future. This could happen in 2024 or 2025. The post-rate cut period will be a huge boost for the market. If you compare this to the bull runs from the past. In addition, the current monetary system will cause more money to flow into the market anyway, which will ensure that it will always rise in the long term. Unless the monetary system is changed again.\n\n[Promise that Paper has value](https://preview.redd.it/mk0ddgnr5hnb1.png?width=2436&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13e3255876aaf10246ab51e4572267e8fbc63b2)\n\n[After the gold standard was abolished](https://preview.redd.it/h1chmsgv6hnb1.jpg?width=1985&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a683858fe83994cdeaf50e438a7ed5909db00936)\n\n[key interest rates in the USA are slowly reaching their end](https://preview.redd.it/hq7ohha08hnb1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b601cef6316e43358c8fe93f7754833eb8297d)\n\n[inflation is almost at the desired 2&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/ah9oike58hnb1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=540576bf5e962c0658f5bcbada8a47e1f893b767)\n\n**3. Possible reasons for a crash before the Bullrun:**\n\nNormally no one can predict the future accurately. So there is also a second side that should not be ignored. One should be aware that there are several factors that could cause a crash. A crash can happen at any time. Of course, this does not determine whether it is over, it will only fall during this time and it will not rise. Later, when the market has recovered after the crash, it will rise again. If you look at decades of data, you will see that the price rises more often than it falls. This almost happened at the beginning of the year when many banks went under. In 2008, for example, when Lehman Brothers had to file for bankruptcy due to the financial crisis, this triggered a huge crash. We almost experienced the same thing, which was prevented by giving money to the banks. Another reason for a possible crash would be that the demand for products falls. But this is the least likely. The chart shows that consumption is still very strong and job layoffs are not necessary. The third reason is the most logical why the bull run will be delayed due to a crash. Inflation is no longer falling and the Fed has to raise interest rates even more. Inflation has stagnated and no longer falls below 3%. Jerome Paul says they have to keep raising interest rates if necessary. If we can still get inflation down to the desired target in the future, things could get worse. At this point there would be a lot of selling and the higher key interest rates would make US bonds even more lucrative and therefore more money would be shifted. But this would only be in the very short term, because at some point the key interest rates would be reduced again after the desired inflation has been eliminated. And then comes the bull run and even stronger because the market crashed beforehand. \n\n[Consumption is sttill very strong, job layoffs are not necessary](https://preview.redd.it/2l6jjdrd7hnb1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ee25d8c8f4cb45f211bb16b4ad326e742fe37c2)\n\n[Stagnated Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/25u6fmiw8hnb1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=b997a362fee793ac485528e0d8cea407742841dc)\n\n**4. Fazit:**\n\nEither way, a bull run always happens and of course no one will know whether the market will crash beforehand or not. Most of the time people overreact or are more negative than they actually are. Many studies have also shown that the best strategy is to simply buy and hold and not let fearful issues upset you. \n\nThank you for reading and the upcoming comments \ud83d\udc02\ud83e\udda7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "16f8xfn", "created_utc": 1694373546.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 170, "comments": [{"body": "Why use many word when few word do trick", "score": 363, "replies": [{"body": "It's the guy at the party that thinks that if he never stops talking others won't have time to call him on his bullshit.", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "*Ben Shapiro has entered the chart*", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11134249716997147}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10568641871213913}, {"body": "Line go up.
