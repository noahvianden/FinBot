{"title": "Overpopulation\u2026 Forever", "selftext": "Preface - I\u2019m completely new, ignorant, investing for the first time. Apologies for the word count below.\n\nCurrently - doing research\n\nThe past - Observing massive media doom going back to pre-2016. The message on 8 year old YouTube videos from CNBC etc = doom. \n\nThe past in reality - massive, unprecedented, unpredicted growth. Growth so delicious that ETF boom occurs. \n\nPresent - uncertainty is identical to past 8+ years. Narrative is the same\n\nFuture - the truth as I see it, as an outsider, as a complete noob = overpopulation ->\n\nWorld overpopulation is the reason the market can\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop. These aren\u2019t bubbles. The bubbles you\u2019re seeing are new investors in the US, India, everywhere.\n\n330 million in America = inevitably more investors. 8 billion worldwide. People exiting the third world in South America due to Lithium alone will be huge. Continent of Africa has barely begun industrialization.\n\nWe, as ignorant new investors don\u2019t know anything but buy. African new money = buy. India buy. USA buy. Unemployment low, more retirement accounts = buy. As noobs, we don\u2019t even know we are bulls. Buy VOO? Sure. Nvidia, makes sense. Noobs buy.\n\nLook at housing market, 65 million new homes predicted in USA. 1% of housing market currently for sale = overpopulation. Endless growth. \n\n5 trillion in ETF\u2019s? Go ahead and short that bubble. But will there be 50 trillion in ETF\u2019s by 2030? \n\nYup. Because of overpopulation. The answer is always overpopulation. Going forward humans are literal compound interest as 8 billion grows and grows and grows. \n\nThere are so many people visiting Venice that it sinks WHILE tourists are there, and rises when they leave. Google any location, too many people, too many tourists not enough houses, schools, not enough condos, hotels\n\nLast thing. I like to learn. So if I\u2019m wrong tear me a new one. Best way to learn is be dead wrong.\n\nIf you\u2019re experienced figure out a way to fleece the noobs.

One typically marks an upward trend (population growth) of an economic cycle while the other marks a downward trend (concentration of wealth) of an economic cycle.\n\nRight now we are actually experiencing what seems to be the beginning of world population decline rather than growth. Look at China, Japan, Italy.. Hell, even the US had a nominal population growth rate of .01% in the most recent population report (full year 2021), and that's with one of the largest influxes of immigration in the world. But if you look closely, you will see that outside of India and a few other instances, populations are getting older and less productive.\n\nI think in large part this has to do with technological advances replacing everyday jobs and monopolization. Think about it. Younger generations (some gen x, millennials and gen z) across the globe can't afford to have kids because there are not enough high paying jobs available to make it worthwhile. They have either been automated away or outsourced to a foreign country (which will later also be automated away) by corporations looking to increase income from decreasing expenses.\n\nUnless something changes in favor of small businesses or the middle class such as breaking up big corporations, I think we are at the top of the preverbal bell curve in terms of economic growth for a long time. Does that mean that the economy cannot grow anymore? No, of course it can. But I do not believe it can grow at the pace that it once did during the 1940's or 50's. This is apart of the inevitable trend of market cycles  over long periods of time that experience large ebbs and flows.\n\nMarx and Engles coined the term Late Stage Capitalism to describe era. Adam Smith wrote about the dangers of unregulated markets and monopolies in \"The Wealth of Nations\".\n\nThis is all to say that any more money that can be squeezed out of the US economy at this point is just diminishing returns and will likely be from consolidation of capital at the top with little at the bottom. Its like trying to squeeze toothpaste out of an almost empty tube. Any time you have this type of stratification between classes, it begins to resemble Feudalism or something akin to an oligopoly. That in itself is usually the canary in the coal mine for a nations downfall.\n\nEDIT: Spelling", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But.

A lot more shit has to go right then wrong. Its not just a poor country becomes rich by offering a rich country cheap labor and goods story. Its that plus a whole lot more.\n\nYes, more people in growing nations investing in our countries stock market is generally good for that stock market as is any person investing in our stock market versus another. But as a whole, that does not compensate for the declining birthrates and economic growth around the world. \n\nThe analogy I was making about America is also important because for the most part, there was a galvanized union of like-minded, hard working individuals all playing the same rules to work hard and make it. China is a great example of a rapidly developing nation with a growing population and gdp. They were an incredible example of a nation that went from dirt poor to wealthy in a very very short amount of time. This one was of the most impressive feats of modern history, and it could only really be done by either submission (communism) or a chorus of individuals all freely working together for a similar outcome.\n\nIn short, that type of growth at such a speed is usually unstable for a reason because it is simply not sustainable. So rapid growth from developing nations tends to compound slower over time. Which means it will not outpace the current trajectory of economic and population decline around the world. Atleast not at this rate.\n\nJust to be clear, the stock market \\*\\*will\\*\\* continue to grow, but not for reasons that will in the long run be good.
