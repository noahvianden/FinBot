I'm not that experienced and I never use covered calls yet I feel like I should", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sure.\n\nSo there are two types of options, calls and puts.  They are contracts they give you the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price during a certain timeframe.  The contract is always for 100 shares of the underlying stock.  You can either buy an option or sell one.\n\nThere are a lot of permutations on that, but \u201cwriting a covered call\u201d typically means someone is selling a call contract AND they already own the underlying shares (again, blocks of 100).  It will have a strike price and expiration date.  It will allow the buyer who paid the premium to \u201ccall away\u201d those shares at the strike price during the time window.\n\nSo for my specific example yesterday I wrote calls with a September 15 expiration date.  The strike price is $280.  Because I was the one writing the call, I pocketed the premium - $220 per contract direct into my pocket immediately.  That money is guaranteed and can\u2019t be taken away from me.  However, now the clock is on to see if I will be able to retain my shares as well (I.e. the option expires worthless in the hands of the purchaser).\n\nIf Tesla stays below $280 between now and September 15th then the options will expire worthless and I will keep all my shares.  And then I\u2019ll probably do the same thing again.  Over the past year I\u2019ve made nearly $10k doing this and have not lost any shares yet.\n\nIf Tesla goes above $280 (especially if it\u2019s above $280 on the close date) then I will likely lose my shares.   Let\u2019s say Tesla is at $300 on close date, my shares would be \u201ccalled away\u201d from me at $280/share despite the fact that the market price is $300 - because I wrote that contract.   My 100 shares per contract will be turned into $28,000 cash.  The option contract buyer could then go and sell their new block of 100 shares they just got for $280 on the open market for $300, so they would be \u201cup\u201d $2,000 on that trade (minus the $220 they had to pay me for the contract in the first place).\n\nGiven that I got my shares in 2017, my cost basis is like $13 so I\u2019m just being forced to lock in like 2,000% gains anyway - so it\u2019s kind of win win for me.
