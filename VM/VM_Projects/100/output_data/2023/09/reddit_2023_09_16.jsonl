{"title": "The Future of Apple: Time for a Reality Check or a Steady Hold?", "selftext": "The tech community is buzzing with opinions about Apple\u2019s latest release, the iPhone 15, and it's clear that the reception has been more tepid than previous iterations. As long-time Apple investors, we've enjoyed the highs of groundbreaking releases, but is it time for a reality check? Is AAPL overpriced, or are we merely on the cusp of another wave of innovation that will take the stock to new heights?\n\n## Mild Reception for iPhone 15\n\nEven the most avid iPhone users appear somewhat unimpressed with the latest features. The question that looms is whether Apple has reached a plateau in terms of smartphone innovation. After all, how much better can a phone camera get? Is faster processing power enough to justify upgrading?\n\n## AAPL Stock in Rough Waters\n\nThe stock has been wobbly, and many are wondering if a market correction is overdue. The high valuation of AAPL stock might seem unwarranted based on current product releases. So, should investors cut and run or stick around for the next big thing?\n\n## Hidden Potential: Siri and LLm\n\nWhile it's easy to focus on tangible products, let's not forget Apple's potential in software and services. Rumors of significant Siri improvements and the much-talked-about LLm feature could turn the tide for the tech giant. We've seen how software services like Apple Music and the App Store have become significant revenue streams; could a next-gen Siri do the same?\n\n## Never Rule Out Innovation\n\nApple has always been a frontrunner in technology. Whether it's introducing the first iPhone or changing the way we listen to music with the iPod, Apple has continually set new industry standards. As investors, perhaps what we need is not skepticism but patience. \n\nSo, to my tech industry peers and fellow Apple stockholders, I'm eager to hear your thoughts. Is it time to be wary, or should we hold on for what could be another exciting chapter in Apple's story?", "id": "16k2bko", "created_utc": 1694853482.0, "score": 98, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "Pro tip: do the opposite of whatever the general consensus of here says", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "Basically when fearful,get greedy\n\nWhen greedy, become fearful", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Warren Buffett", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing how did you know that", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1815367043018341}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2800549566745758}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20558598637580872}, {"body": "Apple will either continue to grow or raise their dividend.

So if I buy one and my ssd went bad, which happened on my moms MacBook Air out of warranty, she didn\u2019t get I couldn\u2019t fix it. I always fixed thing, she got mad and thought I was not helping and I got screamed at until I left.\n\nShe got a MacBook m1 after I told her that her laptop couldn\u2019t be fixed. Someone charged her $400 to reinstall it a few times and I finally told her it\u2019s not worth $400 and she was halfway to a new MacBook, thing is if it\u2019s storage fails, it\u2019s out of apple care or if it is the laptop is done for.\n\nSo having had Nvme go bad, having had such bad luck with my last MacBook. I have an iPhone, but I haven\u2019t been tempted to get a MacBook at all bc Lenovo upgraded me and apple didn\u2019t.\n\nMy brother had less problems in 2008 and they replaced an  early MacBook with a unibody metal one, they comped apple care, so way back I would have gotten a new computer, an AirPod failed in the 9th month and resetting it fixed it. I was going to get an Apple TV but they wouldn\u2019t replace the AirPod bc it was out of warranty, even though I had called in, it\u2019s less than two years old. My five year old sennheiser headphones still work fine, they need new ear things to look new, the AirPods sounded better, but $69 for one bud is a lot. It turned me off from buying an Apple TV or even a new mac. Bc I had such a bad experience, I used macs from 2004 until 2016 and haven\u2019t had one since. My customer support has been better.\n\nSo it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t need a new laptop with a processor similar to an m1, if I have lost faith in their previously amazing customer service, why should I buy another apple product? I have an iPhone bc it\u2019s a legit good device but it\u2019s a 13 and I see no need to upgrade it until it stops getting software updates, security updates, so 3 more years of os but also I\u2019m annoyed about the AirPods and MacBook, and Lenovo gave me a laptop with twice what my original one was\u2026. Dunno if they have better customer support, why buy apple?\n\nIt used to be 1. Vastly better hardware/os 2. Customer service 3. Ecosystem.\n\nMaybe macOS is better than windows 11, but my laptop had multitouch and I can play civ 5 with friends on the 2-1 form factor, I\u2019d need a MacBook plus an iPad with sidecar or an iPad with a similar game. GeForce 1650-max q means forza and a lot of new games run. 4k hdr screen.\n\nTo get a MacBook that nice would be expensive. I also don\u2019t trust the company if it breaks or I get a defective system. I also can\u2019t fix it myself.\n\nI could replace anything in the Lenovo.\n\nIf the m1/8gb is enough for desktop use, than why get an m2 or m3 unless you make movies or edit pictures or do graphics? I can do Corel painter 2023 with gpu acceleration right on my screen, I don\u2019t need an iPad for sidecar for that either.\n\nThe game thing is also a limit. Intel macs came with subpar gpus but they could play games, I don\u2019t know about new ones, I could stream from my gaming pc, it\u2019s what I do with the Lenovo with anything that needs 4k, I just don\u2019t see the need to replace it, I don\u2019t feel apple will hook me up if it\u2019s messed up.
