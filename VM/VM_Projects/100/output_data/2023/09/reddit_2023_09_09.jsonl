{"title": "MercadoLibre seems absurdly undervalued.", "selftext": "My portfolio is up 50% this year.  I have a portfolio that is 100% growth stocks and I\u2019ve taken some time to look at valuations to evaluate if I have companies that seem to be over their skis in terms of valuation.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.\n\nI have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I\u2019m seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)\n\nEvery other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.\n\nBut according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.\n\nIf my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying \u201chell no!  Always stay diversified!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says \u201c5 stocks minimum\u201d. The other says, \u201cwhy buy anything but your best idea?\u201d  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre\u2019s services, so it\u2019s a company I can get behind on a personal level.  I think Lynch would approve.\n\nI\u2019ve just never put all my money into one stock before, but this seems like an insane bargain.  \n\nWhat do you think?

I live in Brazil and I am a regular Mercado Libre customer (here it's called Mercado Libre, in Portuguese. But it's the same company). Brazil is one of the largest markets Mercado Libre operates, if not the largest. So being a regular Mercado Libre customer in Brazil for the past 5 years I would say I can have a fairly good insight on its moat from the customer perspective.\n\nHere Mercado Libre has beaten the concurrency for the past 5 years or so. Amazon has not half the popularity of mercado Libre, simply because Mercado Libre has built a high customer base throughout the years and also because most of the sellers are on Mercado Livre, but few are on Amazon. Mercado livre is the one stop place for technical equipment in any field, from dentistry to sound equipment. Huge variety and great customer support. So far, that would be a great moat.\n\nBut recently there is a crucial aspect of Mercado Libre's customer relations that is making me think the current management is not as cautious as it has been in the past: Brazilians (and probably customers for other countries too) are simply being unable to connect to their accounts on desktop computers. A malfunction on their login system on browsers makes it almost impossible to use your account. The only way to access your account as a customer is by the mobile app. There is no 2 step authentication and no way to use your phone to login on your desktop. It's simply not possible for Brazilian customers to login on their accounts if they attempt it using a PC. The Brazilian internet is full of complaints about it and it has been going on for a very long time. So it's certainly not something that is affecting few users, it's widespread. And Mercado Libre never addressed this issue.\n\nWhile this may seem a trivial issue, I'd say it's a red flag. A company that has conquered a great portion of the market that suddenly incurs in such carelessness may or may not keep growing. I think it's just too many people complaining for the company to ignore it. \n\nAmazon has not half the variety of sellers that you find on Mercado Libre. But Amazon has fast delivers, and a great user interface. I myself created a recently an account on Amazon to search for stuff I could not buy on Mercado Libre because I could not access my account. In the end I used mercado Libre on my phone and made the purchase. But this was simply due to the price: it was cheaper on Mercado Libre. But I wonder how many other frustrated customers created their account on Amazon and bought from Amazon instead from buying from Mercado Libre.\n\nWhen you're shopping for expensive technical equipment you want to use your desktop browser, so you can open many tabs at the same time, compare vendors, prices and products within Mercado Libre vast inventory. But if you are pushing your customers to Amazon by preventing them from using their accounts on their desktop in the Brazilian market, you must have something wrong with administration.\n\nIf this was something that had been spotted and solved quickly, most people would not even notice the issue. But it has been going on for more than a year. According to.the older posts I've seen. And this is terrible for customers of technical equipment, a segment that Mercado Libre excels.\n\nSo this raises a red flag on whether the current administration is going to sink Mercado Libre. I think this is a red flag because it is an indication of mismanagement. What If be does start switching to Amazon to recover their customers?\n\nI would not regard Mercado Libre as a long-term investment. I don't believe on its moat and that is what Amazon needs to take its place. And you will not see info on how many vendors may have opened stores on Amazon on Mercado Libre's reports. It's a very important thing that can't be on the reports. You must know the market to realize this. And this is very dangerous for Mercado Libre.\n\nI do think it's currently undervalued but I also think it may not perform well in the future if it's giving away its customer base.
