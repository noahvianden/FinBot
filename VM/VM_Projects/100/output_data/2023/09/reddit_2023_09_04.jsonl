Gelsinger added that following on from Meteor Lake (expected to be launched later this month), Intel will be ramping its Intel 3 process (5 nm) \u201csoon\u201d. Perhaps more excitingly \u2013 and tantalizingly \u2013 Gelsinger said that Intel has received a large customer pre-payment for its 18A node (1.8 nm) that has already been successfully taped out and is on track for 2025.\n\nOne can only speculate as to which company this \u201clarge customer\u201d is. TSMC also claims it is on track for its own 2 nm process node in 2025 and already enjoys the patronage of major customers including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, MediaTek along with Apple. Undoubtedly, Intel will be keen to secure at least one of these companies as it helps with its own economies of scale as investing in each of these new process nodes is a multi-billion-dollar endeavor. In the end, the competition in the foundry sector is great for customers as it is driving the delivery of faster, but also more efficient chips.\"", "id": "169x6lx", "created_utc": 1693846265.0, "score": 460, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": ">One can only speculate as to which company this \u201clarge customer\u201d is. \n\nIt's Ericcson.\n\nIt was on a slide they shared that Ericsson SoC is their 18A customer.", "score": 167, "replies": [{"body": "While I\u2019m sure Ericsson is a customer, I am sure that the large customer is someone else.
