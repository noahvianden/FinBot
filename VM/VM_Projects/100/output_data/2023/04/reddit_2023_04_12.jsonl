{"title": "Buffett says US bank deposits are safe and the government would backstop all of them if necessary", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/12/warren-buffett-us-bank-deposits-are-safe.html\n\nWarren Buffett said Americans should not be concerned about their bank deposits in the wake of the latest financial shock in the sector and the government would ensure no depositor in this country lost a dime. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be worried about losing the money and the deposits they have in an American bank, and today, they have no reason to worry,\u201d said the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO in an interview with Becky Quick from Tokyo on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d Wednesday. \u201cBut the message has gotten very confused and people don\u2019t really understand how it all works.\u201d The banking sector went through a brief panic in March as depositors fled Silicon Valley Bank, which had mismanaged its bond portfolio and was overly leveraged to the tech industry. Fear grew that depositors with more than the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit would lose their money. But over the weekend on March 12, the government backstopped all depositors in SVB, along with those in Signature Bank, no matter the amount they had with the banks.\n\nBuffett said the government would likely step in to backstop all depositors in all U.S. banks if that was ever necessary, though he did note that would require Congressional approval. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the OK,\u201d he said when asked if Congress would approve that extraordinary action. Buffett noted that Congress would also adjust the debt ceiling for this to take place in order to avoid financial ruin for the country. Buffett noted that shareholders may lose out if more bank failures occur and rightly so, but depositors shouldn\u2019t be worried. Bank closures are an issue that\u2019s impacted Buffett personally, he said, with his dad losing his job and savings in the 1930s when the bank he worked at failed.\n\nBuffett, 92, said he so confident that U.S. depositors are safe that he would put a million dollars of his own money in a bank and challenged someone else to do the same. He said he will give that money to charity at the end of the year if just one American lost their deposits through a bank closure, but he keeps the other person\u2019s money if U.S. depositors remain whole. \u201cIf any American depositor has lost money from a bank failure, the other soul gets to name where the $2 million goes, to what charity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t, I get the payment. And that\u2019s a firm offer, and we\u2019ll see who steps up.\u201d", "id": "12jly7z", "created_utc": 1681305363.0, "score": 443, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "His million dollar bet is the same as me betting a penny.", "score": 287, "replies": [{"body": "He sounds exactly like a guy who has tons of money in\u2026 bank stocks.", "score": 54, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45405662059783936}, {"body": "A full 0.0009% of his net worth!\n\nThe equivalent of somebody with a net worth of $1 million making a $9 bet", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5927731990814209}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "....", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23363374173641205}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13128209114074707}, {"body": "![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0028181897941976786}, {"body": "I mean I would bet $1000 the exact same way, you want to take the other end of that bet?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Good for you, but Warren Buffett is not as confident as you in risking such a percentage of his net worth, and I trust his judgement better than yours.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44355878233909607}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6780850291252136}, {"body": "He owns insurance companies that insure larger deposits than the FDIC.

Some critics charge that by reflecting consumer substitution the BLS is subtracting from the CPI a certain amount of inflation that consumers can \"live with\" by reducing their standard of living.
