The term spread used by the New York\u00a0Fed refers to the gap in yields between\u00a0the 10-year Treasury bond and the 3-month bill.\n\nWhen yields on shorter-term bonds are higher than yields on longer-term bonds, the yield curve is considered\u00a0inverted.\u00a0\n\nAn inverted yield curve has reliably predicted each of the previous eight U.S. recessions since 1970.\n\nWhen a yield curve is inverted, investors fear\u00a0that the current high level of interest rates, reflected in elevated shorter-term yields, will push the economy into a recession, causing the central bank to cut interest rates in the future, thus discounting presently lower longer-term yields. This is why an inverted yield curve is often a precursor to a recession.\n\nThe **SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF** (ARCA: BIL), is a popular ETF which offers exposure to the ultrashort end of the Treasury\u00a0curve, investing in zero coupon U.S. T-Bills with less than three months until maturity.\n\nThe\u00a0**iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF**\u00a0(ARCA: IEF), instead offers exposure to Treasury bonds\u00a0with seven to 10 years to maturity.\u00a0\n\n**Treasury Yield Curve Inversion: Where Are We Now?**\n\nIn March, the term spread was negative 1.15%, as\u00a010-year rates were\u00a0around 3.5% and 3-month yields were\u00a0around 4.65%. The 10-year-3-month yield differential has further\u00a0worsened to a negative 1.6% at the time of writing, with the 3-month yield jumping to 5.2% and the 10-year yield trading at 3.6%.\n\nIf such a spread\u00a0holds or expands further in April, then the next month's\u00a0New York Fed\u00a0recession probability indicator will likely become even\u00a0more negative than its previous assessment of a 57.8% chance of a recession occurring before March 2024.", "id": "12s4uwe", "created_utc": 1681927495.0, "score": 276, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 160, "comments": [{"body": ">An inverted yield curve has reliably predicted each of the previous eight U.S. recessions since 1970.\n\nBut were there moments where we had an inverted curve for a decent amount of time, but not recession?", "score": 148, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "A yield curve inversion has historically always preceeded a recession.

Personally i choose to DCA average into index funds and a couple blue chip stocks so I do not time to market but if I had to predict what is going to happen I would say we are looking to trade flat for quite a while or have a rather minor recession followed by flat trading for a couple years I personally don't think we are going to see a -50% bomb like alot of people on Reddit are predicting.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As you should\u2026hopefully at the very least you are able to max out your roth. I am still DCA into index funds as well. Honestly, the only true risk to this strategy in the long run is an economic collapse. A retirement account would be the least of your worries in this scenario. \n\nFirst off, the stock market is not the economy. It is possible, although unlikely, to have a recession without the stock market sinking/crashing. Trying to time, or predict the direction of, the stock market is no different from trying to predict which slot machine will pay. Now as to why I believe a recession is likely.\n\n* You don\u2019t fight the fed. The fed is predicting, and assisting in the start of, a recession. \n\n*Fed funds rate is now at levels not seen since 2007-2008. This doesn\u2019t directly lead to a recession, but it leads to a tightening of credit which is recessionary in nature. Any business that has been surviving on free money(low rates) - no longer has access to this free money. This will lead to bankruptcies, which we are starting to see. Many businesses will also restructure/cut costs - less business investment, lower pay/benefits, job cuts, etc. \n\n* Business inventories are rising. This has a negative effect on companies\u2019 cash balances - not good with tightening credit. This also leads to companies reducing outgoing orders for product. This is mostly the cause for why you see manufacturing output rapidly declining.\n\n* The economic equilibrium is out of balance. Since the last recession, wage gains have paled in comparison to price increases (this was a problem prior to Covid and many were already predicting a recession before the pandemic). This rapidly accelerated in the last few years - so it is the same problem as before covid, but now much worse. \n\n* Yield curve inversion - I have seen this \u201cdoomsday\u201d indicator recirculating online for months now, however, I suspect most do not understand what this is telling us. This means investors rather collect a fixed return over a longer period, because they view the potential reward for other investment options as not being worth the risk. I.e. They are expecting an economic downturn. \n\n* Federal assistance programs and debt repayment deferrals have/are coming to an end. This will only add insult to injury for already cash-strapped consumers. This leads to less expenditure. \n\nAlmost every economic indicator, with the major exceptions of unemployment data and the stock market, are pointing towards a recession. However, both of these indicators tend to lag behind the others. It may sound stupid - but I am hoping for a recession. Cooling periods are a normal/healthy part of the economic cycle.

You also need to get some better sources. [EPA.gov](https://EPA.gov), the ICCT report, and [sciencedirect.com](https://sciencedirect.com) are highly political institutions.\n\nHere's the facts around renewable energy (excluding nuclear and hydro which are actually amazing).\n\nRenewable energy (wind and solar) are intermittent, low density forms of energy. While they technically always exist on earth, they do not always exist in the same geographic location, and require a ton of effort to concentrate and turn into usable power. The sun only shines during the day, and the wind does not always blow. Since these realities go against our basic energy demands (we need heat when its cold and dark, irrigation and cooling when it's hot and not windy) we create grids which have BOTH the hydrocarbon capacity for energy generation and a secondary supporting layer which is made up of unreliable energy like wind and solar. This is massively inefficient and causes tons of problems, but even putting that aside, there is not a single grid in the entire world which relies on wind or solar for its power needs.\n\nHydrocarbons like oil, gas, diesel etc. are very dense forms of energy. They also benefit from being highly portable, easy to store across long periods of time, and cheap to produce. The reason that people want to transition to electric vehicles is not because we want to 'reduce exhaust fumes'. There are very strict regulations already in place for car emissions, and in most wealthy countries with good rule of law this is already not an issue. You're also just exporting your emissions to another location where the power is actually generated, so not exactly a huge accomplishment. The real reason people want to transition to electric vehicles is because they have bought into the lie that our energy consumption is going to destroy the world. They think C02 (plant food) moving from 250ppm to 450ppm is going to disrupt the delicate balance that existed in nature and kill us all, which is insanity. Governments have acted on that insanity to take tax money and put it towards 'green' energy sources, which is why all these companies pander to ESG narratives and why companies like Tesla can sell inferior products to consumers.\n\nOnly a complete moron would think building an entirely new stock of vehicles worldwide which relies on batteries (mineral mining + energy use) and a theoretical solar and wind grid which doesn't work and would require more mineral mining and energy use to even have a hope of existing would be a net benefit to the planet.
