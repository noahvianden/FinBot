VR headsets use different tech than normal  displays, it is not the same thing.\n\n>hardware is known for being kind of shit\u201d\n\nAnd so you linked a speculation article from 3 years ago on a chip already out the door. Well, let me tell you how that turned out .\n\nSo let's talk about apples best chip, the M2\n\nIt's 8 core 8 thread , max clock for half the cores 3.5, and 2.8 for the other half. It has integrated graphics, which are fine for a laptop, but literally useless if you need to do anything graphically intense (like VR).  No L3 cache at all. 24gb max ram\n\nIntel and AMD have mid range chips that are better than this. 8 cores, perfectly fine, 8 threads... Not going to cut it in VR. Intel and AMD flagships have anywhere between 12-24 cores, and double the amount of threads. 24gb of ram is not enough in VR applications today, which is probably why Intel and AMD allow over a hundred. L3 cache is pretty useful for CPU heavy applications, like lots of VR applications are, and that's why AMD made an entire line of chips with more L3, and Intel followed. 3.5ghz clock speed slow AF. Intel and AMD are both over 5 at this point, and not just for half the cores. \n\n\nSo yes, apples hardware does in fact suck, and has literally zero chance of running any hardware intensive tasks. Even less of a chance running VR because integrated graphics are what they are.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely thrilled to see how this comment ages", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.011517051607370377}], "tickers": ["intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["meta", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Ah damn.

{"title": "Your lotto play for META's earnings tonight", "selftext": "Yesterday, I posted about MSFT's earnings [and anyone who listed banked hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/). The stock is up 8.5% today, calls up massively. My last earning post before that was last week with [Tesla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/) which did extremely well too. Now we're looking to print more with META today. Who's ready? \n\nThe company will report its Q1 2023 earnings today after market close. The Facebook parent has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of tech's year-to-date rally, the company's stock climbing nearly fucking *70%* in 2023 ($124 -> $211). The company's \"year of efficiency\" messaging and execution has resonated with shareholders (us), so the next question is \u2013 can ol' Zucky keep it up? \n\nHere's what analysts on Wall Street are expecting to see out of Meta:\n\n* Revenue: $27.67 billion\n\n* EPS: $2.01\n\n* Advertising Revenue: $26.76 billion\n\n* Family of Apps Revenue: $26.88 billion\n\n* Reality Labs Operating Losses: $3.8 billion\n\nI expect the stock to beat the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. The company outperformed the street estimates in the last quarter, despite a 4% y-o-y drop in the total revenues to $32.17 billion. The top line primarily suffered due to lower advertising revenues. Notably, the average revenue per user was down on a year-on-year basis. That said, the daily active users improved in the quarter. I expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.\n\nMeta's \"Year of Efficiency\" has involved substantial cost-cutting at the company. In March, Meta announced it would lay off [10,000 workers](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meta-to-cut-another-10000-jobs-zuckerberg-says/), building on the company's previous layoff announcement back in November, which affected [11,000 employees](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134139800/facebook-layoffs-instagram-meta). At the close of 2022, Meta had more than 80,000 employees. The impact of Meta\u2019s cost-cutting initiatives such as reducing its headcount will be scrutinized.\n\nA number of analysts are coming into this earnings cycle with substantial optimism about Meta's trajectory (including me). JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth currently has Meta at Overweight and raised his price target on March 24 for the company to $270 from $225, reiterating the company as a \"top pick.\"\n\n\"Importantly, 2023 may be the 'Year of Efficiency,' but we believe Meta is building the critical muscle for financial discipline over the long term,\" he wrote in the March note. \"Meta shares have more than doubled off their early November lows but we still think there\u2019s meaningful upside ahead driven by accelerating revenue growth, continued cost efficiencies, and still attractive valuation.\"\n\nHowever, challenges remain for Meta, as investors will look for improvement in the much-talked-about losses generated by the company's metaverse operation, Reality Labs, which lost a [whopping $13.7 billion in 2022](https://news.yahoo.com/meta-reality-labs-lost-13-230453969.html). Reality Labs is expected to report a loss of [$3.8 billion](https://www.forex.com/en-ca/market-analysis/latest-research/what-will-big-tech-earnings-mean-for-the-nasdaq-100-outlook/) in the first quarter, up from a loss of $2.96 billion for the same period last year. However, this would be an improvement quarter-over-quarter, with Meta posting a $4.28 billion loss from Reality Labs in 4Q 2022.\n\nAdditionally, company watchers are hoping Meta can begin to leave the digital ad slowdown of the last year in its past. Early data indicates that, on the ad market front at least, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. The decrease was due to a slight drop in advertising revenues, which suffered because of tough macroeconomic conditions. The same was evident from the ARPU figure for the year \u2013 down 3% y-o-y. On the flip side, the DAUs increased by 4% y-o-y. I believe the Q1 results will follow the same trend.\n\n\"We think investors are cautiously optimistic on an improving digital ad market, while META has improved its cost structure and have given investors more confidence in management's commitment to profitability,\" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black on April 24. \"Recent ad checks indicated March ad spend was higher than anticipated and engagement data with Facebook and Instagram has been positive relative to peers.\"\n\nSo despite the Reality lab losses, I think META will beat estimates and will shoot up AH. So the play will be similar to MSFT, a call spread. I'll be getting META 4/28 215c and selling the 230c. This will cost $470, but can offer 3.2x gains if this goes our way.", "id": "12zph3r", "created_utc": 1682527051.0, "score": 135, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|31|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12juh8u/can_delta_or_united_airlines_stock_takeoff/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12qxya3/what_to_do_for_netflix_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12kvaap/your_play_for_uhn_earnings_tomorrow/) \n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/CalmGains, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I expect Meta to beat the street's estimates for earnings and revenues.
