More importantly, it's not like they have to go through the main challenge of finding a new architecture. Other neural nets for planner for instance may not even have to change and could use old data still.   \n\n3. So most of the models can be used in transfer learning where some of hte initial layers are modified for the new inputs, and yes will need new data but they aren't starting from scratch.

Mobileye has more for say L2 Highway systems development, but far, far, far less for anything more advanced.  \n\n5. In general, I don't understand your perspective. Every company changes hardware, needs labeling, and leverages open source findings. Have you worked in engineering much? Best production models aren't necessarily bleeding end research findings, that's...common. Waymo, Cruise, Mobileye, all have solid ML teams, so does Tesla.
