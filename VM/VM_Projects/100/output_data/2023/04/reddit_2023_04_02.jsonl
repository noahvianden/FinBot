It\u2019s the most convenient car I\u2019ve owned of about 14 cars from German to Japanese, Korean and American. I barely even think about charging, just plug it in at night just like my phone or laptop. Never stop for gas, never check the oil. It stays cool in summer and warm in winter. If I need service, I just schedule it from the phone app and a dude comes to my house. Large online community which answers every question.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve been trading Tesla since it was public and probably 30% of my gains have come from that company. I wish I had just held my original shares, but each time the market cap got \u201ctoo high, too fast\u201d or my calls would print, I would cash out instead of roll forward. In 2019 I even went short bc it was absurd price after my deep otm calls printed and got lucky with the covid crash and bagged on the way down too. I didn\u2019t get back in until this year when it was beat up a bit and left a lot on the table. \n\nYou can\u2019t evaluate Tesla like traditional car makers, you just can\u2019t. There are many more layers. It\u2019s more similar trajectory to apple in the late 2000s early 2010s.  Look at their numbers. They sell pretty much every car they make and they don\u2019t even advertise yet. They have a very loyal customer base and probably will experiment upgrade cycles like apple did with iPod/iPhone.\n\nYou honestly think dinosaurs like GM and Ford are going to compete? The only thing they make real profit on is big trucks/SUVs and that\u2019s really only down to their own brand loyalty and the tariffs on imports. They have huge debt, supply chain and labor issues, poor management, and no real vision. People hate on Tesla for its EV tax credit benefit as not sustainable, but the big three benefit from a 25% import tariff on pickup trucks that started 60 years ago.\n\nMy boomer dad (if he lives long enough) will get an electric car the same way he reluctantly gave up his flip phone for an iPhone. He will consult me and I\u2019ll tell him to get a Tesla bc that\u2019s what I have and can give him the free tech support for it if he needs it.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget the silent generation and boomers own like 75% of everything and are going to die in the next two decades. What do you think their GenX children and zoomer grand children are going to buy with that money?  Toyota and Lexus? \n\nAnd my point about market cap, is that most retail traders don\u2019t care about market cap. They think (wrongly) share price is a measure of value.
