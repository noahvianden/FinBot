But the problem is based on ALL the evidence I've seen, look at a chart of SPY. That's the evidence you need that they are planning on destroying the value of the dollar, and mass de-dollarization, BRICS nation backing Gold, collapse of the banks (that they will rescue, but with new conditions to adopt CBDC) is perfect way to introduce central planning central banks CBDC. There is NO way they are going to repair the value of the dollar. (please checkout this [video](https://youtu.be/RY1ECavKSJU) from KITCO news).
