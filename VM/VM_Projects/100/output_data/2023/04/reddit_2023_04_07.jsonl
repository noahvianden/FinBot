It\u2019s a cheerful, efficient building that bears the hopes and scars of the population it serves. The carefully curated murals and architectural flourishes give way to extensive water damage inflicted when a resident on an upper floor reportedly slept with the faucets running. Social workers walk purposefully through the halls, greeting residents, and well-loved dogs are being walked everywhere you turn.  \n>  \n>But what makes Tahanan notable isn\u2019t its aesthetic. It\u2019s the way it was built. Tahanan went up in three years, for less than $400,000 per unit. Affordable housing projects in the Bay Area routinely take twice as long and cost almost twice as much.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>But it\u2019s not just 14b. There are local hiring requirements. There\u2019s the requirement to get your power from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission rather than PG&E.

You need an additional review from the Mayor\u2019s Office of Disability. That\u2019s a good one to examine because, well, who could oppose that? But these projects are already in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the additional review takes time and comes at a cost. \u201cThey come in when you\u2019re done,\u201d Foster said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll say, \u2018That threshold is two centimeters off, and it is in all of your doors.\u2019 And so that delays people moving in for another couple of months.

[Here is the comment I made in mid February](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/112uzdy/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_feb_15_2023/j8po699/). \n\nThe summary:\n\n> In January [2023] the tech unemployment rate fell to 1.5% from 1.8% in December, according to CompTIA's analysis. \n\nThat same firm released their update following today's job numbers. It seems it went from 1.5% to 2.2% in February, and then stayed constant at 2.2% in March. I can't access their full report. But even despite that, job posting increased to 316K.\n\n> Tech industry employment, covering all workers employed by technology companies, experienced a **modest decline of an estimated 839 jobs last month**. Telecommunications accounted for the largest share of the decline at -3,100 positions, which was offset by gains in cloud infrastructure, tech services and software.            \n> \n> **Employer job postings for tech positions increased by 76,546 month-over-month, to a total for March of nearly 316,000. This represents the highest level of employer hiring activity as measured by job postings in seven months.**\n> \n> **Technology employment across all industry sectors increased by an estimated 197,000 positions** for the month, according to CompTIA\u2019s analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics #JobsReport data. The **unemployment rate** for tech occupations held **steady at 2.2%**.\n\nSo yeah, there is no reason to doom over the tech sector's labor market. Unemployment is 40% smaller than the overall unemployment rate; this is among some of the highest paid occupations; layoffs concentrated among large tech companies that overhired but offer incredibly strong severance packages.\n\n---\n\nIn other good news, we are near/at [*record high* levels of Black prime age employment rates](https://i.imgur.com/ej2Pxmj.png): \"Now at 78.1%, 0.6% above the pre-pandemic peak, and now just 0.6% from the all-time high in 1999.\" For the first time years and maybe even ever, [Black employment rates are higher than White employment rates](https://i.imgur.com/0YxTRwY.png), although age differences in the population between demographics plays a major role in this.

The reduction in work hours was more pronounced among men ages 25-55 with a bachelor\u2019s degree. And high-earning men reduced their hours the most: for example, **the top 10% of male workers by earnings (making more than $140,000 per year) reduced their work hours by an hour-and-a-half a week, from 44.7 hours in 2019 to 43.2 hours per week in 2022. By contrast, the bottom 10% of male workers by earnings (making less than $22,000 per year) worked more hours, 23.4 hours per week in 2022, compared with 22.6 in 2019.** Those who worked long hours reduced their hours the most. The top 10% of male workers by work hours logged at least 50 hours per week in 2022. This is a lot of hours, but in 2019 the cutoff to be in the top 10% of male workers by hours worked was 55 hours a week.\n\nIt's the richer workers who are working less, and who I am less concerned about. We want to see low income workers at higher levels of employment, participating more in the economy, and working full time.\n \nMoreover, your link:\n\n>  In fact, other survey data showed that workers\u2019 desired hours of work declined, providing direct evidence that the hours reduction was voluntary. \n> \n> What did workers do with the time freed up from work? The latest available figures from the American Time Use Survey provide a clue. It turns out **married men are the ones that reduced their work hours the most, and they spent more time socializing and relaxing**. \n\nIs this a bad thing also? Those who did reduce their hours did so voluntarily and to enjoy life.\n\nYour links takeaways:\n\n> I see two longer-term gains for workers. First, a **better work-life balance** will help workers improve their mental and physical health, which may allow them to be happier and possibly more productive, even, and to work into older ages if they so choose. Second, as men working long hours reduce their hours, women, who typically work fewer hours and do more non-market work due to societal norms, may choose career paths that used to demand long hours, **improving gender inequality** especially at the top end of the earnings distribution. \n\nSounds good to me!\n\n**TL;DR:** The second links says higher income/wealth Americans are choosing to work less hours and take leisure (Fine, they can afford it). This does not contradict my claims about lower class / working class Americans, who are working *more* hours, earning more at those jobs, and participating in the economy at historically high rates.

Check out the US median age over time:\n\nhttps://www.bourbonfm.com/blog/us-median-age-population-1950\n\n\nWe're now over 38 if you search for current data, indicating that the aging trend has continued. \n\nTo clarify this is a global trend, not only US.  Not least of which in China, which I won't link but is getting old, too. And this trend is projected to continue:\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/672669/projected-global-median-age/ (expand data points to see historic data)\n\nAs for my source from 2020 about a \"long-term downward trend\", I think that due to demographic factors it's not unreasonable to assume that this has continued. Actually, take a look at unemployment data, it seems to have been trending down for awhile now and also seems to have continued that trend post-Covid:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\n\nFinally, I think you have to consider other factors like de-globalization and \"made in the USA\" or \"made at home\" trends, arising from Covid and geopolitical tensions making us realize that cheaper products from abroad aren't always better.  This is great for domestic workers.  I would also consider climate change and the prospect of war, which both mean that we can't afford to have workers sit idle and need to get them to work building solar panels (or whatever) and tanks (or whatever).\n\nAll of this is wonderful for labor, and I think it's only fair to admit that it's playing a part in the robust labor market right now.  That said, it comes with some drawbacks.  An older population means we have less workers and more dependents, and that means those that do work have to work harder to pay for pensions and healthcare for these people.  Secondly, along with the other factors I mentioned like de-globalization, a tight labor market thanks to demographics pushes wages and prices up, making 2% inflation somewhat unrealistic (this is not the end of the world but is something we will have to deal with, and are dealing with now).  Finally, the incentive to take on more and more debt to pay for these things, plus the reality that interest rates will probably be higher for longer, will compound the debt issue that I have mentioned many times before.\n\n**Tl;dr** - In sum, I never meant to say that the labor market is bad right now.  It actually looks very strong, as your data have shown. I'm not an economist or academic and I haven't done extensive research on it, but from what I've heard it's not unreasonable to attribute a great deal of this to demographic and other structural factors like de-globalization.  It's still a great time to be a worker, and there's clear benefits to the notion that if you want a job, you can get a job.  But like everything, this situation comes with tradeoffs which we will have to manage.\n\nPeople are dumb and will distort data to fit any narrative they want.  Sorry you had to deal with that, I know you go out of your way to be really thorough so that can be frustrating. I really do my best to be evidence-based, obviously we all have personal biases but I think what I've shared, at least, is not contrary to the data you've presented.\n\nAs a final note, I've shared this a lot but I think people \"feel\" that things are worse and unfair for some reason.  My 92 year old grandma is always talking about how crappy America has gotten and how she understands why I live in Spain now.  Admittedly some of these things are not directly supported by data, and it's frustrating when people resort to conspiracy-level claims when the evidence contradicts them.  But I think you can't immediately dismiss people's feelings when it comes to these things.  It's not that their claims are correct, they may be very false, which we ought to point out.  But at the same time I read recently in China that the vast majority are proud to be Chinese, happy with the government, and happy with the country's economic progress.   Admittedly, in an authoritarian country that means less than it would otherwise, but the author of the book I'm reading says it wouldn't be fair to say that it's all thanks to Chinese people being afraid to speak out.  Which makes sense, because the level of development that China has seen in the last 50 years is startling.  They have their own challenges, clearly, but the average Chinese person has reason to believe that things have been getting better, whereas for the average American, for whatever reason, that may not clearly be the case. \n\nAnyway hope this makes sense, feel free to push back or share your opinion and take care.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "de"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["recovery", "inflation", "recession", "gdp", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6086517572402954}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5832390189170837}], "tickers": ["inflation", "recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "What do you guys think of JEPI?
