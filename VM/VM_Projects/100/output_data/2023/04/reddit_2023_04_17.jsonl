So what delta would the short leg be? If the long is 18 delta, that means the short put is higher delta by some amount. \n\nAlso, it would be useful to know the width of the spread you are contemplating.

The more time to expiration, the more time value. So if the price crosses the strike well before expiration, an exercise at that point **loses all the time value**. Since people generally don't like to throw money away for no reason, early exercise is rare.\n\nThe risk increases when the time value approaches zero.

Yes, absolutely. I close all of my short trades well before expiration. If you can take a 50% profit by closing now, why wait weeks or months to take that profit? Profit now is often better than maybe more profit later, since later may turn that profit into a loss.\n\nAre you actually approved to trade naked short calls?

The time to take it out should be a 2-year window far in the future; the window is to let you wait out a potential recession. The market always bounces back higher.\n\nNow this next part depends on how old you are and what age you want to cash out but most people aim for 30+ years on this type of fund. That's because compound interest starts giving you increasingly huge returns every single year. \n\n[Take a minute to play with this compound interest calculator ](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)\n\nIf you want to be conservative use 8% instead of 8.5% for the interest rate. This number removes inflation and covers a lot of fees. Fill the rest out how you want and the numbers it returns will be the equivalent of you being given that money today. The difference between 21 and 30 years essentially doubles your return. Try other combinations of the fields like adding a percent to the interest rate or aiming for a high monthly contribution if you don't have many initial funds.\n\n\nI can't tell you much about Fidelity specific fees. They may offer a tax calculator or you can use a generic one.\n\nInstead of S&P look into VTI or VOO. If you decide you want to branch out some of your money but not rely on the luck of one company there are lots of ETFs for specific sectors like BOTZ and ROBO for Automation and Artificial Intelligence. (I pulled those last two off the top of my head and haven't researched them in years, they're just an example relevant to the climate and not explicitly a recommendation)\n\n\nThat's the gist of surefire investing. 30+ years and an annual interest rate that maxes around 10% is safe but you'll naturally feel FOMO when you hear about a single company that could have given you that return in 6 months.

This could imply that the Fed will maintain its accommodative monetary policy for longer, which could support the stock market.\u201d\n* \u201cTesla\u2019s delivery numbers exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations and showed strong demand for its electric vehicles. This could boost its revenue and profitability in the quarter and improve its competitive position in the industry. Tesla\u2019s stock price could rise on this positive news.\u201d\n* \u201cGameStop\u2019s stock sale plan indicates that it is trying to take advantage of its elevated share price and raise capital to fund its turnaround strategy. However, this could also dilute existing shareholders and put downward pressure on the stock price. GameStop\u2019s stock price could drop on this announcement.\u201d\n\nI think this is a fascinating application of AI and NLP to the financial domain, and I wonder how accurate and reliable ChatGPT can be in its predictions.

It's not meant to replace human intelligence but rather to assist and enhance our abilities in various tasks.\n\nI agree that GPT-4 might not be a game-changer like the internet, but it can still be a valuable tool for various applications, including writing and proofreading, as you mentioned.\n\nAs for the coding aspect, I understand your concerns about poorly named variables and logic. However, my point was to illustrate GPT-4's ability to understand and provide meaningful explanations, even in such scenarios. It's true that relying on AI-generated code without fully understanding it can lead to maintenance and documentation issues. But AI can still be helpful for tasks like code review or providing suggestions to improve the code, which can ultimately save time and effort.\n\nIn the end, it's all about finding the right balance and using AI as a supplementary tool, rather than relying on it entirely.\"", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5212977528572083}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5218225121498108}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5374743938446045}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4495442807674408}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.76111900806427}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38802891969680786}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3143598139286041}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4494635760784149}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22202081978321075}, {"body": "this is just due to a lack of training. gpt-4 handles this much better\n\nyou could make the same argument about not-so-intelligent humans too", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11054098606109619}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24826090037822723}, {"body": "Ask it to play a game of chess and see how that goes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Since very many years obviously the machines, even several years ago with Go.
