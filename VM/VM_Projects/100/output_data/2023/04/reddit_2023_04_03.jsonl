However, it was the dealerships driving prices up and not the OEMs. With the exception of Tesla who sells direct. And Tesla raised their prices like crazy to match what the dealerships were doing. Their profit margins sky rocketed. So the dealerships and Tesla benefited from the auto bubble but not legacy OEMs. Now the auto bubble is deflating and the market supply demand is normalizing. On top of that auto loan delinquencies are rising on all the horrible loans people took out the last 2 years.
