Are you asking if there is some law legally determining what the Fed can and can't do in terms of rate hikes, or are you asking if there's some economic theory to explain the need for further rate hikes?\n\nAssuming it's the latter then you should think about rates in terms of economic incentives. Specifically, given that economic actors are always trying to maximise their real returns within a given risk tolerance, you should consider how rates impacts this dynamic.\n\nThe primary reason the Fed had to increase rates over the last year is because when inflation rises real yields on savings drop and real borrowing costs decrease. When this happens consumers are incentivised to borrow and spend savings while investors are forced to invest in riskier in pursuit of yield. This is why inflation can spiral out of control because if not quickly addressed with higher rates since economic incentives start to shift towards incentivising more spending, more borrowing, and more investment which typically results in even higher inflation. \n\nThis is the reason many cite the \"Taylor rule\" and the need for Fed funds to exceed the inflation rate to bring down inflation. Because unless Fed funds is above the rate of inflation savers will receive negative real yields on their savings and therefore be incentivised to borrow and spend.\n\nUnlike last year, this year inflation is almost certainly going to drop rapidly over the coming months. The rate of inflation falling will by itself increase real yields, so compounding this with further Fed hikes could be dangerous if you believe inflation is likely to fall significantly this year. Or put another way, if last this year parking money in a \"zero-risk\" money market fund could yield a real return of 2% a year, why on Earth would you take on additional risk by investing in a company which might yield a real return of 3-4%? And if you're a consumer, why would you would to borrow or spend when you can earn such an attractive return on your cash by just keeping it in a money market fund?\n\nIf there's one thing I think we can say with some certainty, it's that the Fed is not going to continue raising rates if inflation continues to cools and starts to fall significantly below Fed funds.
