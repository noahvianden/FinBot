{"title": "Debunking Kerrisdale Capital's Bearish Take on C3.ai", "selftext": "**Update:**\n\nC3 responded to Kerrisdale's allegations and published a [statement](https://ir.c3.ai/static-files/a4394b09-6a6d-40be-b0f2-4cfbbc89c176) on their website.\n\nAnd here is an [interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-04-05/fedex-aims-to-cut-4-billion-podcast) with the CEO (starts at around minute 10).\n\nAccording to their statement, they follow the US GAAP standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition, which states that revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied, regardless of billing.\n\n\\-\n\n**Original Post:**\n\nHi all, I'm new here but basically spent all night looking into the [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) and [Kerrisdale.](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/)\n\nI'm long on C3 - so I'm as biased as Kerrisdale here, but apparently, that doesn't keep people from taking their word for granted, either. I have a degree in Finance, worked at a big-four accounting firm, in the financial industry (upper management), and am now a business owner (that was too lazy to create a new account for posting this - that's why you'll find me posting all kinds of UE5 stuff, otherwise. My dirty hobby...)\n\nBut I'm a hopelessly logical investor, meaning I couldn't figure out why Kerrisdale's letter to Deloitte yesterday moved the markets at all. So I needed to understand the whole situation better and digged deeper.\n\nI went through C3's financials and Kerrisdale's report and looked at their letter to the Auditor, and here are my two cents on their March 6th report and their letter to Deloitte. Apologies for the lengthy post, but it's a complex topic.\n\nIt is worth questioning whether Kerrisdale's attempt to undermine C3 serves to manipulate market perceptions, particularly when considering the firm's history of short-selling and ongoing [legal scrutiny.](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/regulation/doj-sec-probe-dozens-of-firms-in-short-selling-sting)\n\nLet's start by shortly going over Kerrisdale's report from March 6th.\n\nKerrisdale's report conveniently overlooks C3's unique value proposition and casts doubt on the company's competitive advantage. However, this dismissal seems disingenuous, given the distinct position C3 occupies in the AI software market.\n\nContrary to the report's implications, C3's industry-specific AI solutions set it apart from the likes of IBM, Google, and Amazon. The company's focus on sectors such as energy, manufacturing, and financial services demonstrates its commitment to providing tailored solutions that address the unique challenges faced by these industries.\n\nThe report also paints a bleak picture of C3's growth rates, suggesting that they are unsustainable. However, the data and industry trends tell a different story.\n\nAI adoption is in its early stages across a variety of industries, with tremendous potential for growth. The ongoing digitization of industries and the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions are good for C3's prospects.\n\nC3's ability to secure long-term contracts with major clients demonstrates the trust and satisfaction customers have in its products and services. This contradicts Kerrisdale's pessimistic outlook and raises suspicions about the firm's motives. They basically take one of C3's strengths (their ability to build long-term partnerships and client relations) and give it a negative spin.\n\nKerrisdale's report attempts to pigeonhole C3 as a company reliant on the energy sector, potentially to create uncertainty and fear in the market. But this claim conveniently omits the company's broader diversification strategy.\n\nC3 has made significant strides in expanding into healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services, proving its ability to penetrate new markets and adapt to different industry needs. This diversification not only mitigates the risks associated with dependence on a single sector but also showcases C3's resilience and growth potential.\n\nThe report also casts doubt on C3's future competitiveness by highlighting declining R&D spending. This interpretation, however, seems deliberately misleading when considering the broader context of the company's strategy and expertise.\n\nStreamlining R&D spending could be a strategic move by C3 to optimize resources and concentrate on the most promising projects. It is important to recognize that R&D spending is not always directly proportional to innovation or product development success.\n\nMoreover, C3's existing technological expertise and intellectual property provide a strong foundation for future growth. The report's attempt to misrepresent the company's R&D spending is... questionable.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that C3's unique competitive advantage, growth potential, diversification strategy, and technological expertise paint a more optimistic outlook for the company's future prospects than Kerrisdale's report suggests. As AI continues to transform industries, C3's targeted offerings are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, in my opinion. Of note to me is their [ESG product](https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-esg/) \\- ESG will be a really, really big thing in the near future, especially here in the EU, in the near future.\n\nMy opinion: investors and market participants should be mindful of the potential for market manipulation and misinformation, especially when considering reports from firms with questionable motives and legal standing.\n\nLet's finally move on to what caused yesterday's market movements. Kerrisdale's letter to the auditor, Deloitte. Keep in mind that this is just my take on it. But I think that my opinion is not entirely unqualified.\n\n**TL;DR: Deloitte is the biggest accounting firm in the US, and it basically comes down to this: you either trust a short-seller publishing an open letter going hand-in-hand with a well-timed media campaign at a conspicuously opportune moment (C3 was about to really take off and obliterate their short position), or you trust that C3's financials, on which Deloitte signed off on, are correct. Your call.**\n\nSlightly longer version:\n\nKerrisdale Capital sent a letter to C3's auditor, raising concerns about the company's accounting and disclosure practices. The letter questions the company's revenue recognition methods, particularly for long-term contracts, and the impact on financial results.\n\nC3 has consistently provided transparent financial results, as evidenced by their fiscal Q1, Q2, and Q3 2023 reports. The company has experienced steady revenue growth and diversified its client base, showcasing a strong business model.\n\nC3's financial reports adhere to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), ensuring that revenue recognition and other financial practices are in line with industry standards.\n\n**As per US GAAP guidelines, companies recognize revenue when the performance obligations under a contract are satisfied.** C3's long-term contracts are structured to deliver AI software solutions and services over time, and the company recognizes revenue accordingly.\n\nIt is essential to emphasize that C3's revenue recognition practices are compliant with the accounting standards and have been consistently applied across all financial reporting periods.\n\nIn their own March 6th report (page 13), Kerrisdale calls out C3 for their long product cycle (6-18 months). **Considering C3 is a rapidly growing company that closed bookings of about $650 million in Q3 FY 23, it's hardly surprising that \"the company\u2019s accounts receivable have ballooned\", according to their letter to the auditor.**\n\nWith C3.ai's strong bookings performance in Q3, it is reasonable to expect a corresponding increase in unbilled receivables. This growth in receivables is a natural consequence of the company's expanding business and long-term contracts, reflecting the ongoing demand for its AI solutions.\n\nOn page 13 of their report, Kerrisdale acknowledges that C3 has a long product cycle, ranging from 6 to 18 months. This admission, coupled with the growth in unbilled receivables, suggests that Kerrisdale's claims are inconsistent and contradictory.\n\n**The long product cycle means that C3's revenue recognition is spread across multiple reporting periods, which naturally leads to a growth in unbilled receivables.** This growth aligns with US GAAP guidelines.\n\nThe contradictory nature of Kerrisdale's claims raises questions about their understanding of US GAAP or their willingness to misrepresent financial information intentionally. It is essential to consider the possibility of malicious intent, particularly in light of the firm's ongoing legal scrutiny and history of short-selling.\n\nThe US Department of Justice and the SEC are currently investigating dozens of firms, including Kerrisdale Capital, for potential market manipulation through short-selling schemes. I found relatively little information on this, but little or unsubstantiated information apparently suffices. I quoted one of several articles earlier in this post.\n\nGiven this backdrop, Kerrisdale's claims regarding C3's accounting and disclosure practices might be an attempt to manipulate market sentiment and cast doubt on the company's financial integrity.\n\nIn light of the transparent financial results provided by C3 and the company's adherence to US GAAP guidelines, Kerrisdale's claims regarding accounting and disclosure issues appear to be unfounded.\n\n**In conclusion, C3.ai's growth in unbilled receivables is a plausible outcome of its strong Q3 bookings performance and long product cycle.** Kerrisdale's contradictory claims and potential misunderstanding or manipulation of US GAAP guidelines warrant skepticism and caution, IMO.\n\nI expect Deloitte to back up C3 in their FY 23 audit opinion, voiding Kerrisdale's claims. I think the whole thing is a well-executed publicity stunt by a short-seller that was facing serious trouble from the stock being about to take off. I would have done it the same way. Even including the SEC, which is/was investigating Kerrisdale, in their letter is a bold move, but implying regulatory action/fraud, is exactly what Kerrisdale needed to \"cover their ass\" here and get the much-needed market reaction. Hats off to them, textbook execution.\n\nSo that's it. Thanks for reading, if you even made it this far.

Having an AI suite that calls ChatGPT, or even that runs a pre-built LLM, is like writing a browser plugin vs. building a browser.  It's a relatively paltry effort.  Hundreds of ChatGPT products are popping up from every sort of company, just the other day the Azure guys were giving a presentation about building services with the ChatGPT API at my work.  \n\n  \nThe latest isn't always the greatest for everything anyway.  Transformer models are the latest fad, but they're not the latest advancements per se.  Even in the current incarnation they've been around since 2017 and the main idea goes back at least to 1992.  One of the things I hate about the machine learning field is that no one seems to read any material (perhaps because CS is so conference based... they jump from one fad to another and often mistakenly think old ideas are new).  But fair enough, they're using the new fad so I guess it does make sense for them to be part of that bubble.  \n\nHave you actually looked at this product?  Looks like an easy and convenient way to make mistakes.  \n\nDo you talk to Google for >90% of your searches?  If not, then why would you buy into the value add of that sort of \"natural\" interaction with technical data?  \n\nThey don't exactly make it clear where they are and are not using the generative capabilities, but anywhere that they are is inherently unreliable, so with them not being clear in their pitch about that... it isn't clear whether or not you can rely on anything there then.  At least regular ChatGPT is hooked up with Wolfram Alpha now and states when it does or does not use it.  Ok, looking at the data sheet makes things a bit more clear.  It generates a text response in the far right panel (so consider that unreliable) and generates a query for the big top panel to support the top result (which you also need to double check, that the generated query was actually appropriate).

Can we stop pretending that they do anything interesting with their AI yet?    \n\n\n\"Their main existing clients are energy, defense, financial.\"  Are they developing more efficient solar cells with their AI?  Are they using AI for advanced target acquisition and tracking?  Are they using AI to make big bucks in algorithmic trading?  No, that's not what they do.  They make stuff for any old generic company to (hopefully) better view and understand their own data.  When I look at their \"Industries\" tab on their site it just looks like they listed every big industry.  I don't think having clients from an industry should be construed as being in that industry.  E.g. energy companies aren't in the cloud computing industry.    \n\n\nTake a look at their products: [https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-applications/](https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-applications/)  It's all just about how they can flavor the same product to be a bit more tuned for each industry.  It's not like they work on any fundamental problems of that industry or help those companies achieve that.  They're not helping Intel or AMD with chip placement problems.  They've got a case study thing on \"Improving Drug Manufacturing Reliability and Performance.\"  Do you think they made changes to the chemistry for better yield with a more reliable method?  Of course not.  They essentially worked on predicting failures, something some of my colleagues have done for a very large and well known partner.  Perhaps we should slap AI in our name (oh wait... we did do that)... but we're not a publicly traded company so we don't have any stock to inflate by doing so.  \n\nI don't think AI will have growth in energy, defense, financial, etc... for their fundamentals.  Those aren't things C3 does.  Isn't their actual industry SaaS or PaaS?  And their competitors more like Oracle (where Siebel is from) or Salesforce or the like?    \n\n\nThe TLDR is... they seem fine at what they actually do.  I don't think the stock popping off on an AI bubble is particularly warranted, but most of the others doing so don't have any more merit to them either...  I might say it's AI bubble risk rather than any sort of risk particular to C3.  For C3 specific risk I would need to actually care about their financials and read the Kerisdale report...    \n\n\nSee also: [https://www.zdnet.com/article/dissecting-c3-ais-secret-sauce-less-about-ai-more-about-fixing-hadoop/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dissecting-c3-ais-secret-sauce-less-about-ai-more-about-fixing-hadoop/)  Ah, gradient boosted trees, they're probably using a bunch of Xgboost now.  They should be cautious with those... make sure to keep updating the models, especially since tree based models like those tend to extrapolate poorly if they hit anything outside their domain.  For some applications where the data is more stationary, they'll be fine, but for other applications the drifting means may eventually become big problems.  I'm a bit surprised that they used a depth of just 5 with over 700 features... makes me think the vast majority of them are unnecessary and there is very little interaction.  With models under 100 features I have sometimes found a depth of 14 to have the best performance on the test data.  I'm not saying all data would be complex enough for 14, few cases would be, but 5... off the top of my head I think 5 is the default value so I wonder how much they explored.

These changes can impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, and you need to take them into account when analyzing a company's financial performance.\n\nConcerns about revenue quality related to a growing receivables balance are valid, especially if it's due to changes in the pricing model.

It suggests to me that customers aren't using the products enough and that this AI company is doing something equivalent to digital channel stuffing. \n\nA subscription model is less risky from a revenue quality standpoint because regardless how much the client eats, you still get your money. However, there is always the risk of overeating by some customers in a subscription model; negatively impacting margins. Additionally the risks of an increasing receivables balance right now is that financing costs are increasing because small banks like SVIB went under and bigger banks provide less favorable financing terms. Which at the very least can potentially impact margins negatively as financing costs rise and, at worst, cause a company to go bankrupt if they cannot deficit finance their operations on their journey to profitably.\n\nMy suggestion would be to do more research and reading and really be able to scrutinize this company and the questions posed by the short seller more deeply.
