The less extrinsic value, the more likely you will be assigned. Since extrinsic value goes to zero at expiration, this explains why assignments generally happen on or near expiration.\n\nThis is because the call holder that exercises early **will lose money**, equal to the extrinsic value.

Shipment volume in Q1 2023 was noticeably lower than the 59.2 million units shipped in Q1 2019 and 60.6 million in Q1 2018,\" IDC said.\n\n\"The pause in growth and demand is also giving the supply chain some room to make changes as many factories begin to explore production options outside China.\"\n\nConcerns over slowdowns in major economies remain, with recent tumult in the banking sector exacerbating worries that runaway inflation and tight monetary policy would hamper growth and financial investments.\n\nIf the economy is trending upwards by 2024, \"we expect significant market upside as consumers look to refresh, schools seek to replace worn-down Chromebooks, and businesses move to Windows 11,\" said Linn Huang, research vice president, Devices and Displays at IDC.\n\n\"If recession in key markets drags on into next year, recovery could be a slog.\"\n\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/global-pc-shipments-slide-q1-apple-takes-biggest-hit-idc-3407746", "id": "12hb20s", "created_utc": 1681112448.0, "score": 618, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "Money going to increased rent, food and gas.
