Everyone uses TikTok but the revenue is a lot less than one would think. It really makes you wonder... I have several theories, one being that the audience on TikTok tends to be a lot younger, and the older generations that are on facebook, etc. tend to be more valuable for ads as they may have more expendible income. Another theory I had is that the role of Tiktok is primarily to consume, and does not really encourage you to engage and interact. I think as a user on Tiktok, all the quick dopamine makes it so easy to just end up in a zombie-like scrolling state, which really reduces the chance for you to engage with their product and ads. On the other hand, you'll see posts from your friends and family on fb/insta, which I think may encourage more engagement. In fact, Meta said in an earnings report that they do not optimize for time spent on the platform. They probably have already concluded that time spent on platform does not necessarily equal more money. Not entirely sure what metric they do primarily optimize for though... This is just a theory though. It could also be that Meta has a much more fleshed out advertisement targeting system, and Tiktok is just very far behind. Who knows?\n\nedit: Ah, and I literally just realized this now. There are quite some advantages to Meta/Insta having multimodal content. For example, I think having a shopping ad (like an image with tags on it to buy things) on Tiktok will be really akward since everything is video form.

{"title": "JPMorgan Warns Stocks Are in 'Calm Before the Storm'", "selftext": " Bloomberg Article:\n\nA  risk-on mood fueling this year\u2019s equities rally is likely to falter,  with headwinds from bank turbulence, an oil shock and slowing growth  poised to send stocks back toward their 2022 lows, according to JPMorgan  strategist Marko Kolanovic.\n\n\u201cThe  Fed indicated no intention to cut interest rates this year, yet risk  assets are exhibiting an unprecedented rally, with European stocks  trading near all-time highs and US stocks recovering recent losses,\u201d  Kolanovic wrote in a note to clients Monday. \u201cWe expect a reversal in  risk sentiment and the market retesting last year\u2019s low over the coming  months.\u201d\n\nIn  his view, the inflows into stocks over the past few weeks \u201cmake little  sense\u201d and were largely driven by systematic investors, a short squeeze  and a decline in the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX. \u00a0\n\nA  drop in the VIX below 20, a level associated with less stressful  periods, suggests investors believe the banking crisis is contained in  the near term. However, Kolanovic characterizes the present market  backdrop as \u201cthe calm before the storm.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOne  of Wall Streets biggest optimists through most of the market selloff  last year, Kolanovic has since reversed his view, cutting his equity  allocation in mid-December, January and March due to a soft economic  outlook this year.\n\n Stocks have remained resilient this year despite rising interest rates  that have dented corporate profits, slowed growth and triggered a series  of bank collapses in the US and overseas. The benchmark S&P 500  rose 7% in the first quarter after dropping nearly 20% in 2022, while  gains across technology stocks have pushed the Nasdaq 100 up 20% since  the start of January and into a bull market. \n\nTech\u2019s  outperformance has become even more magnified recently as traders ramp  up bets that banking-system stresses will prompt the Federal Reserve to  hit the brakes on its tightening campaign.\n\nUS  stock futures were steady on Tuesday, with contracts on the S&P 500  dipping less than 0.1% while those on the Nasdaq 100 edged 0.2% lower  by 3:51 a.m. in New York.\n\n\u201cIt  is worth noting the accordion-like nature of risk sentiment, where  restrictive rates produced an issue for various carry trades and the  ensuing pullback in yields mitigated some of the stress,\u201d Kolanovic  wrote. \u201cAlthough central banks are still communicating, there is ground  to cover on fighting inflation and pushing back against the market\u2019s  assumption of cuts, so the original source of stress, rates higher for  longer, can reenter the picture.\u201d\n\nCitigroup  Inc. strategists including Chris Montagu said net positioning turned  clearly bullish for the S&P 500 over the past week.
