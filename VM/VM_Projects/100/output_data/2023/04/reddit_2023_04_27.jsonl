Now look at what happened over night\u2026 we went from a 26% chance of 450-475 rate/ 40.2% chance of 425-450 rate to currently now a 48% chance of 450-475 and 30.2% chance of 425-450\u2026\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that we actually just saw over night the market go from pricing in 75bps of rate CUTS by the end of the year to now only pricing in 50 bps of rate CUTS by the end of year\u2026 \n\nNow last time I checked the market has always seen rate cuts as bullish and rate hikes as bearish\u2026 actually what is even more impressive is that over the last month we went from an expected 35.9% chance of 400-425 fed funds rate EOY (aka 100bps of rate CUTS) to where we currently are as mentioned ago\u2026 that means FINALLY the market is actually starting to believe jpow\u2026 \n\nNow this is where im pure speculating and spit balling my theory here\u2026 what if markets really didn\u2019t believe JPOW last fomc? What if we ran up in hopes that JPOW was wrong and that we would actually cut 100bps\u2026 well in less than a week JPOW is going to stand up there and tell the markets \u201cim hiking 25bps and once again as I said last meeting our base case is NO rate CUTS this year.\u201d Now this time markets are going to start to believe him\u2026 \n\nThen what happens next? Well we get CPI and boy do I think we get some CPI fireworks\u2026 look at the price of OIL alone and the fact that current forecasts are for an unchanged YOY CPI/ CORE. Why does that matter? Well after 9 consecutive months of downward trending CPI we finally are about to stall/ rebound. What is that going to do? Well that is going to cause even more panic\u2026 why? Simple\u2026 JPOW absolutely can not (outside of an actual black swan market crash) stop rate hikes if inflation rebounds or even just slows its downward trend. \n\nWhen inflation is unchanged or more likely rebounds on May 10th markets gonna panic\u2026 but I think they already know this\u2026 they are going to have to with no choice price in even less rate cuts by EOY if not more rate HIKES by EOY\u2026 \n\nSo the question would be why did SPY just put in the biggest green day in over 3 months on seemingly extremely bearish new that is staring us down right now? Its simple\u2026 market needs exit liquidity\u2026 Today is going to be the highest volume bull day since March 31st. In my opinion and theory markets know May is going to be a very bearish month and that we are going to see a true drop (think 380-390)\u2026 right now we are seeing this push back up into the consolidation range for a few reasons\u2026 1. Burn as many people already short (remember market is apparently the most net short since 2008) before the drop happens. 2. Big money needs to exit their longs and shares that they bought from 410-418 and 3. Big money is trying to get the best price they can on shorts. \n\nIn no way should the VIX have dropped nearly 10% on the data and news we got this morning and not with what the market priced in with the fed funds rate\u2026 This is a fake rally in my opinion. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/144zb3ojwhwa1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae5e5f4b65436f705c365266e6a0e56eb4bab790\n\nFrom a supply and demand stand point we had a pretty killer and wild day\u2026 We had a lot of changes\u2026 \n\nWe officially established a new demand (support) at 404.3 and in doing do pushed up to take our 406.74 and 409.18 demand. \n\nIn addition we pushed up all the way to 412.62 supply and had a pretty solid rejection off of it. \n\nI see two scenarios playing out here\u2026 first scenario is that tomorrow we will push up to touch 414.22 demand (to take it out) but close back under 412.62 which should reconfirm that level as supply (resistance) that would then pave way for a push back to 404.3 demand and possibly down to 399.07 supply next week. Or the second scenario would be that we just immediately turn around and sell off back under the daily 8/20ema tomorrow which most likely would result in 412.62 being reconfirmed as supply (resistance) \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8t7a7r2kwhwa1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f3a42f80a8e89fb86270705c75b0482cd1c005\n\nNow on SPY here price action wise this was quite the reversal and really did put a stop to the bears right in their tracks\u2026 The biggest and most bullish thing I see here is that we came up and retook the daily 8 and 20ema\u2026 While it is possible we could immediately double top tomorrow and drop back under the daily 8ema by EOD\u2026 more likely than not this shows a pattern of continuation to the upside for tomorrow. \n\nLooking at this realistically we have now established a new range of 404.3 to 415.6. Upside should continue to be limited right around the 414 to 416 area. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvukdyikwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=21145d09c4bc76d82141054a69800b33039408d5\n\nWe do get some more data in the morning which will be interesting to watch play out and how markets receive this data\u2026. I honestly don\u2019t have a high sense of direction for tomorrow but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see an attempt to touch and take out that 414.22 demand we left above\u2026 doing so really would open up a lot more down side possibilities. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 412.6 -> 415.4  \n Demand- 414.2  \n Support- 410.6 -> 409.2 -> 406.9  \n Resistance- 412.6 -> 414.1 -> 415.2\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v67q9ykwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b482691fa1a3bd42f9854fe817042d78b072fb04\n\nFutures daily also had some re-arranging today. We put in a new demand (support) at 4085 and have push up to take out 4117 demand. We now are currently sitting just over 4158 supply with the next supply at 4178 and 4198. \n\nMuch of the same here on Futures as SPY I do see a case to immediately turn around to reconfirm 4158 as supply (resistance) with a double top drop\u2026. But I also see a case for push back up to 4178/4198 supplies first before we eventually push back down to 4085 demand and eventually 4040/4055 supply. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s932s7elwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=100d27ecbe027e0ba5d4d27823ae07db83f1cf69\n\nMuch of the same here we came down here and double bottomed nicely off 4085. In doing so we retook the daily 8/ 20ema and retook critical level of 4095. \n\nWith the current down trend broken we should expect this 4085 to 4178 range to be our new range until fomc or something else breaks that trend. As of right now the closer we get to 4178 the more bearish we should find ourselves. \n\nI do believe we will continue this run up tomorrow but I believe we are just being presented and even better short opportunity for summer time.\n\nFutures Daily Level  \n Supply- 4158 -> 4178  \n Demand- 4085  \n Support- 4138 -> 4110 -> 4095  \n Resistance- 4158 -> 4178\n\n**VIX1D**\n\nThe VIX1D actually gets its own section today because it was so intriguing to me as while we only have now 4 total days of data\u2026 todays the first day that didn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\nThe VIX1D, or the 1-Day Volatility Index, measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 Index for the current trading day.Taking an aggregated measurement of weighted prices across one- and zero-day P.M. settled SPX option expirations, the VIX1D calculates its value of expected volatility, according to the Cboe\u2019s press release. Simply put, the VIX1D reflects the midpoint values of weekly SPX put and call prices for today and the next day in real-time. \n\nSo that\u2019s the definition of apparently what the VIX1D measures.. now lets look at the VIX1D today\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kda0aewlwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2560f15ec08942660639077b7672535a6ade3383\n\nThis is VIX1D on a 5min chart with HA candles on the left and standard candles on the right\u2026 what does this price action show all day? Well it showed that the VIX1D had a MASSIVE drop over night (at open\u2026 remember vix1d closes at 415pm and opens at 930am which I still think it should be the same hours as the regular VIX). After the massive gap down what did it to? It rose all day long and aggressively rose all day long.\n\nNow why is that odd? Well lets think about this the same way we think about the regular VIX\u2026 if we watched the VIX gap down about 30% at open only to close up 11.29% by the EOD what would you expect the price of SPY to do? You would 100% expect it to have a massive drop. And if it didn\u2019t what would you expect? Well you would expect that there is a massive imbalance somewhere and that something isn\u2019t correlating correctly\u2026\n\nSo I see two ways this fixes itself\u2026 we either 1. Have a massive melt down on SPY tomorrow to catch up to VIX1d or 2. We have a massive correction to the downside on VIX1D which then causes an even bigger rally on SPY tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67049ibmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4a3950a3ec6fa0ee884fbd2ab1915719e9a259c\n\nCurrently I am in the process of tracking VIX1D and finding a correlation\u2026 I am not using Mondays data as its not helpful for me and my analysis so I only have 2 days of data\u2026 so far what I have seen is that IF the 4pm to 415pm move on VIX1D is down (so the 415pm close is lower than 4pm opening on candle) SPY will open green the next day (no correlation on how green yet). I also see a correlation that IF the VIX1D closes HIGHER the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES red\u2026 IF the VIX1D closes LOWER than the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES Green\u2026 \n\nSo if we look at this trend and data so far\u2026 we should see a green open on SPY followed by a red close\u2026 now of course two days of data is hardly anything to take a trade off but I continue to track this and plan to track this for the foreseeable future and analyze IF we can make a predictive guess\u2026\n\nBut I share this data now because if that\u2019s the case and data holds true we are actually setting up for a massive red day tomorrow with how aggressive the VIX1D rallied. \n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ecgugpmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6aebaaa81bc69bd1df5fc5f55b593a90acb124\n\nNow this is where I continue to be a little dumbfounded\u2026 I see zero basis for why the VIX would be down 9.66% today based on the GDP data and the change in the EOY fed funds rate expectations\u2026 We should have seen a continuation on the VIX to the upside\u2026 however, that\u2019s not what we got and we now find ourselves back in this red channel from 15.05 to 17.1. \n\nThis also brings us back under the daily 8ema/ 20ema. \n\nNow the question and the data I will be taking from today is does the VIX outweigh price action on SPY compared to VIX1D\u2026 as in does a massive red day on VIX mean more than a massive green day on VIX1D. \n\nI also can not for the life of me understand while the VIX would drop 9.66% (meaning there is now less 28dte+ long term puts than yesterday) when a recession is pretty much imminent and the actual chances of a fed pause grow further and further away. There is a severe imbalance here. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0k1e04nwhwa1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=fafb37fbee265099a5bcdaf525096acdf00def15\n\nToday was an absolutely frustrating day\u2026 took a small loss on a meta put which im not even upset about\u2026 \n\nBut intraday trading today was absolutely frustrating and at times senseless\u2026 It felt like almost all day we were set up for clear cut bearish movements. However, what we found was pushes to the upside just continued\u2026. The hardest part about today was that I recognized we were in extreme bull momentum for most of the day and I even tried a few times to get in on calls (actually loss on a few or took profits too early) however the technical never set up for an entry\u2026 and by time it actually set up for a call entry it had already moved.\n\nToday was a lesson in a few things\u2026 1. NEVER and I mean NEVER fight extreme momentum no matter how good a play works (I struggle with this ever day like this)\u2026. 2. We do not need to trade every single day\u2026 recognize the days that are advantageous to your strategy and capitalize on those\u2026 sit out the rest\u2026 3. There will be days that are the exception to the rule\u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean we change our rules to fit that day\u2026 it\u2019s the exception not the rule. \n\nI am still thankfully sitting at my weekly profit goal overall right now but today took a huge chunk out of my weekly profits. Today was a frustrating day and one that you look back and say well obviously it was easy\u2026 just buy a call at hold it all day\u2026 well sure everything is easy when you look back\u2026 but for anyone who uses any sort of technical analysis or price action reading or anything outside of FOMO\u2026. Today was anything but easy. \n\nRemember\u2026 tomorrows a new day and we have 252 trading days a year\u2026 we don\u2019t have to trade every day\u2026 also have a set amount every day that if you lose $xxx then you stop for the day and come back the next day\u2026 one of the worst thing someone can do is continue to trade on a day that\u2019s not made for their strategy and eat way and weeks or months of profit.", "id": "1317xu1", "created_utc": 1682631108.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m quite surprised by the +10% to -2% (so far) move AH on Amazon.
