{"title": "Anheuser-Busch (BUD) Short Hypothesis", "selftext": "I'm going long on $65p January '25 puts on BUD.\n\nThere are a few reasons why I believe the stock price may be headed for a decline.\n\nFirstly, the recent advertisement featuring a transgender individual has caused quite a bit of controversy. While the ad was intended to promote diversity and inclusivity, it could actually backfire and lead to a decline in sales. Additionally, I've noticed a lot of TikToks and other social media posts suggesting that there hasn't been much inventory movement lately. If demand for Anheuser Busch's products is decreasing, this could lead to lower sales and a drop in stock price.\n\nSecondly, the company is carrying a significant amount of debt - over $100 billion to be exact. This makes the company highly leveraged and vulnerable to economic downturns. A rising interest rate environment or economic recession could make it difficult for the company to meet its debt obligations, which would negatively impact its stock price.\n\nThirdly, Anheuser Busch's current ratio is low - a rule of thumb is to have a ratio of 2 or higher, but Anheuser Busch's current ratio is currently only 0.66. This suggests that the company may be having trouble meeting its short-term obligations, which could be a red flag for investors.\n\nLastly, I've noticed that the puts for Anheuser Busch seem relatively cheap when compared to the stock's historical volatility. This could be an opportunity for traders to take advantage of the situation and potentially profit from a decline in stock price.\n\nOverall, I believe that Anheuser Busch's stock price may be headed for a decline, making it a prime candidate for purchasing puts. Of course, as with any investment, there are risks involved, and it's important to do your own research and make informed decisions.\n\nWhat do you all think? Do you agree with my hypothesis, or do you see things differently?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW, this post is just opinion, not financial advice.", "id": "12j1uvk", "created_utc": 1681255702.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I believe Anheuser Busch's stock price may be headed for a decline, making it a prime candidate for purchasing puts.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7884622812271118}, {"body": "too much money in addiction. it literally can't go tits up", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "check your personal risk tolerance", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "What about personal economic numerical insolvency sustainability?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27850955724716187}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14891588687896729}, {"body": "10000% this.
