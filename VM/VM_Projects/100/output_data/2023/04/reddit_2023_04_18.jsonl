{"title": "Time to buy Tesla ($TSLA) stock before Q1 earnings?", "selftext": " \n\nTesla ($TSLA) will be a highlight of this week\u2019s earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.\n\nWith shares of $TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.\n\nLet\u2019s see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.\n\n**Q1 Preview**\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla\u2019s Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nThe dip in Tesla\u2019s YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d91a2d5fcfc7ad728237fb839d2e98f65d8a143)\n\nImage Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nWhile Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company\u2019s earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla\u2019s profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.\n\nTesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.\n\nWith that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share. \n\n**Deliveries\u00a0&\u00a0Demand**\u00a0 \n\nThe ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla\u2019s quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla\u2019s willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022. \u00a0\n\nThis would still fall short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla\u2019s ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock. \n\n**Growth & Outlook**\n\nTesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla\u2019s growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.\n\nAccording to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter. \u00a0\n\nOn the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/wjxy3fvzdmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=af3049e7976c81d7b4fddd720f49b219f194bcd6)\n\n**Performance & Valuation**\n\nTesla stock is up an impressive +52% year to date to largely outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +8% and the Auto Manufacturers-Domestic Markets +22%. As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors\u2019 +4% and Ford\u2019s +9% YTD performance.\n\nEven better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors\u2019 +41%, Ford\u2019s +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry\u2019s +88%. \n\nShares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nGoing into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\u00a0Tesla\u2019s annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite\u00a0the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.\n\nAlthough the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be\u00a0 rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease.\u00a0", "id": "12qiq5n", "created_utc": 1681813781.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "To me the stock price always rise high during the closest time to earning release due to hyped up, and result in little to no change or decrease after the earning release.

Here are the results.\n\n* **Earnings per share:** $2.88 vs $2.86 expected\n* **Revenue:** $8.16 billion vs $8.18 billion expected\n\nOn Tuesday, Netflix said goodbye to what got it started \u2014 it\u2019s DVD mailing business, in which it would send out the discs in red envelopes to customers. The company\u2019s Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a blog post that it would finally wind down the DVD business, which \u201ccontinues to shrink.\u201d\n\nA year ago, Netflix had reported its first subscriber loss in a decade, sending its shares on a downward spiral, as well as those of its media peers. The results pushed Netflix and its streaming rivals to focus on profits over subscriber numbers.\n\nResults for the country\u2019s new ad-supported tier will be top of mind. Last November, Netflix unveiled its cheaper tier with commercials, which costs $6.99 a month. The ad-supported tier came shortly after it lost subscribers as streaming competition ramped up.\n\nSarandos recently said the company is likely to offer multiple ad-supported tiers in the future.\n\nAnother focus for Wall Street will be Netflix\u2019s crackdown on password sharing. Late last year, the company said it would begin rolling out measures to have people who have been borrowing other accounts create their own.\n\nThe company has said more than 100 million households share accounts, or about 43% of its global user base. That has affected its ability to invest in new content, Netflix has said. Both the ad-supported option and crackdown on password sharing are meant to boost profits.\n\nIn February, Netflix outlined password-sharing guidance in four countries: New Zealand, Canada, Portugal and Spain. The company said it would ask users in those countries to set a \u201cprimary location\u201d for their accounts, and allow users to establish up to two \u201csub accounts\u201d for those who don\u2019t live in their home base for extra fees.\n\nThe company has yet to provide password-sharing guidance for the U.S., although it is expected to do so this year.", "id": "12r2j2b", "created_utc": 1681848431.0, "score": 575, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 135, "comments": [{"body": "They should have mentioned the word \"A.I.\" somewhere in the statement.", "score": 574, "replies": [{"body": "\"Artificial intelligence is helping us identify former password sharers who are trying to circumvent our crackdown by either sharing their living rooms or even live streaming their viewing experience.\"", "score": 170, "replies": [{"body": "Just talk about using AI to promote content and match genres to subscribers.
