If so, what strike are you comfortable with expiration.", "id": "12xle8d", "created_utc": 1682350230.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Current price of TSLA is 160.39 as of this writing.  If you are long TSLA and your target price is 190 by July here is a trade with a trade plan that you can look into for demo account only. It is for a long diagonal: Buy 1 July 165 call and Sell 1 May 170 (35 delta) call for a debit of 10.50.  Risk is 10.50 to the downside which will be realized if TSLA drops to 85 based on risk graph.  There is also a 5.50 risk to the upside if TSLA rallies to 300 by May expiration.  This is a long delta and long theta position.\n\nHow to manage if TSLA goes down: Sell to close position if TSLA underlying is less than 149.88.  This will result in a $170 loss based on risk graph. At this point, consider buying stock if you are still bullish.  This would have saved you $1000 had you bought stock at 160 (current price now), and then it dropped to 150 which would result is a $1000 loss on paper.\n\nHow to manage if TSLA goes up:  If TSLA rallies to 169 before May expiration (25 DTE) Buy To Close 170 call and Sell To Open June 180 Call 35 delta (or whatever delta that will net a credit)  for a credit.  You will now have a  July 165/ June180 call long diagonal.  If TSLA continues to rally to 180, Buy To Close 180 and Sell To Open July 190 Call.  The end result will be a July 165/190 Bull call spread.  At expiration, if the 190 is ITM, you can close as a spread, Sell to Close 165/190 for a credit of 25.00 at MOC.  If the 190 is not in the money at expiration, you can exercise your 165 call if you desire is to own the stock.  You will have the right to buy TSLA for 165 and sell CC or whatever your heart desires.  If any of the short strikes do not get touched, let the calls expire and sell weekly 35 deltas.  To summarize, you are selling 35 delta and buying to close and rolling when those deltas hit 48-50 when they are ATM and then selling a further out 35 delta or whatever strike will net a credit.   \n As I mentioned earlier, this position is long delta so as long as you close the shorts early enough before the deltas get too large, your position will profit each time you roll for a credit.  Your 165 longs will have a larger delta than the new short call's delta each time to roll.

Somewhere here, it got leaked to the media, bank run was in the magnitude of $70B instead of $24B. I THINK $70B figure was the borrowing from Federal Reserve at some point and it got erroneously interpreted as bank run. This is my biggest guess.\n\nSo, the best scenario would be\n\n1. bank run was about $24B instead of $70B\n2. JPM and other banks put $30B because FRC did not need it after all and all other banks knew they'd get it back because FRC did not need it anyway. This is huge.  Magnus Billing, CEO of Alecta, got fired after losing $2B over SVB failure. No CEO would provide billion dollars, putting his job in danger.\n\nThis is my best scenario for FRC and I have 7,870 FRC stock, average about at $14.60.\n\nEither I will retire or get retired.\n\nEdit: I was wrong.
