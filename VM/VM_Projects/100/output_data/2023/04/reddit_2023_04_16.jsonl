Such a lifeline seems unlikely here with price inflation officially running at 5%, though we still have IORB as a result of 2008(this is now yielding banks a free $148b a year), a massive reverse repo presence, a huge spike in discount window usage, and BTFP. Seems like someone sees something big happening...and wants to ensure banks have a nice soft pillow to land upon...as usual the pillow will be provided by tax payers and people stupid enough to store their wealth in the national currency.\n\nYes, bankers will again be allowed to loot the system by socializing their losses with the help of the federal reserve and treasury.

It's tough to tell which banks are financial landmines for unsecured creditors because bankster balance sheets have conveniently been made opaque by absolving them of having to mark their assets to market. It's likely when, not if, more banks blow up and how the so called \"regulators\" handle it that will determine how the masses respond, buy yeah, probably most whine and cry a bit about it and then do nothing. Government employees will probably do nothing even when they discover their pensions are an exit strategy for bankers and they've no say in the matter.\n\nBanking is made to appear very complex when the basic concept is actually very simple.
