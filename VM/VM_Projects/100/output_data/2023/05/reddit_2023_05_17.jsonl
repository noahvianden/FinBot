He believed he had charmed the capricious\nmistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.\n\n\"The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground\".\n\"Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?\"\n\u201cIdk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted\".\n\nWherever he went , \"off colour\" remarks were expressed.\n\nAt the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz\".\nAt the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: \"This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and\n FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro\".\nAt his wedding to Burry: \"I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis\".\n\nIn Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.\nHe wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis \u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle \ud83d\udd34 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, \"The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate\". In it, he was quoted as saying \"bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully\".\n\nConvinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.\nHe sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98\u2019. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter\ndismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.\nHe eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted \"THIS ISNT FAIR\", that\u2019s his mans, Burry, walked in, \"Honey, your salmon\nis here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.\u201d With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place \ud83c\udfe1. The monitor, with one hand he tried to cover, and with the other halt his mate's enter. However, it was too late. Burry saw the look on Rizzly's face and [knew of their fate](https://ibb.co/xmXSZjc).\n\nAlas, my fellow regards, he was never a bear, but an ostrich with too much flair.\nAnd I, what positions do I hold? Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.\n\n\ud83d\ude0f TLDR: BUY NVDA PUTS \u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f", "id": "13k37ln", "created_utc": 1684333377.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|427|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Rizzly is a bear who got burned by shorting NVDA.

He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.\n\nIn this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in \"puts\", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.\n\nTo fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.\n\nThe story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths. The narrator of the story then reveals their position: they hold 30 Nvidia put options, meaning they too are betting on Nvidia's stock price to decrease.\n\nThe TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of this post is: \"Buy NVDA puts\", meaning the author is advising to purchase put options for Nvidia's stock, betting that the price will drop.
