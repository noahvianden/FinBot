Small and medium sized businesses will be unable to pay the borrowing costs as everyday americans stop patronizing them due to having to tighten their own belts in the face of ever increasing debt payments (all time high household/CC debt, raided 401ks) and they will start laying people of en masse.

One is that falling from 300+ to $59 may mean it's been significantly derisked.  Another is that the market should reward them when the current failed CEO gets replaced.  \n\nAnother big one is just the recurring pattern we keep seeing.
