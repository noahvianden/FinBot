{"title": "CMA bank might be going under soon.... here's the how/why", "selftext": "Let's DD...\n\nI'm going to be referencing their Q1 earnings report along with some reports they presented after that and why I think there was major red warning flags flashing at the bank which were and still are being overlooked.\n\nHere's where you can find their Q1 report: [https://investor.comerica.com/presentations-events](https://investor.comerica.com/presentations-events)\n\nFirst off, the bank is prototypical to the current banks which have failed this far.... Large long term HTM assets which are now losing billions in value per quarter, along with a splurge of covid lending which has begun to lose their past positive gains, if not all of them,  as of the end of Q1, and they are at risk in their loan to deposit ratio due to currently holding massive unsecured deposits which are at flight risk and ballooning the banks Loan to debt liabilities.\n\nThe HTM assets they are booking have been in the multi billions per quarter range while they are in debt \\~15b and only have 9b cash.  **This means all of the cash they claim to have on hand is on paper only due to not having to liquidate HTM assets, YET...**\n\n**In their Q1 earnings report, they had already nearly maxed out their FHLB loan programs, indicated they were already preparing to go to the discount window for 20b and in addition to that... (when no one knew/gave a shit about the BTFP) this bank had already pre-calculated they could go in and get 9b in loans to max on over on the BTFP. (a major red flag!!!!! especially since we can see there's still \\~5bn in BTFP loans outstanding as of today...)**\n\nI believe the reason they had included all these \"features\" of how to access liquidity at this point was because they they had realized they were majorly at risk to far exceeded their deposit to loan ratios  when accounting for  the fact that they had 11 billion in deposit flight just a few months prior, HTM asset unrealized losses, now in the multi billions, and further deposit flight risk with their over 50% uninsured deposit foundation of which they were lending out on.    With fancy math, and not accounting for their Unrealized losses on their lending practices they claimed to have an 85% Loan to deposit ratio.  The problem here is they openly admit they have approximately 64 billion in deposits, of which 53% are basically a flight risk due to being non-interest bearing & uninsured deposits.  The previous quarter saw a 11 billion flight of deposits and they still maintained well over 30 billion of deposits that were at high flight risk.  \n\nLet's make this clear... The bank knowingly has over 30 billion at risk of deposit flight and when tallied along with their HTM unrealized losses and 15b in debts essentially means the bank is at risk of becoming insolvent due to just a few depositors wising up and moving their money to interest bearing accounts...  I think the bank understood this at the start of Q1 once they witnessed an 11billion outflow of deposits but decided to parade around they can get liquidity but that's not the real problem here....\n\nThe bank has increased their lending activities over the last few years to hit 50billion in loans during the covid boom when liquidity was easy and lending was cheap and even won awards for having created the most loans over all other competitors last year... which I think is going to come back to bite their ass soon and here's why:\n\nThe bank has been one of the biggest lenders in Michigan to the corporate/business sectors ever since 2020-2021 but the bank stated in their Q1 report they expected 9% annualized growth in these sectors... yet just a short while later they announced their internal metrics/reporting which showed a decline in business activity by over -4% for the previous quarter...  \n\nHow did they ever calculate that they will hit 9% growth when they just suffered -4% declines in the previous quarter into a rate hiking environment?  The bank obviously had internal tracking metrics here and saw their commercial businesses slowing down but still said they expect a bounce back of 13% over 9 mo into further rate hikes after lending like madmen during peak bubble?    The company in this Q1 report also said they were increasing their allocations for defaults going up to nearly 1 billion, or 2% of their total lending practices.....    **To make it simple...  they're basically just a regarded as all of us here on WSB by expecting 13% growth while at the same time knowingly planning for massive losses and deposit flight risk as we headed deeper into the year with  higher rates...**\n\nLet's make this clear... The bank knowingly has over 30 billion at risk of deposit flight (after already losing 11billion) they still remain at risk from just a handful of customers who can easily get 3-5% on their money.  When tallied along with their HTM unrealized losses, 15b in debts, and 50b in commercial loans which are slowing down and facing increased default rates, pre-planning to access the BTFP (the most desperate grab for cash from the fed of which we know \\~5b is outstanding in the BTFP program....) \n\nSo yeah, I think this bank knows they are actually getting obliterated in terms of growth prospects... but did the song and dance to try and say they weren't a bank on the brink of collapse...\n\nSo to summarize, I believe the bank is at serious risk of becoming insolvent and collapsing due to just a few depositors wising up and moving their money to interest bearing accounts (which may have already happened?) \n\n**CMA bank looks like it's been staging and preparing as a FDIC candidate since Q1 and will likely end up being sold off for profitable acquisition rewards for years away...**\n\nYes they have an okay business model, but it's a business model which became extremely at risk due to higher rates, massive unsecured deposit flight risks, excessive peak bubble lending which is now having increased default rates, and HTM assets which hold multibillions in unrealized losses on their balance sheet.\n\nThe real question here is not if the bank might fail, but more so, how soon?\n\nTBH I thought about this for a good while before deciding to buy puts here, the reality is just plain and simple.... this bank, unfortunately, fits like a cookie cutter perfectly into having the same systemic problems as what's actually been causing banks to go under thus far, and I doubt they are some magical bank that can escape this coming fate.  They claim they might be able to mitigated their HTM damage, but only after we passed 4.5%, the fact still remains that they have a very large deposit flight and had lending practices which are now turning into potential \\~billion in losses...\n\nThe final cherry on top?  Cramer was lamenting that this bank might go under and was being treated \"unfairly\" just yesterday which is what actually made me go investigate their risk/q1 report.  I understand it's easy to blame short sellers, but in reality, this is on the bank for sitting on their hands and ignoring interest rate risk while the fed hiked up to 5% thinking they can just ignore what was happening to their balance sheet.\n\n**TL:DR? CMA bank** is massively at risk for solvency issues and was a peak covid bubble lender which is now turning sour.  The bank knowingly has a multibillion uninsured deposit flight risk problem while holding onto additional billions in unrealized losses via HTM treasuries/lending risks which means they are teetering on the verge of becoming insolvent due to 30b of deposits which can easily be moved away, and is incentivized, to better than a 0% rate.", "id": "138x7cn", "created_utc": 1683311441.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|1192|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcghx5/revival_of_a_company_wall_st_believed_to_be_a/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/138x7cn/cma_bank_might_be_going_under_soon_heres_the/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DerpyMcOptions, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruz96y5qn3ya1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1a27295c92ee40b4eabb6fa4d79ce9611998a3c", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/bdevec8usgya1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=791ddce1b8ff8a73fa12ca0a078a69b5e1db2272", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Lets goooo", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0665854886174202}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6724363565444946}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2973877191543579}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3925454616546631}, {"body": "Well.. it was next in the burry chart... so its not to farfetched...\n\nIf it does tank... its probably gonna kill a certain someone who sold calls on wal..![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "What really stands out to me, is that they were already openly discussing the BTFP as a necessary source of liquidity in their Q1.\n\nThis is actually what stood out to me as extremely suspicious, given that that program had only just been announced, it's possible a regulator had already intervened and forced them to have a discussion of how and why they would be needing to access this extra source of liquidity and the steps to do so.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3474053740501404}, {"body": "Link to burry chart", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Just search wsb for \"burry chart\"\n\nYou will find a thread on it", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8583143353462219}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2608698308467865}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3139230012893677}, {"body": ">CMA bank is at serious risk of becoming insolvent and collapsing due to just a few depositors wising up and moving their money to interest bearing accounts.

If you remove the FHLB 19b metric of assets, that means they're looking more like a 10% default rate on their commercial loans in the coming yr (which is huge and looks toxic to me...)  **Remember, this report was placed out back in Q1 before assets in CRE/REITS started actually defaulting in much greater numbers with up to 80% markdowns, as they are now, so they may have grossly underestimated the actual commercial decline/losses in Q1 they could experience throughout the remainder of the yr.**  This isn't just about \"paying for deposits here\" it's about the solvency of their entire bank due to large unrealized HTM assets and lending practices which are now increasingly at risk of default (by their own Q1 report.)\n\nTheir lending practices had them lending long on deposits which still sit at 0% rates praying they never leave for much safer and easier yields, some of their depositors have wisened to the tune of over 11billion in Q1...  If the bank suffers \\~10b more of deposit flight they might be faced with having to liquidate HTM assets or other non favorable asset liquidations.  They already accessed well over their current cash on hand amount via the FHLB to provide liquidity for the previous 11+billion in deposit flight, meaning the cash they \"hold\" is actually all tied up as swaps which they cannot continue to access for more liquidity.  They're clearly in a liquidity crunch, I doubt like hell they're issuing any new loans as they are already overextended via the discount window swaps.\n\nThis bank was without a doubt, engaged in the same lending practices which got the other banks in trouble and liquidated via the FDIC as of late.   They have already accessed liquidity from their assets via the discount window meaning they were already having desperate liquidity issues during Q1 from 11bn in deposit flight.  This means they're reaching criticality.  If they incur just a smidge more of deposit flight in addition to their forecasting loan losses then they're basically done for as they would just further overextend their Loan to debt obligations and enter desperation mode of maxing out their discount window / BTFP programs which don't actually offer them much cushion.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s what CET1 is for", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The CET1 covers only 5b of flight deposit risk/losses before they would need more.. with their 100bn assets this is can disappear quite quickly especially when they encounter deposit flight of 10b like they had in q1", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No, you don\u2019t understand.
