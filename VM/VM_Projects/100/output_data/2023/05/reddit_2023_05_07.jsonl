You don't project out 10 years to get an estimated 10 year return. \n\nSay you've got a company at a PE of 10, growing at 20% per year. What if instead of 10 years, you want to know your 1 year return? You'll get a number which is about 11% of the price. Does that mean your 1 year expected return is -89%? No, obviously not. \n\nAs warren buffett says, \"The intrinsic value of any business, if you could foresee the future perfectly, is the present value of all cash that will be ever distributed for that business between now and judgment day.\"\n\nYou're right in saying valuation is an art. What you're doing is smearing shit on the walls.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your holding period does not need to be forever for DCA to perpetuity to be relevant. The stock will exist forever (ignoring certain events) and you will sell it for a price that reflects that. Buying stocks at half their intrinsic value based on DCA to perpetuity, then selling them when they correct to intrinsic value within 1-3 years, is a perfectly legitimate strategy and an example of what I just said. \n\nThe idea that it has to generate its own market cap within 10 years to be worth it only makes sense if you expect to sell the stock for $0 at the end of those 10 years. \n\n>This is why I'm using a long time frame, not short time frame. Year to year returns are pretty chaotic. \n\nOkay, so how about 5 years? You'll find the expected return is still negative, but less negative. How about 15 years? You'll find the expected **annual** return becomes more and more positive. *The longer you forecast out under your method, the better your* ***annual*** *return projections will look*. This is because your system is inherently flawed. \n\nAlso, you're not using a market cap to GVA model because that is a model used to value the S&P or american business as a whole and simply cannot be applied to a single business, as a single business does not have a GVA number in the same way it does not have a GDP number. I've just read Hussman's blog post, introducing market cap/GVA, and he talks exclusively about using it to value the S&P. Also, don't know how relevant it is, but Hussman has returned about 2% a year over the past decade so I don't know if it would be wise to listen to him. \n\nAs for the last bit about Buffett and Munger - in the first quote, Buffett is talking about the DCF model. He is making a comedic parallel between Aesop's quote and the correct way to value something, the DCF. \n\nIn the second quote, Munger is talking about how, while DCFs are correct in theory, they are not useful to the investor in practice (so long as you understand the concept behind them - which is that future cash flows are worth less than present ones, and that a business is worth the present value of its future cash flows). I agree with this - while DCFs are technically correct, they are not hugely helpful and I haven't physically written one out in years. Understand, though, that what Buffett (along with all good investors) is doing in his head is effectively an imprecise DCF. That's what the next couple quotes are about, too. That using a DCF gives the illusion of accuracy via precision in your maths, when the real source of uncertainty is the business's future prospects. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now for a quick bit of honesty - I have never argued with anyone quite so infuriating as you.
