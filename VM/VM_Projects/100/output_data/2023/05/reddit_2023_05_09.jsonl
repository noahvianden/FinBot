However, when I file a dispute with Paypal (and show that the computer was back in the hands of Lenovo), the money is refunded in two days without me having to do much else. \n\nAnother example... I had gotten a message from Angie's List about a change in their subscription model, and that if you wanted to cancel, that you had to do so before certain date. I wrote them back and requested to cancel my membership, but then a few weeks later, they still charged me. There was no way they were going to willingly return my money, but when I showed Paypal that I had messaged my request in the proper timeframe, they sided with me and reversed the charge.\n\nDon't under estimate how unethical and immoral so many major companies are these days.

{"title": "Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee", "selftext": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653\n\nHidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers\u2019 actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found\n\nThousands of officials across the government\u2019s executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.\n\nMore than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.\n\nA top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.\n\nThe Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.\n\nThe vast majority of the disclosure forms aren\u2019t available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.\n\n\nAmong the Journal\u2019s findings:\n\n\u2022 While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\n\u2022 More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.\n\n\u2022 More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.\n\n\u2022 At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.\n\n\u2022 About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.\n\n\u2022 When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency\u2019s work.\nNumber of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21\n\nFederal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield \u201cimmense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,\u201d said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.\n\nHe said many of the examples in the Journal analysis \u201cclearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the government.\u201d\n\nSome federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. \u201cThe buck stops with the official,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. \u201cIt\u2019s the official who could benefit or be harmed\u2026. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.\u201d\n\nInvesting by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.\n\nJournal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.\n\nThis article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.\n\nU.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nThe 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges.\nimage\nA view of Washington, D.C.\n\nMost officials\u2019 financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.\n\nSome made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven\u2019t turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn\u2019t provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)\n\nUnder federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren\u2019t considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn\u2019t restrict investing in diversified funds.\n\nSome federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is \u201ccommitted to transparency and citizen oversight of government,\u201d said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.\n\nAt the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.\n\nMr. Molina\u2019s job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He \u201creviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,\u201d said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a \u201cpersonal and confidential representative\u201d of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.\n\nIn the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.\n\nReported trades in energy and mining firms;\n\nmade by spouse through a financial adviser\n\nThe trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband\u2019s account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA\u2019s electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.\n\nOfficials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don\u2019t conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal\u2019s review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.\n\nIn an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn\u2019t know much about the energy trades. \u201cI can say this on the record: I didn\u2019t even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn about 2\u00bd years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina\u2019s disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.\n\nIn the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.\n\nTwo months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.\n\nAfter publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: \u201cNeither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a \u2018pool\u2019 of several dozen clients\u2014not for us individually.\u201d\n\nMr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency\u2019s ethics office \u201ccounseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.\u201d EPA officials signed Mr. Molina\u2019s financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.\n\nU.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.\n\nThe EPA doesn\u2019t have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren\u2019t working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina\u2019s boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.\n\nGreg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department\u2019s director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.\n\nMr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias\u2019s portfolio.\n\nMr. Zacharias\u2019s office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn\u2019t attend those meetings.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn\u2019t involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. \u201cI could always walk downstairs and ask them how it\u2019s going. But that really wasn\u2019t an interest of mine,\u201d he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.\n\nMr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn\u2019t pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: \u201cI\u2019m just the pipe-smoking science guy.\u201d\n\nThe Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal\u2019s analysis.\n\n\u201cI apologize that things don\u2019t look good on the buy side,\u201d Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: \u201cI just decided that would be a good investment at the time.\u201d\n\nHe said ethics officials didn\u2019t raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be \u201ca little tighter.\u201d\n\nA Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias \u201cworked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.\u201d She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees\u2019 disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.\n\nSome conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies\u2019 misunderstanding of their own rules.\n\nThe FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are \u201csignificantly regulated\u201d by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.\n\nAn FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.\n\nMr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA\u2019s planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.\n\nMr. Bertoni\u2019s lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.\n\nThe stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.\n\nThey did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni\u2019s forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,\u201d the attorney said in an email.\n\nAfter considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.\n\nAn FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family\u2019s holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.\n\n\u201cThe FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,\u201d said the spokesman.\n\nWhen federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.\n\nValerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.\n\nMembers of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.\n\nMs. Hardy-Mahoney\u2019s office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.\n\nThe NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.\n\nMs. Hardy-Mahoney\u2019s office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers\u2019 rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney\u2019s office dismissed the charge in January 2021.\n\nLast November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.\n\nThe NLRB\u2019s inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.\n\nThe report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney\u2019s office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report\u2014Ms. Hardy-Mahoney\u2014received additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.\n\nMs. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei\u2019s husband.\n\nIn June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank \u201cin a very, very difficult position.\u201d Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he \u201cjust would love to see\u201d a clear policy on the matter.\n\nBecause Mr. Powell didn\u2019t dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.\n\nIn early September 2018, Ms. Wei\u2019s husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.\n\nIt then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.\n\nMs. Wei\u2019s husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei\u2019s disclosure.\n\nThe Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.\n\nThe new Fed rules for top people don\u2019t apply to Ms. Wei because she isn\u2019t senior enough. The trades were \u201cpermissible then and are permissible now,\u201d said the Fed spokeswoman.\n\nMs. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had \u201cno responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.\u201d She said the Fed \u201cdid not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.\u201d\n\nEthics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei\u2019s trades didn\u2019t violate conflicts rules.\nimage\nThe Federal Reserve building in Washington.\n\nRoughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.\n\nIn one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC\u2019s own rules.\n\nThe financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal\u2019s review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020\u2014an average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.\n\nAbout one-third of those reported 2020 trades\u20142,994\u2014involved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.\n\nOver the years, to safeguard the CFTC\u2019s integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees\u2019 investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC\u2019s role doesn\u2019t include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.\n\nNonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail\u2019s husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission \u201ccould possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.\u201d The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission\u2019s statutory authority.\n\nMr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn\u2019t speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the CFTC, \u201cemployees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,\u201d said the agency spokesman. \u201cIn this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse\u2019s investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.\u201d\n\nMr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: \u201cThe FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation\u2019s banking system.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.\n\nAcross the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.\n\nReed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\n\nAt the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.\n\nDefense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.\n\nNearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn\u2019t include Alibaba. The company\u2019s stock rose 4% that day.\n\nThree days later, Mr. Werner\u2019s financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.\n\nThe sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn\u2019t involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.\n\nThe Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn\u2019t own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee\u2019s duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.\n\nAt least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon\u2019s top cybersecurity official.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.\n\nMr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn\u2019t direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn\u2019t involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn\u2019t see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.\n\nWithin federal agencies, ethics officials generally don\u2019t consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials\u2019 ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don\u2019t know what employees are working on.\n\nWhen ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies\u2019 inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nA Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.\n\nOne matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse\u2019s financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren\u2019t allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official\u2019s work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.\n\nWhen a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC\u2019s inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: \u201cWe take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.\u201d\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nAre stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.\n\nMost federal agencies don\u2019t have protocols to verify that officials\u2019 financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.\n\nThe official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.\n\nAt the EPA, Mr. Molina\u2019s financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.\n\nThe conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not \u201cparticipate personally and substantially\u201d in matters that have a \u201cdirect and predictable effect\u201d on their investments and those of family members.\n\nWhen the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn\u2019t have any influence over environmental policy.\n\nHis \u201cduties are administrative in nature,\u201d his boss, the EPA\u2019s chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. \u201cHe provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect\u201d on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina\u2019s financial disclosure.\n\nIn his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn\u2019t file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.\n\nEthics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina \u201cscores\u201d of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.\n\nIn one email, a senior ethics official said his office had \u201cprovided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.\u201d\n\nMr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn\u2019t know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA\u2019s electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.\n\nIn September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.\n\n\u201cWe have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,\u201d wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, \u201cso I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. \u201cI feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,\u201d he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.\n\n\u201cIf the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,\u201d Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. \u201cI believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.\u201d\n\nEthics officials didn\u2019t investigate Mr. Molina\u2019s trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina\u2019s final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.\n\nMr. Molina wrote out a personal check to \u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d and sent it to officials in the EPA\u2019s ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.", "id": "13cncl6", "created_utc": 1683632845.0, "score": 1817, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Buffet says invest in what you know.", "score": 310, "replies": [{"body": "Ok this one is pretty funny \ud83d\ude02.", "score": 77, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06175483763217926}, {"body": "I wish I knew insider information!", "score": 31, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27958834171295166}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28585055470466614}, {"body": "At this point, what even is there to do ?

During these times, short sellers covering their positions likely contributed to increases in GME\u2019s price. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period. Figure 6 shows that buy volume in GME, including buy volume from participants identified as having large short positions, increased significantly beginning around January 22 and remained high for several days, corresponding to the beginning of the most dramatic phase of the run-up in GME\u2019s price.\nFigure 6 shows that the run-up in GME stock price coincided with buying by those with short positions. However, it also shows that such buying was a small fraction of overall buy volume, and that GME share prices continued to be high after the direct effects of covering short positions would have waned. The underlying motivation of such buy volume cannot be determined; perhaps it was motivated by the desire to maintain a short squeeze.

{"title": "Guys! ABNB Earnings are Today! How are we gonna get a 5-bagger?", "selftext": "It's finally time. Airbnb (ABNB) is scheduled to report their earning results today after hours. As you guys know, the company connects hosts and guests online and allows them to book travel services and accommodation facilities worldwide. For the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 16-21% on a reported basis and 18-23% on an FX neutral basis. This is most likely driven by growth in European travel and a gradual recovery in China.\n\nTo keep things simple, I'm going to put the entire post in jot note form and then provide my conclusion at the end.\n\n**What to Consider**\n\n* Airbnb has been witnessing steady improvements in long-distance and cross-border travel due to relaxed travel restrictions. This is likely to have continued to aid its performance in the first quarter.\n\n* Growing momentum among travelers is likely to have continued driving the [Nights and Experiences Booked](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1193532/airbnb-nights-experiences-booked-worldwide) and Average Daily Rates in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n* Strengthening demand in North America, EMEA and Latin America is likely to have driven ABNB\u2019s performance in the quarter under discussion.\n\n* Increasing guest demand for non-urban nights is expected to have continued driving active listings for non-urban destinations in the quarter under review.\n\n* Airbnb\u2019s consistent efforts to enhance various aspects of its services to gain momentum among its hosts and guests are likely to have benefited the quarterly performance.\n\n* Analyst [Sachin Mittal](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sachin-mittal) maintained a Buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $153\n\n* [Cost cutting measures](https://www.tipranks.com/news/airbnb-nasdaqabnb-trims-headcount-slightly-despite-hiring-plans) taken earlier will reflect higher margins in this quarter.\n\n* However, uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic are expected to have been concerning in the first quarter.\n\n* The impacts of macroeconomic headwinds, including rising prices and geo-political tensions, are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.\n\n* Intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have been an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n**Concluding Thoughts**\n\nIn the end, we have a booming travel industry that's ripping back and above pre-pandemic levels. Airbnb's are *still* cheaper than hotels. The number of users are growing and the platform has been consistently rolling out new features. I'm gonna literally jump in on calls. Last earnings, we saw the stock rise up +14%. Can it do this again? Doubtful. But what the hell, time for a call spread. I'm buying the 5/12 135c for $241 and selling the 140c for $132. This means the spread can be bought for only 109 bucks, and can offer 4.6x gains *if* the stock goes up 9.6%. Historically, the average move (either up or down) has been about this much. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.\n\n---\n\n**Edit:** Selling the 140c, not the 140p", "id": "13d0gwm", "created_utc": 1683654145.0, "score": 170, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|153|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13byuhu/what_im_doing_for_pltr_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13bzvbn/why_im_getting_pypl_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/135v8qm/your_lotto_play_for_amds_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/136t8is/your_lotto_play_for_etsys_earnings_tonight/) \n**Account Age**|4 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/CalmGains, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Buy the 5/12 135c for 109 bucks and sell the 140p for 132 bucks.

Well its simple\u2026 IF CPI rebounds or shows any signs of plateauing\u2026 whats the reaction going to be? Well they are going to have to price in a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting\u2026 and that is going to mess up all of this markets plan for 75bps of cuts by EOY. \n\nIf CPI comes in hot on YoY and Mom tomorrow in my opinion we are looking at a true 2-3% melt down and not only that but we are going to continue to sell off the rest of the week\u2026 the only thing that could stop that is a cool PPI print the next morning. \n\nIf markets has to reprice their fed funds rate by EOY this could be the catalyst markets have truly been waiting for. \n\nNow if I am wrong and we get a CPI of 4.9% or lower\u2026 well lets just say we are probably going to see a rocket ship to 440 within a very short period of time\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld6nbr1z8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=01dd8b35780a2519f09ede76f219f1c7ff7deedb\n\nSPY daily did not establish a new supply at 412.99 as I was expecting it too\u2026 though tomorrow if it is red we should establish a new one there\u2026 \n\nI see that we closed directly in the middle of this range\u2026 that means our upside target is really 415.56 to 417.03 and our downside target is 404.3 to 405.06. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4xaggz8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=609f6919791c6c72fd232874a4b5150049485a1c\n\nAbsolutely BRUTAL price action today with no continuation and lots and lots of tight ranges\u2026 we spent an hour an 6 cent range at one point\u2026 \n\nWe have a major downside support at 405.2 then 399 and we have a major upside resistance at 416.8 then 419.5. \n\nPossible CPI Targets\n\nBulls- 416.84 (1.45%+) -> 419.5 (2.08%+)\n\nBears- 405.2 (-1.4%) -> 401.4 (-2.33%) -> 399 (-2.93%)\n\nFor me I don\u2019t think that the upside case is there for me as VIX is so low and really CPI is already EXPECTED to come in lower and lower\u2026 a surprise upside beat especially that 5.1% im looking for with MoM rising would absolutely start a huge leg down though\u2026 for me im bearish. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/baoys2wz8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=071dcc8e4d1aca0b528c6a05ba6dff5ccd65ad1f\n\nNow interestingly enough futures DID turn 4152 into a new supply (resistance) which means that our target should be 4073 minimum but I still am eyeing that 4040/4055 supplies that we have come ever so close to so many times\u2026 \n\nIf we get an upside beat tomorrow then we would look for 4190-4198. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7htphta09vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9286150cd989ea6633a652d28a00a4eb346b8383\n\nFutures impressively only put in a 22 point range today\u2026 that\u2019s a very small movement for nearly 24 hours of trading\u2026 \n\nCPI potential targets\n\nBulls- 4198 (1.51%+) -> 4237 (2.4%)  \n Bears- 4073 (-1.53%) -> 4055 (-2.01%) -> 4040 (-2.34%)\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jws3dca19vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e46e35f1b68ba3c4ffa902ec2ff074646dcb3c1\n\nStarted tracking the VIX on TOS and idk why just sometimes it just looks nicer then TV\u2026 maybe it\u2019s the dark mode\u2026 jk light mode for life! \n\nAnyways the VIX continues to hold just under that daily 20ema. You can see we are really in a diamond pattern here which means if we can break through 20.42 (+15.4%) tomorrow then we might actually be looking at a bigger upside push to 22.6 to 24.18\u2026 if that happens then we are looking at a fairly big dump on SPY which would correlate with a CPI miss\u2026\n\nHowever, if we break support tomorrow of 17.32 then we are going to look to target 15.72 support once again.\n\nFun fact\u2026 this is the LOWEST the VIX has closed pre-CPI in over a year of CPI releases\u2026 \n\nOnce again the risk is to the downside not the upside\u2026 actually something else that is incredibly impressive to me is the fact that the IV on 1dte contracts for tomorrow closed under 20%... that\u2019s incredibly low\u2026 I remember a time when SPX ATM contracts were like $4000/ play\u2026 you had to go almost 20 strikes OTM just to get a lotto sized play\u2026 IV used to easily hit 80-100% on CPI days\u2026 IF we get a big miss and surprises tomorrow puts might see some fireworks. \n\nI did not open up longer term (60dte) puts today\u2026 I wanted to but with the cheap 1dte I decided to swing a 1dte put instead\u2026 my thoughts here is that if we miss I will win big\u2026 if we beat with IV this lower and only being a handful of strikes OTM with the probability of another flat open I should be able to get out relatively unscathed\u2026 I would then look for the 418-420 range to start a long term bearish play. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5i6ilr19vya1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=9099cf24ff5ebcc438cda84d6f743a2fe10a0449\n\nToday was another hard trading day with this tight ranges and lack of continuation\u2026 I made a few good trades and made some bad trades\u2026 the biggest issue was even with 1dte I found that when I was correct the underlying just didn\u2019t move enough to pay us for our efforts.

Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
