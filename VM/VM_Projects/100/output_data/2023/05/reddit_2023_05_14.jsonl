{"title": "Money Supply Falling Rapidly", "selftext": " The Money Supply Has Plummeted In The Biggest Drop Since The Great Depression. The last time the year-over-year change in the money supply slipped into negative territory was in November 1994. (Bond crash).  \n\n\nMoney supply growth can often be a helpful measure of economic activity and an indicator of coming recessions. During periods of economic boom, money supply tends to grow quickly as commercial banks make more loans. Recessions, on the other hand, tend to be preceded by slowing rates of money supply growth.  \n\n\nThe fact that the money supply is shrinking at all is so remarkable because the money supply almost never gets smaller. The money supply has now fallen by $2.2 trillion (or 10.2 percent) since the peak in April 2022. Proportionally, the drop in money supply since 2022 is the largest fall we've seen since the Depression. (Rothbard estimates that in the lead up to the Great Depression, the money supply fell by 12 percent from its peak of $73 billion in mid-1929 to $64 billion at the end of 1932.)  \n\n\nThis all points toward rapidly declining economic activity in an economy where real savings and investments have been hollowed out by more than a decade of easy money. Bitcoin has only ever existed in easy money. Easy money, easy gains. ...

They studied the spread of COVID in a restaurant.  Patrons who sat under an air conditioning vent all contracted COVID while patrons sitting nearby did not.  This illustrates something called minimal viral load.  The virus might be in the air but to get COVID, you need to get a certain minimum amount.  So, you can see how masks work.
