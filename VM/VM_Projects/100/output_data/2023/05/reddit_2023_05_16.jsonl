There are tons of labs with robotics far more advanced than this. Most eventually drop the humanoid part, because it's a gimmick. In practice humanoid robots are inefficient.\n\nExample, [UCLA robotics](https://samueli.ucla.edu/robotics/).\n\nAnd I'm sure you'll come up with more technobabble you don't understand to try to claim Tesla uses \"AI\" so it's different somehow (all these systems us AI, all these systems have object detection).\n\nJust tell me, what new tech has Tesla actually developed? Even their object detection algorithms are the basic ones taught in intro ML courses. They just sound cool to people who don't know anything about the field.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If the robot is not being controlled remotely and is interacting with it's surroundings then it's autonomous, right? Do you have a video showing how they're controlling it when it's walking around or interacting with its surroundings? I understand that the autonomy might be really basic or heavily restricted but it looks to me like it's got some level of autonomy.\n\nThe efficiency of a humanoid bot isn't in the way that it interacts with objects, it's in the manufacturability of the bot. If you want the bots to cost $10,000 each then you have to be able to manufacture millions of them. In order to manufacture millions of them they need to be able to perform many different types of tasks. Because the world has been, for the most part, built for humans, the best form factor for a general purpose robot is humanoid. The fact that you don't understand this kind of puts your whole entire anti-thesis on the bot into question. This is a critical feature of the bot to understand the vision. Obviously if you are designing a bot to put a rivet into metal then there are other more efficient form factors for that exact task. But you're missing the entire point of the bot. That rivet bot won't take out my garbage or pick weeds in my garden. And if I design a \"weeding bot\" that's going to cost $500,000 each.\n\nI think you're confusing \"being first\" with \"being innovative\". Nobody is arguing that Tesla has been the first group to build a robot. But right now, they are the only company that I am aware of that has a plan to build millions, maybe even billions, of autonomous robots for the general public. They are focused on bringing the manufacturing costs down and the usability high.\n\nThe entire bot has been developed by Tesla. They are now creating all of their own motors and actuators that are purpose built for their tasks. They have created a photorealistic training environment that they can use to train the visual neural net in the bot. \n\nAgain, I have no idea what point you're trying to make. I think you're stuck on some idea that because Tesla didn't invent the concept of robots or AI that they haven't done anything impressive which is a dumb argument. The same thing could be said for current impressive large language models. Just because someone didn't invent something doesn't mean that their developments and rates of progress are not impressive. Henry Ford didn't invent the assembly line nor the automobile but the Model T was incredibly impressive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, your logic is analogous to the following: someone says \"Michael Phelps is a great swimmer\" and you respond with \"Ya well people have been swimming for thousands of years and many cultures have independently come up with the concept of swimming\".

It sounds like you're talking about Asimo which reportedly costs $2.5 million to build and took over a decade to develop.\n\nTesla only started 2 years or so ago and is aiming for something that doesn't cost $2.5million a piece to produce and I think Tesla aims for more than 1 hour of operation time for their robots.\n\nIn case you don't know, producing something for $30k that has more capabilities than something that costs $2.5 million to produce puts quite some difficult constraints on your product.\n\nObviously, that is not as trivial as scaling up a toy robot, right?\n\n>Tesla is not doing these things either.\n\nYou're joking, right? How can you deny they're not considering fine motor control when the video literally shows the robot grasping differently shaped objects and articulating fingers?
