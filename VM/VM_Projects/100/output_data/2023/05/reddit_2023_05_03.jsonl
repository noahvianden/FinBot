{"title": "APPL DD", "selftext": "Hello fellow Regards, I am about to make all of us rich our the fucking wazoo, listen closely because it\u2019s not that fucking hard to fat finger the put button. \n\nOk to begin we can see apple trading between 150-170 these past 3 months right? Right, now if you take a look at the calendar you can see that apple is coming up on its next earnings this Thursday at close which means that Friday will be the market open where we see the actual effect of this earnings call.\n\nNow follow me here on this one because it\u2019s gonna get very complicated but today we saw Jpow talking about the rate hikes and how we will not be seeing them go away for some time correct? Well immediately after that a whale at JP was seen selling 500,000 shares on the whale watcher app. This whale selling out seems reasonable correct? WRONG, after checking senator listing Nancy pelosi purchased roughly 20 million equivalent in shares instantaneously after the sell off of this whale. Still not seeing the connection? Well if it wasn\u2019t obvious enough Nancy pelosis husband works at JP Morgan and he most certainly sold off those shares to tax harvest his losses on Rivian, this may seem ok until you remember that tomorrow is thurday and apple earnings effect is on Friday which means that Nancy told Jpow to tank the market or at least make it seem like a whale would want to sell off a large portion to offset suspicion. I wouldn\u2019t have even bat an eye at this until I saw Jpow use his phone after announcing the rate hike and if you know anything you would know that he most likely texted pelosi or even bought apple for himself. \n\nFurthermore, if you look at cnbc headlines you can see fear mongering, this implies they are bullish and would like to maximize profits being up 121% YTD in all positions, it\u2019s a ploy to increase credibility of the companies reports correct? Correct! So I took this knowledge along with my degree in mathmatics and saw the chart once more to see slow purchasing of whales while offset by sell offs of average Joe traders like me and you, this is what we call the market being so efficiently priced in because the big boys know what\u2019s gonna happen already. Now this may seem crazy but that\u2019s not all, let me ask you when is the day of beast feast? This may seem irrelevant but beast feast is a national holiday celebrated on may 5 also know as Cinco de Mayo. Cinco is 5 in Spanish however in Latin (pre erazoic) it is 2, two days after Friday is Sunday? What is open on Sunday? Not Chic fila a! Therefore this implies every 7th year not considering the leap year we have a reversed beast feast due to the timing of the market. How is this important? Well we know that Tim Cook is a hardcore conservative Christian and he cannot eat Sunday post Cinco de Mayo, so he is gonna be fucking raging mad right? So am I saying puts on apple, fuck no you dumbass clearly you aren\u2019t following me. He is gonna be so fucking mad that the only way he can offset his mood, based on my chemistry background, he must find an equilibrium with the external environment and therefore to decrease enthally( heat generated by anger) he must increase entropy naturally. Root word tropy (trophy) means that there is a reward waiting for us created by him. Friday is his offset with nature. \n\nSee technical analysis below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour are regarded \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: Calls on apple, unless we have monkey market?", "id": "136yzts", "created_utc": 1683146773.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|41|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Calls on apple, unless we have monkey market?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This didn\u2019t age well.", "score": 276, "replies": [{"body": "Jesus this is even tougher after seeing the new post.", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "Jesus is his new investment plan", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I\u2019m dead", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Let's hope bro get some karma off his shit... its God's will", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11976979672908783}, {"body": "Probably OP too", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15971001982688904}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08490379899740219}, {"body": "Broooo \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.038421064615249634}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14919710159301758}, {"body": "no better example of, \"everyone gangsta until margin call\"", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04849456995725632}, {"body": "Facts\ud83d\ude02", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06562895327806473}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.239350363612175}, {"body": "And what drugs did OP take to go on such unhinged ramblings about Cinco de Mayo and Chick-fil-A?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Nah he was just overconfident and too hype", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04909144714474678}, {"body": "the most potent drug of all: the degeneracy of r/wsb", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3052006959915161}, {"body": "This dude in my opinion is most likely the result of someone going on chatGTP and asking it to \u2018make funny wallstreet bets post\u2019.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20401360094547272}, {"body": "He got a house inherited from his parents, used it as collateral for a 600k loan and lost all the money on stocks\u2026don\u2019t be like OP, only spend money you can afford to lose.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21552708745002747}], "tickers": ["de"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Well he did make someone rich", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18198958039283752}, {"body": "Wondering whether this whole thing is a troll.
