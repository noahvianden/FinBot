The company plans to roll out its third wave of layoffs before summer.  \n\nHere are the results, compared with estimates from Refinitiv and StreetAccount:\n\nEarnings per share: 93 cents per share adjusted, vs 93 cents per share expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts\n\nRevenue: $21.81 billion vs $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\n\nDisney+ total subscriptions: 157.8 million vs 163.17 million expected, according to StreetAccount\n\n\nIger\u2019s second tenure at Disney also comes as legacy media companies contend with a rapidly shifting landscape, as ad dollars dry up and consumers increasingly cut off their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming.\n\nYet the streaming space has been difficult to navigate in recent quarters, as expenses have swelled and consumers become more cost conscious about their media spending.\n\nWall Street had expected Disney+ subscriptions to grow less than a percent during the quarter to reach 163.17 million users. However, the service saw a 2% decline in memberships, falling to 157.8 million subscribers from 161.8 million as of Dec. 31. The majority of these losses came from an 8% drop in membership at India\u2019s Disney+ Hotstar. An additional 600,000 subscribers were lost domestically. \n\nThe company\u2019s direct-to-consumer operating income losses were narrower than expected, however, with Disney posting a loss of $659 million during the quarter, compared to a loss of $841 million projected by Street Account. Revenue for the unit rose 12% to $5.51 billion, reflecting recent price increases.\n\nDisney said the lower operating loss was due to improved results at Disney+ and ESPN+ during the quarter, partially offset by lower operating income at Hulu.\n\nThe company also saw higher subscription revenue at Disney+, where average revenue per user rose 20% to $7.14 for domestic subscribers. This gain was offset by a 20% fall in revenue for Disney+ Hotstar, which pushed global Disney+ ARPU to just $4.44, lower than the $4.52 projected by Street Account.\n\nDisney\u2019s linear TV networks posted $6.63 billion in revenue for the period, down 7% from a year earlier.\n\nOverall, for the three-month period ended April 1, Disney reported net income of $1.49 billion, or 69 cents a share, compared with $597 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, per share earnings for the most recent period were 93 cents.\n\nRevenue for the quarter rose 13% year over year to $21.82 billion.\n\nA bright spot for Disney came from its parks, experiences and products divisions, which saw a 17% increase in revenue to $7.7 billion during the most recent quarter.\n\nAround $5.5 billion of that revenue came from its theme park locations. The company said guests spent more time and money during the quarter visiting its parks, hotels and cruises both domestically and internationally. Its cruise business, in particular, saw an increase in passenger cruise days.\n\nBeyond day-to-day operations at the company, shareholders and industry analysts expect Iger to address a number of ongoing challenges during Disney\u2019s earnings call Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday, Disney expanded its federal lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, accusing the Republican leader of doubling down on his \u201cretribution campaign\u201d against the company by signing legislation to void Disney\u2019s development deals in Orlando.\n\nAdditionally, the company is already seeing rippling effects from the writers strike, including the production shutdowns of Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cBlade,\u201d which was set to begin filming in Atlanta next month, as well as the Disney+ Star Wars series \u201cAndor.\u201d", "id": "13e2a65", "created_utc": 1683750644.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "i feel like a lot of people get these streaming services as a promo with their phone company. they end up getting it for free for x amount of time. on paper, these companies have loads of subscribers. am i crazy to think they do this to oscillate the stock? up down up down.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "That's me ... my amex platinum credit card reimburses up to $20 bucks a month for a bunch of streaming services....wouldn't have got the D+ bundle of it weren't for the refund.

{"title": "My lotto play for DIS's earnings tonight", "selftext": "Disney is reporting it's fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell. I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&P 500\u2019s +8%.\n\nHere are what analysts expect:\n\n* Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts\n\n* Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\n\n* Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)\n\nThey're expecting a drop in Disney\u2019s second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies. \n\nNotably, Disney easily surpassed its Q1 EPS expectations by 43% last quarter. The earnings beat was driven by a 21% YoY increase in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment revenue at $8.7 billion. This led to shares of DIS spiking more than 5% before cooling down and drifting lower in the following weeks. Certainly, more sustainability in Disney\u2019s price movement after reporting its Q2 results is at focus in hopes that this year\u2019s rally can be extended.\n\nBeyond day-to-day operations at the company, we're going to expect Bob Iger (CEO of Disney) to address a number ongoing challenges. On Monday, Disney expanded its [federal lawsuit](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/disney-sues-florida-gov-ron-desantis-alleges-political-effort-to-hurt-its-business.html) against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, accusing the Republican leader of doubling down on his \u201c[retribution campaign](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/disney-lawsuit-against-desantis-expanded.html)\u201d against the company by [signing legislation](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/desantis-signs-bill-to-void-disney-development-deals.html) to void Disney\u2019s development deals in Orlando.\n\nAdditionally, the company is already [seeing rippling effects from the ongoing writers strike](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/hollywood-writers-strike-halts-stranger-things-severance-production.html), including the production shutdowns of Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cBlade,\u201d which was set to begin filming in Atlanta next month, as well as the Disney+ Star Wars series \u201cAndor.\u201d\n\n**IGER & Cost Cutting**\n\nIn regard to Disney increasing its margins, Iger returned to the helm of the company last November with the initiative to reduce expenses and sustain growth and profitability.\n\nDuring its last quarterly report and Iger\u2019s first back as CEO, the Disney boss announced the company would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $5.5 billion. To the delight of investors, Iger stated the cost-cutting initiatives will make it possible for Disney\u2019s board to approve the reinstatement of its dividend by the end of the year. We expect a third wave of layoffs within the company announced soon.\n\n**Streaming Growth**\n\nLike streaming competitor Netflix (NFLX), Disney will no longer provide guidance for subscriber growth. With that being said, Disney\u2019s ability to add subscribers during the quarter will be at the forefront of its Q2 results.\n\nSpecifically, Wall Street is eyeing Disney+ after the streaming service lost 2.4 million subscribers during Q1 amid subscription price hikes and increasing competition from big-name tech stocks like AAPL, and AMZN. This was the firstly quarterly loss since Disney+ was launched in 2019. Still, a wider loss was expected among Disney+ subscribers last quarter with Disney topping estimates by 3%.\n\nDisney+ had 161.8 million paid subscribers during Q1 and 234.7 million total subscribers when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services. While Disney\u2019s total paid subscribers topped Netflix\u2019s 232.5 million paying members, the company\u2019s Direct to Consumer segment reported a -$1.1 billion loss during Q1 up from -$0.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nDisney stated the increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu although there were improved results at ESPN+. Direct to Consumer revenue did increase by 13% YoY during Q1 to $5.3 billion.  \n\nImprovement in operating costs among the Direct to Consumer segment will make Disney\u2019s stock much more attractive. Longer-term investors are hoping that Disney\u2019s growth among streaming services will eventually lead to massive earnings potential for the company.\n\n**Earnings Expected Move**\n\nLooking at the implied volatility of the options market in Disney, we can see the weekly expected move for the rest of the week is \u00b1$3.55 - about 3.5% of the stock\u2019s notional value. This is not too high of an expected move for an equity, but it is about 77% of the expected move through the June options cycle 39 days away from expiration, and over 50% of the expected move in the July options expiration cycle. Based on this information, the market is placing a lot of weight on Wednesday's earnings report, given the high implied volatility in the weekly cycle relative to further-dated cycles.\n\nWith DIS stock trading at $100.70 (at the time of writing this), we can go to equidistant out-of-the-money (OTM) strikes to see if there is a difference in premium, or skewed premium. Looking into the option chain, in this case, the calls is trading for a bit more than the puts, both 5 points OTM from the current stock price. This tells us that Disney\u2019s options market has call skew in the weekly cycle. This indicates that a high velocity move is being priced into the upside \u2013 this does not mean the stock is going to go up, but the market is pricing in the risk of a high velocity move to the upside just slightly.\n\n**What to do For Disney Earnings?**\n\nI looked through the last 5 years of movements with earnings, the stock moves on average 4 \u00b1 3% after the earnings report. With this said, it might not even be worth getting calls or puts because the premium prices are pricing a move that's very very similar to this percentage. However, given everything I've looked at, I want to get puts. DIS 5/12 99p is 2.03. However, I'll be inversing myself because of the WSB Cramer tag and will make big money with a call spread.
