The \"s\" at the end should be capitalized and stands for \"Securities.\" \"LEAP\" is not the singular of \"LEAPS\". To form the singular, modify put or call. So one LEAPS call, two LEAPS calls. This also avoids implying that LEAPS can only be calls.\n\n> For example, i'm looking at PACW call LEAPs expiring Jan 2025 at 15 strike. The ask is $1.70. How do I know i'm not overpaying?\n\nAny price above zero would be overpaying for PACW calls. We're still waiting for the other receivership shoe to drop on that bank. I've got puts on KRE that say PACW is going to go into receivership sometime this year.\n\nFor any call, LEAPS or not, it's the same process as for shares. How do you know that the current spot price of AAPL or NVDA or BAC is over or underpriced? You have to make some kind of informed forecast for the future price and evaluate either, shares or contracts, against that forecast.\n\nFor nearer term calls, which would rule out LEAPS, there is also an element of volatility. Some amount of volatility is priced into nearer term calls and that volatility can be over or under priced relative to eventual realized volatility, more-or-less independent from the share price forecast. So a forecast for near term volatility may also be needed.\n\nHere's an example of making a volatility forecast: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/13ptef9/expensive_options_case_study_tsm/\n\nIV Rank and IV Percentile are useful tools as well, just keep in mind that they are trailing 52-week averages.

Hence the terms - In the Money (ITM), At the Money (ATM), Out of the Money (OTM) etc.\n\nExtrinsic value is the measure of uncertainty surrounding the possible fluctuations of the Intrinsic value depending on the remaining days to expire. Hence, more days to expiry means more chances for the underlying stock price to go up or down. Thereby, higher price for that contract. So, as an Options contract nears expiry, the extrinsic value component lowers since not much time left to have price fluctuation in the underlying stock. And if the contract is already in OTM, then it'll be worthless on the expiration date.\n\nDid I get it right?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> The price of an Options contract (i.e., premium) at any given point in time has two components = Intrinsic value + Extrinsic value.\n\nCorrect. Further, either or both may be zero.\n\n> Intrinsic value is the measure of how much profitness that contract is sitting on at that point in time (based on the strike rate and the underlying stock price). \n\nClose. Profit is determined by the initial cost. If the cost is less than the total value of the contract, you have a profit. So just call intrinsic value the difference between the strike price and spot price, when that difference is a positive number. There's no word \"profitness\", btw. And \"strike price\", not \"strike rate\".\n\nIntrinsic value cannot be negative, so that means intrinsic value can only be calculated **for a call** when the strike price is equal to or less than the stock price. **For a put**, it is the opposite, intrinsic value can only be calculated when the strike price is equal to or greater than the stock price.\n\n> Hence the terms - In the Money (ITM), At the Money (ATM), Out of the Money (OTM) etc.\n\nITM also means intrinsic value is greater than zero.\n\n> Extrinsic value is the measure of uncertainty surrounding the possible fluctuations of the Intrinsic value depending on the remaining days to expire. \n\nNo, that misses the point. Extrinsic value is the **risk premium** that sellers demand to compensate them for the probability that they will have to honor the contract at a loss. Since that probability is a function of time, extrinsic value can also be called time value. The probability is also a function of volatility, btw. Which is why extrinsic value is sensitive to both time and volatility.\n\nVolatility captures the notion of \"uncertainty\" that you had in your definition.\n\n> So, as an Options contract nears expiry, the extrinsic value component lowers since not much time left to have price fluctuation in the underlying stock. \n\nThat is essentially correct, but that is not the only way extrinsic value goes to zero. Consider a call with 90 days to expiration. That's a lot of time, so from your statement, extrinsic value ought to be high. But what if the strike price is $50 and the stock price is $200, when the price range for the last 90 days was $150 to $250? In that scenario, the $50 strike is so deep ITM that there is close to a 100% chance that the contract has to be honored at expiration. In that case, when honoring the contract is practically a certainty, the seller can demand all the risk premium they want, but no buyer would be willing to pay. Therefore, the market forces the seller to offer the contract at parity (intrinsic value only, no extrinsic), if they want to sell contracts at all.\n\n> And if the contract is already in OTM, then it'll be worthless on the expiration date.\n\nIt may already be worthless. It depends on the volatility of the underlying.

Obviously, the shares part of a CC benefits if the price skyrockets, independent of the call, but the *net effect* can't be \"more profit\" in a skyrocket-4-months-into-8-month-hold, so I'm still confused. Particularly if the skyrocket timing would be after the holding time of the \"up to 60 DTE\" CC in comparison.

If they guess the next token incorrectly, the NN path is reduced in strength. As I mentioned, my knowledge isn't really focused on their creation but I have the general idea. It's more or less based on Shannon's \"guess the next word\" experiments in information theory, correct?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So there are a lot of rather similar terms and often their definitions are not very strict or change over time, so it is understandably unclear.\n\n**LLM** is mostly a definition of the *task* that a model is supposed to do - **language modeling** (and additionally being a '*large*' model), while an **RNN** is an *architecture*, how the model works.\n\nSo naturally there can be RNNs that are LLMs and RNNs that are not LLMs; and similarly LLMs that are RNNs and LLMs that use other archictures.\n\nLMs in particular mostly fall under the class of **sequence-to-sequence models**; and with that you could see how RNNs could also be used for other things - like stock-price movements.\n\nIn the \"early days\" of ML LMs (like 2018-2020), RNNs were still the best performing architectures. Nowadays **transformers** beat everything most of the time, and usually transformers is a different architecture from RNNs.\n\nI say mostly because RNNs are still at the top for some LM tasks (typically character-level) and there are works that combine the two - being both RNNs and transformers at the same time; those are mostly just research still and not leading.\n\nThough when people talk about LLMs, they tend to refer to more specific available models - like GPT3, PALM, GPT-J, etc. These are all transformers and are not RNNs. It is also a rather small class of rather similar models vs all of the different types of models that people have developed and made it to leaderboards etc. There are some reasons for that.\n\nSo I think what you are curious about is the difference between a transformer and RNN, and why being language modeling would not imply being an RNN necessarily.\n\nSo first you are right that language models typically work by taking some text, feeding in parts of it, predicting a continuation, and then correcting itself vs the actual continuation.\n\nThis type of training is specifically called **self-supervised learning**, and is used by both RNNs and transformers.\n\nThis is not the case for all models though. E.g. BERT masks random words in a text and then predict with having access to both text coming before and after. Which also means you could do things like having a story with a start and end, and then fill in the middle; or suggest individual words to replace to improve a text. This is also considered a type of language modeling, even though it is not just predicting the next token.\n\nAs you can imagine, this is something that RNNs rather struggles with and part of the reason why BERT could be so powerful for segment and classification texts.\n\nThe intuition for this is that an RNN only processes one token at a time, outputs some memory, generates the next token, rinse and repeat. This makes it difficult for it to deal with far dependencies because if something at the beginning of the text is useful, it needs to keep track of that in its memory and keep copying it for every token in the text in the hopes that it will become useful at some point.\n\nTransformers rather work by processing and predicting everything at once - all the tokens get fed in in parallel; go through a number of layers; and then have outputs for all of the tokens. Instead of one token feeding into another, each token instead produces values associated with 'keys' (vectors), and each next token in the next layer picks what values to use based on query vectors being similar to key vectors. That way each token can choose to have its values being influenced by any other token.\n\nSo e.g. if the text somewhere mentions a dog named Dexter, it can create a vector about that, and another token that is curious about whether the text is about a pet can see that vector being similar, and take and use that name. The tokens inbetween need to know nothing about this.\n\nSo the architecture is rather different.\n\nModels like GPT however are called **decoder-only** and they are trained only to predict the next token, one at a time, and hence are also **autoregressive language models**, which they share with but still are not RNNs.\n\nHope you find that useful/interesting!

But yea, that's a very powerful tool and a feature that caught my eye was how it operates in a very lateral way. I think I hadn't really connected the dots of how RNNs function and the nature of bi-directional context. Can't really do that with RNNs.

The difference is more in how previous words affect the next  - in the case of RNNs, a limited memory has to be passed along with each word, while for transformers, each word stores and looks up information associated with vectors.\n\nIt is fun to think about the architecture too but I mostly use and adapt pretrained models nowadays too.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6045348048210144}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6790270805358887}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6761218309402466}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6154791116714478}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.739098310470581}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.487823486328125}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6766891479492188}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6965546607971191}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6590388417243958}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.00640525110065937}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0015473945531994104}, {"body": "No - you're being clueless here and injecting your own assumptions.\n\nAI is a broader term that includes ML.\n\nAI even includes something as simple as pathfinding back in games from the early 2000's.\n\nThat something is AI or something is ML does not make it advanced in itself.\n\nWhat you seem to be thinking about is human-level artificial intelligence.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7483816146850586}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5021402835845947}, {"body": "Is Nvidia over promising what they can actually deliver in terms of AI?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "NVIDIA isn't really making any promises about delivering AI (at least not that I'm aware of).

I agree that there will be a pullback after the researchers and startups are done having their go.
