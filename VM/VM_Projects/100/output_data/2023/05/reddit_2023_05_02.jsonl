Personally, I use a combo of technical analysis, upcoming events that\u2019ll impact the market, and overall market vol to determine which side of the 0DTE play I want to make. Once I have an educated guess on the direction I **think** the market will take, I\u2019ll then select the appropriate strategy. \n\nMy personal checklist:\n\n1. Technical analysis - I use very simple chart studies to get a general sense on if the market is \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d. Feel free to investopedia how to read these, Bollinger bands, Commodity Channel Index, Relative strength index. \n2. Next, I like to use [ForexFactory](https://www.forexfactory.com) to see what economic events are happening that day/tomorrow. Might take a little getting used to reading the site, but red icons indicate high impact and clicking on the \u201cspecs\u201d icon gives you an easy to understand blurb about what\u2019s expected. \n3. Understand when to buy vs sell options. Time is always working against you as a buyer, so you need to make sure you\u2019re trading on a high vol day, otherwise you\u2019ll have to be nearly perfect on timing your entry to make money consistently. A normal day for the S&P 500 is about a 10-20 point movement (in either direction). I personally try and avoid buying on these days and prefer to sell CSEPs or spreads. For buying, I prefer to wait for ~25+ point swings in order to trade with the momentum. Makes timing your entry not as critical, but always understand why the market is moving before just jumping in. \n4. Most important: HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY! Even if your plan is to 5x your money, place the closing trade immediately after entering to avoid getting greedy and losing it all. Same goes for the downside. Know what you\u2019re comfortable risking and be disciplined when you inevitably lose a trade. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s just going to take practice and time to get good at anything.

The strike really has more to do with streaming residuals than it does with the ceo pay. Yes, there is a vast contrast between a CEO\u2019s pay and a writers. Let me be clear the writers are not underpaid. They are also trying to restructure their length of pay. (See attached contract) The negotiations are no where near close to coming to an agreement.\n\nLet me also mention SAG and DGA contracts are set to expire June 30th. Are the studios going to start handing out shows when there could be a potential second strike? Definitely not. This could be another 3-4 month strike which would cause lots of production workers to potentially lose their homes or leave the business entirely. Interesting correlation between writers strikes and economic crashes. Will buy some puts just in case.
