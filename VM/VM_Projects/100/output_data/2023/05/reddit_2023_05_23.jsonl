{"title": "The start of the next leg down or classic bear trap? 5-23-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Last week I said I was still bullish on SPY and that I did think we would see 430\u2026 I still feel that way and I think that we are seeing the pullback before the next move up playing out here perfectly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpnzrqlx7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfca3733ae3c70c56371aa01abb439fe086702ba\n\nBefore the bears absolutely took the bulls by the horn middle of day and plunged them off the cliff\u2026 I was targeting two major support areas on SPY and QQQ for tomorrow\u2026 while anyone who follows me know on a daily time frame my timing may not always be perfect (as I expected tomorrow) my levels almost always play out\u2026 Being that these levels played out a day early for me\u2026 I actually am expecting a bounce tomorrow\u2026 or by EOW minimally. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxa53g2y7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc175a508967bb1e0e0170789e8d9cac3cf3f834\n\nFrom a supply and demand standpoint we had a huge day\u2026 so we put in a new supply (resistance) at 418.78. This now makes this 418.78 to 419.5 a major supply and resistance area. In doing this we have no retraced all the way back down to take out 416.75, 415.58 and 413.91\u2026 we did fall just shy of touching 413.05 supply just under the daily 20ema though. \n\nTaking out the daily 8ema is a bearish omen for the markets, however, bouncing off the 20ema like we did today is bullish in nature. This should be seen as a support bounce rather than a bigger sell off for now. \n\nHowever, IF we continue to leg down tomorrow and close a candle under 413.05 supply which is the daily 20ema then I actually might be more apt for a that we see a retrace back to 410.2 demand (Support) before we bounce. This might be an example of being a day early for the bounce. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4anbi8ly7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=466405364f29c67c25a0ff347e51cc5fd4ebe747\n\nBears took us all the way down through the daily 8ema and bounced us right off that red support line at 413.7. As of now that should still be considered support until proven other wise. \n\nSupport for tomorrow of that line will be 414.6 meaning bulls need a small gap up overnight in order to reconfirm and hold that support with hopes of a push up to the 417/418 area. \n\nNow if this is the next leg down what bears need to do is break through 414.6 support and most importantly break under the daily 20ema and close a candle below it\u2026 If you remember we traded in that 410.2 to 413.9 range for almost 3 weeks before we finally broke out to 420\u2026 this actually is a back test of that support of that range. This is the bulls attempt to turn previous resistance into support.\n\nFailing to do that would result in a retrace back to the 410 range. To really sell this market off bears need a closure under 410.2. That 410.2 level is our daily demand so that likely would be a major support bounce area for bulls. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 413 -> 418.8  \n Demand- 410.2  \n Support- 414.1 -> 412.3 -> 410.2  \n Resistance- 417.1 -> 418.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/heeklg2z7n1b1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=519662e80b9ac77085a70549a277d18c51d37076\n\nNearly identical movement from futes today setting a new supply at 4208. In doing this we would have expected the move down to the 4149/4143 supply area. We did come down and perfectly bounced off 4153. As of right now that is major support to watch. \n\nThere is a chance overnight bears get this to 4149 to take out that supply but from here I expect a bounce off the daily 20ema. \n\nIf bears continue their sell off though the biggest support will come at the 4127 demand. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjx729hz7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=98ddaa876ef8a04e0de3dd79fbfda243054e28cc\n\nFutures did not quite breakdown and touch that red support line that SPY did today. However, Futures did come down and perfectly back test and bounce off 4153 support form the previous 4122 to 4153 channel. \n\nWe also are setting up to close exactly on the daily 20ema which would favor a possible double bottom support bounce and move back up. \n\nThe most probable play out here is a double bottom off 4158 that leads to a move back up to the 4172 to 4188 area. \n\nHowever, if bears manage to break this down further then support is at 4125 if we see back to back selling off happen. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4149 -> 4208  \n Demand- 4128 -> 4198  \n Support- 4158 -> 4125  \n Resistance- 4172 -> 4189\n\n**QQQ Supply and Demand DAILY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de7nq8zz7n1b1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=93498a1053eb6d526ab81b64a62d534b69d3b2fb\n\nI said last week I was looking for a possible sell off back to the daily 8ema being that QQQ is in extreme bull momentum in order to find an opportunity for a long entry. We are looking to be getting just that. \n\nThe daily officially turned 337.63 into a new supply\u2026 In doing so we come down and take out 337.29 and 333.11 supply. Now we do have another supply left down below at 326.82 but that is at the daily 20ema. That would be a larger sell off and with us being in extreme bull momentum I would be very surprised to see that move happen (not that it cant happen though). \n\nI will be looking for the bulls to bounce off the daily 8ema tomorrow and look for a run back to the 336.37 demand area. \n\nHowever, If this sell off continues then are most probable sell off target is that 326.82 supply which is also the daily 20ema. 325-326 is a pretty strong demand (Support) area that we would need more momentum to break through. \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  \n Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 324.99\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/elwg2ng08n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=80517c7a8dbc35e92590dba9b9a1062aef7261a3\n\nThe VIX actually had a really nice breakout today and after bouncing off the 16 support area 3 days ago now this is now retesting critical resistance at 18.86. IF the bears (spy) can close the VIX over 18.86 and target 20.08 then I would believe in a bigger sell off on SPY happening. However, this is a probable rejection area for the VIX. Even if the VIX gets to 20.08 we still honestly are more likely to reject then we are to sell off\u2026\n\nThere just isn\u2019t any real momentum to the downside and even watching the intraday movement today the dip continues to get bought. \n\nWith no debt ceiling talks till tomorrow minimum and FOMC minutes at 2pm we likely are to return to a slightly bullish narrative. There is a chance the market could bearishly take what JPOW had to say at FOMC but historically they usually receive FOMC minutes well not poorly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndrrkwv08n1b1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=654018e23491d451e942967ccbfa2222fd1a7a11\n\nYellen is scheduled to talk at 1005am though so that could be a true wildcard. Tomorrow with Yellen and FOMC minutes is likely to be very volatile. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5il29mb18n1b1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=908eb23f35c3077d87c6855c63ccab1292ea5aa2\n\nI really struggled this morning in that very tight range and chop\u2026 just seemed like premiums weren\u2019t paying out for the move that was happening. However, was really able to capitalize on that mid day sell off and overall had a great day trading. Intraday secured another weeks of profit goal. Currently even if my QQQ and SPY Call lottos go to zero tomorrow I have officially secured 2.5x my weekly profit goal\u2026 if they don\u2019t go to zero tomorrow then im sitting at 3x weekly profits goal. \n\nCurrently assuming my week ends profitable this will be my 8th green week in a row\u2026 that makes it tied for my second longest win streak in a row\u2026 my longest current win streak (since I have started documenting the way I do now\u2026 remember I used to work full time as a nurse and just traded in my off times) is 10 weeks in a row of green. \n\nJust for transparency my longest red streak is 4 weeks in a row.", "id": "13q06ys", "created_utc": 1684874713.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR SPY to 0", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24701885879039764}, {"body": "Bear trap.

In late August 2021, 14 unfinished apartment buildings were demolished in Kunming, Yunnan Province.\n\nThe developer had run into financial difficulties and abandoned construction. After the buildings went unattended for seven years, it was decided that they should be demolished out of safety concerns. In less than a minute, they collapsed into piles of rubble. It was an unsatisfying end for the massive project.\n\nChina's real estate market has been rocked by the kind of problems facing China Evergrande Group. President Xi Jinping, who has hailed the nation internationally as \"Great China,\" is slowly and quietly starting to act in order to save face. One of the main tasks is dealing with the empty developments known as \"ghost towns.\"\n\nBut some worry that these developments are just the tip of the iceberg. Data clearly show anomalies in the Chinese real estate market.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.  Ghost cities have long been debunked since they were completely misunderstood a decade ago.  Since then, none of the reported ghost cities have remained empty, though new developments are still being built prior to being occupied.  \n\nThere's this thing called \"planning\".  In this case, China builds developments for huge numbers of people and doesn't move anybody in until the construction is completed.  This allows them to set and enforce standards for power, communications and other utilities so that those things aren't being slap-dashed together later.  It's cleaner, less risky and more efficient.  If you've ever been anywhere in Thailand, you would see exactly the problem with not planning anytime you look at any utility pole in the whole fucking country.  It's a nightmare.\n\nMy job in the US is to literally go around the country and unfuck the utility issues that have sprung up around not properly planning communities.  The US power grid is plagued with radial lines and all manner of line tapped distribution networks that can't sectionalize at all.  Chinese developments are avoiding all of these issues and many others including insufficient sewer systems, water systems, drainage, grading, and so on.\n\nYou are just repeating bullshit that has long been debunked.  And the article you quoted makes not only the same mistake, but commits a new one.\n\n14 buildings in an already established tier 2 (read: major) city in China is not and could not be a \"ghost city\".  It's a development within an already existing major city.  You, as a clearly overly sinophobic westerner who'll buy anything negative about China, grab the phrase \"ghost city\" and run with it, because confirmation bias.  \n\nOn to the meat of it, this development ran out of money a decade ago.  It has sat unfinished at some intermediate phase of construction for 10 years.  It's a safety hazard.  Nobody has come along to finish it and the company that started it was unable to get the capital required to complete the work.  The decision to demolish it was made lucidly and with the laudable reason of public safety.  Why you can't accept that and instead need to fabricate some bullshit that they are padding GDP is fucking ridiculous and someone needs to say that to you.  China doesn't need to pad its GDP.  It's already accepted by every economist in the world as the greatest economic miracle in the history of mankind.  But your position is that somehow, 14 decade old buildings in Kunming are the proof of some widespread conspiracy.  K.\n\nChin enjoys a nearly 900 billion dollar per year trade surplus.  They have the most modern cities in the world.  They have the largest educated population in the world and graduate an educated workforce equal to the entire US educated workforce every 4 years.  They lead in 37 of 44 critical emerging technologies.  They have so much pull around the world that even the mighty US cannot do anything but talk shit and then walk it back.  Even as China puts together a system that undermines the hegemony of the dollar, the US must sit back and let it happen, because real economic power resides in the east now.  Get used to it.
