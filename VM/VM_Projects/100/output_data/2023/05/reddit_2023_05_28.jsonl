Every year that goes by, they lose another advantage, and each time they retake the lead, it's a hollow victory, and AMD simply retakes it faster every year.\n\nIntels' last HEDT launch was not only an embarrassment for the most part, Threadripper and Zen made it look downright stupid to consider. Intel hasn't bothered to compete in that sphere since.\n\nCurrently, they have absolutely nothing for EPYC and nothing worth mentioning in the forseeable future. AMD is taking datacenter marketshare from them at will. Once a business switches to a brand, they are very resistant to switching back. If Intel came out with a winner next year, you probably wouldn't see much traction for another 5 years. So for the next several years, it's pretty much a garuntee Intel is going to lose most of their datacenter customers.\n\nIn the desktop space, Zen5 delivers Raptor Lake performance and/or better at nearly half the wattage. If you're a gamer, AMD is the clear choice(5800X3D, 7800X3D). If you're concerned about power, heat, efficiency, etc, AMD. If you're workload oriented, it's still essentially AMD outside of a few special case scenarios(7900X, 7950X). If you game and perform workloads, AMD(7950X3D). AM5 will support another 3+ generations of cpus. With Intel, you will need a new socket, which means additional cost. AM4's longevity gained a lot of fans, AM5 will be similar and thus an aspect many will keep in mind before choosing a 1-2 generational socket from Intel. \n\nGPU wise, their high-end ARC cards are struggling to compete with entry-level AMD and Nvidia GPUs from 2-3 years ago. They are also plagued with driver issues. There are rumors of them leaving the GPU space as well.\n\nIntel has been failing to deliver on roadmaps and promises since 2016. Their margins have been shrinking, their node advantage lost, their forward guidance and roadmaps questionable, their ability to compete in the emerging AI market in doubt, etc. Meanwhile, AMD has been consistently overdelivering on promises since 2017. CEO confidence with AMD is sky high while a lot of doubt has been surrounding Intel CEOs as of late, and for good reason. \n\nI bought into AMD back when they hired Jim Keller because I could see the handwriting on the wall.

They cut tons of jobs, are getting out of and selling parts of their business, and have changed employee compensation which will hurt them talent wise. \n\nAmd has had some hiccups occasionally but more importantly their CPU\u2019s are just legitimately competitive and Intel can\u2019t price their chips with insane numbers anymore so they have to price them a lot lower. This is an issue really every where for Intel where to get their products sold they have had to take substantial hits on margins.  \n\nThe other thing is chiplet design on most of AMD\u2019s products means that it\u2019s much cheaper and more efficient for them to make working CPU\u2019s making prices easier to slim down on, making margins lower for Intel if they want to stay competitive. \n\nOther than MobileEye Intel really isn\u2019t doing fantastic anywhere. The only place where it\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d is with Laptop sales and when you own 75% of the x86 laptop market it\u2019s a lot easier to lose marketshare then to gain headway. Not to mention possible consumer headwinds. \n\nIFS ~ Intel Foundry Services is down 24% compared to Q1 of last year and made only 118 million dollars on revenue. I know they have defense contracts for chips when they build their new foundries but that\u2019s gonna be a while. Additionally they are what 3rd possibly even 4th place in this market. What happens when these foundries are completed ? Unless a massive discount is offered they are going to lose tons of money. \n\nThen there is the issue of roadmaps and execution. Intel has cancelled tons of products that companies were looking forward to. And a lot of companies are questioning whether said products that are being promised now are ever gonna come out. This is a really bad thing because it makes it easier for companies to make a switch. Additionally if not cancellations, extremely long delays like the delays of Sapphire Rapids. \n\nThis brings me to the last issue and probably the second biggest not named IFS. AMD is looked at better in the AI sphere because of how strong their Datacenter/AI/Cloud chips perform and roadmap. AMD has a full product stack for every type of need and their performance is far better that what Intel is putting out in 90% of use cases. Intel is hemorrhaging market share here and it\u2019s not gonna stop, it\u2019s just gonna accelerate. Down 39% since Q1 of last year to 3.7 billion.
