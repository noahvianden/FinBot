{"title": "Shopify beats Earnings but will abandon logistics expansion and layoff 20%", "selftext": "May 4 (Reuters) - Canada's Shopify Inc (SHOP.TO), said on Thursday it would let go 20% of its workforce in a second round of layoffs and sold its logistics arm to freight forwarder Flexport, sending its U.S.-listed shares up 16% in premarket trading.\n\nThe company also reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter, as more merchants used its online tools and targeting services to attract customers tackling high inflation.\n\nA host of new tools have encouraged more businesses from Mattel (MAT.O) to Coty (COTY.N) to join the platform, allowing the company to hike its subscription fees.\n\nKnown as the e-commerce platform for small businesses, Shopify had ramped up its order fulfillment network, when it expected the pandemic-led e-commerce boom to persist. But by mid-2022, it said it had over overestimated growth levels and laid off 10% of its workforce in July.\n\nAs the e-commerce boom brought by the global pandemic subsides, Shopify's spending in the fulfillment network has been more closely scrutinized by investors who worry the capital-intensive project could weigh on earnings.\n\nThe sale of the logistics unit Deliverr Inc, a company it acquired for $2.1 billion less than a year ago, was done in an all-stock deal that will give Shopify a 13% stake in Flexport - a startup in which it has made a previous investment.\n\nRevenue was $1.51 billion in the quarter ended March 31, topping analysts' estimates of $1.43 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe company also posted a surprise adjusted profit of 1 cent per share, compared with expectations for a 4 cent loss.", "id": "137ivsm", "created_utc": 1683202652.0, "score": 662, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 173, "comments": [{"body": "\"Beats earnings\", \"announces layoffs\" - 2023 in a nutshell.", "score": 936, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cWe\u2019re doing great, but these pesky employees are weighing us down\u201d", "score": 363, "replies": [{"body": "employees are our most valuable assets tahts why we cant afford them anymore.", "score": 44, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5749862790107727}, {"body": "Can\u2019t think of a tech company that isn\u2019t over staffed.

Without your consent. They still do it today btw.\n\nI'm not negating that it was revolutionary. Just that it wasn't revolutionary in the sense you think it is.

Even today most people think of Google as a search company, when it fact it's been an advertising company since 2000.\n\nHere's a quote from Sergey Brin but you can find more of this stuff if you look for it.

I had an Internet start-up\u2014so did everybody else. It was unprofitable, like everybody else\u2019s, and how hard is that? But when we became profitable, I felt like we had built a real business.\u201d Best of all was that Google, against all odds, was making that profit without surrendering its ideals. \u201cDo you know the most common feedback, honestly?\u201d Brin asked. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018What ads\u2019?  People either haven\u2019t done searches that bring them up or haven\u2019t noticed them. Or the third possibility is that they brought up the ads and they did notice them and they forgot about them, which I think is the most likely scenario.\u201d \n>\n> (This would track with an experiment that Google repeated regularly\u2014the \u201cno ads\u201d test that compared users who saw ads with those served results pages free of sponsored links. Every time the test was run, the outcome was similar: dropping ads did not increase searching. More often than not, the users in the control group who continued to see ads searched more than those with ad-free pages. Google\u2019s relieved conclusion: its ads made people happy.) From that point on, Brin and Page saw nothing but glory in the bottom line. Google was profitable, and its hiding strategy was successfully masking the extent of its success. Its name was synonymous with search. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s famous tech critic Walt Mossberg called it \u201cthe most useful site on the World Wide Web.\u201d Everyone was asking the founders when they would have an IPO, but \u201cit\u2019s not an issue for us,\u201d Page said in 2002. \u201cEvery month we make more money than the last one.\u201d", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6965310573577881}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6513108015060425}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6008805632591248}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6949511170387268}, {"body": "All of them do eff all realistically is what the poster was implying.
