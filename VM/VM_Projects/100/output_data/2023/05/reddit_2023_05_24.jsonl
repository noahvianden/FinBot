Lately, I've been seeing a bunch of newer people on here actively correcting people and acting like \"being short\" can only mean \"short selling equities\" - which is kind of hilarious to me because this sub has totally become the blind leading the blind. Guessing someone just looked up the definition of short selling without understanding the macro concept and now a bunch of people are just regurgitating it.\n\nIf having a short position just meant something was sold short, the term would have no directional meaning without also specifying the instrument that was sold short. This just adds a bunch of unnecessary confusion when you're trying to distill the concepts behind more complicated trades. When people in the industry use short/long, they are generally using them to describe the overall direction of the trade. If they want to get into the specifics more they will use long/short in tantum with the investment instruments used. If an investor says \"they're short (asset x)\" without classifying the instrument, they mean the trade will make money as x's price decreases. Likewise, when they say \"they're long (asset x)\" they will make money as x's price increases.
