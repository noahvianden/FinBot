{"title": "Fed Chair Powell says rates may not have to rise as much as expected to curb inflation", "selftext": "The probability of a pause in rate hikes increased dramatically from 62% to higher than 86% in futures after an interview with Jerome Powell in which he stated that rates may not have to rise as much as expected.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/19/fed-chair-powell-says-rates-may-not-have-to-rise-as-much-as-expected-to-curb-inflation.html\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that stresses in the banking sector could mean that interest rates won\u2019t have to be as high to control inflation.\n\nSpeaking at a monetary conference in Washington, D.C., the central bank leader noted that Fed initiatives used to deal with problems at mid-sized banks have mostly halted worst-case scenarios from transpiring.\n\nBut he noted that the problems at Silicon Valley Bank and others could still reverberate through the economy.\n\n\u201cThe financial stability tools helped to calm conditions in the banking sector. Developments there, on the other hand, are contributing to tighter credit conditions and are likely to weigh on economic growth, hiring and inflation,\u201d he said as part of a panel on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cSo as a result, our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course, the extent of that is highly uncertain.\u201d\n\nPowell spoke with markets mostly expecting the Fed at its June meeting to take a break from the series of rate hikes it began in March 2022. However, pricing has been volatile as Fed officials weigh the impact that policy has had and will have on inflation that in the summer of last year was running at a 41-year high.\n\nOn balance, Powell said inflation is still too high.\n\n\u201cMany people are currently experiencing high inflation, for the first time in their lives. It\u2019s not a headline to say that they really don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said during a forum that also featured former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.\n\n\u201cWe think that failure to get inflation down would, would not only prolong the pain but also increase ultimately the social costs of getting back to price stability, causing even greater harm to families and businesses, and we aim to avoid that by remaining steadfast in pursuit of our goals,\u201d he added.\n\nPowell characterized current Fed policy as \u201crestrictive\u201d and said future decisions would be data-dependent as opposed to being a preset course. The Federal Open Market Committee has raised its benchmark borrowing rate to a target of 5%-5.25% from near zero where it had sat since the early days of the Covid pandemic.\n\nOfficials have stressed that rate hikes operate with a lag of a year or more, so the policy moves have not completely circulated through the economy.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions about the extent to which additional policy funding will be appropriate. But given how far we\u2019ve come, as I noted, we can afford to look at the data and the evolving outlook,\u201d Powell said.\n\nMonetary policy in large part has been geared toward cooling a hot labor market in which the current 3.4% unemployment rate is tied for the lowest level since 1953. Inflation by the Fed\u2019s preferred measure is running at 4.6%, well above the 2% long-range goal.\n\nEconomists, including those at the Fed itself, have long been predicting that the rate hikes would pull the economy into at least a shallow recession, likely later this year. GDP grew at a less-than-expected 1.1% annualized pace in the first quarter but is on track to accelerate by 2.9% in the second quarter, according to an Atlanta Fed tracker.\n\nPowell spoke the same day that the New York Fed released research showing that the long-range neutral interest rate \u2014 one that is neither restrictive nor stimulative \u2014 is essentially unchanged at very low levels, despite the pandemic-era inflation surge.\n\n\u201cImportantly, there is no evidence that the era of very low natural rates of interest has ended,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams said in prepared remarks.", "id": "13m2gh0", "created_utc": 1684518207.0, "score": 685, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen.

Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide.  Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates.

Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird\u2019s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen.

There, bullishness danced with the fairies of conviction, crafting silhouettes of hummingbirds in the fluidity of thoughts, or were they ideas? No, no, they were walrus-riding unicorns, but I digress.\n\nOne might ask, where does the pickle jar fit into this narrative? Oh, it's a vessel, you see. A vessel brimming with the liquid bullishness, as pungent as a hedge fund manager's tie on a bullish market day. This was a market not of stocks, bonds, or even Bitcoin, but of dreams, color-coded by the frequency of their consciousness waves. \n\nOnce, there was an avocado. Green and plump, as avocados often are, yet its heart yearned for bullishness. But you see, the avocado was trapped in a field of consciousness, a paradoxical meadow of half-formed thoughts and unfinished Sudoku puzzles. It dreamed, oh it dreamed, of bullfights and bullish markets, of bullish terriers chasing frisbees in the park.\n\nThe clock struck thirteen, a highly unusual occurrence unless you're in the grips of a Salvador Dali painting. Then suddenly, bullishness erupted. It had the face of a walrus but the agility of a hummingbird. Iridescent in its glee, it ran, nay, it pranced across the vast expanse of the consciousness field, leaving footprints that smelt oddly of daisies and newly minted coins.\n\nThe azure tree, or was it chartreuse, winked from the corner, its leaves aflutter with the rhythm of consciousness. It whispered tales of bullish market runs and meandering consciousness streams. Tales from when the sun was but a blushing maiden, and the moon, a cheeky lad.\n\nAmid this swirl of consciousness and bullishness, our avocado, our humble, green friend found its calling. It became the first avocado to run a hedge fund, dealing in stocks of dreams and futures of imagination. Yet, despite its newfound bullishness, it would always remember the sweet, serene chaos of the consciousness field.\n\nSo, in this land of unfettered dreams, where consciousness and bullishness frolic under the crimson sun, the narrative continues to meander. A symphony of words that tumbles like a giggling brook, full of mirth and absolute, unequivocal incoherence. But isn't that life? A nonsensical narrative of consciousness fueled by the bullishness of existence? Or maybe, just maybe, it's all about the avocado.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5614113807678223}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24576668441295624}, {"body": "Your favourite movie is **Fight Club** \n\nAmirite ?", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Damn right", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Can\u2019t get enough of them meatloafs tits i see", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "*His name was Robert Paulson*", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.019596662372350693}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1856408417224884}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22903460264205933}, {"body": "First rule of Fight Club is:\n\nYou don't talk about Fight Club.....", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6226160526275635}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11790750175714493}, {"body": "Listen\n\nI am the center of the universe \n\nThe literal main character \n\nEnough out of you and this trash", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.025155572220683098}, {"body": "Remember this post next time y\u2019all decide to make any money decisions based on what this sub says lol", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2866353392601013}, {"body": "I cant believe that WSB commenters are missing that this is classic copypasta", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14078229665756226}, {"body": "My kind of technical ANALysis.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33606311678886414}, {"body": "I shorted Amazon when they had 2% sales growth in a 5% inflation environment with rapidly declining rate of growth in their only profitable AWS segment.  \n\nObviously I like losing money because we all know tat revenue declines and slowing growth is bullish for growth stocks with huge PEs\u2026", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "EVERYTHING IS FUCKING BULLISH YOU DUMB FUCKING CLOWNS, spy going to 694.20 by EOY, there is no fucking recession and if there was it's already fucking priced in, your shorts are going to get fucked and I WILL BE DELIVERING SAID FUCKING, I AM THE FUCKING BULL MARKET, dont fight it, dont FIGHT ME, stonks only go up AND there is nothing you can do about it you silly gae bers![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Bone marrow is delicious your a simp", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03045717440545559}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4274)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.024866340681910515}, {"body": " \n\n# \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Mad real bad, because doomer prophecies aren't coming true and they can say \"Sure I barley passed high school!

I want 5k in one dollar bills\n\nTeller: oka great. Let me just confirm you are a custodian on the account so we can get the withdrawal processed from your sisters account.
