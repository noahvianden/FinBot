{"title": "VIX options strategy", "selftext": "Hi all\n\nJust want to run my VIX options strategy by the option experts.\n\nSo - I did some stats and found out that 80% of the time the VIX has been between 14 and 25 (over the time span that the VIX is available).\n\nSo, if I sell cash secured calls with strikes = 25 and cash secured puts = 14 (if available), I have a 80% chance to close the deal in my favor.\n\nSo, what is with the risks:\n\n* Spike crash (happens from time to time) --> VIX can go up to almost 90\n* Regular crash (we all know) - VIX will be between 25-40 for 2-3 months\n* Period with Vola > 25 of > 3 months --> happened from 2008-2009\n* Periods with Vola < 14\n\nHow to hedge:\n\n*  In any case a bear call hedge, i.e. selling a call at Strike = 25 and buying a call at 50, which will leave me with a risk of 25 --> so I need $2500 per trade in cash to be called cash secured, i.e. with a portfolio of 100k I could open 40 positions of that risk profile\n* I am experimenting with additional hedging like Long Calls/ Puts on the UVXY but this would be the topic of a different threat. \n\nMy experience so far (over a few months)\n\n* The difficulty of cause is if you need to roll in case your Short Call is ITM. However, this can be done w/o too much of a loss.\n* Annual win rate is 20-35% p.a.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nWhat additional risks do you see?

However, on the other 20% of the time that it is above 25, there is quite a large range where VIX can be between 30-40 and in some cases, greater than 60. If you sell the 25 strike and buy the 50 strike for peace of mind, one of the problems you will encounter is the large delta disparity between the two. The potential problem this would create is if the VIX does rise to say 35, the short call would increase way more than your longs would increase. This means that if you have to close it out, you would have to buy back for much more because the short 25 call would be deep ITM, while  your long 50 call would still be OTM if the VIX is at 35.  All of a sudden, it would cost you 3.00 to 4.00 to close out something you sold for 0.40 wiping out several months worth of gains. This can happen all across the different strikes so even if you stagger into different months, you would still suffer a large drawdown. In fact, the the options with more DTEs (further out) would be affected more since they are more sensitive to Vega. If you are selling credit spreads, you are short Vega. A rapid rise in the VIX and those positions would get destroyed because volatility would increase.  Another thing to consider is the theta. The position is originally theta positive if the VIX stays below a certain level.  If the VIX\ndoes rise to 35, the theta could shift to negative because that\u2019s the nature of spreads. As the underlying goes through your short strike and closer to your longs, the theta could swing from positive to negative.  You now have a situation in your hands.  Do you close out now that the VIX is at 35 and take a loss or do you wait and hope for a retracement.  If you wait, the VIX can continue to rise which would compound your loss and put you deeper in the red.  In addition, you now have theta working against you (40 contacts would have a large negative theta) and you will lose money in each passing day.  Your $100k account could easily\nbe down $15-25k even on a non-black swan event.  If a black swan event were to occur like Covid, the VIX could very well go through your longs and you could be 50-60% in the red and your delta could be at -700 (negative) or higher.  This means a 1 point rise in VIX underlying (from 50 to 51 for example) and your position would be down $700. A 10 point rise (from 50 to 60) and you\u2019re down another $7k.
