The headline CPI is 3.2% up YoY while core CPI (excludes energy and food) is up 4.0% YoY. Both beating market expectations and this means JPOW has shut the Fu\\*king Door on Inflation right?

The US CPI uses a flawed method to calculate the cost of healthcare insurance. Most reasonable regards will use the health premiums that you pay monthly or biweekly. BUT not the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)! Because if you use that, according to this article, premiums went up about 7% YoY based on Kaiser. [https://www.marketplace.org/2023/11/13/how-are-health-insurance-costs-reflected-in-inflation-calculations/](https://www.marketplace.org/2023/11/13/how-are-health-insurance-costs-reflected-in-inflation-calculations/)\n\nBLS uses an incompetent, idiotic method which doesn\u2019t track the paid health coverage premiums at all\u2026WTF\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WTF](https://preview.redd.it/j7mu3p8vol0c1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=63177d2fe39bcb21aec054befaedea6ef46e7a96)\n\nSo if I pay $24,000 annual premiums but I am healthy and don't need any service then my healthcare cost is $24,000. But if I am an older boomer who uses $10,000 of hospital services, then I \u201conly\u201d pay $14,000 in healthcare costs. Note in this example, the premiums remain the same. Using these dumb@ss methods, BLS claimed that they overestimated healthcare costs by 37% during the pandemic when everything was shut down. No one could use any healthcare services! And that they need to subtract 4% from the healthcare cost every month from September 2022 to September 2023 to smooth out the calculation.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BS](https://preview.redd.it/rrlet6m0pl0c1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76b0f0d45a054de1cc6c11aab663aa3a65802c6)\n\n \n\nObviously, this is BS and the charts from wolfstreet.com show this manipulation.

As do I, but specifically because China would never let NIO go bankrupt \ud83d\ude06 \n\nHello, this is Bing. Thank you for your question. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThis is a very interesting topic to discuss, as both NIO and RIVN are competing in the fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) market. However, they have different strengths and weaknesses, and face different challenges and opportunities.\n\nNIO is a Chinese EV company that has been operating since 2014. It mainly focuses on the premium segment of the market, offering SUVs and sedans with advanced technology and design. NIO also provides innovative services to its customers, such as battery swapping, mobile charging, and autonomous driving. NIO has a strong presence in China, the largest EV market in the world, and has recently expanded to Europe. NIO has delivered more than 300,000 vehicles as of October 2023, and has a loyal and engaged customer base. NIO's revenue in 2022 was 49.3 billion yuan (US$7.1 billion), up 36% from 2021. NIO's net loss in 2022 was 14.6 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion), down 37% from 2021. NIO's market cap as of November 2023 is 11 billion US dollars\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3.\n\nRIVN is a US EV company that was founded in 2009. It specializes in producing electric pickup trucks and SUVs, as well as electric delivery vans for Amazon. RIVN aims to appeal to adventurous and eco-conscious consumers who value performance, utility, and sustainability. RIVN has a state-of-the-art factory in Illinois, and has secured partnerships with Amazon, Ford, and Cox Automotive. RIVN started delivering its vehicles in September 2023, and has received more than 100,000 pre-orders for its products. RIVN's revenue in 2022 was 1.1 billion US dollars, up from zero in 2021. RIVN's net loss in 2022 was 2.8 billion US dollars, up 75% from 2021. RIVN's market cap as of November 2023 is 16 billion US dollars\u2074\u2075\u2076.\n\nBased on these facts, it is hard to say which company will go bankrupt first, as they both have their advantages and disadvantages. However, some possible factors that could affect their future prospects are:\n\n- The EV market is growing rapidly, but also becoming more competitive and diverse. Both NIO and RIVN will have to face increasing pressure from established automakers, such as Tesla, Volkswagen, Toyota, and Hyundai, as well as new entrants, such as Lucid, Polestar, and XPeng. They will have to differentiate themselves by offering superior products, services, and customer experiences, as well as maintaining cost efficiency and profitability.\n\n- The EV market is also influenced by various external factors, such as government policies, consumer preferences, environmental issues, and technological innovations. Both NIO and RIVN will have to adapt to changing regulations, incentives, standards, and expectations in different regions and markets. They will also have to invest in research and development, innovation, and quality improvement, as well as address potential challenges, such as battery supply, charging infrastructure, safety, and cybersecurity.\n\n- The EV market is also subject to uncertainty and volatility, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic and social impacts. Both NIO and RIVN will have to cope with potential disruptions, such as supply chain issues, production delays, demand fluctuations, and customer retention. They will also have to manage their cash flow, debt, and liquidity, as well as their investor and stakeholder relations.\n\nIn conclusion, both NIO and RIVN are ambitious and promising EV companies, but they also face significant risks and uncertainties. It is difficult to predict which one will go bankrupt first, as it depends on many factors and scenarios.\n\nHowever, based on their current financial performance and market position, I would say that RIVN has a higher chance of going bankrupt first, as it has a higher net loss, a lower revenue, and a lower delivery volume than NIO. RIVN also has a higher valuation than NIO, which could make it more vulnerable to market corrections and investor sentiment. However, this is just my opinion, and I could be wrong. I hope you found this answer helpful and informative. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 11/16/2023\n\n(1) Quarterly Results | NIO Inc.. https://ir.nio.com/financials/quarterly-results.\n\n(2) NIO Inc.

I dont think they are going into the red because of it either, that means their margins were huge.  \n\n>\\- Price of electricity is currently quite supressed, if all electric the power needed would be more than double, imagine the elecrticity power reaction to that.\n\nWhy do you say that price of electricity is supressed?  I am pretty sure it is at market prices.  We can absorb a huge increase in power usage without having to build up infrastructure because most will be charging at night when power usage is lowest.  Power companies have to build out for peak usage and then all their generators sit idle overnight.  If you balance the load you make money 24 hours a day instead of 12-16.  This is a huge boon for power companies. As long as they have time to prepare for the increase it is not a problem for them and would not increase prices significantly.\n\n>\\- It\u00b4s yet to be seen that they\u00b4re better for the environment overall, particularly if electricity to power them isn\u00b4t.\n\nThere are many studies that show that they are much better for the environment especial wrt C02 emissions.  there is a small up front increase but over the life of the vehicle it is not even close.  This is true even if you were to use coal to power them, simply because large power plants can approach 60% efficiency while an Ice car struggles to beat 30%.  That said most places have at least some nuclear and renewables as part of the mix which means zero co2 emissions and an even lower overall impact.  Even more importantly as the grid gets greener the whole transportation sector gets greener without any further intervention.\n\n>\\- Maintenance being low is actually a hughe problem for the long term business model.\n\nfor the dealerships yes, the sooner they go away the better\n\n>\\- It\u00b4s not so clear that maintenance is actually lower, we\u00b4ll have to wait a bit:[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html)\n\nrepair costs and planned maintenance are two very different things\n\n>I mean, they might take over, I\u00b4m not a fundamentalist either way, it\u00b4s just not totally clear to me yet..\n\nI thought the EV was going to be difficult to live with and I would have anxiety all the time, I was surprised how easy it was to get into the habit of always charging at home and how annoying going to a gas station is now (with my second car).
