I realize everyone's valuation models are a little different.\n\nI have a couple ways of doing it, but the simplest to explain for filtering supremely overvalued stocks is this. I basically ask the question: could this company deliver more distributable cashflow to me as a shareholder over the next 10 years than a bond of similar safety.\n\nSo, let's say we're looking at MSFT. I would compare to 10+ year A-rated corporate bonds (roughly 5.5% right now) or Treasury bonds (4.6% right now). I take 75% of MSFT earnings yield (no company can distribute 100% of earnings yield, and even 75% is very high that would pretty much eliminate growth), and then I check to see what type of annual earnings growth would have to be achieved in order for my equity portfolio to equal the portfolio growth of the bond portfolio. Right now, MSFT has an earnings yield of 2.8%. So, starting year one as though we were actually getting 75% of this (2.1%), I then see how much annual growth we would have to achieve to equal roughly 5.5% from bonds. In this particular example, we would need 20% growth annualized over 10 years for our MSFT account to equal A-rated corporate bonds. 15% growth would equal a bond portfolio of roughly 4.3% over the next 10 years.\n\nThe interpretation is this: MSFT would have to distribute 75% of their earnings as dividends (they presently distribute 25%) AND grow their earnings at 20% per year in order for us to receive the same cashflow as A-rated corporate bonds over the next 10 years. If we add in the fact that MSFT stock could lose valuation, whereby those holding the stock could have capital losses, I just don't see the bullish argument in support of MSFT stock right now.\n\nI have several other techniques to value a company, but the conclusion is the same.

The non-stop pumping and V shape recoveries. How can that possibly ever go away? Convince me how this can change when every single dip is free money. The longer that time goes on the more risk free the market becomes. It becomes insanely impossible for this to have even the smallest pullback and then that gets instantly wiped out with a V shape recovery.
