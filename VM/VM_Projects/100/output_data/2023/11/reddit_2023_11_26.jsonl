{"title": "AI is going to kill the Tech Industry", "selftext": "It\u2019s a story old as time. A new technology hits the world, people want to be part of the new revolution and be the best with the new shiny object. \n\nEventually there are too many companies supplying the product and demand focuses on a handful of companies leading to a large fallout in companies values.\n\nRailroad boom and western expansion\n\nFirst Auto boom\n\nTech bubble in 2000s\n\nCrypto \n\nAnd now it\u2019s in the name of AI.\n\nThe power and potential of AI is as beautiful as it is terrifying.

You won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do. And depending on how much information you choose to share with it, the software will be able to respond personally because it will have a rich understanding of your life.](https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents)\n\nWhile not fully developed yet, as the technology evolves it has the promise to be able to develop whatever you want and connect to whatever you have. If you\u2019re a shareholder of many tech companies this should scare the shit out of you as sea changes lead to the potential for higher churn.\n\nThat company you own because there are millions of subscribers that has tailored versions of its product for many industries is about to look pretty antiquated. Have the AI study all the notes in your business and make a tailored CRM with all the best practices for efficient data entry and connect it with my Email. \n\nOhh remake my email to be more simple and add tools to make me better at sales. Having difficulty making that tool? No problem go to the AI App Store and subscribe to the best email add-in for sales.\n\nAs technology has evolved we have seen basically winner take most markets. Do you really want the 4th ranked GPS on your phone? How about the 3rd best Language Model?\n\nMany companies are creating and launching Language Models right now but as they expand I would assume only a few true leaders will emerge. Will niches develop? Maybe, but remember you can also just upload data to the mainstream ones to give it expertise in what you want quick and efficient knowledge on.\n\nI\u2019d be worried about any tech companies that are \u201cfeatures of AI\u201d not \u201cplatforms of AI tools.\u201d A feature would be \u201cwe have the best mousetrap\u201d a platform is \u201cwe have the best tools to create your mousetrap\u201d and/or \u201cchoose from the highest reviewed mousetraps on our AI store\u201d\n\nEven if you disagree with me on the future of tech, we probably agree that the ability to produce new features and products is now extremely fast for large companies and basic tech start ups given output of these models. This means that the supply of code should increase over time which means more tech companies and competition. This is not good for growth and pricing as more hands try to grab their piece of the admittedly growing market pie.\n\nThe AI platforms leaders as I see it are: OpenAI, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, ADBE\n\nPotential Platforms:\nSalesforce (CRM) with their EinsteinAI application and App Store \n\nIBM with their AI tools through Watson \n\nProbably some others\n\nOther comments: \n\nAI is likely to automate many jobs away and replace some of those jobs with jobs we can\u2019t imagine yet.

This doesn't matter so much if AI is just a tool to generate a starting point for something, or to find a faster-than-brute-force solution to something which can be then verified.\n\nIt matters a ton though for live decision making where safety is at stake.  For example, Teslas have been observed to make the same mistake at a specific intersection for a while, then after a software update it no longer makes the mistake, then after another software update the mistake is back.  How was it fixed?  Well the training data changed and the application of that data to the sensor inputs happen to change the result to be better.  How was it unfixed?  Same reason, different result.  The developers can't just fix it by hardcoding a \"in this lane at this location do X\" and even if they did that would surely go wrong in the future once the intersection changes somehow.\n\nThere are infinite edge cases in the constantly-changing real world and while humans do make mistakes as well, it's rare for most humans in some situation to suddenly all make the same mistake.  This is far more likely for an AI.\n\nWhile the opacity of AI decision making isn't as much of a problem when it is just used as a tool to generate a starting point for something which humans will continue working on or verifying, it is still a problem if humans start to trust the AI output too much.

{"title": "One-Year of Selling Options Premium on TQQQ", "selftext": "Hello Theta Gang,\n\n'Tis the season to be thankful for most glorious option premium!\n\nI haven't posted here yet, but I've watched the sub for a while. I've been selling puts on TQQQ for about 1 year, with the occasional call. I've been through some ups and downs as the market changed over the year, but generally going in the right direction. I used to post my progress, status, and trades in the r/TQQQ sub, but I just can't stomach that place any longer. This sub is more aligned with my objectives, so I'll try posting my updates here.\n\nTQQQ is a crazy-crazy ride, but the IV is great if you can actively manage your trades well. I generally sell puts, pretty close to the money. I don't mind being assigned and I always have enough cash to take assignments, but I do roll out often to avoid it. I normally operate with anywhere from $175k to $250k capital for this strategy. At most times, I have right around $200k deployed. This account currently has 1,700 shares gained through assignment with an average cost basis of $38. I have an open call option on those with a strike at $48.\n\nMy average monthly gains are around 4%. I have posted many screenshots and actual trades in my prior posts in r/TQQQ (home of the braindead, except for a precious few) if you care to see them. I have used this money for a variety of things including helping pay for my kid's schooling and a rather expensive luxury item that sucks my wallet dry like a turbocharged Hoover.\n\n[Cumulative Option Premium Gains, Just Crossed $110k in One Year.](https://preview.redd.it/qjmr67ntal2c1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce5b486fa70c4033739eb65d503eb07b60eb529f)\n\n[Option Premium Gains by Month](https://preview.redd.it/5hcjhdieal2c1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaf448e68861a0eccdd6109c9a4755e25ec0d364)", "id": "183yjjm", "created_utc": 1700960388.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "what DTE do you look at and what delta's?
