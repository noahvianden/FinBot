{"title": "US economic growth for last quarter is revised up to a 5.2% annual rate", "selftext": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Shrugging off higher interest rates, America's consumers spent enough to help drive the economy to a brisk 5.2% annual pace from July through September, the government reported Wednesday in an upgrade from its previous estimate.\n\nThe government had previously estimated that the economy grew at a 4.9% annual rate last quarter.\n\nWednesday's second estimate of growth for the July-September quarter confirmed that the economy sharply accelerated from its 2.1% rate from April through June. It showed that the U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 the total output of goods and services \u2014 grew at its fastest quarterly rate in nearly two years.\n\nConsumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, rose at a 3.6% annual rate from July through September \u2014 still healthy but a downgrade from the previous estimate of 4%. The economy also received a lift from companies building inventories in anticipation of future sales. Also driving the third quarter growth was an uptick in spending and investment by governments at all levels, federal, state and local.\n\nThe U.S. economy, the world's largest, has proved resilient even as the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher interest rates have significantly increased consumer and business borrowing costs. But they have also helped ease inflationary pressures: Consumer prices rose 3.2% last month from 12 months earlier, a marked improvement from the 9.1% year-over-year inflation recorded in June 2022.\n\nThe U.S. job market is cooling from the red-hot levels of the past two years. But it's still healthy by historical standards: Employers are adding an average of 239,000 jobs a month this year. And the unemployment rate has come in below 4% for 21 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.\n\nThe combination of easing inflation and resilient hiring has raised hopes the Fed can manage a so-called soft landing \u2014 raising rates just enough to cool the economy and tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economic-growth-last-quarter-133558430.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAaxSG3WR1-7mbPrJ9yyCC1cZUFNru2b4N5pYyb4RSQO_AC9pUKytnHAdXW5TCuCxBf820rYwtmIRyukCZ6r7wLwtck61m_EpXMAKKPM71gpvTHpeJdYuoDTSUGg-1bUzzDUy_r9vJLhfqukZ5Ifv2sOR5z7lqBvQMDPzS3YlU_-", "id": "186q0dv", "created_utc": 1701266346.0, "score": 400, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Bears in shambles", "score": 164, "replies": [{"body": "But they won on Monday?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "EYyY, wE GAtT ThE tAp PiCk, WeRE GaAAnNA bE Da NeW PaCKurSE!", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14555096626281738}, {"body": "Nowhere is safe", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06401891261339188}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1900748312473297}, {"body": "Umm...
