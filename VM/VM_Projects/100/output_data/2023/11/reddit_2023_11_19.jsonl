Then he checks your bags or something making you feel insulted because hey youre rich and belong! Then you enter and nobody serves you, you walk around. Eventually, someone asks if you are just looking. You think how dare they I am rich! Then you say no you would like to buy something. They say we have some lovely bag tags over here. You think I am going to prove this person wrong Ill buy this bag for $10k. Now they switch and give you great customer service. Wow I am meant to be here I proved I am rich and special and they have accepted me as one of them. What a great group of people. \n\nThe bag you want might even be not available and they put you on a waitlist and then try and get you to buy other products with high margin like tags, phone cases, wallets, etc. Obviously as you spend more youre more likely to get the top level product.\n\nI have not been in an LV shop for years but if you read text books on luxury marketing strategy thats pretty standard practice.
