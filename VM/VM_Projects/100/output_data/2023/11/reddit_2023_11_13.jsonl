{"title": "Disney is cheap at this levels", "selftext": "* Powerful IP: Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars. Endless opportunities for new parks. \n* Movies: Marvel movies and series have been flopping lately, (many becoming money-bleeding) but Iger announced a creative restructuring. They're reshooting a bunch of stuff for the next movies and the new Avenger, F4, and X-Men sagas could bring another golden era for the studios. Just Infinity War and Endgame brought 1.1b in profits for Disney. \n* Cruises: The cruise industry has not recovered from the pandemic yet, but it's set to reach pre-pandemic levels in the next 2 years. In the same period, Disney is going to double its passenger capacity with two new cruises. This could bring 1b in net profits with pre-pandemic margins.\n* Streaming: Disney wants to merge Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Considering the amount of content that platform would have, it could be a killer for the competition. Disney+ is set to become profitable in 2024, which would be massive considering it loses 500m per quarter atm. This is a bit of a reach, but Disney+ has 60% of Netflix's subscribers, if with the merger of Hulu and ESPN+ they achieve margins somewhat close to Netflix's, imagine how much the company could grow, considering Netflix is valued higher than Disney currently.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "17ua6zr", "created_utc": 1699880660.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.39, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Didn\u2019t the latest Marvel movie just have the worst opening weekend of any marvel movie ever?", "score": 259, "replies": [{"body": "Indeed.

Even at its ATH, from 2010 to 2021, the stock only 4x in price. Compared to the other large cap companies, that's pretty poor. Since 2010, this company has only managed to double. That's just horrible for a company that has as much brand value and IP as DIS. Seems like a massive blunder. Compare that to Netflix which had no IP and served strictly as a streaming platform and now creates original content that far surpasses DIS. How did Netflix do it but DIS couldn't? What where they doing this entire game? So from my outlook, you're investing in a company that isn't really that attractive to begin with. Do I think you can make money buying it at the current price? Sure. Is DIS one of those companies that is high on my list? No, and it shouldn't be.\n\nDISNEY's biggest issue is people don't resonate with the characters they have now. Everything seems rushed. It used to be the core of Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. Now they're giving everyone a movie. Too much of something weakens the brand because now every release seems like just another movie. I also hate how they try and connect every superhero to another. It's just a bad decision because you limit the amount of storylines you can create. There's just no character development in any of these characters. Ant-Man isn't worthy of his own movie. Give it to the primetime characters. Another issue is they don't create new characters. At some point, DISNEY has to look at creating something new but all they do is create the same characters regurgitating the same storylines and when they screw up, they just put time travel back into the picture.\n\nStar Wars has been a dud. Episode 7 was fine just because it rejuvenated the franchise but 8/9 were horrible and poorly written.

As some of you may know, the powers that be have been on a self-righteous moral crusade around the world. Ireland is putting warning labels on beer. In Australia it is illegal for adults to buy vaping products, Canada has sugar sweetened beverage tax.. you get my drift. Adults are not allowed to do adult stuff, and mark my words if history is anything to look at, next stop is undoubtedly prohibition.\n\nNow I'm not here to argue what people should and shouldn't be allowed to do, I'm here to give the most important DD you'll hear in your lifetime, and I'll keep it so simple a bag holding meme stonk ape would understand. So now that we're on the topic of history, when did the prohibition of alcohol come into play? **January 17, 1920**. If you are not aware throughout the 1920's a long boom took stock prices to peaks never before seen. Why? Because they made everything fun **ILLEGAL.**\n\nPeople need an outlet as we're all just animals in the end of the day, the same way a lemur sucks on a poison millipede for a high and a dolphin passes the blowfish bong around to its flipper buddies **WE NEED AN ESCAPE TOO**. People were so bored that the only thing they could do is fucking gamble on horse and cart stocks, it's actually illegal to make the stock market illegal in capitalism, look it up. So everyone went balls deep on fd's 20's style and shit only went up.\n\nIt was only a full 9 years later when they had the biggest stock market crash ever seen. The great depression of **1929**. With the last remaining outlet for degeneracy gone; the stock market, people turned to crime, and like clockwork they began to unwind the laws that made this mess in the first place. Prohibition ended December 5, 1933.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7YI0Lkcvlc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7YI0Lkcvlc)", "id": "17tyu8u", "created_utc": 1699837108.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 138, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|977|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The government is trying to make vaping illegal.

{"title": "I have seen the 8th Wonder of the World", "selftext": "And it's in Las Vegas. \u00a0\n\n(**TLDR at bottom for those who want to cut to the financial details**).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor several years now, I've been visiting the city, and occasionally finding myself driving past an enormous, enigmatic structure.\u00a0 The thing loomed in the former empty space next to Wynn Resort, and at first glance, it looked only like an oddly-round building.\n\nAfter seeing it a few times, I eventually asked an Uber driver what I was looking at, and he told me it was something called \"The Sphere\".\u00a0 He said they had been building it for a while, that no one really knew what it was exactly, or when construction would be complete.\u00a0 I nodded and looked at it warily, assuming it would just be another neon-lit casino, adding to the clutter of the Strip.\u00a0 It really was unremarkable at the time.\u00a0 Hulking, jet black, covered in steel scaffolding.\u00a0 Frankly, it looked boring.\u00a0 Then I forgot about it for a while.\n\nMonths passed, and in September, a little over a month ago, I found myself back in Vegas to attend the Magic the Gathering 30th Anniversary celebration.\u00a0 I stayed at Palazzo, just a few miles from the convention center.\u00a0 My daily commute to and from the event saw me driving past Sphere several times, though initially just in the daytime.\u00a0 I didn't actually see the thing in full darkness until the end of my second day. \u00a0\n\nI will remember this the rest of my life, it was truly that incredible.\u00a0 It was around 8:30 PM, late enough to be completely dark.\u00a0 I was heading back to Palazzo in a cab.\u00a0 We left the Convention Center, and eventually made a turn onto Sands Avenue.\u00a0 As we made the turn, I looked up from the phone in my lap, just as the Eighth Wonder of the World swung into view.\n\nThere are no words to properly convey that moment.\u00a0 It was that breathtaking, that overwhelming, that surreal and wonderful and annihilating.\u00a0 A huge portion of my field of view was occupied by what I can only call a tiny Sun.\u00a0 Yes, an actual literal star, about 500 feet wide, sitting directly in front of me in downtown Las Vegas. \u00a0\n\nI've spent hours looking at filtered video of the real Sun.\u00a0 I've watched its churning eddies, the roiling, seething coils of plasma and gas boiling and frothing at its surface.\u00a0 I've stared transfixed at those videos over the years, imagining the noise and the violence of the thing.\u00a0 The indescribable energy pouring off of it, the obliterating heat. Apparently the Sun fuses around 600 million tons of Hydrogen every second, yet in its entire 5.5 billion year lifespan so far, it's consumed less than 1% of its total fuel.\u00a0 It had always been an abstraction to me, an ambiguous thing far, far away that only occupied a tiny portion of the daylight sky. \u00a0\n\nThen suddenly I'm looking at the Sun, right up close.\u00a0\n\nThe cab continued on as the Sun filled more and more of my field of view.\u00a0 Eventually we were right next to it, the dancing, writhing orange and yellow light filling the car.\u00a0 There was no heat of course, but the illusion endured even up close.\u00a0 I unconsciously pressed my face up against the cab's window as we slowly drove by, eyes rolling to trace the curvature of the star as it arced high up above me.\u00a0 Then we turned another corner, and it slipped from view.\n\nI was speechless.\u00a0 I stared straight ahead into the back of the passenger seat in front of me, attempting to process what had happened.\u00a0 I felt breathless, and reached my hand to my chest, felt my heart racing there, adrenaline still coursing through my body.\u00a0 I'm almost 49, and as a very seasoned traveler, I'd never seen anything like it. Ever.\n\nOver the next two days, I went and looked at Sphere as often as possible, from many different angles and from different distances.\u00a0 I determined the structure is probably best viewed from about a quarter mile away, where it's gigantic, but not overwhelming. \u00a0\n\nApparently Sphere uses an AI art system developed by renowned digital artist Refik Anadol to create what it displays to the public.\u00a0 Suffice to say, his work is astonishing, meshing perfectly with the capabilities and aesthetics of the structure. \u00a0 Over the time I watched it, it transformed from the photorealistic to the abstract, from a glistening, blinking eyeball as big as a small mountain to a whimsical, flowing tapestry of blue and green that reminded me of octopus skin.\u00a0 No matter what vantage point I had, I always found myself surrounded by transfixed tourists.\u00a0 It's almost impossible to look at Sphere without being stunned.\n\nThe venue opened formally to the public at the beginning of October.\u00a0 It's nearing the end of hosting a lengthy concert series by U2, and will likely be sold out for performing venues for the next century, assuming Vegas stays open for business.\u00a0 It will be selling ad space on its surface to help with monetization, though it'll likely make more revenue from hosting events in its 18,000 person arena.\u00a0 I haven't been inside the building yet, but praise for the early concerts there was beyond glowing.\u00a0 Social media the world over is flooded by photos and videos of this thing as more and more people experience it.\n\nSphere's impact on Vegas itself will probably be transformational as well.\u00a0 Consider how many people flock to cities like Paris, Berlin and Seattle to see mundane landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, and the Space Needle, respectively.\u00a0 Old, tired relics of a dead age that just betray expectations and bore your children. \u00a0 When word truly gets out about how insane this thing is, it's going to draw millions more people to the city.\u00a0 Every person who sees it will tell every person they know; it is impossible not to evangelize the experience.\n\nGuys, I can say unequivocally that Sphere is one of the most incredible things humans have built in the history of our species. \u00a0 It's the most wondrous single thing I've ever seen on Earth, natural or artificial.\u00a0 Forget the Great Wall.\u00a0 Forget the Pyramids, the Coliseum, the Grand Canyon, the Space Shuttle and Niagara Falls. \u00a0 Those things are remarkable and even wondrous, but they pale in comparison to the majesty of this structure in Vegas. \u00a0\n\nIf you haven't seen Sphere for yourself yet, it's worth the trip.\u00a0 There is nothing like it on the planet, and I think the stock is extremely undervalued.\u00a0 It could make a tremendous investment opportunity for the community, and unlike so many of the mediocre companies promoted here for the memes and the lulz, it's actually worthy of the attention. \u00a0\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nSPHR (Sphere's company) opened an 18,000-seat arena in Oct 2023 with sold-out U2 concerts for months.  Initial \"losses\" in the media were due to final $95M construction costs, not a consequence of operations.  Despite a $2.3B investment, SPHR's market cap is just $1.26B with a low P/E ratio of 2.04. The stock has grown 60% in six months. I've heavily invested and believe in its potential. Read the above for a more thorough breakdown.

{"title": "A global nuclear renaisance in progress. While the global uranium supply is in a structural deficit that can't be solved in a year time.", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe know that the global annual uranium supply is in a structural deficit, that can't be solved in a year time and not at today's low uranium price (\\~75USD/lb)\n\nThe uranium market is in a structural global deficit and it can\u2019t be solved in 12 months time.\n\nIn fact, the Total amount uranium needed for short term delivery is much bigger than the Total amount uranium available for short term delivery, while uranium demand is price inelastic.\n\nMany projects (needed to solve the global deficit) need a sustainable uranium price of \\~90USD/lb (other experts talk about 100 - 120 USD/lb), and projects need years of permitting and mine construction before starting uranium production.\n\nAnd because the uranium demand is price inelastic, the uranium spotprice is most likely going significantly higher in coming months.\n\n[https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/uranium-market-update-forecast](https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/uranium-market-update-forecast)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn December 2006 the uranium spotprice was around 72 USD/lb, in February 2007 around 75USD/lb, in June 2007 139USD/lb.\n\nBut between 2007 and today there was a lot of inflation, so 75 USD/lb early 2007 isn't the same as \\~75 USD/lb today\n\nBack in February 2007 the sector had enough with 55-60 USD/lb to have a global supply and demand in equilibrium. Yet the uranium spotprice went from 72 to 139 in 7 months time. How come?\n\nThe utilities increased their uranium spotbuying because they were a bit worried about the uranium supply in 2008-2010. And the uranium spotmarket was, and is even more today, a very tiny market.\n\nToday with all the inflation and Labour shortage a sustainable uranium price of \\~90USD/lb (other experts talk about 100 - 120 USD/lb) is needed to get global supply and demand in equilibrium again over time (It will take many years to achieve equilibrium again, because it take many years to restart and build enough new uranium mines).\n\nAnd today there actually is a structural deficit, not just a worry! By consequence, the uranium spotprice is likely to significantly overshoot the needed \\~90USD/lb (other experts talk about 100 - 120 USD/lb) uranium spotprice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But what about the evolution of global nuclear fleet?**\n\nEarly 2007: 435 operable reactors worldwide (total running reactors: 368,860Mwe), 28 reactors under construction and 64 reactors planned.\n\nToday: 436 operable reactors worldwide (total running reactors: 364,586Mwe (391k -27k)), 61 reactors under construction and 112 reactors planned.\n\nSource: World nuclear association\n\nThose 27k Mwe are from remaining 22 Japanese reactors not restarted yet + 6 Ukrainian reactors.\n\nJapan already restarted 11 of the 33 operable Japanese reactors and want to restart the remaining 22 reactors faster now = Unexpected additional uranium demand.\n\nAll German reactors are closed today, Germany can\u2019t close them twice\n\nThe last 2 years many countries did a U-turn in favor of nuclear power (South Korea, France, Sweden, Belgium, The Netherlands, California, ...) which resulted in unexpected licence extensions of many existing reactors and new plans to build new reactors in the future.\n\nThe licence extensions (France, Belgium, Spain, South Korea, California, ...) of existing reactors have an immediat impact on the uranium demand.\n\nAnd India and China are massively building new reactors! Others building reactors are Turkey, Russia, Egypt, ...\n\nChina builds reactors on time and close to budget\n\nToday China has 55 reactors running and 25 under construction,but only \\~4.9Mlbs domestic uranium prod = Huge supply insecurity for China, so China is rushing to buy all uranium they can get before western utilities rush into the sector to restock and to renew their old LT contracts.\n\nAnd the global uranium supply isn\u2019t ready for this, while it already is a structural global uranium supply deficit.\n\n**This isn't financial advice.
