{"title": "\"Why did the Dot Com bubble burst?\"", "selftext": "\" It\u2019s always difficult to identify a single catalyst that causes the bursting of an asset bubble, but in the case of the internet bubble, two factors seem to have played at least some part in the industry\u2019s rapid decline, which began after the tech-heavy [Nasdaq composite](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/n/nasdaq-composite) peaked on March 10th, 2000.\n\nThe first factor was rising interest rates. The [Federal Reserve](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/federal-reserve) raised the [fed funds rate](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/fed-funds-rate) (which informs most other interest rates) several times over the course of the years 1999 and 2000. Higher interest rates tend to motivate investors to move money out of more speculative assets (like internet company stocks) and into interest-paying assets like bonds.\n\nThe second factor was the onset of a [recession](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/r/recession) in Japan in March of 2000. News of this recession spread fast and led to a wave of fear that triggered a worldwide selloff, moving even more money out of speculative equities and into safer, fixed-income instruments like bonds.\"\n\n**HMMM, it really seems like this is exactly what's happening now. The FED is going to increase interest rates, which will kill startups. The venture capital will dry up when investors realize that bonds are safer than the stock market. Earnings only look good right now because of inflation, and sky high PE ratios will soar on bad earnings. Hedges will switch strategy to shorting the market once they realize there is more money to be made off of puts than on calls. China is already hitting major economic turmoil which will have global effects. Consumers will not have any money to spend on goods because they all have 20% car loans and 9% mortgages, and their 500 dollar student loan payments just resumed. The AI revolution is basically just a sham. The current developments are by definition only \"deep learning\" and are not even close to being considered genuine AI.**\n\n*WE ARE SETTING UP THE NEW BULL MARKET BOYS!!!!!!!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "17m6o83", "created_utc": 1698940552.0, "score": 105, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The market is due for a major correction in the next few months, and we are setting up for a new bull market.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39882364869117737}, {"body": "Most of the companies did nothing of value.", "score": 233, "replies": [{"body": "The whole dot com industry was basically just thousands of WeWorks.\n\nScary to think at some point Yahoo was the most valuable company in the world - by a very wide margin.", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "Yahoo was pre-00s Google with a bunch of other sites we use now too so it deserved the valuation.

The decision changes as the inputs change, and you can make this more and more complicated for increasingly distinct outcomes.\n\nYou can see this in games like Tic Tac Toe, which have simple rules, and it's simple to model \"intelligent\" behavior in a machine that plays the game... And then compare that to a game like Chess, which requires significantly more inputs to make intelligent decisions.\n\nThe other dimension of modern AI is predictive capabilities - giving a machine the ability to *predict* an outcome according to statistical probabilities based on some input. For example, if I said \"Bah bah black _____\", a machine that has been trained on a hundred million hours of people talking might predict that \"sheep\" is the most likely word to fill in the blank with 90% likelihood.\n\nHow does that translate to the real world?\n\nWell, AI in one form or another has been commonplace for the last thirty years - you just don't know it because it's not sexy.\n\nDocument understanding, sentiment analysis, speech to text, GPS navigation, actuarial loan procedsors, web search, etc - all are forms of AI, just with a different name. It's a running joke in our field that \"We'll have AI when we can do X!\", only for us to develop the ability to do \"X\" and move the goalpost.\n\nThis current iteration of that is \"Generative AI\" - which is admittedly an amazingly powerful innovation. Generative AI literally just means AI that fabricates some output according to an input - it \"creates\" something out of thin air. And personally, I thought we were still 10-20 years away from the first commercially viable tool.\n\nThe major difference between ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, etc and previous attempts is that these tools are actually *useful*, even if they're far from perfect. \n\nWhat's it good for? Well, we're still figuring that out. Right now, intelligent note taking and virtual assistants are proving useful, and in the art domain, smart fill in Photoshop that lets you \"make up\" something that fills a gap has been quite useful.\n\nYou have to remember, we're in the *very early stages* here. It's not too dissimilar to the first Ford Model-T - nothing is inherently NEW about the technology (engines had been around for decades), but it was the first \"consumer ready\" device. People derided the vehicle because \"it's unreliable, we have horses, why not take a street car\", etc... But just twenty years later, cars had passed all of those hurdles, and a century later cars would be so commonplace and integral in our economy that it would make someone from the 20's head explode. \n\nFrom a computer scientist's perspective, all behavior in our world can be mathematically modeled...although we sometimes struggle to understand how complex such a model may need to be. But as compute power increases, as our ability to compile databases improves, the reliability of generative AI will only improve.\n\nBoth I and my mom are computer scientists - she worked in linguistics and natural language processing, I work in AI and automation. She's joked with me before that the technologies we're working with today are roughly identical to what they were fiddling with in the 80s... the difference is that we have hundreds of orders of magnitude more compute power than they did.\n\nThus, bet on NVidia - the modern graphics card era has done more to democratize AI development than any other technological innovation.\n\nBet on Microsoft, because they are figuring out how to package generative AI into a useful tool for Windows machines.\n\nBet on Adobe, because the ability to artificially insert \"images\" in a photo are going to put a lot of digital artists out of a job. \n\nIt's the Model-T era of AI integration, it's only going to get more sophisticated from here.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I ain't reading all that, but I'm happy for you, or sorry that happened", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's why you're in /r/wallstreetbets", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09161467105150223}, {"body": "TLDR: blah blah...something...it's all smoke and mirrors right now but it won't be.
