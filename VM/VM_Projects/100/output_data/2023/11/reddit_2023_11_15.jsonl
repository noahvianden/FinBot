This was a bigger contraction than the expected 0.6% decline in a Reuters poll.\n\n* It underscores the complex challenges for the Bank of Japan as Governor Kazuo Ueda contemplates an eventual exit from its ultra-easy monetary policy, while bolstering the case for the Japanese government\u2019s 13.2 trillion yen ($87 billion) economic package that will feature subsidies and payouts to low-income households to mitigate soaring energy and utility bills and aimed at curbing rising living costs.\n\nThe world\u2019s third-largest economy also contracted 0.5% in the third quarter from the previous quarter, after expanding 1.2% in the second quarter from the first. This was also a bigger contraction than expectations for 0.1% contraction.\n\nBoth declines were Japan\u2019s first in four quarters and are part of an unstable trend since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 that has seen periods of economic expansion alternating with contraction.\n\n\n\nThe weaker GDP print was partly driven by weaker than expected domestic capital expenditure, which contracted 0.6% in the third quarter from the second quarter \u2014 as opposed to expectations for a 0.3% expansion, according to the same government release.\n\nPrivate consumption in Japan was flat in the third quarter from the previous quarter, as domestic and foreign demand weighed on the economy.", "id": "17vh1oq", "created_utc": 1700008596.0, "score": 413, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "I live in Tokyo, been here for 7 years.

Salaries are awful compared to mass immigration countries.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Again, You would have to compare wages to their cost of living. The wages would be worse if more immigrants flowed in, it\u2019s simply the law of supply and demand, and we are starting to see the stagnant wages break in Japan as the workforce is starting to shrink. The cultural issues are at root for their lackluster economy, being too complacent and not as competitive as they once were. Inefficient work hours, problems with seniority, among others are major problems. Wages in Japan were once the highest in the world in the 80\u2019s, investment bankers from the UK and US flocked to Japan for the booming IPO market. It is not just one solution fits all, to tackle the population problem you need to tackle the economic situation, which would need for society to change cultural norms so that people work more efficiently and productively with a better work life balance to have kids. And in order to afford these kids there would need to be more jobs than workers, which would mean salary increases to compete for a shrinking workforce. In turn, higher discretionary income leads to more job growth and better household living, leading to a better economy and a more stable population. There is no shortcut here where you can just throw millions of immigrants at in this process and think it would solve everything and fix salaries somehow. Look at Europe, their salaries are relatively low compared to the US (even Japan) despite their mass immigration, mass immigration does not lead to higher salaries, in fact it leads to the opposite. The US is different since since they have such a huge country and has had a long history of rugged individualism and a Protestant thinking (one in which was imported from Calvanism that states that attaining wealth was a sign that God favors you and you would end up in heaven)  of becoming rich means success. Combine the isolation of the US from much of the warring world, it\u2019s natural resources and big size, along with a entrepreneurial spirit you of course are going to get the wealthiest country with a high standard of living. However not every country is the same nor has the capacity that the US does to support such a large population, it\u2019s a disservice to modern economics to assume the same economic theory would work in other cultures. Mass Immigration to the US works because of its history and size like the reasons I stated before, it\u2019s resources and capacity stretches far and needs more people to support it. However for smaller and more homogenous\u2019 countries, you cannot have the same amount of resources and spread them across a larger population and act like that somehow will fix everything and not cause salaries to go down and make them compete for the same amount of goods with more demand and people.

Just slowly buy shares of your preferred indexed ETF until then. \n\n- Consider VIX and stock\u2019s IVRs when wheeling. You should sell covered options when the relevant metric is high. For indexed ETFs, you should use VIX as your bellwether, and IVR for individual stocks. You DO NOT have to constantly have a short option open.

I've been here a really long time and have some observations that may be helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why is the wheel so popular\n\nOptions are complicated and take a good amount of time and energy to really understand on a basic level, let alone a real thorough working knowledge. There are risks, that are not totally intuitive, that are missed by a lot of traders. The wheel, however, you can run with virtually no understanding of options, leverage, risk management, risk in general, or really any financial or market knowledge. If you read posts from wheelers, its apparent that a lot of these people don't even understand basic stock market dynamics, let alone derivatives.\n\nThere are psychological biases that affect newer premium-sellers, that are not exclusive to the wheel. If you sell premium, you should run a high win rate, at least over 50%, independent of your P&L. If you don't, you are probably doing something really wrong. When you win most of your trades, its very hard to convince people that they have a sub-optimal, or outright poor strategy, even though its provably obvious.\n\nAnother one, is that people get really hung up on the idea of collecting premium, so much so that they tend to ignore fairly obvious risks and flaws in their strategy. After all, how bad could it be if you're realizing gains? Never mind that a lot of these people are taking 10x the risk to collect what amounts to a high dividend. This is where you see positions like un-margined, fully cash-covered put-selling, for which there is no mathematical justification. Its just poor risk/reward any way you look at it.\n\nOn the flip side, you can lie to yourself and ignore unrealized losses on assigned stock indefinitely, because stocks are a perpetual asset. \"Its not really a loss, cause the stock will come back.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the wheel, its a lower-risk, lower-reward strategy that sounds great on paper. You'll do better 99% of the time by buying and holding SPY or VOO. Many people go their entire lives never trading anything more advanced. That's fine, I guess. My personal issue with it is that leverage and trading both sides, are two of the biggest benefits to options trading, which the wheel fails to utilize.\n\nFWIW, my impression is this sub has become less of a wheel-haven in the recent past, but I also feel like its just become more random overall, with knowledgable people getting bored and leaving. Its always been the blind leading the blind to some extent, but reading through the comments on this post, its both hilarious and slightly horrifying.
