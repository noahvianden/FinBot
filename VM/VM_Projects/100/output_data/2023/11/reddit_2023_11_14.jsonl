Both companies have fought to limit revealing the deals\u2019 details, citing potentially anticompetitive effects.\n\nThe incidental disclosure from Alphabet\u2019s expert witness Kevin Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was not expected. Murphy\u2019s testimony came as part of the company\u2019s efforts to fight the Justice Department\u2019s claims that the company illegally maintains dominance over search and advertising markets.\n\nWilliams & Connolly antitrust partner John Schmidtlein visibly cringed when Murphy revealed the number, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nThe search default agreement is a major focus of the proceedings. Judge Amit Mehta has described the Apple-Google deal as the \u201cheart\u201d of the case. It\u2019s a number Wall Street pays attention to as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated in a note to clients that Apple would see $19 billion in 2023 revenue as a result of the search engine default deal with Google.\n\nNeither Apple nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai defended such deals when he testified in the proceedings. But Google\u2019s competitors have described the arrangement as damaging to their business. Microsoft\n\nCEO Satya Nadella, for example, pushed back in detail when he testified in October.\n\nNadella said that \u201cevery year\u201d he had held the top job at Microsoft, he had \u201cdialogues\u201d with Apple over a default search engine deal for Microsoft\u2019s Bing, even if that meant billions in short-term losses. Nothing had yet come of those talks, Nadella said.\n\nNadella said that the idea of an \u201copen web\u201d was a misnomer. \u201cEverybody talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web,\u201d he said on the stand.", "id": "17v4p9n", "created_utc": 1699975814.0, "score": 558, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "I am so used to googles search and how it presents the results, I do not understand how bing presents their results and I do not feel satisfied and I immediately perform the same search on google and feel satisfied ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face).", "score": 253, "replies": [{"body": "Bing is garbage", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Google is getting so much worse.

{"title": "Are We In A Student Loan Bubble?", "selftext": "Hey y'all. So I need some advice. Basically I believe that we're in a Student Loan Bubble. Americans hold 1.8 TRILLION dollars in student loan debt, with 92% of that being Federal. There are only 9 federal student loan servicers, and they've all dropped the ball when it comes to loan repayments. For example, my servicer Nelnet $NNI has had their website crash over 10 times since September. Their official hold time is 90 minutes to talk to a customer service rep, but I waited 2.5 hrs. Hundreds of thousands of students have been incorrectly billed. My loan was bought and sold three times during the pandemic. American credit card debt is at an all time high, and many students have no ability, intention, or budget to repay their student loans. I believe I read a report that said 50-60% of students don't intend to repay their loans. They haven't had to for 3 years, and many students were pissed off when loan forgiveness was cancelled.\n\nNelnet has a debt to equity ratio of 4:1, P/E 17, and their profits and cash flows are down. If you go on Twitter (X) there are tons of students who are pissed off. Another thing that makes me upset is that Nelnet laid off hundreds of employees, and used the money to buy back their own stock. The issue is the exec board owns 50% of the stock (and has 70% of voting power). Institutional investors own 30% and it's a low volume stock.\n\nNelnet aggressively acquired the loan portfolios of other companies, and IMO they will have to pay the piper when they realize that students are not paying back their loans.\n\nThey are also under investigation from the Department of Education for violating their contract. It blows my mind that the major media outlets are not reporting on how many students are not paying back their loans, and investors seem unbothered by NelNets horrible financial stats.\n\nIs there anything I can do to increase publicity and make someone look into this and write a news story on it?\n\nFull disclosure bought put options when their stock was at $100 and I'm currently up 120%. Their stock was worth $60 before Covid, now at $86. I certainly don't think they are worth 40% more now, but given how low their volume has been I don't think investors are aware of how much trouble they're in.\n\nAny recommendations would be helpful.
