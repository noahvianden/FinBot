Every vendor who needs paypal/a processor already has it or has considered it, and with Stripe being the new kid on the block with sexier rates I just don't see many people choosing PYPL over Stripe to a point where we see 2018 growth again. \n\n\n\nI sell an ERP system directly to business owners/decision makers in a company and usually discuss our payment providers that connect to the ERP. And when I mention Stripe vs Paypal there is really nothing that edges the CEO's/CFO's to choosing Paypal vs Stripe. Especially when they ask for the rates of the providers, they almost always choose Stripe after seeing 30% lower rates than PYPL for the same function. Anecdotal evidence for sure, but there has never been an instance where we tell them that they NEED to use Paypal over any other provider. To me that's a huge problem and my current job regularly provides me a front row view of CEO's/CFO's denying Paypal based on their rates and competiton. \n\n\nThat's the reason why I'm not buying the PYPL growth story. Not a fan of investing in a company with no MOAT, who offers the same product as their competitor, but at a worst rate for merchants. Nor a company that charges crypto fees 400% higher than the average competitor.\n\n\n Stripe is growing at a rate 10x faster than PYPL and I don't think there's some hidden market of business owners who had no idea about Paypal that will suddenly sign up.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pypl", "pypl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["pypl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["pypl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45291849970817566}], "tickers": ["pypl", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["pypl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You have a personal vendetta against pypl, i see you on every pypl thread", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe because I literally see someone trying to punp PYPL literally every single day at this point.
