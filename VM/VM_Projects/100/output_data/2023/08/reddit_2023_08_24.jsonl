The big topic this year (as lately) is if the FED will keep raising interest rates to cool down inflation.\n\nSimplifying a lot: high interest rates have a negative impact in company valuations as it virtually means the risk free asset (goverment bonds) pay very high payout, and company profits become less interesting for investors. Higher interest rates also make more expensive debt for companies/ individuals which theoretically stops growth, consumption and cools down prices (inflation).\n\nSo as a summary people is scared JPow (FED\u2019s chairman) will continue to increase interest rates.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "people aren't scared that Powell will increase interest rate again. Rates are at 5.5%, and even if they go up to 6%, that wouldn't move the 10 year rate much, and the 10 year rate is used to value companies. It might cause market to fear the Fed engineering a hard landing, but it wouldn't affect the 10 year rate that much.\n\nWhat people are concerned about is actually the long term outlook from the Fed. The topic for this year Jackson Hole is \"structural shifts in the global economy\". They are likely going to talk about structural factors that will bring long term inflation up back to normal period (before 2008 financial crisis, and not low inflation like the last decade). It might mean the Fed will eventually move to a 3% inflation target in the future, after they bring it down to 2%. When people buy a 10 year bond, they want it to beat the average inflation over that 10 years. If there're factors that will bring inflation up over that 10 years, then that would bring the 10 year rate up. For more than a decade, the 10 year rate was very low because people assumed inflation would stay low (below 2%), so they didn't need to hedge for higher inflation risk. Now that there're substantial risk inflation might not stay low, they will demand higher yields to compensate for that inflation risk. Going forward, even if inflation stayed at 2%, the 10 year rate is likely to stay above 4%.\n\nWhile Powell's speech is important and market will likely focus on it the most, other Fed officials will also be giving talks to news outlet, today and tomorrow. And many of these Fed officials are voters. In fact, it's arguably better for people to listen more to Fed officials as opposed to Powell. The reason is because the Fed committee is somewhat divided right now. There're some doves, and there're many hawks. When Powell speaks, he represents the whole Fed committee. If there's disagreement among the committee, Powell is unlikely to provide a lot of details on what the Fed is thinking. This is why you see Powell telling people to refer to the SEP projection on what the Fed is thinking. The Fed members, on the other hand, can speak more freely, though they still don't like to tell people what they will do at the next meeting. Fed Harker, one of the most dovish member currently, just told CNBC today that he's fine with how much the 10 year rate moved up recently. He even said it's helpful to the Fed.

The market may be anticipating that this is the last \"blow-out\" earnings report for NVDA and that growth may stall out from here as spending on Nvidia's AI products plateaus off, or declines, or NVDA's margins go down (may or may not happen... but we'll see).\n\nI'll use GOOG's post-earnings reaction on 2/2/2022 as a historical example of this type of of thing.

Now pull up a daily stock chart for GOOG and look at what happened on that date (2/2/2022) and ever since then.  GOOG opened at an all-time high, sold off that day, and then sold off further.  The market apparently anticipated what came next -- GOOG's earnings reports since then have been lackluster by comparison (revenue/earnings declines).  And GOOG stock has yet to reclaim that 2/2/2022 high. \n\nBack to NVDA, it also worth noting that its earnings are historically inconsistent and prone to CYCLICALITY.\n\nLook at NVDA's [historical EPS growth](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/financials/) each year:\n\n2015: -4%, 2016: +137%, 2017: +89%, 2018: +37%, 2019: -32%, 2020: +53%,, 2021: +123%...\n\n2022: -55%\n\n2023:  +600-700% (?)
