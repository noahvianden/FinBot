{"title": "Your Next Amazon Order Might Be Delivered Without A Box", "selftext": "Amazon is set to change how it delivers products, skipping the extra Amazon box for certain items like TVs and toasters. This move is part of CEO Andy Jassy's strategy to boost profits and reduce waste. Around 11% of items already arrive without extra packaging, and Amazon aims to expand this approach to cut costs and promote sustainability. While there are potential risks like theft due to visible packaging, the benefits in terms of efficiency and reduced environmental impact are significant. Other companies like Brita have already redesigned packaging to align with Amazon's program, signaling a positive industry shift. This change aligns with Jassy's vision for a more profitable and eco-friendly Amazon.\n\n**Target & Starbucks Genius Strategy**\n\nTarget has unveiled a new nationwide initiative \u2013 free curbside delivery of Starbucks orders \u2013 catering to the younger generation's penchant for mobile ordering. Customers using Target's Drive Up service can now seamlessly add Starbucks purchases to their order. This collaboration aligns with Starbucks' strategy to enhance customer experience through digital convenience, resonating with the growing Gen Z and Millennial customer base. Starbucks reported a 12% revenue boost in Q3 2023, reaching a record $9.2 billion, with its mobile app usage surging by 12.4% last year. The Starbucks-Target partnership is set to enhance convenience for busy parents, and the service will be available in 1,700+ stores with Starbucks Caf\u00e9s and Drive Up service by October.\n\n**The Saga Continues: Barbie and Oppenheimer Box Office Dominance**\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer dominated the weekend box office, securing the top two spots and raking in $33.7 million and $18.8 million respectively, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter. Barbie's performance propelled it into the list of top 10 films with the biggest fourth weekends in history, pushing its domestic earnings to a whopping $526.3 million.\n\nOppenheimer followed closely, claiming the second spot and adding to its success with a total domestic pull of $264 million and a global box office tally of $649 million. This makes it director Christopher Nolan's fifth-highest grossing film, trailing only The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem secured $15.8 million, while Meg 2: The Trench slipped to fourth place, amassing a total domestic earning of $54.1 million after a $12.7 million weekend.\n\nA new entry, Last Voyage of Demeter, the Dracula film with a $45 million budget, debuted with $6.5 million. Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion earned $5.6 million and claimed sixth place, premiering just after the start of the actor's strike.\n\n**Hershey Steps Up as Health-Conscious Consumers Seek Wellness in Snacks**\n\nHershey introduced its better-for-you confection (BFY) strategy in 2021, aiming to expand options for health-conscious snackers. This includes no sugar added, zero-sugar, plant-based, and protein-packed products. The move was influenced by consumer insights revealing a growing focus on wellness:\n\n\\- 71% prioritize a healthy lifestyle\n\n\\- 78% see healthy eating as crucial\n\n\\- 70% aim to reduce sugar intake\n\n\\- 62% look to add protein to their diet\n\nHershey caters to these trends through various initiatives:\n\n1. **Sugar Management:** They revamped the Zero Sugar line, experiencing tripled sales. They acquired Lily's, known for no-added sugar treats, and launched Honest Organic Gummies.\n\n2. **Plant-Based Options:** The company tapped into the booming vegan chocolate market with Hershey\u2019s Plant Based Extra Creamy with Almonds & Sea Salt and Reese\u2019s Plant Based Peanut Butter Cups.\n\n3. **Protein Occasions:** Addressing the demand for protein, they acquired ONE\u2122 Brands and are launching protein-packed ONE\u2122 Puffs.\n\nHershey collaborates with retailers to capitalize on the BFY trend, placing products strategically and utilizing eye-catching displays. BFY confection's growth potential is high, offering consumers more choices for various occasions. The success of this strategy stems from consumer insights, market awareness, and strategic partnerships.\n\nEdit: Seems like the community enjoy this type of information.
