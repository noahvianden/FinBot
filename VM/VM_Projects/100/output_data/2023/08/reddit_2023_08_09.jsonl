They are already competing. The next chain of events usually goes \"But apple will eat their lunch\" - Apple pay is huge, its growth is slowing at about 3% YOY (understandable given its size) yet all of these companies are still able to continue growing.

Great, so if my bank doesn't participate and yours does, what does this solve? Nothing. Just send me my 20 dollars through PayPal or Venmo, thanks.\n\nNow as the other recent threads have pointed out PayPal already offers crypto and now will offer a USD backed stable coin. I'm no cyrpto person so I can't comment on those merits, but I see no situation where this leads to less transactions, so more transactions = more TPV = more money.

It's just not a good business IMO, and I have no faith in their long term prospects for a few reasons.\n\n* Competition in the space is exploding, and will likely only continue to go up overtime.\n\n* I constantly hear people at reddit say that they've been screwed over by Paypal and had money stolen from them siding with scammers over them. I've heard it so much that there's no way I would ever open up a Paypal account if I needed to send money to someone. And if I'm thinking this then I surely can't be the only one. This combined with the first point make me very skeptical that Paypal can continue growing in the future like they have in the past. Negative reputations have consequences, especially when there's competition.\n\nAnd then there's the numbers, which are just dreadful IMO:\n\n* Their Free Cash Flow has barely even budged for the last 5 years. When removing stock based compensation (which effectively steals earnings from investors) their annual FCF went from $3.81 billion in 2018 all the way to $3.85 billion in 2022, all while their revenue has gone from $15.45 billion in 2018 to $27.52 billion in 2022. This shows just how much their margins have already been shrinking overtime.\n\n* Paypal's balance sheet has also gotten a lot worse. they went from having no debt in 2018 to 10.42 billion in debt and only 10.85 billion in cash at the end of 2022. You would hope that if Paypal was taking on all of this debt that investors would have gotten a good return on their investment, but instead the stock is down 28.72% over the last 5 years.\n\n* If you look at the share count Paypal has already started upping their share buybacks a lot more over the last year then they had been for the prior decade. They went from 1.16 billion shares outstanding to 1.11 billion shares outstanding at the end of the last quarter. By contrast they had 1.23 billion shares outstanding in early 2014. But what have Paypal's heavily increased stock buybacks over the last 12 months done for the stock's price? Why it's dropped by 37.3%! So in other words all they did was burn some cash while shareholders continued to lose a fortune on the stock. IMO when a company starts buying back stock that's often a warning sign that the business can't find anything good to do with their cash to grow their business, which could mean their growth is likely to slow down.\n\nSo yeah, I'm definitely not touching this stock.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Their Fcf in 2017 was 1.8 billion 2023 5 billion.\nThey have 100 million less shares today, 250 million more customers and 14.5 billion more rev.\nIts at 2017 valuations.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah but you may as well be talking to a dog here.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.020251674577593803}, {"body": ">d.
