That being said, I remember him pushing the Tattooed Chef (TTCFQ) pretty hard a couple of years ago and he\u2019s been pushing PayPal these past few months. So I know he has some pretty big losers as well, but he never seems to bring them up \u2026\r  \n\r  \nWhen he speaks, he obviously knows the basics, but sometimes he also makes weird claims and assumptions (PS ratio is useless, gross margin is useless, etc.)\r  \n\r  \nI was wondering, are any of you a part of his private group ? Is he performing as advertised ?\r  \n\r  \nHave any of you been following him for a long time ? Can you attest to his greatness ? To his ability to predict ? Or is he lying and just an average performer ?\r  \n", "id": "163paj3", "created_utc": 1693236809.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019ve been following his channel for years (for fun) and Ive worked for a couple years in equity research, so I know a thing or two about stock valuations, portfolio management, etc. First understand that pretty much any content on Youtube is for entertainment, not serious investing. Any channel that is seriously focused on investing is going to show valuation models like DCF and go much more in-depth. Jeremys research often consists of nothing more than quick look at a company\u2019s financing statements and analyst projections. Sometimes he will even say things like \u201cI went to the mall today, and [insert store name] was packed\u201d to justify one of his picks. That\u2019s not to say that Jeremy doesn\u2019t provide any value. The value that I get from his channel is entertainment and quick bites. I don\u2019t have time to watch CNBC all day and listen to conference calls, so once in a while I tune into his channel to catch up on the market. He does a pretty good with this. As far as his stock picks go, yes his success is largely due to a few outliers like Tesla, ELF, and Meta. Whether or not he got lucky is debatable and doesn\u2019t really matter. The same argument can be made of successful portfolio managers and those who underperform the market. The important  to remember is that past success doesn\u2019t guarantee future results. Tesla was largely a once in a lifetime  type of return. Even if Jeremy strongly believed in the company, which I believe he did, anyone who says there wasn\u2019t an element of luck is kidding themselves. Noone can forsee a stock 20xing in 3 years. Was the stock undervalued in 2018, definitely. Was it undervalued 95%, probably not. But again, Tesla was a giant outlier, it 20x in less than 3 years, which is better than Google, Amazon, Microsoft have ever done in such a span throughout their history. And these are the most successful companies in the world. Without Tesla, his returns are likely far less impressive. Meta, too, was a great call earlier this year. Others like TTCF, Voyager Digital pretty much went to $0. I think it was irresponsible for him to push these stocks so hard in 2020-2022 without fully acknowledging the very real risks. Jeremy isn\u2019t stupid, and he definitely could have done better here. With that said, there are things I admire about Jeremy. He has been consistently investing in the market for many years, through ups and downs. As far as I can tell, he is a self made millionaire. He has conviction. Regardless of whether or not he got lucky with Tesla, he stuck with his conviction and didn\u2019t sell his winner too early. These are things any investor can learn from. These days he\u2019s pushing Amazon and Paypal - two stocks i own. He makes good points for both, but I\u2019m not buying these stocks because Jeremy told me to buy them. Amazon is a compounder and will likely keep growing over the next 3-5, 10 years. The company is #1 in e-commerce and cloud, number 3 or 4 in digital advertising, and growing in a bunch of other verticals. Paypal is more of a value play, hopefully not a value trap. The company generates billions of dollars in free cash flow, and hopefully they can keep growing and expand their foothold in the payments space either through organic growth or acquisitions. I believe Paypal has limited downside at this point and is relatively low risk.", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the long detailed answer. I really appreciated.
