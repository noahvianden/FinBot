We are in the hottest jobs economy of your lifetime.

That means that that the letter being better written and impressing some stereotyped recruiter is almost certainly not what happened. \n\n Basic algorithms could have inserted key words to create it, and basic word match algorithms found those same words on the recruiting app. \n\nSo if you told it \"write me a cover letter as a first year help desk applicant\" it just generated words about problem solving and knowledge base and so on.  Then the companion reader bot looked for words like problem solving and knowledge base and decided this would work for the help desk level 2 job.
