By fiddling around with the amounts based on your perception of when is a good time to dump in more and when it's a good time to dump in less, that is, by definition, not DCA.  It's timing the market.  And contrary to what DCA pushers say, timing the market *is* a good thing.  They do it.  Everyone does it.
