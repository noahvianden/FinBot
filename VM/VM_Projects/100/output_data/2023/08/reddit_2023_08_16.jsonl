Instead, here\u2019s some interesting data for you to consider against your current positioning and P/L:\n\nWhen the broader market (S&P 500 as measured by SPY) bottomed in Oct 22 (@356.56), it was right around the price level where the market first started to break-out into new all time highs (Nov 2020, 354.56 - vaccine EUA approval).

If you\u2019re a technical analyst you might say these would be the support/resistance and proof of pivot points. If you\u2019re not a chartist, you might infer from this data in retrospect that essentially all of the gains during the Covid era were erased by the market.\n\nSo, if you had bought and held 100% SPY on 4/1/21 (@400.61), at the current 52-week highs on 7/31/23 (@457.79) your open P/L over that period would have been *UP* by 14%! Not flat to 1% percent as you currently stand. With those facts in mind, congrats on getting back to even. That\u2019s a great feeling, and you\u2019re probably sleeping better at night!

Those prior support/resistance pivot points also show you over a broader period that when the market breaks out into new all-time highs, there is period of positive price momentum before the next bear market. So, as we get closer to 4800 on the S&P 500, the probabilities that you\u2019re getting in \u201cat the top\u201d or \u201chave missed the move\u201d are actually quite low over a longer time horizon, as history proves. All you\u2019ve missed is the opportunity to get in at lower costs by buying the dips.\n\nIf you consider repositioning (and based on this analysis, my *opinion* is you probably should - not suggesting 100% SPY, just using as an easy compare), Aug/Sept/Oct are historically some of the weakest periods for broader market returns post-WWII. Some of the biggest sell offs in market history have occurred during this time frame, and ironically many of the market bottoms have too. Momentum is definitely slowing as volatility has begun to rise two weeks into this calendar window. The S&P also closed below it\u2019s 50 day yesterday, so that will likely bring in some sellers. So, the probabilities of you being able to reposition in the coming weeks at better prices are in your favor, because trading volumes (and thus liquidity) are historically lower than average during these late summer/early fall months when people are traveling and many institutional players are in their conference seasons. As a result, broader price swings can occur on lower buying/selling demand relative to other periods of the year.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who likes to wait for confirmation of trend resumption (because the best times to buy are often when the scariest/most negative headlines come out and it\u2019s often hard to emotionally pull the trigger on the buy), then rest assured that Nov-Apr are historically the strongest 6 months of the year for market returns post-WWII, so you could wait until early November to buy, and can likely expect to see the market marching close to making new 52 week highs and back towards previous all time highs (assuming no exogenous \u201cblack swans\u201d pop up).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate your effort to give a exhaustive answer to my (kind of silly) question. \n\nI was considering buying only index funds (maybe ftse all world or s&p500) going forward, but reading your comments I'm starting to think about actually closing some position and transfer the money into those etfs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe one thing that is stopping me is that I hate selling at a loss and I hate selling my \"winners\"  so I feel kind of stuck... seems crazy but controlling your feelings really is the hardest part.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "LOL - yeah, it was exhaustive, but glad you found the info helpful.
