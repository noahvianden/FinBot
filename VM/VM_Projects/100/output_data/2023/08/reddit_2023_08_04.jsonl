{"title": "UAW Demands 40% Pay Hike in Labor Talks With Detroit Automakers", "selftext": "The United Auto Workers union is pressing the Detroit car companies to give its factory workers a 40% pay hike in the next labor contract, an increase that would be the largest in recent memory.\n\nThe union conveyed this demand to the automakers this week, along with a list of other items it plans to push for at the bargaining table.\n\nThe UAW is negotiating new four-year labor agreements for about 150,000 hourly workers at General Motors GM -1.26%decrease; red down pointing triangle, Ford Motor F 0.46%increase; green up pointing triangle and Jeep-maker Stellantis STLA -0.51%decrease; red down pointing triangle.\n\nCurrently, unionized factory workers at the Detroit car companies start at about $18 an hour. The top wage, achieved over a period of years, is about $32 an hour.\n\nThe 40% pay hike would be a general increase over the life of the next four-year contract. It would be broken up into a 20% increase upon the contract\u2019s ratification, and four additional 5% wage increases given each year, according to a person familiar with the matter. \n\nA UAW spokesperson said that during the current contract, the average CEO salary at the Detroit car companies has increased 40%. \u201cWe believe UAW members deserve the same if not more.\u201d\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain has already taken an aggressive stance with the automakers, pledging to take a different tack than past UAW leaders and make significant gains for members, particularly on wages and benefits lost in previous rounds of talks.\n\nIn a speech to members Tuesday, he vowed to secure double-digit pay increases for members, without specifying an exact percentage.\n\nHe also outlined a list of 10 demands that he plans to bring to automakers, including the right to strike over plant closures, the re-establishment of some retiree benefits and a defined pension plan for all workers.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re demanding double-digit pay raises,\u201d Fain said during the address, which was broadcast via a Facebook livestream event.\n\nWages are typically a focus during bargaining between the UAW and the car companies, but this year, they have taken on greater prominence, following a period of high inflation. The union is also demanding a return of cost-of-living adjustments and other benefits given up in previous negotiations to help the car companies survive financially.\n\nStill, a 40% pay increase is unusually large, compared with previous contracts. In the last round of talks, which concluded in late 2019, the union secured two sets of 3% increases over the life of the contract, along with lump-sum payments.\n\nThe car companies have historically resisted big pay increases, preferring to instead offer workers bonuses and other one-time payments that don\u2019t add to their fixed costs.\n\nFain, a reform-minded leader elected to lead the 87-year-old union earlier this year, has taken a more militant tone in his dealings with the automakers and has made clear he is willing to strike.\n\nHe has argued that all three automakers are coming off a period of robust profits and that it is time for workers to share in the success.\n\nGM said it plans to increase wages for workers, but that the union\u2019s demands as they currently stand would threaten the company\u2019s ability to support its hourly workers long-term.\n\nFord said it looks forward to working with the UAW, while Stellantis said it had a productive meeting Tuesday with the UAW leader and it is reviewing the union\u2019s demands.\n\nAlong with higher wages, the UAW is also seeking greater job security for its members, particularly as the auto industry transitions away from the gasoline vehicles that have long supported factory jobs to building a new generation of electric vehicles.\n\nSome auto executives say battery-powered vehicles require fewer workers to assemble than traditional gas-engine cars, and jobs for those who work at engine and transmission plants are at risk in a future that is more focused on EVs.\n\nFord, GM and Stellantis have all funneled billions of dollars into building new electric-vehicle plants and battery-making facilities in a collective bet that the technology will attract new customers.\n\nFor their part, they want more flexibility from the union to navigate this shift and reassign workers to new areas that support their long-term objectives on EVs.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/uaw-demands-40-pay-hike-in-labor-talks-with-detroit-automakers-d5daa557?mod=hp_lead_pos10", "id": "15hmgd7", "created_utc": 1691112873.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "they can get that %40 by killing the dealerships", "score": 147, "replies": [{"body": "Dealerships somehow hold massive political sway, through lobbying efforts.

Though the headline number was a miss, it actually represented a modest gain from the downwardly revised 185,000 in for June.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 3.5%, against a consensus estimate that the jobless level would hold steady at 3.6%.The rate is just above the lowest level since late 1969.\n\nAverage hourly earnings, a key figure as the Federal Reserve fights inflation, rose 0.4% for the month, good for a 4.4% annual pace. Both numbers were higher than the respective estimates for 0.3% and 4.2%.\n\nAnother important figure, the labor force participation rate held at 62.6%, the fifth straight month at that level. A more encompassing unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell to 6.7%, down 0.2 percentage point from June. The survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a more robust gain of 268,000.\n\nHealth care led job creation by industry, adding 63,000 jobs for the month. Other sectors contributing included social assistance (24,000), financial activities (19,000) and wholesale trade (18,000). The other services category contributed 20,000 to the total, which included 11,000 from personal and laundry services.\n\nLeisure and hospitality, which has been a leading sector for most of the recovery in the Covid pandemic era, added just 17,000 jobs, consistent with a slowing trend after averaging gains of 67,000 a month in the first three months of 2023.\n\nPrevious months\u2019 totals were revised lower \u2014 the June count dropped to185,000, a downward revision of 24,000, while May was cut to 281,000, down 25,000 from the previous estimate.\n\nEven with the slowing job gains, the economy has proved resilient against a variety of challenges, particularly a series of 11 Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at bringing down inflation.\n\nMost Wall Street experts have been forecasting a recession at least for the past year, but growth has managed to stay positive as consumers keep spending and the services sector rebounds from its pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nGross domestic product gains have averaged 2.2% annualized for the first half of 2023, and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow tracker of growth is pointing to a 3.9% gain for the third quarter.\n\nHowever, Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that the full effect of the rate increases has not been felt yet. Economists worry that the Fed could over-tighten and send the economy into recession.\n\nInflation data of late has been moving in the right direction. However, the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge is still showing prices rising at a 4.1% annual rate, or more than double the central bank target.\n\nWages have been one component of the inflation picture. Average hourly earnings had been declining, though the annual figures are somewhat distorted by comparisons to a year ago when wages were surging.\n\nA Labor Department gauge that the Fed follows closely showed compensation costs rising at a 4.5% 12-month rate through the second quarter. That level is not consistent with the Fed\u2019s inflation target.\n\nAt the same time, recession fears on Wall Street appear to be ebbing.
