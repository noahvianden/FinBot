Not that the public markets are cheap, but the guys holding leveraged assets in the private markets are hoping for Powell to relent and lower rates so they can hold onto what they have without taking a bigger haircut than necessary.\n\nHere's an interview with Meb Faber on some of the things going on in real estate right now. I don't think they go over the issues with covenant lite debt, but that is an important difference between theory and practice as well.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EXx6vCa9ff8?si=t4dGHJ618y6qrDXg\n\nAdditionally, here's another interview today with Tony Dwyer where I believe he talks about how private credit is acting as a buffer to Fed policy to reduce the \"pain\" felt in the markets.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/K4dP1S69WmQ?si=NG2a0iJBZ3QJ5s8x\n\nBoth are reasonable interviews to listen to because they talk more about practice in the real world; where I think Powell has more experience than people realize.\n\nOne other thing to think about. During the 2008 financial crisis, Warren Buffett stepped in to take advantage of the crisis to get good deals for himself with companies that overextended themselves during that time. He got sweetheart deals and was able to use his cash position to help these companies get through a challenging time. However, during the pandemic he wasn't able to. Why is that? It's because of the fiscal and monetary policy that the Trump administration forced down Powell's throat to \"combat\" the pandemic. \n\nSo not only is Powell having to deal with ZIRP and NIRP, he also has to deal with the wild spending that occured as a result of the Trump and Biden Administrations. And in truth, Powell is probably using the Inflation Reduction Act as cloud cover to continue to keep rates up and squeeze more of this excess out of the system. The longer time he has the more companies will be forced to find more productive uses for their capital than just creating bullcrap businesses like Carvana and Opendoor.
