Compiling data from the two reports indicates* ***a 45% additional drop in active users in the past week.***\n\n*Even users who are active on Threads are spending less time on the platform. Sensor Tower data shows the* ***average time spent has dropped from 19 minutes to just four minutes*** *on iOS and from 21 minutes to five minutes on Android devices. (Threads is currently geared toward mobile devices and does not have a desktop client.)*\n\n*Twitter users have remained steady at 200 million\"*\n\nSo what do you guys think? Will Threads be yet another Meta flop like their metaverse or do you think it can somehow increase users again and become profitable?\n\nI think most people signed up because it was easy to do if you already had an instagram account but having logged in the past couple of days i hardly see anybody posting anything there.
