{"title": "JPM Net Income Surge 67% YoY to $14.5 Billion", "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings Friday that topped analysts\u2019 expectations as the company benefited from higher interest rates and growing interest income.\n\n* Earnings: $4.37 per share adjusted vs. $4 per share Refinitiv estimate\n* Revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $38.96 billion estimate\n\nNet income surged 67% to $14.5 billion, or $4.75 per share. When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May \u2014 a $2.7 billion \u201cbargain purchase gain\u201d from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase \u2014 earnings were $4.37 per share.\n\nRevenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.\n\nShares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.\n\nJPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it\u2019s about deposits, funding costs or net interest income \u2014 all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March \u2014 the bank has outperformed smaller peers.\n\nThat\u2019s helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.\n\nThis time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.\n\nThe acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry\u2019s funding costs to rise.\n\nThat\u2019s pressuring the industry\u2019s profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nLenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.\n\nThe bank won\u2019t be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.\n\nFinally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.\n\nWells Fargo\nalso reported earnings Friday, and Citigroup results are on deck. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report Tuesday. Goldman Sachs discloses results Wednesday.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/jpmorgan-chase-jpm-earnings-2q-2023.html", "id": "14ze43n", "created_utc": 1689334766.0, "score": 396, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "Easy to make money on higher interest rates, while still paying out sub 1% to customer savings accounts.", "score": 363, "replies": [{"body": "Chase savings pays 0.01% interest rate.

The Writers' Strike: Although the current writers' strike may not involve a significant number of workers, I believe that if it persists, it has the potential to create a domino effect, impacting other workers and businesses associated with the entertainment industry. This could disrupt production schedules, decrease revenues for media companies, and have wider implications throughout the economy.\n\n2. Potential UPS Strike: I have come across information indicating a potential strike within UPS, which raises concerns about potential backlogs and subsequent economic issues. If a strike were to occur, it could disrupt supply chains, cause delays in deliveries, and result in increased costs for businesses relying on shipping services. These disruptions could have implications for various sectors of the economy, affecting both consumer spending and business operations.\n\n3. The Russian Issue: Based on my personal research, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing mounting pressure and geopolitical challenges. While it is important to acknowledge these concerns, accurately predicting their impact on the global economy is challenging. Geopolitical tensions often lead to market volatility and uncertainties, which can influence investor sentiment and potentially impact economic growth in specific regions.\n\nGiven these factors, I am apprehensive about the state of the economy and hold a pessimistic outlook. It is crucial for investors and traders to remain vigilant, carefully assessing the potential risks associated with these events. Understanding the likelihood and magnitude of their impact on specific industries or sectors can help inform investment decisions. Diversification and risk mitigation strategies should be considered in light of the uncertainties prevailing in the current economic landscape.\n\nPlease note that these are my personal opinions and observations and should not be construed as financial advice.
