No need to read a secret hidden message into it.\n\nI also consider it to be very good advice for almost all investors (including me), particularly considering the high volatility of TSLA. Several years ago (probably during the big drop in 2019), Rob Maurer of Tesla Daily lost a large amount of a heavily leveraged investment in TSLA due to a margin call (I greatly admired that he took responsibility for his investment choices and moved on). During the huge drop from TSLA's most recent all-time high, many people lost a lot of money on margin (and time-based bets), while many others sat on their stock, bought more (with cash) when the price went down, and are well prepared for likely future increase in the stock.\n\nTLDR: Elon's comment was to a person planning to buy a lot more TSLA stock over a long period of time, and was consistent with what he has said many times before - no particular reason to think it was a hidden message about Q2 2023 deliveries or earnings.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I too got jacked around a bit this year with a margin call.

There is a lot of reason to believe he might try to imply something because he has done this before when people have hyped up buying stock because X (battery day, AI day, investor day, earnings and even with Dogecoin) and just before the day he starts talking about how investing to TSLA has risks and people should be careful and most of the time the stock has tanked afterwards because the things just didn't live up to hype or expectations.

Quite often when TSLA is up (people excited) before an event, the stock goes down after the event whether Elon had dropped any hints or not, so it's hard to be sure they were really hints. \n\nIn Elon's recent tweet, he writes \"Tesla has always been a high variability stock, often with no obvious rhyme or reason\", and \"We are confident about long-term value creation, but cannot control the manic-depressive nature of the stock market.\" If I were looking for hidden messages, I might guess that the hidden message is \"I think the company is doing fine, but I suspect that the stock may drop for no sensible reason, as it has done many times before\". Whole Mars' reference to buying TSLA over a time span of months lowers the probability that the caution relates to some specific Q2 number.\n\nOf course, everyone can make their own interpretation. One of my favorites was essentially \"Elon is warning us about margin loans to let us know that Dojo is going to take a long time to ramp up\" :-).\n\nDisclaimer: I happen to have some cash at the moment, and would like to buy more TSLA if the price goes down.
