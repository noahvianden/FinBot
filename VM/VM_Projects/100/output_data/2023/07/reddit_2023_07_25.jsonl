{"title": "Microsoft earnings are out \u2013 here are the numbers", "selftext": "Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.\n\nHere are the key numbers to follow:\n\nEarnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.\n\nBased on analysts\u2019 projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won\u2019t lift salaries this year.\n\nAnalysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn\u2019t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google\u2019s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers\u2019 data, and it told developers they\u2019ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine\u2019s chatbot, and other tools.\n\nInvestors are eager for resolution in Microsoft\u2019s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.\n\nMicrosoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 19%.\n\nIn June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company\u2019s LinkedIn unit violated the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nExecutives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/25/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2023.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "159jfo6", "created_utc": 1690315686.0, "score": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 145, "comments": [{"body": "Lol top and bottom line beats. \u201cWe are not raising salaries this year\u201d had me \ud83d\udc80", "score": 487, "replies": [{"body": "The average microsoft employee more than likely has a decent salary but this is what turns your work culture to shit.
