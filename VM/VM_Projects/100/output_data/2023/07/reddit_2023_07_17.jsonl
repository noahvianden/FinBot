When safe Treasury securities offer a 5% return, investors may rightly expect higher returns, around 7-8%, for riskier stock investments. This is because investors demand a premium for taking on additional risk in the stock market compared to the safety of Treasury securities.\n\nFor stocks with little to no growth prospects, an 8% return would typically translate to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.5.

This range reflects the classic utility P/E ratio, which is associated with stable, slow-growth companies.\n\nFor stocks showing higher growth rates of 10-15% annually, a P/E ratio of 18-20 could be appropriate. Such higher P/E ratios signify investor optimism about the company's potential for growth and profitability.\n\nOverall, the relationship between interest rates, stock returns, and P/E ratios is complex and subject to various market factors.

I\u2019m interpreting it loosely here but I believe this is what is happening in markets today. People are so fixated on the classic indicators- yield curve, P/E ratios, Fed policy, and we as a society are so scarred from the GFC and dot com bubbles in recent memory that we don\u2019t dare want to make the same mistakes, and the data is so widely available, I believe trying to use these indicators when everyone else is is not going to yield strong results.\n\nLet me give you an example of why this works. For the last two years there was an absolute fever pitch of fear about inflation. That caused the fed to change its policy which caused lots of companies, particularly in the tech sector to cut back on hiring and start laying people off. Meanwhile lots of people flocked to long bonds for safety inverting the curve in the process. Essentially large parts of the economy braced for a major recession while earnings were great. That is simply unprecedented. The entire thing ran counter cyclically. \n\nNow people can\u2019t believe there wasn\u2019t a hard landing and a crash but in reality it didn\u2019t happen precisely because everyone expected it. So what does that have to do with high p/e\u2019s? Well now that everyone believes there\u2019s no opportunity where p/e\u2019s are high the market is adapting and changing. Everyone is waiting for a classic setup where markets crash and p/e\u2019s drop and we go into recession to buy so it\u2019s virtually assured that setup isn\u2019t going to come. Markets adapt to create opportunities where people think they can\u2019t possibly exist.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Goodhart's law indeed holds relevance in the current market scenario. As society becomes increasingly fixated on the traditional indicators like yield curves, P/E ratios, and Federal Reserve policies, these indicators may lose their effectiveness as reliable measures of market performance.\n\nThe collective memory of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the dot-com bubbles has left a lasting scar on investors, making them cautious not to repeat past mistakes. However, when too many investors use the same indicators to guide their decisions, it can lead to market dynamics that defy conventional wisdom.\n\nA prime example of this phenomenon is the recent fear of inflation that gripped the market. As investors became obsessed with inflation as a potential threat, the Federal Reserve adjusted its policies, leading to actions like hiring cutbacks and layoffs in certain sectors, particularly the tech industry. Surprisingly, while large parts of the economy prepared for a significant recession, earnings remained robust, creating a counterintuitive situation.\n\nThe prevalence of such scenarios demonstrates how market expectations can shape market outcomes. When everyone expects a particular setup, such as a classic market crash and low P/E ratios, the market adapts and evolves to create opportunities where people least expect them.\n\nThe belief that high P/E ratios indicate no investment opportunities can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. As more investors wait for the perfect moment to buy during a recession, the conditions for such a setup become less likely to occur.\n\nIn essence, the market is highly sensitive to collective beliefs and expectations, and investors need to be aware of this phenomenon.
