It's basically the same thing as taking a loan of $40/share against your share value, but you are paid interest on the loan, instead of having to pay interest.\n\nWhat I'd rather do is write a $120 call and if the CC is assigned I collect the original $100/share value AND $20/share on top in gains, plus the premium.  Let's say the extrinsic value premium on the call is $2 either way ($60 call or $120 call). With the DITM CC, you get $60 + $42 on assignment = $102. With the OTM CC, you get $120 + $2 = $122. This is assuming that the shares went up over $120 in both cases.\n\nThe difference is that you *always* get the $102 for the DITM CC (we assume the shares don't drop below $60), while sometimes you don't get the $122 on the OTM CC, because it doesn't go over $120.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thanks PapaCharlie9,\n\ni fully understand what you mean, i think another difference is DITM CC can reposition every month after the assignment (assume always close above the strike price) while OTM CC have more gains when going up only and if it doesn\u2019t go up the next OTM CC strike price might be lower than your position", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6246631741523743}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7887666821479797}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5774440169334412}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6242904663085938}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39950254559516907}, {"body": "hello everyone, just wondering will anyone do such way:\n\n1. do a short call strike price slightly higher than current stock price, for example strike $137.5 and current stock price is $135.2\n2. set an alarm to buy shares when the stock price reaches the strike price\n3. if the stock keeps going up you already have shares to be assigned\n4. if the stock never reach the strike price you short call is all yours and free\n5. only downside i can think of is the stock moves above strike price trigger to buy shares then keep going down until the short call expires\n\nis this some stupid way or something that\u2019s doable every month to compound the short call premiums", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You could prob do all of that without buying shares in between", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "i am worried about point 5", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02538510225713253}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32567232847213745}, {"body": "In addition to point 5, the stock could gap up.

When this number increases, it means currently unemployed people **are staying unemployed** instead of finding jobs and re-entering the workforce.\n\n**Historically, every time continued claims has increased by at least 20% from the previous year, a recession immediately follows. There have been zero cases where it increased 20% YoY without a recession.** Sometimes it is a lagging indicator (occurring in the middle of the recession), sometimes it is a leading indicator (occurring months before the recession), but there has never not been a recession when it crosses this threshold.\n\n**Continued claims also tend to lead the unemployment rate.** About half the time continued claims shoots up just before the unemployment rate does. The other half the time they move together at the same time. This appears to be one of scenarios where continued claims is giving us a warning before the unemployment rate moves.\n\n**Why YoY?** There are many ways to view these data and they all say the same thing. YoY data clearly delineates **change in trend,** which, when it comes to unemployment, is the indicator. The forward looking indicator is NOT the current rate/number, but rather change in trend--from where we were. YoY also removes variation due to season.\n\n**TLDR:** The official recession start date will be during the second half of this year--possibly as soon as the next month or two.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "14ps7jn", "created_utc": 1688412143.0, "score": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|2701|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xpjmk2/updated_spy_valuation_from_the_king_of_valuation/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: the recession has started already and will be official by end of 2020.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "2020?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "2020.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8634039163589478}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11764474958181381}], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Time to fire up the money printer.", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "I think they're going to let this one ride for a little while.
