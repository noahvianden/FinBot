If August's test data is terrible, I probably won't be holding out for my $110.\n\nI might buy ABC restaurants with an exit event of \"when it spikes after the sportsball strike ends\".\n\nWhatever exit prices and conditions, it's perfectly fine to adjust them over time, as you have more data and can refine them.  Maybe your original PT was too ambitious, or maybe it was conceived before some major sector multiple expansion.\n\nBut in general, everybody should have at least some exit conditions in mind, even if it just boils down to \"if this thing spikes 40% in a week, I'm going to call that a win and dip out.\" \n\nToo often, people just get married to a stock, and they don't even think of selling it, even when they should.

Above that, I got lazy and just thought I'd let it ride.  Above $160 I said \"it's more than met my exit, but I really don't want to pay the tax this year, I'll sell it January even if I can't get the full $160-170.

Not to mention scandals over things that didn\u2019t matter, like antennagate or the notch.  Hindsight is 20/20.\n\nLet me address the bear case for Tesla:\n\n1. Competition will shrink Tesla margins to comparable levels to the rest of the auto industry.\n\n-I don\u2019t think this will happen.  Telsa has a couple of fundamental cost advantages over legacy auto makers.  Mainly vertical integration, manufacturing technology.  To me, Telsa margins are temporarily depressed right now since they are still in scale up mode at giga Texas and giga Berlin.  Pricing probably won\u2019t go much lower than it is now, so we will likely see margins start to recover by next year (assuming no recession)\n\n\n2.  Future growth is baked in.  \n\n-Personally I doubt it.  The company only has 4 models under one brand.  Over time they will expand the lineup and introduce addition brands.  Most auto companies have at least a luxury brand and mainstream brand and the luxury brand is where the real money is made.  Expect Tesla to build or acquire a luxury brand.  And if Cybertruck is successful I would no be surprised to see a spin-off brand that brings the Cybertruck vibe to other vehicle models.\n\n-The energy business will be bigger than most people expect, potentially bigger than the auto business.\n\n-Telsa is a leader in AI and autonomy, and there is a lot of potential upside in that.

For example Tesla said they would continue grow 50% every year the Bears took it to mean adjusted for ever previous year which is an impossible expectation.  What Tesla meant was 50% growth from that year\u2019s production.  I can\u2019t remember the number of cars.  Subtle but important difference.  This IMAO is why Tesla has more or less stopped forecasting and not introduced any new models like the \u201c2\u201d.
