Intel's nascent foundry unit saw a 307% surge in revenue to $232M.\n\nThe company also generated $454M in revenue attributed to Mobileye (MBLY), which it partially spun-off in October 2022.\n\nA consensus of analysts expected \u00a0the company to lose 3 cents per share on $12.14B in revenue.\n\nAMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose in after-hours trading following the results.\n\nLooking ahead, Intel (INTC) said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $12.9B and $13.9B, with the mid-point above the $13.28B estimate. It also expects adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, topping the 13-cent-per-share estimate.\n\nThe Santa, Clara, California-based Intel (INTC) also said it is on track to deliver $3B in cost savings this year.\n\n\"We remain focused on operational efficiencies and our Smart Capital strategy to support sustainable growth and financial discipline as we improve our margins and cash generation and drive shareholder value,\" CFO David Zinsner said in a statement.\n\nIntel (INTC) is holding a conference call at 5 p.m. EST to discuss the results.\n\nSource: https://www.msn.com/en-US/finance/-companies/intel-surges-as-q-results-show-pc-rebound-underway-strong-guidance/ar-AA1erZrx?ocid=sapphireappshare", "id": "15bd18s", "created_utc": 1690490863.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Intel is a strategically important company for the US.

But Intel 4 is pretty much all but complete (since MTL will be launching this quarter) and from everything official and speculated (rumors), it appears to be doing fine. \n\nIntel 3 is just a slightly buffed Intel 4, the risk there will be very low. \n\nIntel 20A is another tough node, but if you look at TSMC 2nm (where Intel 20A would be competing against) you would notice that the density gain between 2 and 3nm is very slight- not at all a full node jumps worth of density. It's likely Intel also does this- since they claim Intel 20A is a TSMC 2nm competitor (hence the naming). If they did do a full node jumps worth of density on Intel 20A, they would be able to claim node leadership with Intel 20A as well, which they aren't doing, rather claiming Intel 18A will do it. Essentially it's lower risk by lowering density targets. \n\nBPD is having risk mitigation by implementing it on Intel 3 first in an internal test node (debuts officially in Intel 20A) and it's very likely that just like Intel 4, Intel 20A will only feature HP logic libs (another measure to mitigate risk). \n\nAnd then Intel 18A is going to be a slight density bump on Intel 20A likely, so once again, lower risk. \n\nA lot of people forget, before the 10nm fiasco, Intel used to have the foundry crown, and it held on to that crown for a *while.* They just fucked up 10nm so badly and for so long, they fell drastically behind.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2352944314479828}], "tickers": ["nvda", "intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">but it's not at all the roadmap they gave in 2 years ago which said Intel 4 would ramp a year earlier, 2022 H2, 2023 H1 products\".\n\nYe they never said that.

The problem was that MTL was not ready on the design side for Intel to start ramping Intel 4 in 2H 2022 anyway, as you can tell by their tape in/tape out dates regarding MTL, which they announced. \n\n>Intel 3 is supposed to have H2 2023 products\n\nNope. If you are talking about GNR and SRF, they were initially Intel 4 products for 2023, now they are Intel 3 products for 2024. \n\nBTW for Intel 3, they are going to start ramping SRF as soon as Intel 3 is ready at 2H 2023 (which is what Intel claimed btw, Intel 3 manufacturing products 2H 2023) if they want to launch SRF in 1H 2024.
