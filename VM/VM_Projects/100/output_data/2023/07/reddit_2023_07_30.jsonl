Similar arguments could be made for other competitors. \n\nBy looking at the company I havent seen many problems either. Revenues are growing, and so are EPS, the debt is decreasing and the margins are quite stable. Operating income has risen a lot and the number of outstanding share has been going down. It really doesn't look bad compared to other companies in the same sector.\n\nThe biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.\n\nBonus for the strong expected economic growth of the USA, especially the states where Kroger is well established, like Texas.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "15dr560", "created_utc": 1690738068.0, "score": 166, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "Because Walmart, Target and Costco aren't grocery stores.

Their stores are dirty because they are a minimum wage employer with huge turnover and little standards if any for hiring. A bit like Amazon but without the decent unskilled pay. So affluent people do not shop there. Before the pandemic regional upscale stores were eating their lunch. Companies like Publix and Wegman\u2019s. \n\nThey\u2019ve probably clawed back some of that now, but that just puts them where they were prepandemic. I believe they are nationwide at this point?

Never enough staff, it's hard to find things sometimes if you don't know specifically where it is, and when you can find a staff member they will not walk you to the item like they used to advertise. Half the time they don't even seem to know and will just point \"over there.\"\nPublix is much nicer, cleaner, and seems to have a staff that is friendly and eager to help. Most of the Publix stores I've been to seem to be a little newer as well so that may help them seem nicer. Kroger is kind of in between. It's not unusual to not have enough registers open but that's not an always thing. Most of the other chains that have been here like Food Lion seem to have closed up. My mom always shopped at food Lion and I would occasionally take her there to get her groceries and there would be very few people there.\nI find that the prices at Kroger are lower then or comparable to Walmart, especially meat and produce, and their generic food products are actually pretty decent. Publix is considerably more expensive than Kroger but their produce is fresher and lasts longer. I'm not impressed with their meat as what I see can be bought at Kroger for much less while seemingly being similar quality. In my opinion Kroger's meat is cheaper than Walmarts as well.  The one thing about Publix besides their very high prices in my opinion is they do have interesting higher-end items that you will not see at Walmart or Kroger. And it's not just one or two items it's throughout the whole store.  I also think the deli and prepared foods at Publix are usually better than Kroger or Walmart. So I never shop for food at Walmart given the option. I try not to shop at Walmart at all. If I'm buying my regular groceries I will actually split up my trip sometimes and get most of it at Kroger and then get my produce at Publix.
