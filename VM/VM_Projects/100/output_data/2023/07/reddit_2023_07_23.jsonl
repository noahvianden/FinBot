Those lower oil prices drove many American companies to go bankrupt or reduce drilling because they cannot compete with low Saudi oil.\n\nSo what happened? As soon as the economy recovered (and it would have recovered whether Biden or Trump won), the American oil companies were found with their pants down unable to supply enough oil to meet demand.

I've also withdrawn at least 16k-20k from the portfolio this year as I sit 19% above my low.\n\nJust one month like Oct 20 to Nov 14 2022 or Jan 1 to Jan 20 would make me whole again. \n\nIt's hard to recuperate 40k while withdrawing 24k-30k/year. I guess you could say I've recuperated all of my losses at some portfolio values or most of my losses at other values. The only issue is that I've spent most of what I recuperated. I was underweight  tech until May when the Yieldmax funds came out. I sure wish I had saved the first 7 months of dividends when I was working. I would be 3 to 4% from my high. In the meantime, every day I keep grinding it out, setting myself up to bounce high during the next rally. \nFrom 147830 to 107734 to 137300 to 121k to 128k to 122 to 133087 back down to 123897.45 back up to 130,015 and back down to 128150, excluding roughly 16k in withdrawals.  \n\nSince I withdraw 1.3% sometimes up to 1.8% of the value monthly-I realize it could take me another year unless I have a 10-20% month, which happens 3 times a year to me. Its a leveraged income etn portfolio. \n\nI've been measuring the volatility of various assets..I dropped 6.9% from my July high and by simply replacing some positions with a larger,more volatile position, I was able to jump 4.9% off my Aug 22 low by September 1 after monthly withdrawals. \n\nIt's difficult but I'll keep plugging away until I get there.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6038551330566406}], "tickers": []}
