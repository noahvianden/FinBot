{"title": "Congressional Insider Trading in 2022: Using Inside Knowledge to Make Profits", "selftext": "Throughout 2022, there were a number of instances of very well timed trades among members of Congress. Let's examine a few examples.\n\nIn February, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House Republican, bought stocks in Lockheed Martin, Chevron, and NextEra Energy. Mere days later, the Ukraine conflict escalated. Other politicians followed suit, buying up oil and defense stocks before the Ukraine invasion.\n\nIn July, Nancy and Paul Pelosi sold all their Nvidia stock. By August, Nvidia was instructed by the US to limit chip sales in China and Russia, causing the stock to drop 20%. When questioned about the timing of her sale, Pelosi remained silent.\n\nSenator Thomas Carper bought bearish ETFs before significant rate hikes and CPI data from the federal reserve. Interestingly, he sits on the Senate Finance Committee, and his positions have profited.\n\nCongress members also heavily invested in semiconductors prior to the passing of the CHIPS bill and restrictions in China. This led to significant gains for them in 2023.\n\nDan Crenshaw was questioned about his stock trades, including a sale in February that brought him a 32% return. In response, he implied that trading was a way for Congress members to better themselves.\n\nIn 2022, both Pat Fallon and Tom Suozzi faced STOCK Act violations for late disclosures of trades worth hundreds of thousands, but the House Ethics Committee dismissed their cases, citing lack of clear evidence of intentional non-disclosure. Both Fallon and Suozzi continued to make late disclosures of trades throughout the year.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "14rcgki", "created_utc": 1688567779.0, "score": 716, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "FYI to anyone replying to this post (automod missed a sticky comment), make sure your comments are in regards to the stocks or stockmarket in general.\n\nAlso OP mentioned these stock companies:\n\n* Lockheed Martin, Chevron, NextEra Energy, NVIDIA, and some non specific bearish ETFs\n\nIf you'd like to discuss politics only, then see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post there regarding this topic.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just looked.

{"title": "The Inflation Nightmare Continues: Prices Soar Despite Economic Recovery", "selftext": "It's time to face the harsh reality, my fellow regards. Inflation is far from being under control, regardless of what the Federal Reserve wants us to believe. Let's take a look at the numbers: In March 2023, inflation stood at 5%, while in March 2022, it was a staggering 8.5%. This means that our everyday expenses have increased by a whopping 13.5% since March 2021.\n\n\n\nBut here's the kicker - there's no logical explanation for this rampant inflation. Last year, the world was in turmoil. Oil prices soared, commodities like wheat and corn saw unprecedented spikes, and yet we were told it was just temporary. Fast forward to March 2023, and prices have gone up again by 5%, excluding energy and food. The situation is even worse in the EU, but let's not get started on their lack of control over their own money.\n\n\n\nWhat we're witnessing now is Jpow's worst nightmare come true. Inflation has become deeply rooted in our economy. It's not just little spikes here and there anymore; it's a broad-based phenomenon that affects every sector. And the worst part? Our real wages have been declining for 24 straight months. We've taken a massive hit to our standard of living, yet no one seems to be talking about it. It's time to wake up, my regards, and demand the wage hikes we deserve.\n\n\n\nIt's clear that the Federal Reserve has missed its chance to rein in inflation. Instead of taking decisive action, they've been flirting with the idea of a soft landing, which has only made matters worse. The time for playing around is over; we need concrete steps to combat this entrenched inflation.\n\n\n\nSo, my fellow regards, brace yourselves for more price hikes and dwindling purchasing power unless we demand change. It's time to hold our employers accountable for their greed and fight for the wage hikes we need to break even. Let's not fall for the false promises of a soft landing; it's time to make our voices heard and take back control of our economy.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Inflation is running rampant, and the Federal Reserve's inaction has allowed it to become entrenched in our economy. Real wages have been declining for 24 months, and it's time for us to demand the wage hikes we deserve.
