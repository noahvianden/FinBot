In terms of ease of use and superiority of product, nobody else comes close, so market share growth is expected.  \n\nThey have a 20% market share with major metropolitan cities such as New York. But here's the biggest thing, the 30% rule. They're looking to increase their revenue by 30% year-over-year for the next three years. And if anyone that is familiar with the platform, they're leaps and bounds other payment processors within the restaurant space.\n\nAnd if anything we learn from the pandemic is people like to socialize. They like to go out to eat, especially millennials. They prefer experiences over material things. \n\nForward earnings looks strong. And because of that, they're one of the first gold miners in the pot of gold, I think if you add all those reasons, it makes a lot of sense to look at Toast.\n\nEveryone looking at Toast should know that the stock\u2019s volatility is high at the moment, so some might see this as a risky play.\n\nOne of the issues is that the qualitative advantages of their product is, so far, difficult to quantify. It\u2019s one of those products that, unless you have friends who are restaurant owners, you don\u2019t really get exposed to how much more superior their product is to the competition. \n\nThe server takes your order, & kitchen knows your order before your server leaves. All communication is done via software. Commissions on sales, if applicable, are easily done. Things like switching tables, orders, and servers are less inconvenient. The GUI is easily navigable. The handheld ordering device is well designed, to the point that servers can just regularly show the screen to the customers for clarification, which would previously be a bad idea as it would cause more confusion, while now or provides clarity in customer communication.\n\nThe stock price has gotten cheaper since IPO, from an over-depreciation that, IMO, is due for a correction. \n\nThe company is executing their growth strategy well, and revenue growth is still expected while eliminating transaction fees that makes things easier for the restaurants transfer over. \n\nI expect consolidation on the stock to happen for a bit, but for a product that has no equal at this time, I expect it to continue marching upwards. \n\nHaving a superior product is great, but the company needs to execute growth, which they are doing. \n\nNo other restaurant payment programs even come close. \n\n\nDisclaimer, I didn\u2019t own the stock until the open of today\u2019s pre-market. I have a \u201cfeeler\u201d amount invested, with a supplement to augment after it breaks out over $23 again. \n\nI had some friends who were paying attention and bought in @ the major supports around $16 & $17, and sold at around 25 last week, so using the volatility for scalping is also viable.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Nicely summarized ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.015258701518177986}, {"body": "Why is the cost of revenue so high considering its a subscription product?

As I mentioned earlier, they qualitative aspects are more difficult to quantify, which covers your concerns, but I\u2019ll continue to try my best. \n\nNobody here is new to the wonders of computer programming. It\u2019s better to go with that knowledge before going into any assumptions about what business owners have available to them.\n\nNone of what you described is new, and was in fact the old way of doing things. For any and all devices, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a common, very versatile business model. It\u2019s versatile, but not optimized. It\u2019s not that the apps don\u2019t exist. Toast is literally the progression of the needs of those apps. You can indeed just download app versions that are so-proposed that have more limited features, or use any program along a number of devices. \n\nThis whole system was, indeed, needed 10 years ago or more, and everything that you were concerned about is specifically addressed in the developments that have happened since long before then.\n\nWhen it comes to ergonomics, which does actually matter a lot for the people who use it all day, it\u2019s much better than a smart phone or a flat tablet. \n\nRuggedization isn\u2019t new. We have used ruggedized laptops in the military for decades, along with tablets and phones, used in tactical environments in both mountainous and maritime environments, such as Panasonic Toughbooks and others adjacent. It\u2019s nowhere near cheap.\n\nIs there a way to use cheaper specialized devices with superior performance? Yes, but tablets and smart phones aren\u2019t the answer, which are the opposite of being specialized. Putting an Otterbox hardcase on cheap old tablets? With cases and other modifications, using the cheapest tablets and smart phones, was still both more expensive and much worse to use. Old processors are slow, screens are shitty, and overall much more expensive. The touchscreens are old and more unreliable. \n\nThe handheld Toast devices are less like hard-cased tablets & more like a cross between a Garmin maritime compass and an Iridium satellite phone. They do not feel cheap, neither in software nor in hardware. For many reasons in its design, they are much more rarely lost or broken, further lessening the cost of doing business.\n\nWhile admitting such limited knowledge, I\u2019m perplexed why you would jump so far ahead of yourself so as to assume that the company takes advantage of people via proprietary hardware. That\u2019s quite an assumption to make from such a perspective of ignorance. \n\nOld phones and tablets were used, and let me tell you, $100 bucks a per replacement, as you mentioned, is still way too much per replacement for scaled up businesses. Nobody is stopping you from having extra Android tablets for 100 bucks a pop\u2026 it just makes you both a shitty boss (for not caring about the experience of your employees) and a shittier businessman (choosing higher expenses) instead of having less expenses with a superior experience both managing and operating the business. \n\nPeople use services such as Toast because, believe it or not, because in many cases it costs much less, saves more time, and even relieves stress to subscribe to the service. Not many programs or systems can optimize operations to the point of lessening the need to use MSFT Excel spreadsheets, which is quite an engineering feat for any program to achieve, and even better for the more efficient management of a business. If finance nerds approve of it, it\u2019s probably good.\n\n\nAs a side note, this is also why we always recommend to only INVEST IN WHAT YOU KNOW. Stick to your edge. In your case, I don\u2019t recommend you investing in stocks such as Toast, unless you yourself are convinced by your own due diligence after adequate research. \n\nJust know that if something is obvious to you regarding a field you are unfamiliar with, unless you have a habit of surrounding yourself with idiots, it\u2019s better to assume that it\u2019s also obvious to those who are familiar with the field.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07627207040786743}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07627207040786743}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.008445660583674908}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.008445660583674908}, {"body": "I view it as a convenience thing for the business.\n\nAssuming a small business owner isn't the most tech savvy or at least doesn't want to be responsible for troubleshooting devices, having equipment available through a vendor makes things easier.\n\nInstead of having to worry about buying new tablets or smartphones when they break, have a shattered screen, you have a vendor to go to.\n\nOr if a certain model that you purchased is no longer sold, you have to purchase a new one which might be slightly different.
