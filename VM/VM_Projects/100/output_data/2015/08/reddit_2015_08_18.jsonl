{"title": "I'm drunk and I want to help you guys out cause I love this subreddit", "selftext": "So, I'm sitting here sipping on some beers and I've decided that to get better at trading, I'm going to post here more often.  My decisions are out in the open for you guys to critique me and maybe learn from me.\n\nThis is going to be a long post so grab a beer.  \n\nAlright basically I'm going to start posting my analysis' and charts so you guys can see how I make my trading decisions.  I see too many of you just piggy backing on others instead of learning how to make your own decisions.  When you do your own due diligence, you have so much more confidence in being able to stay in the trade and successfully exit it also.  \n\nOk so let's begin.  I would categorize myself as a swing trader.  This means most of my positions are held from either 2-7 days for a short term swing trade or from 2 weeks to 3 months and at most 6 months for a longer term play.  I focus mainly on futures but for my posts I will try to focus more on equities because that's what most people on this sub are doing.  If I do show analysis for a futures contract it will be the ES which is the S&P 500 emini contract only because I prefer it to SPY.  For the sake of my posts, ES and SPY pretty much move the same way.\n\nNow, what equities do I trade?  Not fucking penny stocks, I\u2019ll tell you that.  I am here to make money, not feed my ego.  I'm not looking for the next best thing that's going to give me a 1000% gain overnight.  I'm looking for consistent and reliable profits from great companies.  If you're feeling like putting on more risk, then do it by trading options, not by putting your money into some shit company.\n\nHere\u2019s an example.  Note that everything is obviously clearer in hindsight.  I did however take the trade I\u2019m about to show you.\n\nStep 1.  Find a great company.  I\u2019ll start by just looking at a long term chart (at least 1 year, preferably 3-10) of a company that\u2019s pretty well known and one that I believe has a business edge over their competitors.  From the chart I\u2019m looking for a couple of things.  If we\u2019re in a bull market like we are now, then this stock better be fucking going up.  There is no exception to this.  If you can\u2019t go up when pretty much everything else is, then I am not giving you my money.  This doesn\u2019t mean that some companies don\u2019t break out of this rut and do make it big.  It means that it\u2019s unlikely and that\u2019s just not good enough for me because I work hard for my money and I\u2019m not going to just throw it away.  So let\u2019s look at Netflix (NFLX).  Honestly, i\u2019ll look at their financial statements on google finance for 3 minutes to basically determine are these fuckers going to go bankrupt or some stupid shit like that?  If the answer is no then we\u2019re good to go.  That is the extent of my financial statement/accounting numbers analysis.  I don\u2019t care about P/E ratios, EPS, revenue, short interest whatever.  What I really want to know is if this company can destroy all of its competitors and rake in the dough.  Ok so back to Netflix.  At least once a day on reddit you\u2019ll see the term \u201cnetflix and chill\u201d.  This is coming from the age group that is the most difficult to predict and market to because teenagers are fuckin nuts.  So when teenagers rave about a company, that\u2019s a good sign.  Now to get more technical.  Netflix costs $7 a month and has no ads.  Hulu plus costs $8 a month and has so many freaking ads.  They also do not have nearly as many tv shows and I believe no movies.  They also don\u2019t produce their own original content which Netflix has been killing it at.  Hulu\u2019s only plus is that they tend to have new episodes sooner while Netflix has to wait till the season is finished or whatever to negotiate a deal.  So Netflix>Hulu.  Now what about regular tv which is probably Netflix\u2019s main competitor.  Netflix will probably never surpass the number of customers that cable tv gets, but that\u2019s not the point.  The point is that Netflix\u2019s membership numbers are going up, while cable tv has been going down.  And it\u2019s not just that.  Go on google for 5 minutes and I don\u2019t think you will ever see anyone on the internet write about how they love cable tv\u2019s customer service, yet I don\u2019t hear a lot of bitching about netflix.  Then don\u2019t even get me started on the price differences.  But you\u2019re probably saying well my tv has 900 channels and netflix doesn\u2019t.  No one fucking watches 900 channels.  I\u2019d say at most you watch 10-15 different channels in a given week.  You also have to watch a commercial every 8 fucking minutes, which i\u2019m pretty sure absolutely no one is a fan of.  The only real draw back of not having tv is not being able to watch sports live, but many companies are coming up with online streaming so this problem will soon be gone.  Ok hopefully that\u2019s enough to show you that Netflix\u2019s business model is much stronger than it\u2019s competitors.  I should also note that this is just the beginning of Netflix.  We have no idea what they\u2019re going to branch into next.  TV has been around forever and it basically hasn\u2019t changed at all.  Ok that\u2019s enough for step 1.  Basically just find a company that gets shit done and one that people love and people love to talk about.  Don\u2019t just find one company.  Find around 10 that you love.\n\nIf you are having trouble coming up with companies to look at for this step, take a look at all the companies on the S&P 500 and also look at companies that you actually do business with.  I have a membership for netflix and so does pretty much everyone else I know.  To me it was a no brainer.  Another example is that I buy pretty much anything that can be bought from amazon on amazon, so again another no brainer.\n\nStep 2.  Wait for the right entry.  Just because you found the greatest company in the world doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s currently at the best price in the world for you to buy it at.  You want to buy low and sell high.  You hear all this crap about not being able to time the market and it\u2019s absolute horse shit.  You seriously think the guys making money trading just place a market order whenever and say well i\u2019m in it for the long term so it doesn\u2019t matter.  Trust me, it fucking matters.  Here are a few reasons why.  1.  The longer your money is in the market, the longer you don\u2019t have money to be able to put money into something else.  It\u2019s classic opportunity cost.  For example, if you put all your money into SPY in 2007 with the logic that, oh I\u2019m in it for the long term so my entry point doesn\u2019t matter because fuckity fuck fuck it\u2019s going to go up eventually.  Yeah you\u2019re right, you\u2019ll be in the green if your time frame is over the next 30 years.  But from 2007 to about mid 2013, your money was doing absolutely nothing for you.  Not even doing nothing, you had to watch it go down down down down.  This is psychologically painful as fuck.  Having to sit on the sidelines for 6 years because you\u2019re a dumb piece of shit for listening to r/investing is not fun at all.  What sucks even more is all the potential money you could have made by putting your money somewhere else.  Plus you lost out on a fuck ton of gains by buying at the peak instead of the bottom.  Basically you\u2019re in a lose lose lose situation unless you\u2019re looking to retire when you\u2019re 115 aka dead.  \n\nYou have to realize that everything goes up and down.  Good companies go down.  Shitty companies go up.  You have to wait for these opportunities and grab em by the throat when they finally do happen.\n\nSo how do you know when you\u2019re getting in at a good price?  Use overbought and oversold indicators.  These are probably the most common indicators in the world and they work really well on longer time frames.  I would not use them to day trade because they can stay overbought or oversold for relatively long periods of time.  \n\nSo back to Netflix.  http://imgur.com/YVJMhO9 This is a 10 year monthly chart of Netflix with a stochastic indicator in the second panel, money flow index in the third, and universal oscillator in the fourth.  Note that It doesn\u2019t show data to 2015 because I\u2019m acting like this is happening in real time.  So this first picture will have the data after my entry point blocked out because it\u2019s really freaking easy to pick out entry points in hindsight.  You will not have that luxury in real life.  You need to be able to make these decisions as they happen, not after they\u2019ve happened.  \n\nSo let me explain the indicators real quick.  In the most simplest terms, these 3 show overbought/oversold.  Stochastic is really really well known and you can look up exactly how it works by using our friend google.  Money flow index shows how much money is moving in and out of the equity.  I honestly don\u2019t know what the fuck the universal one does, but I do know it shows overbought/oversold signals.  So how do I use these indicators?  If i\u2019m looking at a great company to go long in (buy) then I am looking for points where the company is oversold.  If it\u2019s a great company then it won\u2019t stay oversold for long so I know that that point is a great time to get in.  I use all 3 of the indicators to find the best point of entry.  Stochastics is a lagging indicator so I use that one more for confirmation.  Money flow index is my baby.  This is my go to for looking for major imbalances in price.  The universal oscillator is better on shorter time frames so I don\u2019t use it for a lot of entries for equities because I tend to hold equities longer than futures contracts, but again it does help a lot and makes me more confident in my decisions.  So go back to the picture and look at the green vertical line that shows the low point of the money flow index confirmed by universal oscillators low that happened previously.  Stochastic\u2019s hasn\u2019t completely bottomed out yet but it\u2019s pretty damn close which is a good sign momentum will be swinging the other way soon. \n\nSo now you have enough fundamental and technical analysis to go in.  You can enter a position by using options or just straight buying equities depending on your risk tolerance.  I would start with just buying the stock outright because there\u2019s a lot more information you need to know to trade options like decay, the greeks, picking the right date, picking the right strike price and stuff like that.  I am not an expert at options so when I want to go hard I tend to trade futures instead.  My point is just make sure you\u2019re comfortable with what you\u2019re doing.  Ok so back to the entry.  There are two things you need to come up with.  The right entry limit price, but more importantly the right stop loss price.  The right entry limit price won\u2019t be hard to determine because you\u2019re already going in when the equity is over sold.  Just try to get in on a down day and you\u2019ll be getting in at a good price.  What\u2019s way more important though is the price at which you say fuck it I\u2019m wrong and I\u2019m not going to lose any more money on this trade aka your stop loss price.  This is more of an art than a science.  I don\u2019t want to get too technical with my first post but you want your stop to be below a major support but not at the major support.  Don\u2019t put it one cent below the support, you need to give it some room.  Trust me, you don\u2019t want to get stopped out when you were right about all your analysis and price eventually went up but just had too tight of a stop so you made nothing.  This is a way shittier feeling than getting stopped out because you were wrong about your analysis.  \n\nSo let\u2019s say you entered at $7 which is perfectly reasonable if you followed the previous steps.  You want to then put your stop at around $5 because the market showed a lot of support around $6.  This doesn\u2019t mean you always put your stop 2 dollars lower than your entry price.  Please don\u2019t fucking do this.  Another stupid thing to do would be to say, \u201cok I only want to risk 5% of my account on this trade so I\u2019ll put a stop where If i\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll lose 5%.  Yes you should definitely be using risk management in your trades but risk management shouldn\u2019t determine your stop.  You should determine the stop first, and then use your risk management to determine how many shares you can buy.  \n\nNow this second picture (http://imgur.com/ce0mnIi)  will show you the rest of the story after the entry signal which was the green line.  As you can clearly see, SHIT WENT UP YO.  So now we come to step 3.\n\n\nStep 3.  Exiting your position.  \nI use the same indicators that I used for my entry to help me determine my exit.  Now instead of looking for when your stock is oversold, you want to look for when it\u2019s overbought.  So again, I want my money index flow to be maxing out, my universal oscillator to confirm it, and then my lagging stochastics to be on the way up but not maxed out.  Wait for a day when everything is green and gtfo with your money.  Don\u2019t use fucking hope to determine your exit point.  Don\u2019t use fucking msnbcs bull shit to determine your exit.  Don\u2019t listen to your grandma or even WSB.  Just listen to the indicators and you\u2019ll get out at a great price.  I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll always get out at the very very top but you\u2019ll get out with getting at least 80% of the move which is pretty damn freaking good.  My exit would have been the red line which is where money flow index was maxed out.\n\nNote: As you can see Netflix went up significantly more within the next year and a half.  However, I would not have held it for that long simply because my trading time frames are not that long.  I would have waited for the next oversold period to enter again, but I wouldn\u2019t sit there and wait it out.  This might just be personal preference.  \n\nStep 4.  Buy yacht/beer/weed/house/car, pay off student loans, buy your girlfriend a gift, or don\u2019t spend any money and just wait for the next opportunity.  I tend to pick the best of both worlds.  I\u2019ll go out and have fun for the weekend, but not blow it all.  It\u2019s ok to celebrate a win, but it\u2019s pretty damn fucking stupid to waste it all.  You want your money to grow and spending money is basically the biggest fuck you that you can do to your money.  \n\nOk so I know this post was long as fuck but hopefully some of you read the whole thing.  This is pretty much my most basic analysis I use for going long in equities.\n\nSome frequently asked questions that you\u2019ll probably have:\n1.  What program am I using for charting/indicators?\nThink or swim.  Put 1 dollar in a TD Ameritrade account and you can use this program.  I think it\u2019s the best basically free software out there for charting.  I wouldn\u2019t use it to day trade ever but for swing trading/ long term trading it gets the job done.\n\n2.  Why should I listen to you?\nI\u2019m not saying I am the greatest trader of all time and everything I say is the word of god.  I\u2019m not saying that if I enter a trade you should automatically do so also.  I\u2019m trying to get you guys to trade DIFFERENTLY.  Most of what you guys are doing just isn\u2019t working at all.  So stop fucking doing the same shit over and over!!!!  The problem isn\u2019t the market, the problem is YOU.  My strategy is basic af, but it works.  There is a huge difference between a winner and loser and don\u2019t you ever fucking forget it.  Become a winning trader by learning to think and execute like a winning trader.  This post will hopefully be a step in the right direction for everyone.  \n\n3.  Are you rich?\nNo, I lost my grub stake learning how to day trade futures (about 15k).  I was forcing myself to be something that I\u2019m not.  Guys, this is about making money and absolutely nothing else.  Find what makes you money and milk that shit as much as you can.  Don\u2019t go off and do something because that\u2019s what the pros do or that\u2019s what the rest of this subreddit is doing.  In the end nothing matters except if you are consistently profitable.  \n\n4.  Why did I make this post/future posts?\nI kind of answered this in the beginning but I\u201dll go more in depth.  This is probably the first time I actually physically wrote out step by step what I do, so that right there benefited me a lot.  Secondly, it honestly breaks my heart looking through some of these posts and seeing what you guys do.  I fucking love this subreddit and I want you all to actually eventually get your yachts or what not.  The people here have the balls to actually risk their money and I think they deserve to get a return just for that because let\u2019s face it most people are complete utter fucking pussies.  I have respect for people that dream bigger than being mediocre so maybe this will inspire some of you guys to really learn about how to become profitable instead of just being another guy that swears that the market is rigged and that no one can make money.\n\nGood luck guys.  Feel free to ask me questions about anything.  I\u2019ll do my best to answer them.

It seems like you're implying a month to a couple months, maybe 6 max? \n\n2) What would you say are the biggest risks associated with this strategy?

Every strategy has losing trades.  That's why I have stop losses in place.  So the biggest risks are that you pick a bad company from the get go, you weren't patient enough to wait for the right entry, your stop was too tight so you didn't let the trade play out, you didn't place a stop at all and now you're hoping that things change when they probably won't, and using this during a bear market/range market.\n\n3.

You don't get fucked on interest for \"borrowing\".  3.  The margin for a contract is the same for going long as it is for going short.  So if my broker requires 5k to go long then they require 5k to go short too.  If you want to buy 1 stock that costs $100, then it'll cost about $105 with commission.

We've been in the greatest bull market in the history of mankind these past 6 years and this company is trending downwards.  That's not a good sign.  Again, I'm not saying that you can't make money by buying this company.  I'm just saying there are better companies out there to give your money to.  \n\nstep 2: entry/look at indicators\nThis stock just made quite a big run up which is not when I want to buy something.  I want to buy before the big run up, not after it.  Buy low sell high.  Also you can see that pretty much every other time it made significant gains, it came crashing back down a couple of months later.  Lastly, all the indicators are at extremely overbought conditions, so you will be buying this stock at a premium.  \n\nstep 3: exit\nNo exit because you shouldn't have entered to begin with", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04852328449487686}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.027763361111283302}, {"body": "tldr - ur 1 hammered fuck, i didnt read a single line", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07927796244621277}, {"body": "How do I get started in these stuffs ?", "score": -12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26403069496154785}], "tickers": ["nflx", "amzn", "nflx"]}
