When charting on the Think or Swim platform, what are the main indicators that you analyze to predict the movement of a stock? E.g. Volume, RSI, moving averages, etc.\n\n2. Do you have any personal rules that you follow in regards to investing? I.e. \"only risk 2% of your total portfolio on any one trade\" or \"don't trade emotionally\".\n\n3. Which trading systems or strategies have you modeled your own strategy after? What educational resources did you find to be the most informative when you first started off at 22 years of age?\n\nThanks in advance!", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "1.

When i first started it may have meant something, but now i use way way less than 2% anyway.  Most of my trades cost $2k-$15k to get into.
