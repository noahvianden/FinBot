{"title": "PSA: WSB Bot Initial Release!", "selftext": "Okay, I think I have enough features working to do an initial release. I would have a lot more time to work on this if someone invited me to stay on their yacht for a week or two wink wink. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**General notes:**\n\nThe bot currently runs in 1+min loops. Reddit's API also has a limit of 30 calls per minute (every 2 seconds). Since I don't expect a HUGE influx of usage, I have not optimized this part, the bot will essentially wait 2 seconds after each call, and then wait 1 minute after processing all messages it has received. Therefore, if the bot receives 10 messages in that period, you could be waiting up to 2min 20sec to get a response. I feel this is reasonable, but am wondering you guys feedback, I could easily shorten the time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How to call the bot**\n\nYou can either send a direct (private) message to 'wsbbot' or call the bot from a comment by using '+/u/wsbbot' followed by your action (don't include the '').You also should be able to put any text before or after the syntax and it should still pick it up. If you make more that 1 request from the same message, it should only respond to the first request.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Currently working features to test:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Buy/Sell stock or options*\n\nUsage: {buy|sell} {ticker} at ${price}\n\n**The $ is now optional**\n\nexample: `buy 1000 AMD at $2.29`\n\nexample 2: `sell 1000 AMD at $30`\n\nExpected result: The bot should respond with your current position and realized p/l for that ticker\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Check stats of a user*\n\nUsage: userstats {username}\n\nexample: `userstats kevintb7`\n\nExpected result: The bot should respond with the total profit for that user, as well as the current open positions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Check stats of a ticker*\n\nUsage: tickerstats {ticker}\n\nexample `tickerstats AMD`\n\nExpected result: The bot should respond with the total WSB realized P/L for that ticker, current overall WSB position, and current open positions with the user, quantity and price of each.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Show recent Trades*\n\nUsage: show recent trades\n\nexample: `show recent trades`\n\nExpected result: The bot should respond with a table with the 10 most recent trades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Show Top Traders*\n\nUsage: show top traders\n\nexample: `show top traders`\n\nExpected Result: The bot should respond with a table of up to the 15 top traders based on Return on Risk Average. The bot will currently return regardless of whether a trade is verified or not, but will give the user that info. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Next Features I'm Working**\n\n*Cheaters*\n\nCurrently, people can cheat. I have code so the bot verifies the trade price against yahoo finance every night. However, it only really shows that in the recent trades feature which is kinda useless, because it cant verify a trade made until after 12AM UTC (when yahoo updates data). I didn't want this to hinder people too much, so I didn't really incorporate it in any of the logic. I think I will just add a small thing to the 'userstats' command that shows how many times a particular user 'cheated'. I haven't tested this for options symbols, not sure if it will work. \n\n*Betting*\n\nThis will be a feature entirely different than the trades. Instead you will bet that a ticker hits a price by a date. The bot will check yahoo finance every night, and keep track if you are right/wrong. As well as your total gains when right? Maybe? I'm curious if people will like this better than the current functionality of trading. If so, anyone that wants to help with the logic please message me. \n\n*Help command*\n\nObviously, if you message the bot help, it should respond with something helpful.\n\n*Copy trade/bet feature*\n\nQuick way for people to jump on the bandwagon. Once released, users will use the bot in the comments. I want to add a feature so you can just reply to the bots response saying \"copy\" or \"Opposite\" (maybe) and the bot will copy the bet/trade to your profile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMods, please message me if there are any issues, I meant to get formal permission first, but a few of you testing were mods i believe. Please message me with any questions. I will comment this post with some examples.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSpecial thanks to those of you that tested:\n\ncryptorific\n\ndetain12\n\ndocOctober\n\nGunpoint_Rajah\n\nholder_account\n\nJagerhunt\n\nmalisam\n\ntheycallme1\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** The information this bot provides is for amusement, do not use as investing advice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: it appears the bot is getting rate limited severely on commenting (needs to wait 10min). It needs more karma, but it will respond very quickly to direct messages FYI.\n\nEDIT 2: The $ is now optional. Also fixed a few bugs, and a grammar error, thanks all!\n", "id": "3awqod", "created_utc": 1435114872.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Processed Trade: Buy 1000000 **YOLOSWAGGAINZ** at 4.2\r\n\r\nCurrent Position in **YOLOSWAGGAINZ**: **1000000** at and average price of **$4.2**\r\n\r\nRealized Gain/Loss in **YOLOSWAGGAINZ**: **$0**", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "havent coded the 'copy' and 'opposite' yet, will do soon", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.050783734768629074}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14398732781410217}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14398732781410217}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.117498017847538}, {"body": "+/u/wsbbot  Buy 1000 AMD at $2.61", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Processed Trade: Buy 1000 **AMD** at 2.61\r\n\r\nCurrent Position in **AMD**: **1000** at and average price of **$2.61**\r\n\r\nRealized Gain/Loss in **AMD**: **$0**", "score": 19, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "+/u/wsbbot Buy 100000000 AMD at $2.61", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Processed Trade: Buy 100000000 **AMD** at 2.61\r\n\r\nCurrent Position in **AMD**: **100000000** at and average price of **$2.61**\r\n\r\nRealized Gain/Loss in **AMD**: **$0**", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "+/u/wsbbot userstats dsbtc", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "User Stats For: **dsbtc**\r\n\r\nTotal Profit:**$0**\r\n\r\nCurrent Open Positions:\r\n\r\nTicker | Quantity | Average Price\r\n:-:|:-:|:-:\r\nAMD | 100000000 | 2.61", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "+/u/wsbbot sell 100000000 AMD at 500.00\n\nedit: fuck", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "need the '$', lot of people are messing that up, I think im going to make that part optional.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2400980442762375}, {"body": "and now the '$' should be optional.
