Not only that, but incredibly efficient -- much more than any hybrid, and a good amount more than any electric car.  The range is drastically higher than any electric car out there.  The batteries rapidly charge faster than any electric car.\n\nBasically, the Tesla is now the fastest and most efficient production vehicle. Ever. They proved the technology is beyond feasible.  They have the eyes and ears of every car enthusiast right now, which prior to Tesla - electric cars were thought of little hippie oversized golf carts.  \n\nThey've been around only a few years.  They'll continue to get more efficient and higher performance.  Combustion vehicles have been around over 100 years, and quarter million dollar+ exotic cars aren't even as fast as a $100k sedan.  \n\nElon set out to prove it wasn't a fad and that electric can not only be more efficient than combustion, but higher performance.  His car is the top of both now.  Toyota, Ford, Honda, BMW, etc have billions and years ahead of them, and they couldn't do that.  Chevy went bankrupt trying to do something like it with the Volt... after trying/failing multiple times in the past.  And the Volt is basically just a glamorous hybrid in power and efficiency.  \n\nSo is it a good investment? Fuck yes it is.  Short term? No. It's an innovative company.  Every announcement from Tesla that comes out brings them higher demand from consumers saying, \"JUST GET US THE GOD DAMN MODEL 3 ALREADY!\" \n\nThe only limitation by the time the 3 comes out that Tesla will have is production.  In a few years, a sub $40k car that runs on pure electric with a highly supported infrastructure for a car that does 200-300 miles per charge?\n\nElon is fighting a *huge* establishment. He's fighting the most American industry of the 20th century.  He's embarrassing them right now.  He has the hearts of the generations under 40.  There's very few vehicles out there on the horizon outside of vaporware that can hold a candle to Tesla's technology.  BMW would be just about the only one at this point.\n\nSo why is it a great investment? I wouldn't dump your life savings into it, but a decent amount to it would be great.  If the X and especially the 3 succeed, Tesla has potential to be the Apple of the automotive industry.  But there's already a big enough established infrastructure and customer base that Tesla isn't going anywhere in the near future.  Worst case scenario is they get purchased, and your investment does fine anyways.  \n\nFinally, those doubting the powerwall? That's a huge factor as well.  Once they start selling those, major businesses that have *any* sort of renewable energy or producing their own energy (such as hospitals with generators and such) will make a huge use of them.  \n\n**tl;dr**: Tesla has major potential to be an incredible investment so early.  You may not see a huge return within the next year... 2 years.. hell, even 5 years - but I believe it'll be the next company in 10-20 years that people look back and say, \"fuck - I should I put a few bucks in it back in the 2010s.\"", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Awesome post.

The other is Tesla is going up against huge companies like gm, who are in a completely different league than Tesla. How fast can Tesla scale up their production to pump out those 3's? Will the other manufacturers be able to put out equal cars in much larger volumes? Will oil/gas companies respond with margins cuts to slow down the sale of electric cars?\n\nThere are a lot of questions and worries, but also glimpses of a potential titan.
