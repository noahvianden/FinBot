A platform that could help a script writer organize the story, that could be storyboarded for the director, and a project management tool for costs, locations, media.... \n\nBasically rather than build another Adobe Suite for the creative work people in the industry need better tools for managing a bigger production than their college final project production. \n\nNow... this could end up shocking the streaming wars. Because now Netflix is in the picks and shovels game, not just the gold mining. It also means Netflix could end up moving to a Premier based model. \n\nShoot your movie using our tools, premier it on Netflix of this negotiated deal, then you can either sell the rights to Netflix content or you can go and sell it to Disney/Amazon/Apple+ etc. \n\nThink about the world wide audience in that regard, what's going to be more popular than all cable and streaming combined? YouTube. \n\nThis is essentially the true competitor to YouTube. Because it takes all the quasi-professional shit, and makes it a true show / movie / short / documentary. \n\nNow... compare this with Disney's person. \n\nGreat talk, but half the time she was razzing strawmen executives talking about how slow they are to adapt. That for the very first time the Disney people weren't thinking of people in huge conglomerated \"audiences\" but instead as individual \"users\" each with their own ideas, behaviors, etc. \n\nWOW, literally a decade late. \n\nI think Disney as a whole is figuring shit out in tech, and they're getting there, but they've been a household name long enough and had such ridiculous talent there to draw more that their lead is basically 100% on the actual creatives... and a lot of those people are getting really old and retiring.

{"title": "[UPDATE: I didn't sell] I've decided to close out my 9.5yr old 3x leveraged ETFs position next week. It's not YOLO enough for r/wallstreetbets, but I thought I'd share.", "selftext": "Hello, clowns. I'm the guy from this thread last month\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dk7wh1/long_time_lurker_here_ive_decided_to_close_out_my/\n\nTLDR - I bought $170,000 worth of triple leveraged etfs FAS and SPXL in May 2010 in the depths of the Great Recession. Held for almost ten years now. I convinced myself last month to finally take profits and close both trades within a week, then valued at over $1,350,000. My reasoning was entirely political, that I doubted any resolution of the China trade war anytime soon and my conviction that the market would tank at first sign Trump, Warren or Biden would be the clear favorite to win, that the further left the Democratic candidate would be, the harder the selloff due to the looming, structural tax and budgetary changes.\n\nWhat made me change my mind to not sell that week? The sudden emergence of moderate candidates in the Democratic primary. In particular, the rise of Mayor Pete in the polls in Iowa, he went from firmly in the pack of 12 to into the lead while Biden has faltered pretty dramatically. Pete hates Medicare for All and he's called out Warren's lack of substance in her ultra progressive program proposals. It's clearly resonating with fiscally conservative but independent voters in the state. The second thing that happened is that Mike Bloomberg has filed for the Democratic primary in Alabama and Arkansas, with several more to come if he does decide to run. Bloomberg is as establishment an anti-tax, pro-business moderate as you can get, I'm biased in that I've wanted him to run for over 10 years now. Bloomberg is polling pretty terribly so far but I think he has the money and the time to make a big dent in the Super Tuesday states in March if he declares soon.\n\nSo, by holding off a month, my trade is up another ~$200,000 currently at around $1,550,000. We got the final Fed cut everyone was planning for and earnings were surprisingly solid, everyone's refound their risk appetite I guess.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AmNrICF.jpg\n\nThe new plan now is to hold into Super Tuesday, I'm willing to pay to find out how Pete and Bloomberg do in the states that matter. If Warren or Bernie emerge as the clear leaders, I am out. Trump being impeached and tried by the Senate would not impact markets much, imho. I have since adjusted my stops higher to the prices FAS and SPXL were at when I made my original thread, so worst case scenario I'm selling close to where I originally intended.
