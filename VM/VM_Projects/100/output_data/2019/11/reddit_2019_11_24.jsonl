This will not change barring China building a multi-trillion dollar navy and somehow creating several military bases in the Western hemisphere, which I don't really see happening.\n\nIn addition, military spending, while excessive, does drive innovation in the private sector, so the money is not entirely wasted.

That\u2019s why other nations simply build cheaper counters. The US navy is about influencing nations without equal technological footing. No need to conquer an airport when you can carry an airport. The Navy adds nothing to the USAs world superpower position. It just makes poor countries less likely to refuse negotiation.  If World war 2 can be associated with heavily armored battleships and large cannons it\u2019s like a boxing match. Modern Naval warfare is about team dodge ball. One hit kills. It\u2019s all about range, speed of positioning, and numbers. Other nations build what can counter nations with equal technological prowess, but the US builds what can easily allow it to take poor people from its home land and scream at them to enhance obedience while rewarding people for doing marathon runs more than people who save lives in combat.

RUSSIA, in two years, has confirmed 85,000 terrorist kills. The DoD spends but the results that are brought towards world stability are overshadowed by other nations efforts.\n\nProjecting power abroad is certainly an advantage. However, the problem still arises with the way the military is structured. Posing as a meritocracy but thinking that a federally accredited degree is Weaving and Knitting makes someone more worthy of leadership than a cognitive reasoning score that outperforms 99.999% of the population shows that the focus is on expendability. Why risk that which is a severe loss to lose when you can risk what\u2019s already worthless and therefore gain? That\u2019s the philosophical stance and it\u2019s gone to the point of HURTING people who are actually worthwhile.  \n\nI agree though. The US isn\u2019t on the losing ground despite spending so much. However, for the amount spent, equal footing is not acceptable. No one pays the price of ten cars for the performance specs of a typical civilian sudan. Military research does drive innovation. That\u2019s true. \n\nWashing machines, dryers, elevators, refrigerators, touch screen devices, electronic communications, all innovations that aren\u2019t top secret military projects due to American quality of life initiatives supported by government legislation. \n\nTook the world 10,000 years to go from sword type A to sword type B.

Electric vehicles will soon be able to drive without a driver. \n\nThe US has... the victory in advancing humanity.

Like nuclear reactors, they generate electricity from nuclear energy, but differ in that they do not use a chain reaction.  Compared to other batteries, they are very costly, but have an extremely long life and high energy density, and so they are mainly used as power sources for equipment that must operate unattended for long periods of time, such as spacecraft, pacemakers, underwater systems and automated scientific stations in remote parts of the world.Nuclear battery technology began in 1913, when Henry Moseley first demonstrated the beta cell.

Most of the sources for RTGs fission byproducts but the vast majority are not good for fission themselves. RTGs power is very different from nuclear fission power.

RTGs use the heat given off by extraordinarily radioactive elements/materials for a direct conversion of heat to electricity.  It's extremely inefficient even with the newer tech out there. \n\nIn the past Sr90 and Pu238 were used by the Soviets and the US for their RTGs. Both are extremely toxic to humans. The several meters of top soil that were removed around Fukushima and Chernobyl powerplants were done because of elements such as Sr90.
