They\u2019re still avoiding questions regarding whether it\u2019ll drive like a Mustang or not, only claiming that it\u2019ll \u201cinspire\u201d you like a Mustang.\n\nHonestly seems like Ford built a wagon, added plastic cladding, lowered it, and called it a day since then they could call it a crossover for the masses. It\u2019s like half the other crossovers on the market, except most sit slightly higher than sedans/hatches/wagons do. In this case, you don\u2019t even have the \u201cbenefit\u201d of added ground clearance since Ford clearly wanted to engineer around the high centers of gravity that plague crossovers.\n\n... and even then it\u2019s doubtful that this thing will drive as nimbly as a Mustang. The Model 3 feels quite heavy as it is around corners, despite being one of the most well-rounded cars on the market, due to the immense weight of the batteries underneath. There is little chance this Mach-E drives anywhere near as well an actual Mustang with the bloated weight of a crossover body. Hell, people complain even now that the current Mustang is too bloated and heavy around corners.\n\nThe reviews are going to be brutal given the \u201cMustang\u201d branding.
