The same tweet actually got analman famous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautifulname: Her story is a sad one and I will provide a very short summary. While in China, her dad died and she received either workers compensation or life insurance money. She wanted to leave China tho and fought her family in court for her share of the money. Also, her dad's boss was sexual harassing her. When she got the money, she applied at a college in NY and left. She then used the money she got to pay tutions and the remaining went straight into AMZN calls. As it was declining, she added more and more money into buying calls. Anywho, she lost everything she put in and was suicidal. She planned to kill herself as she didn't have the funds for next semester and didn't want to go back to her family obviously. I think she is still alive, I reached to her a while back and don't know how she is doing now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYY kid: This 13 year old got the most upvoted post on this sub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat amex guy: A month ago, someone borrowed money from Amex and his plays didn't work out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat oil guy: A banned user decided to make a new user account to participate in this sub. He then makes a post predicting the price of oil and if it was correct, well he made money. He then makes another post stating he was right and was obviously excited. No proof tho, we just had to take his word. Mods ask for proof in the dms and he sends out this very long ass comment as why he won't and is taking an ethical stand and how he is going to be banned again. TBH I didn't even read that shit and who would? all the mods asked was pictures. But the mods accept his reasoning and let the post stay. The comments were talking about how much he made etc.. when this dumbass replies to one of the comments and sends a picture. Now this picture is obliviously altered and everyone noticed the calculations (from his account) didn't add up. It was the same thread as the mod who asked for pictures. Cant make this shit up, Lmao he got ban within seconds and the post is locked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat wolf guy: just google or type in youtube \"wolf bets apple\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*This is what I remembered.
