It is all about the probability the market is giving a particular event. For example, when the giga factory was announced, there was X% chance that this will lead to higher production and $X higher revenue/profit. The chance isn't a 100% because the factory isn't finished and producing, so something could go wrong between now and when it is finished. The market determines what that % chance has of occurring and the expected dollar value is by buying and selling shares of stock after the announcement.\n\nFor example, let's assume a simple world where the factor either works perfectly or fails entirely. If the market believes that stock prices were to rise $100 if the factory works perfectly and the stock rises $50 after the news of the factor being built, then the market believes that there is a 50% chance that the factory works and 50% chance the factory fails. That $50 stock value increase after the news announcement is the priced-in amount. Whether or not something is priced-in depends on what the expected $ value increase will occur from the news and the % chance the news will occur. So when most people say something is priced in the market is already assigning a near 100% chance to the outcome so there is no positive gains that can be captured.\n\nFurthermore, the saying \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" is based on the idea that rumors have a less than 100% chance of occurring so the market is only pricing in a small amount of the positive value of the event. Once the event is confirmed through news then the market is setting the odds at near 100% so there the event has been fully priced in.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That break down of the buy the roumer sell  the news really tied it all together but that example was perfect!This was a great break down, really understand it alot more now, thanks!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40564438700675964}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5092008113861084}, {"body": "Nothing is ever fully priced in", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37084442377090454}, {"body": "I hate to spoil it for you, but he\u2019s retarded", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You know this is WSB, right?

If it becomes massively less/more likely then the price will change abruptly.\n\nHence it goes up on the rumour of positive announcements and then down when the news is invariably less positive than some who have bought thought it would be.
