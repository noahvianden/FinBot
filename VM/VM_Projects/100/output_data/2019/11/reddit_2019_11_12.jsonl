Nothing I saw changed my thesis, so despite the emotional rollercoaster I didn't sell.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "It's been a weird experience for me.  I generally play it very safe when it comes to money but after getting my Model S I gradually became more and more convinced that Tesla's cars would become a huge hit.  I initially bought shares for 10K, thinking \"oh well, if I lose this, it's only 6% of my portfolio\".  I started following Tesla news more closely, and found this sub.  I lurked here for a while before I started commenting and gradually got involved in more of the discussions.  I also started reading RealTesla for a while, to make sure I wasn't just ignoring the potential problems and bear theories.\n\nThe more I read, the more convinced I became of my own thesis, and the more it seemed clear to me that the bear thesis and theories were bullshit.  That bear thesis is becoming smaller and smaller over time and and a lot of the bear theories have never came to fruition.  In a year or two, the bear thesis will be limited to \"an earthquake can hit the Freemont factory\".\n\nSo over time, despite the bad headlines and the bad performance, I've increased my initial investment about 9-fold and it's now 52% of my portfolio.  I never though I'd take such a risk, but even if I lose my entire TSLA investment, my life wouldn't really change in any way.  If I had listened to the bears who say \"why not wait to get into the stock until the fundamentals are better?\", I wouldn't have been up the way I am now (41%).\n\nSo yeah, interesting and weird experience... All of the bad headlines and the hilarious looney tunes theories have only strengthened my belief in Tesla's potential.

They talked about neuralink for ~60% of the interview, but here's some things Elon said during the ~7 minutes they talked about FSD:\n\n- Probability of accident in stop-and-go traffic is already much lower in autopilot than with human drivers. \n- Approaching FSD the way you would teach a person to drive. Starting in the parking lot and moving from there (I personally don't think that analogy holds with the highway, but  I think the point he's making is that they're working up from the bottom and down from the top, sorta)\n- Traffic lights and stop signs are the big missing pieces. Interesting that Elon says they could always geocode stop sign locations and use vision to eliminate any gps error. He definitely seems open to geo-coding stop signs/stop lights. \n- Elon thinks the hardest part about FSD is representing your surroundings accurately in vector space.

Comparatively the speed limit geocoding is significantly more complex and low-value.\n\nI'd argue they are fundamentally different use cases with different LOE and different strategic scenarios... if your logic is \"they can't geo-code speed limits\", that's not a full enough thought process for me to get behind.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.584227442741394}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "haha I never thought about that parallel about learning in a parking lot.

In most recent history, it took 4 years and 8 years to recover (get back to even) from those losses.

Our time is finite, so whether we try to \"time\" the market or not, a certain degree of timing is built in anyway. Imagine retiring after a bubble burst. Imagine being 45 years old in 2000. 13 years later when you're 57 and ready to retire, your performance over that period was exactly 0%.

Because debts generally have higher interest rates than your interest on savings. So having $1000 in saving generating 1% is wasted if you have $1000 in debts appreciating by 5%.\n\nBuild up low risk (savings accounts) then low medium (such as cash ISA). Then you can think about medium high risk like stocks and shares ISAs, mutual funds and ETFs.\n\nOnly invest into options what you would be happy to see increase or decrease in value.

Leave this place and never return.\n\nThat said, here is the approach I generally take.  For context, I'm 32, married, with no kids, and work in tech, so my Personal Risk Tolerance is pretty high (although probably pretty low by WSB standards).  Hopefully this gives you enough ideas of things to Google.\n\n1.  If you have any debt, pay it off before you do any investing.  The interest rates on debt are likely higher than you'll be able to earn in returns consistently.\n\n2.  When it comes to picking stocks, there are a few guidelines I follow.  First, I have to like the products or services, or otherwise believe that the company has a strong market advantage.  Examples: I fucking love Costco, so I own Costco, and I'm bullish on their move into China.  I think NVDA has a market advantage in the server GPU market, and as more companies start looking for AI solutions, they're in the sole position to benefit.  The second guideline is that whatever you're buying should not be too expensive.  The usual way to measure this is by looking at the ratio of the stock price to the company's earnings per share.  This is called the PE ratio.  If the PE ratio is large, this generally means investors are pricing in future increases in earnings to the stock price; if the PE ratio is small this usually means that investors are not expecting much growth from the company.  Finally, the company's management should have a track record of success.  Check out the board members on LinkedIn and see what they've done in the past, if their profiles allow it.  How did their past companies do? Success tends to follow successful people.\n\n3.  Anyone can make money in a rising market.  The harder part is not losing money when the markets are falling, or at least limiting your downsides.  This is called \"hedging\".  You should always have a general idea of how much value your portfolio will lose if the S&P drops by 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, etc.  This is done using the *beta* of the stock, which is the correlation coefficient of the stock with the overall market.  Generally, you can think of a stocks beta as: if the S&P drops by 1%, then this stock drops in price by beta%.  If your portfolio is too risky, you will feel pain during a market contraction.  You can limit your beta exposure by purchasing assets which are negatively correlated with the market, such as gold futures, or SPY puts.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This is going to end poorly and probably on CNBC. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0620400495827198}, {"body": "Do yourself a favor and forget this sub", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06806923449039459}, {"body": "If there's one thing that's helped me understand the markets then it's this.
