AirPods Inc could conceivably see a similar ratio of gross to net margins (72% gross, 19% net). This would make their net profit around $3.8B, not $7B. This also doesn't account for licensing fees and other costs of building into another companies ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly, a 25 P/E is **really** high for hardware companies. Historically when Apple was considered one, it traded closer to 8-9 P/E. This is in line with other accessories manufacturers like Belkin.
