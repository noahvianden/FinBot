{"title": "It's scary to trade options on amounts of money that feel large.", "selftext": "My portfolio is now at about $800, which is an achievement for me considering I've put $850 into the account over time and lost about $600 while I've been learning.  So I've just about broken even so far, but now that I have this much money in my trading account, the idea of trading with this much money is daunting to me. (I know it's not a lot to trade with from some people's perspectives, but from my perspective this is the most I've ever traded with since starting)\n\nEvery move feels too risky, as such I'm trying to figure out what the best approach would be to proceed.\n\nI think approaching this with a diversified portfolio and low-risk moves would be the best plan of action for gradual growth and limiting potential losses.  I don't want a big chunk taken out of my account at this point, and I'm more than happy with small gains over time.\n\nBut I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this fear of trading with a large (by your standards) amount of money, or making large trades.\n\nThis last move that made my money back was a move in reaction to seeing the share value of TSLA spike up in reaction to   recent news.  At which point I opened an ATM call (with what was my entire portfolio) and in the same day I made back the money I had previously lost as I closed the call within a couple hours. (I did not want to hold overnight for fear of the share value going back down and the share value had seemed to calm down.  Consequently, I sold on a near-high point when the share value had been flat-ish for awhile)\n\nIn essence however, how do you trade with what feels like \"a lot\" of money to you?  What constitutes too much risk?  Have you ever experienced this fear of trading with a \"large\" amount of money?  What moves do you make to still make upward progress with your portfolio, but without having this fear? (or having less fear at least)\n\nThank you for reading this post, and thank you in advance for your reply if you decide to leave one.\n\nHave a nice day!", "id": "dt21uo", "created_utc": 1573152051.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Position sizing will answer most of your concerns", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!

Let me tell you, it\u2019s really tough to manage risk. I haven\u2019t found a magic formula yet, but so far I can tell you what has helped me;\n\n1. Divide and conquer. Divide your account into as many small options positions as you can, when your signal for entry triggers. Do not use all your capital for 1 single position. Go for uncorrelated trades, if possible. \n\n2. Only trade liquid options and stay close to at the money. \n\n3. Take any windfall amount quickly. Don\u2019t get greedy, don\u2019t rationalize holding longer. The goal is to make the most money with the least amount of time spent in the market.\n\n4. Ideally, get at least 2 contracts so you can scale out on a gap up (for longs). \n\n5. The best time to gamble is Thursday afternoon for Friday weekly expiration. You can get a lot of things \u201con sale\u201d. I usually look for options .20-.40 on momentum and mean reversion trades. If you get a gap in your direction the next morning, take 1/2 off. I expect those trades to either go 100% or go to 0. My risk is the amount I pay for the options.\n\n6. You can also manage risk by trading with equity instead of options, or even by using later dated options. \n\n7. Lastly (well not really, I have more but I\u2019m done for now), consider using spy puts (calls) for an overnight hedge. I want to experiment with using a 1/3 account size spy put hedge and 2/3 of my account in call positions. You just have to find the right strike and expiration for the put... the goal is protection against trump tweets and adverse trade war news.

The issue was, it was hard to know when to exit for optimal protection (I would exit too soon). Also, sometimes my positions would all be down, and the market would be up (that tends to happen when I go for the \u201cknife catching\u201d trades).

The only true answer to this question is - it depends. The very fact that you asked this question tells me that you didn't have an exit strategy (profit target) before entering the position. This is IMO one of the deadliest beginner trading mistakes which I've fallen victim to hundreds of times. Obviously you're not \"day trading\" here, but the same concept applies. What's your goal? When did you plan on eventually selling? Do you need the money now? Are you using this money to buy a house? Are you laying your future retirement on the line? Have you locked in some profits? Do you have bills to pay? Do you care if you lose every single dollar in this investment? What's your risk tolerance? Are you in pain right now thinking about this? Do you stress about this position on a day to day basis and live every second hoping and praying that this works out for you? If you are, then that means it's time to sell. There's something more important than financial capital - mental capital. I've wasted months in positions that did nothing but drain my sanity, even though they made me money. As a trader and even in life, you want to preserve your mental capital as much as possible. It's your life blood.

Waymo has been trying to make self driving cars since 2009, 10 years ago. Tesla had their big Autonomy Day in April this year and that's pretty much when they started going all in on machine learning, HW2.5 was very limited by the computer hardware and running at 21 frames per second it had to do a lot of compromises, like navigate on autopilot which uses a lot of hardcoded lane changes and rules. In September Tesla released smart summon   and it's really a proof of concept. A way to test all their neural networks and collect more fleet data in relatively safe scenarios. \n\nThe training for smart summon was all done with test data collected by Tesla themselves, they had to gather a bunch of images of curbs for collision detection and so on. Well, with a million smart summon activations, how many pictures of bikes, pedestrians, cats do you think Tesla has gathered for their collision training dataset now? If smart summon was their main objective they could improve it so much with this new data, but engineering hours and cloud time is probably better spent working on a city driving network, that has all that bike, pedestrian collision detection trained. They've already had a working test version for months, next month they could release an early release version, end of december a full release with a semi-working version. 1-3 months later a near flawless version. \n\nMany legacy automakers have only a few months ago said that full self driving is still \"many years away\" maybe by the end of next decade we will have FSD. A couple months from now they may just wake up one morning and Tesla owners can get from A to B without touching the steering wheel or any pedals. They have their billion dollar autonomy divisions still targeting over the air updates and self driving 4-5 years from now and this hits them out of nowhere.

First of all let\u2019s address the geo-fenced part. \n\nFSD is a problem that a 99% reliable solution that works everywhere is still borderline useless and will literally cause millions of accidents each year if widely deployed. On the other hand a 100% reliable solution that works in even just 1% of the locations will be extremely useful for those places. Waymo\u2019s approach relies on geo-fencing for sure, but imagine them deploying driverless taxis just in the largest 20 metropolitan areas in the U.S within the next few years, how much revenue/business do you think they\u2019d be getting? For a company like Uber most of their revenues come from places like SF, NY, LA, etc. Imagine them shipping geo-fenced taxi fleet without drivers to just NY, SF, and LA within the next 3 years. That alone would be making them tons of revenue and kill Uber/Taxi in those areas.\n\nSecondly let\u2019s discuss the \u201cminivan\u201d part. This is probably the bigger reason why Waymo\u2019s business is worth more. The fact that Waymo is *not* an auto manufacturer means they can go for the platform play, and sell their solutions to all the other automakers out there. Despite many people\u2019s belief on this sub, Tesla is unlikely to become the *one and only* automaker on the planet, or even one with a majority marketshare. That means the majority of the global car market are also the potential market for Waymo. Today it\u2019s installed on a Pacifica minivan and next year it may be sold to Honda to be installed on the Accord. Selling a FSD package incurs much, much higher margin than the car business itself, thus why even if Waymo\u2019s tech is behind (it\u2019s not), it would still have higher financial upside. This is also the reason why MobileEye was sold for $15B, despite that their tech may not exactly be industry leading.\n\nFinally I don\u2019t believe Waymo is worth more than Tesla. It\u2019s a private subsidiary of Alphabet and has no explicit valuation. IIRC it\u2019s one Morgan Stanley analyst arbitrarily putting a value on it. We all know how we feel about these random \u201cvaluations\u201d by analysts.\n\nEDIT: [This is the latest pubic update on Waymo's current state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=2hqTnmn51Fg), seems really solid and they even addressed edge cases like handling different kinds of emergency vehicles/sirens and even interact with police officers pulling over a Waymo car without any driver inside.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "It is 100% certain that even geofenced robotaxis will sometimes fail. \n\n99.9...9% reliable solution will have to suffice for both applications.\n\nThat said, Tesla is already doing fencing of the AI, just not geographic fencing.

They are usually not very well received on this particular sub (however /r/teslamotors are usually much more receptive), but here it is again.\n\nTesla's approach (AI + Computer Vision only) is indeed the \"conceptually superior\" approach, and that's been the argument used by Elon and many supporters. However for a professional engineer like me we understand that an approach that is only \"conceptually superior\" is completely meaningless if it cannot deliver the results we want within an expected timeframe under an expected cost.\n\nWaymo's approach is (AI + Computer Vision + LIDAR + Geofencing). Despite what many Tesla supporters believe, the army of PhDs and engineers at Waymo fully understand the limitations of LIDAR/Geo-fencing and the higher ceiling for cost and versatility of a pure vision based approach, because after all we are talking about a company that has **Strong AI** as the end goal. They know they will be throwing away some of their current work once pure vision based approach takes over one day (and they have plenty of people working in parallel on that approach without a doubt), but if they can deliver something of great value in a shorter time frame, throwing away some work is a completely acceptable cost to a company with the resource Waymo has. \n\nWe have one saying amongst engineers, that is **pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil**. Very often a non-optimized solution is actually the optimized approach to deliver a good product. Elon is a very smart guy, and he probably sees the end-optimizations as well as anyone in the industry, but his personality is likely preventing him from making a compromise and he tends to shoot straight to the end stage. We saw him making similar mistakes when it comes to trying to automate the Model 3 production/manufacturing process too much too early. I do believe FSD is just another one of such mistakes, except the cost will be higher since it will take years and years to see the results.\n\nBut looking at the bright side, even if Tesla fails in beating Waymo to this game, their work in vision-based FSD will be pushing the industry forward and it will definitely become highly valuable at one point in the future.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting post.

He invested a ton of money and design effort into a carbon starship and then dropped it all on a dime for steel. etc.\n\nWe can debate the specifics of FSD all day, but we don't really know, and \u2014 at least for me \u2014 he's earned the benefit of the doubt.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": ">We can debate the specifics of FSD all day, but we don't really know, and \u2014 at least for me \u2014 he's earned the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIndeed.

{"title": "Hi, I'm the guy with 1.2M Ford. Update and AMA I guess", "selftext": "**EDIT: Do not harass /u/MoonYachts, he was allowed to post the screenshots and talk about the position. If he hadn't made the post I wasn't ever going to and you all would have never got to enjoy it.**\n\nFirst a clarification, /u/MoonYachts was not the one with the position, he just took my screenshots and posted them to the sub. I didn't have any problem with that since I didn't do this trade for the attention or karma or anything like that.\n\nAlso another important point to make is that I levered up last Thursday, not the Monday that the post was made.\n\nAnyways here's a few interesting points\n\n1. I had zero contact from RH since last Friday until today. I got an email last Friday telling me to expect a call on Monday, however it never came.\n2. My account was restricted Friday at open, it became \"disabled\" around noon on the same day. I'm not sure what the difference is, you'd have to ask RH. Also that same day I was hit with a $91,000 margin call.\n3. I did not sign an NDA, I was never asked to sign an NDA. I was not contacted by the SEC, FINRA, or any other regulatory body, and vice versa. I really want to emphasize how little communication I received from RH.\n4. Today RH closed out the Ford position, I'm not sure of the specifics however it wasn't that complicated of a position anyways, any competent trade desk could get out relatively easy. If anyone is curious about the Apple position, it was assigned on Friday, which was the plan anyways, so its not a big deal. Any other position in the screenshots MoonYachts posted were from before levering up.\n5. I am banned from RH. Their email said that if I am carrying a negative balance I have 60 days to pay it off. I am not carrying a negative balance so I'm doing a money transfer to my bank and an ACAT transfer to TDA. I can't speak to what happened to the other uses who did this since they made far riskier plays than me with the leverage they gained.\n6. Matt Levine's coverage is the only worthwhile thing I've read on the trade. The trade isn't that interesting its just big numbers. I will take exception to the line saying that I did this to amuse my Reddit friends, as I only read WSB on occasion, however it is a fair generalization.
