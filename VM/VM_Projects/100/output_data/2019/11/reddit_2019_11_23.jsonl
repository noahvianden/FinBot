{"title": "Cybertruck design is actually the best design they could've made as far as pickup trucks are concerned", "selftext": "This is a very calculated move and the best they could've made in the pickup space, hear me out.\n\nThe thing with pickup trucks is that they're a huge market in the US, but let's face it 99% of truck people would not want to switch to electric as long as gasoline exists.\n\nThe Rivian, and big three electric pickups will sell in very low volumes (forget Amazon for a second). If Tesla had made a more normal-looking truck, it would have had a small share of a small sub-section of that market (aka electric pickup trucks).\n\nNow this design is a much smarter way to approach it:\n\n-not many people would've bought an electric Tesla pickup anyway, but now in addition to some of those people, other people may consider buying it. People who may not even need a truck, but who want to get it just for the badassery of the thing, or its originality. Or the low cost alone may attract buyers who would not have considered buying a pickup in the first place. A big deterrent to buying a truck is the fuel cost, but since electric motors are so efficient it's less of a concern.\n\n-another thing to consider is I'm pretty sure this design has some super-efficient engineering benefits behind it, AKA they'll be able to make a good profit off of it, even at a low price. Less parts probably and other things. Which would have been more difficult with a more traditional-style truck.\n\n-this unique styling is something that sticks in your mind. I remember at first I hated the design, then it stuck in my mind all day. I still don't think it's superb, but now when I look at every other vehicle including the Rivian or other teslas they look out of date. And after having this thought I saw people making posts about that same observation. Unbelievable...\n\n-the last thing to consider is this got people talking about Tesla, huge amounts of free advertising, which will drive other model sales.\n\nSo yeah. I think there's way much more to this than just \"haha we made a cybertruck from the future\"...
