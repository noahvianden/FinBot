A lot of it was driving through the Netherlands and Germany (the majority).\n\n2 observations:\n\n- I didn\u2019t see nearly as many Model 3\u2019s in the Netherlands than I expected to. Still saw a shitload of Audi\u2019s and BMW\u2019s though.  As great as Tesla\u2019s sales have been there, I think there\u2019s quite a bit room left in the market once those Audi and BMW leasers need to replace their vehicle in the next 2 or 3 years.  Sure, the incentives for EVs are going down, but it will still be better than a gas or diesel car.\n- Germans on the Autobahn are just batshit crazy.  Obviously, I\u2019ve seen them do 200 km/h for longer stretches before, but that was mostly in summer weather.  This weekend, I\u2019ve seen plenty of them doing in heavy rain and even this morning on a wet autobahn at 3 degrees celcius.  It\u2019s like a certain part of the Germans drive as fast as they can, whenever they can, and a large other part just drives fairly normally.  Unfortunately, the latter part appears to be the one that\u2019ll have more difficulties in affording the Model 3.  The group that can afford it (and easily, considering the number of Porsche\u2019s and Mercedes AMG\u2019s and Audi RS6\u2019s and BMW M5\u2019s I\u2019ve seen), will probably just not be interested in them I think... As great as Tesla cars are, doing long stretches of 200km is definitely something you\u2019ll have to give up unless you want to spend a lot of time at superchargers.  EDIT: of course, that also means the majority of this group won\u2019t go for the German EV\u2019s either, because they offer even less range! ;)\n\nIn short, I expect more sales from the Netherlands to come over the years, whereas I think it\u2019ll grow _very slowly_ in Germany.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "That's why Tesla should do something about Model S and X.\n\nI know that Elon said that Model S is mostly sentimental thing, but c'mon - not everybody wants fully autonomous vehicles.

It\u2019s only fine as long as you stay in the right or middle lane, being _very patient_ to move between lanes when you absolutely don\u2019t see anything coming up from behind you.  Even then, overtaking someone on Autopilot is tricky because due to EU rules, the lane switch needs to be completed within 5 seconds. Obviously, this 5 second rule also applies when you try to move back from the left lane to the middle lane.  During those 5 seconds, you\u2019re quite likely to get flashed by someone that \u2018came out of nowhere\u2019 due to his speed.\n\nI gave up on Autopilot in Germany after about 10 minutes...

I'm not sure this is solvable practicably with improved autopilot--I think >160km/h is just too fast for a vision-based software solution to be safe amongst much faster and slower drivers.\n\nTo me the solution is just to set a reasonable speed limit, like 170 km/h, to reduce the velocity delta between drivers and software.\n\nI'm sure it must be fun to travel at high speeds, but driving faster than \\~140 km/h is an enormous waste of fuel for ICE vehicles, and energy for BEVs (which negates the purpose of driving faster to save time, since you'll need to charge longer)\n\nUntil the near future, when we can just build autonomous convoys which follow closely to increase fuel efficiency, then this is no longer a problem.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There is no solution at those speeds...
