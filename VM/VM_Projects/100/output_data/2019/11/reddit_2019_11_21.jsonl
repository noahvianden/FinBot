I remembering the dip in value in 2002 as I entered college.  Established an IRA at 18. \n\nIn 2005-6, I was apart of a \"financial investing group\" in college.  About 20-30 students interested in gaming the market who really hade no idea about anything, but we tried splitting up into focus groups of 5 to study about different sectors and report back to the group.  No one saw any signals, there was a general talk of average recession cycles being 7 yrs, but no one saw any signs in that group. \n\nI got lucky and sold out just about everything in July of 2007, motivated by the desire to down payment on a mortgage for a rental property and nothing else.   I got lucky again being in Austin Tx's real estate market which only stalled in value and never dropped in housing price like the beating everywhere else; it had me nervous as hell about the uncertainity.  \n\nI thought I was paying attention to the markets in my mid-20s.  There were the rare occasional doom & gloom guys on TV, but most analysts were just reporting figures and stating their opinion mostly positive.

We all knew/know recessions are inevitable, and there were a lot of theories floating as to what could trigger... but generally, people were optimistic.  Dotcom bubble burst was relatively short. By 2009, it looks like \"the Great recession\" term was MSM sugar coating and in denial of the grim reality.  Leman brothers, the underwater housing prices, consumer debt, oil prices skyrocketed then too... all came suddenly as a surprise to the majority of people.\n\nI think there a lot of people have vivid memories of 2009 and know recessions are inevitable, that's why people have been predicting the next market downturn since 2016 and the media has given a little more credence to those doomers.
