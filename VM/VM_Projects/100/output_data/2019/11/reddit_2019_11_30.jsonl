China retaliates Monday morning before the open... it could be something as simple as \u201cwe will wait till after the election to make a deal\u201d and the rally from middle October will be in jeopardy. We could fall a couple hundred points, I doubt much with fed pumping money into the system.. then as we approach December 15th trump gets his phone out and tweets China and US are talking and December 15th tariffs will be delayed 90 days (similar to last year).  This could renew optimism into year end\n\n\n2. China retaliates Monday and trump looks at the market sitting at all time high and thinks \u201cI got free house money to play with\u201d and sends tariff man tweets out and December follows through with tariffs.. if December 15th tariffs go through, I doubt we go to 3400 or high on spx. \n\nBottom line: a lot of different ways this could play out.. however, what we know for certain is, this market is sitting at all time high. Pain trade is still to the upside.. but catalysts to send this market lower are significant and unpredictable because of mango in office. If you can manage to hold long into year end the least you could do is hedge your position... puts are really cheap with VIX at lows and implied volatility nearly non existent.. the options market does not show anticipation of a recession or a crash coming in the near term.. people are still buying tons of upside and not really hedging like they were coming out of last December sell off.. if you look at options market in January through March, puts outweighed calls almost 2:1 some cases 3:1.. back then, people were nervous and the market continued to run up.. personally I see a lot of exuberance and lack of pessimism.. people can say what they want but we are at least or near 2 standard deviations away from 200 DMA. That\u2019s roughly 96% of the observations in data.. we have gone 10% since middle of October with no pull back of 2-5%. This market could go straight to the moon into year end, but if I wanted to bet, I\u2019d say we stay flat or head lower into year end unless trump makes a deal with China..\n\n\nFor a deal to happen, trump has to feel like he needs to win for his election.. currently, I don\u2019t think he feels like that at all.. I see trump just dragging this whole trade through the holidays so the consumer spends into next year...
