For vehicles priced over 40,000 euros the grants will rise to 5,000 euros.\n\n> The government wants to have 10 million electric vehicles on the roads by 2030, part of an offensive designed to turn round the German car industry's perceived laggard status in e-mobility compared to its rivals in the United States and China. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see whether those grants will be restricted to cars made in Germany (although I think that'd be illegal according to EU laws).\n\nAlso interesting: a lot of bears keep pointing out that the Dutch subsidies will be reduced as of 2020, but as this shows, there are quite a few interesting markets left that need to jump-start EV adoption.
