But the HW3 \u2018FSD\u2019 computer won\u2019t be enough to get regulatory lvl5 approval.  It\u2019ll have to be the 3rd-Gen \u2018HW4\u2019 computer.  There\u2019s just so many things for the Neural Net(s) to map, that even the new HW3 chip won\u2019t be enough.  Also part of my prediction - Tesla will upgrade MCUs on the S/X to the new MCUs needed for HW3/4.  They also will find a way to replace the cameras and wiring on the relatively few HW2 cars.  HW 2.5 owners won\u2019t get a HW3 retrofit, and will instead need to accept less-capable cars while the HW3 cars continue to get updates.  They\u2019ll be the first to get the HW4 retrofit.\n\nLate 2020 the HW4 chip should be in production.  Anyone have any guesses as to what a fleet retrofit like this would cost Tesla to accomplish?  Sounds like it\u2019d involve ~1M cars.  They could hire temporary technicians just to get it done.  Let\u2019s say it takes an hour of labor and they pay the tech $20/hr.  Then the HW4 computer costs them $80 each.  That\u2019s $100M, and say 6 months to get them all done.
