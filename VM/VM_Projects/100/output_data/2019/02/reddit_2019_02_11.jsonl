I'm a software developer and my LLC pays for my truck so it is a tax write-off. What's your top marginal tax bracket? Take that right off the top of your lease.\n2. On the topic of sales tax, sales tax is added to individual payments after interest is calculated. If you buy a car sales tax is added into the loan and you pay interest on that tax for the life of the loan.\n3. *Assuming you are getting the same car regardless of financing method* (which admittedly most people don't), leasing is a lot cheaper.

Sort of an off-shoot of #3 but if you're aggressively paying down debt leasing lets you open up cash flow and pay down that debt faster.\n5. If you're free of bankruptcies and repos, it's much easier to get approved for a lease because the payment is lower.\n6. You can negotiate the interest rate on a lease (money factor), especially if there's a dealer markup (there almost always is). You can't really negotiate interest rate on a loan with a bank outside of getting multiple offers.\n7. No maintenance liability, which is not always the case with purchases.\n\nLeasing v. buying a vehicle is the same argument as renting v. buying an apartment or house.

{"title": "Investing in Cannabis: a brief overview of a true YOLO opportunity", "selftext": "We are all extremely lucky to be witnessing the end of marijuana prohibition in the developed world. This is a market that will forever change the economic landscape for the countries involved in bringing about a legal marketplace. For investment purposes The Marijuana sector is comprised of two main markets at the moment IMO. There is Canada and there is the United States. \n\nIn Canada marijuana has had a strong country wide recognized legal marijuana system built for corporate control since the introduction of the MMPR in 2013. Provinces and their national govt have been in lockstep throughout (mostly) and this has created stability for investors. This has led to companies such as Tilray and Canopy Growth Corp and a few other small corporate entities sucking up Billions of real investment dollars from individuals and even [Fortune 500 beverage companies](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/canopy-growth-closes-5-billion-constellation-brands-investment-transaction/). Accordingly this resulted in a gross overvaluation of these companies that operate legal cannabis operations. Take a look at these [financial reports](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/financials/) and tell me if this seems like an effectively managed and run outfit. No one cares about what I see as fairly obvious poor management and at its peak this company was worth over 10 Billion in market cap.\n\nIn the US everything is fragmented by unique state laws. The one unifying law is the schedule 1 status that dictates federal illegality. This is where opportunity for us lies. Due to this status that\u2019s purely [fucking stupid](https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling) investment banks and corporations such as the one that gifted Canopy 4 Billion can not reasonably invest into these companies that are in many ways far outperforming Canopy at the time of that multi billion dollar investment. All while existing in far more attractive markets once the concern of federal interference is lifted. Imagine investing in UBER or Facebook far before a bank or large stakeholder gave them billions of dollars in return for a large interest of the company. This is where the marijuana industry is at in the United States. You can invest before the banks and financial institutions.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go into too much detail about the Canadian market but the point is that the entire nation is comparable to the state of California with absolutely none of the branding potential due to many different factors. Canada may lead in the international market opportunities but its apparent that that is slowly developing and not as attractive as Canadian companies may hope it to be [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/monazhang/2017/11/07/global-marijuana-market-31-billion-investors-cautious/amp/). imo the US is a far more attractive business space for cannabis due to available expendable income and branding potential. \n\nAt the end of the day investing in this sector is about finding the next McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks. Anyone can sell a cup of coffee or a shitty cheeseburger (or mediocre weed). Yet here are two mega billion dollar corporations that have billions of people across the world addicted to their product. This is what I\u2019m looking for. As someone who is pretty experienced trying different quality weed;  in my opinion the company that takes the lead is going to be about delivering quality of product (unlike Starbucks and McDonalds) and the leader is far from established at the moment. \n\nI was going to make this a lot more detailed with more links but I\u2019m going to leave a lot of the digging to you. Most of the info you need is going to be in the corporate documents. You should take the time and learn to read 10-q, k, and all corporate documents when making an investment of this length. I\u2019ll start taking profits after large institutions begin making sizable investments similar to constellation\u2019s. Could be a year, or 5. I really can\u2019t say with certainty but I do feel it\u2019s coming sooner rather than later with bipartisan legislation such as the [S.T.A.T.E.S. Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATES_Act) being introduced. The political aspect of this is continuously moving in the right direction and there is strong indication that big banks are pushing the right people towards cannabis reform with Trump signaling his support as well as other traditionally conservative (towards drug policy) politicians.\n\nCredit to u/CannaVestments for this quick [overview](https://imgur.com/a/dpv4qVi) which is accurate to my knowledge.\n\n\nEdit: This following link is an updated (continuously) version of the imgur link by u/Cannavestments \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bgogg22ba76j65a/US%20MSO%20DD%202019.xlsx?dl=0\n\n(TCNNF) The one I like the most is Trulieve [link](https://vimeo.com/313083903). They dominate the Florida market with over 500k sq ft of grow space and soon to be 30 dispensaries. No other company dominates a region like trulieve and they are doing it in one of the most attractive marijuana markets in the world with tourism and retirees everywhere to give them their expendable income once full legalization comes into effect. Financials are attractive [link](https://www.trulieve.com/investors). The only public company in the entire industry worldwide with financials that look like an actually profitable and compelling investment. More than that is their philosophy of business. They don\u2019t make massive acquisitions. Their 4 million dollar investment in Massachusetts (100k sq ft cultivation license + 3 dispensaries I believe) can easily turn into 4 million a quarter in roughly a year. This is good for shareholders which btw is majority insider controlled and locked up until July [link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/trulieve-cannabis-corp-announces-voluntary-lock-up-agreements-with-company-founders-804831853.html). Right now fully diluted the company is valued around 1B in market cap. Compared to peers this is a steal. Canopy saw 10B and this company had better revs last reported quarter in 2018 (annual report due on April 30) not to mention strong profits and all the other important metrics that put its peers to shame. Compared to canopy\u2019s valuation you can see why I\u2019m so excited about this opportunity.\n\nI think the fear for investors here is the market is immature and people are doubting they can hold onto their lead. Florida has previously capped stores to 30 and many other operators had yet to build out. Trulieve however just won an important suit that has ruled that cap unconstitutional [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-judge-marijuana-dispensaries-cap-20190204-story,amp.html). I think it\u2019s too late for competitors and it\u2019s trulieves market to lose based on government and legal actions recently. The cost to entry is high and every other competitor is operating in debt and making acquisitions that cost hundreds of millions of dollars instead of organic growth. \n\nThe other issue is that they don\u2019t have the license getting skills in other states and will have to make large acquisitions going forward, which may be true but I think patience will reveal opportunity like in Massachusetts. They will target cheaper license getters or struggling license holders without the means or knowledge to buildout and use their profits while their competitors struggle with debt. This is my yolo essentially. I\u2019ll diversify but due to share structure and insider control as well as the other factors this is the most attractive company in the US by a large margin imo. I think anything under $15 is a good buy and don\u2019t think it stays under $20 much longer.\n\n(GTBIF) The next one I like is green thumb industries [link](https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/overview/default.aspx). This one has been making acquisitions that have been [massive](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/13/1650439/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-Inc-GTI-Expands-with-the-Acquisition-of-Integral-Associates-Nevada-s-Top-Cannabis-Operator.html) but they aren\u2019t stupid moves unlike some of its peers (medmen) who have spent egregious amounts on unestablished license holders. They bought a [company](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/essence-cannabis-dispensary-awarded-new-licenses-to-expand-to-california-300768648.html) that afterwards won a very unique and competitive license in West Hollywood. They also won a very competitive and valuable license in [New Jersey](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/17/1668365/0/en/National-Cannabis-Company-Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Awarded-Cultivation-Processing-and-Retail-License-in-New-Jersey.html). This is the key to long term growth in the industry while maintaining shareholder value. A license can cost a few million vs buying a license holder which can cost tens of millions or hundreds of millions depending on development so whoever has the best license getters in the industry are going to be at a serious advantage for long term growth. Financials aren\u2019t horrible compared to the rest of the sector and they are positioned well in Illinois with around 100k sq ft in grow space. Illinois just elected a pro legalization governor. Market cap is around 1.5 B. overall I trust this company and its branding efforts (rise dispensaries) to make it an established player in the market. They are however in buildout mode so financials might not look as pretty this year and dilution will be happening and therefore will see good buying opportunities this year imo. I\u2019d be happy to pick some more up around $7.\n\nSomething to keep in mind when doing your own due diligence is these m.s.o. (Multi state operators) like to count their unbuilt licenses as if they exist. In Florida for example, it seems companies were granted 30 dispensaries by default so a lot of mso, without even building out 1, have greatly inflated their dispensary numbers. Focus on who actually has the most buildings functioning and distributing product. That will tell you who is ahead. I personally am focused on companies that dominate an area which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they will have the most dispensaries-just the best locations to saturate a market. \n\n(CURLF) I don\u2019t like curaleaf [link](https://content.equisolve.net/curaleaf/news/2018-11-26_Curaleaf_Reports_Third_Quarter_2018_Financial_and__29.pdf) because of overvaluation (mc around 2.5B) but it\u2019s probably wise to pick up a piece of these guys when the opportunity arises. They were early in New Jersey which is a very attractive market and bring in significant revenue. They have 20 operational dispensaries in FL and over 650k sq ft of cultivation space across all states they operate in according to their investor presentation. It will be telling if they can make a significant dent to trulieves footprint in Florida or if they will be The Burger King to trulieves McDonalds. Trulieve has maintained over 60% of market share in Florida so I question Curaleafs potential to outcompete competitors in other states as well. They also are initiating a share [buyback](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curaleaf-announces-launch-of-share-buyback-program-300760620.html) which at this stage is a huge red flag while green thumb is acquiring serious license getters and Florida competitor trulieve is opening 6 stores in the upcoming few months. I\u2019m looking for a strong dip in the upcoming year and might buy some around $4.\n\n(Acrgf) Acreage has made some dumbfounding decisions that include millions of dollars of investment in the state of Iowa which has only legalized cbd and in general have fairly unattractive locations including Oregon and Maine [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/oregons-weed-glut-what-happens-to-excess-pot-697985/amp/). They also missed the boat in Florida and look a little desperate with this [acquisition](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/acreage-holdings-enters-florida-medical-cannabis-market-with-67-million-acquisition-natures-way/) made recently. Imo They are b listers from my due diligence (Burger King might be too much of a compliment) but they\u2019re the best politically connected [link](https://m.benzinga.com/article/12716495) and are well positioned financially to be a force in the sector. Already distributing in Jersey (125k sqft cultivation facility) which is big. If I see stupid moves I stay away especially if they are already overvalued [link](http://investors.acreageholdings.com/file/Index?KeyFile=395942626) but this should definitely be on your radar (also has 100k sqft cultivation in NY) . This thing trades strong and I think a lot of big money is behind it. I will probably diversify and pick up some when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping to have an opportunity to buy around ~$12-15 because I don\u2019t think they are deserving of a market cap of more than about 1.5B at the moment and currently are trading around a 3B market cap.\n\nAnother thing is to do your due diligence in each states cannabis economy as each is incredibly unique. Right now Oregon, Washington and Colorado are not business friendly (in terms of helping a balance sheet look nicer) even though Colorado and Washington are very attractive revenue wise. Some states limit monopolies or have no limit in dispensaries/cultivation which reduces economic upside at the moment. Maryland has a limit (cant find a link so might need to fact check me on this) on how much one company can own of the state which will be interesting to see how it\u2019s upheld as the market merges. Cali has overtaxed everything so the black market continues to be very influential there but whoever takes the lead in this state (medmen currently) will be a formidable force as the black market slowly fades from existence. Nevada is a good economy due to limiting the licenses given out and flower prices were rising for a while. Vegas is huge from a branding perspective. Green thumb is the leader here after their big acquisition. Jersey is just getting around to implementing medical expansion (thanks to fat bastard aka Chris Christie) so companies there haven\u2019t even capitalized on that population density yet. Most of this is really common sense and comes down to basic supply vs. demand economics. The northeast especially, where there are tons of non smokers without access to quality black market connects are going to pour hundreds of dollars into brick and mortar stores each month imo so I\u2019m paying close attention to Mass/NJ/NY in the coming year to see who takes the lead there.\n\n\n(MMNFF) Medmen is garbage and idc to go in depth on why [link](https://equity.guru/2018/05/28/medmen-goes-public-tuesday-three-executives-will-make-money-deal/). It would be a lengthy write up. They have the best market penetration in Cali so far and I do think they will be relevant in 10 years but investment potential isn\u2019t as attractive as their peers. Insiders sold out for a reason in my opinion [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/marijuana-retailer-medmen-acquires-pharmacann-for-682-million-2018-10). this acquisition is going to take a decade if not more to pay off assuming it does. Just horrible mismanagement of shareholder value IMO. \n\n(CRLBF) Cresco labs are Chicago based and have focused their efforts in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/overview/default.aspx) Management seems to be top tier but I think it\u2019s a little pricy at the moment (~2B) for what they own. The main guy sits on a committee with newly elected Pritzker in Illinois (140k sq ft cultivation in IL) and they will be major players I think [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Cresco-Labs-Co-founder-and-CEO-Charles-Bachtell-Appointed-to-Cannabis-Legalization-Subcommittee-of-Illinois-Governor-elect-JB-Pritzkers-Transition-Team/default.aspx). I\u2019m looking to diversify with these guys when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping for a chance around $5.\n\n(ITHUF) Another interesting company is Ianthus [link](https://www.ianthuscapital.com/investors). They recently merged with MPX and imo it has legitimized their future. Ianthus holds attractive licenses in NY and FL but has no proven growth or brand perception. Mpx on The other hand has strong brand perception (although recently they\u2019ve been getting poor reviews on products) and proven growth and also holds some attractive licenses in AZ, MD, and NJ among others [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/two-new-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-coming-to-atlantic-city-vineland/article_8bceb880-437d-5d4e-ab89-7429c53d7fc5.amp.html).\nTogether I think they will be a value buy at some point. Unfortunately both don\u2019t have enough operating capital to fund their growth and will need funding to execute and fulfill their potential. when an opportunity presents itself I\u2019ll buy a small piece for diversification. I\u2019m looking for sub $3 myself.\n\n(HTHHF) There is also Harvest Health and Recreation [link](https://www.harvestinc.com/industry-experience/). Not very familiar with them but they seem to be strong license getters and have good reviews. Definitely overpriced at the moment. I\u2019ll look for a buy op under $4. \n\n\nA company to look out for is Columbia Care [link](https://www.col-care.com). They have a huge presence in the northeast and have yet to go public. Won a New Jersey license recently. \n\n(DXBRF) There is also Dixie brands [link](http://dixieelixirs.com/ir-dashboard/). This is where long term future is in the industry. Beverages are a socialized means of getting fucked up. The beverage leader will normalize getting high. Right now that\u2019s Dixie. My concern here is this is decades away from normalizing. I don\u2019t think the market for drinks is as attractive an investment short term as the actual infrastructure to grow the plant. Also my opinion is established brands such as Coca Cola will simply come in and have better brand recognition immediately. Nothing Dixie or any edible manufacturer is doing is necessarily a secret or patentable from my understanding so all the big beverage players have to do is hire the right people and they will immediately dominate a company like Dixie. \n\nSomething else to look out for is investor presentations and revenue forecasts. I\u2019ve seen quite a few but the one that stands out the most is acreages that was just absolute bullshit. Do not under any circumstance trust guidance from companies. I think revenues will grow slower than most will admit but the market will continue to overvalue these companies as we get closer to large capital investing in the US cannabis space. Companies that have established presence in growing markets such as Trulieve I\u2019ll trust far more than unestablished companies with poor footing like Acreage to give accurate projections. At the end of the day there are too many variables in a completely new market segment to rely on company projections.\n\nOther ancillary companies for \u201csafer\u201d investment include Scott\u2019s Miracle Grow (SMG) which I think will dominate the self grow industry as well as the commercial growing infrastructure based on some of their recent acquisitions. The other sector I\u2019m somewhat familiar with is mass spectrometry. Labs to test marijuana composition are going to be a huge need and mass spectrometers and liquid chromatography will be in high demand. I know Waters (WAT) specializes in spectrometry. Also (TMO) Thermo Fisher and (PKI) PerkinElmer for laboratory needs. I haven\u2019t actually done my due diligence on these guys financials and fundamentals though.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it I think. Some smaller players exist but these are the big boys that have the most growth potential. If you have a thought, question or comment about anything I\u2019d love to hear it, especially if you are familiar with any of these companies or have your own personal insights to share. There will likely be more relevant companies that go public so I\u2019ll keep my eyes open and let you know if I see anything worthwhile. I\u2019m looking forward to the market consolidating when bigger money gets to join in. These are just my opinions so do your own due diligence and best of luck!\n\n", "id": "apkd46", "created_utc": 1549915669.0, "score": 1069, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 184, "comments": [{"body": "Loved the post.

If you do your due diligence on a company such as trulieve and look at financials you see a well run machine that isn\u2019t wasteful and is financially efficient with a profitable business model in a much more difficult medical landscape in a much more cannabis unfriendly environment. CGC has always been in a very similar position to Trulieve which has no rec numbers either but still strongly outperformed the Canadian company.\n\nQ over q numbers look horrible because they cooked the books growing too fast and inefficiently so as to build their assets.

Or in America where advertising is going to be embraced fully in most states?\n\nCgc will just move in and buy American companies? great! That would negate your statement that American companies are overvalued and support buying a company like trulieve which trade at 4x future earnings. I don\u2019t really think you\u2019ve done you\u2019re due diligence into the American sector if you think these companies are overvalued. Some of these will be worth 20B + and yes multiple will be IMO.

I\u2019ve been balls deep in the industry a long time and his calls on Trulieve and SMG are home runs.  \n\nI\u2019m based in Florida and have done business with both of them for many years.  Trulieve completely dominates the state in every way, they\u2019re orders of magnitude ahead of the competition.  They must have great lobbyists and lawyers because they\u2019ve kept the barrier to entry into doing business in Florida ridiculously high to ensure they maintain their virtual monopoly with (full vertical integration), and also won a lawsuit allowing them to open more dispensaries.  This week home cultivation in FL took a major set back with Joe Redner losing to the state on appeal, which means the only place people are getting their product is from dispensaries (which trulieve has 60%+ market share).  They\u2019re making strategic acquisitions and are strong in markets that will be huge once they mature and feds reschedule.  Many of their grows are multi tiered, meaning their 500k sq ft is actually probably more like 750.  Their operations are state of the art and their team is strong, I know them personally.  These people are not stupid, are well funded, have a profitable business and a clear vision which they\u2019re executing on incredibly.  Using the metrics some of these other companies are valued with, trulieve is undervalued significantly.\n\nSMG (Hawthorne really, their hydroponics subsidiary) is our main supplier.  They fucking KILLED it with the acquisitions of sunlight supply, gh, Botanicare, gavita and can filter.  They have the top brands, bought the wholesale distribution and now have ridiculous margins on these products.  They are decimating the competition on all fronts.  They put BWGS lights out in under a year.  Hydrofarm, their only other real competitor is on the ropes right now.  HF was acquired and is not doing well.  They\u2019ve closed 3 DCs, have no stock (we can see it) and rumor has it they\u2019re getting called on a bunch of big loans from the investors who are freaking out as they\u2019re free falling.  I believe they\u2019ll be gone by 2020 latest which will leave Hawthorne as the only real show.  Hawthorne is selling direct to commercial cultivation, which is a pivot from their traditional model of selling only through hydroponic stores.  Commercial is a huge market and they are bringing a level of professionalism and technology that is unparalleled by anyone else in the industry.  They\u2019re in every retail hydroponic store as well ensuring they\u2019ll dominate the home growing market.  We\u2019ve traditionally been at a 75%/25% ratio Hydrofarm/Hawthorne in terms of purchasing for the last decade.  We\u2019re probably at 90/10 now Hawthorne/Hydrofarm because Hawthorne has stepped it up across the board (catalog offerings, service, pricing, logistics etc) while hydrofarm has floundered.  \n\nOne op didn\u2019t mention that might be worth looking into is Grow Generation.  They\u2019re trading on the pink sheets now, but hear me out.  They\u2019ve raised quite a bit of money and have made some extremely strategic investments over the last quarter.  They bought 3 very influential stores recently, chlorophyll in Denver being the most important.  They\u2019re on pace to do 100m in sales this year without any other acquisitions.  They also bought out BWGS inventory at liquidation for like 10 cents on the dollar.  This was not something they planned for and came spur of the moment.  Mother fuckers beat us to it, we were gonna buy all the inventory.  Classic case of big bank taking little bank.  This is going to pump that bottom line HARD.  They\u2019re going to beat revenue expectations by a mile, mark my words.  These guys are sharp and they\u2019re buying up all the stores (and more importantly the human capital along with) that are players in the market.  They\u2019re purchasing proprietary brands and starting to have the ability to source product direct from manufacturers in huge volume, bypassing traditional wholesalers like Hawthorne, and adding all that profit to the bottom line.  They looked rocky last year but are really starting to the put the pieces together, build a team and marketshare and execute on their plan.  Shit I might sell them my business and go work with them.  This is one to watch.  Let me know before you guys go full blown autistic though so I can buy some calls.\n\nAnd op was dead on about MedMen.  I wouldn\u2019t fuck with them with ops dick and any of you losers pushing.  They\u2019re a fucking dumpster fire that could\u2019ve been a gold mine.  \n\nDixie is going to get snapped up by a major brand once we get rescheduled.

Canopy hasn't shown a single quarter with rec sales yet.. q over q losses are massive because they had to try to play catch up to the legislation that was moving faster than they could keep up with. \n\nAnyway, US companies don't have the same explosive upside potential as Canadian companies did 3 years ago .. the hype is already hugely priced in because of watching what unfolded up here in the great white north.\n\nThere will not be a second bite at the apple for US sector investors. Best bet for big returns is picks and shovels ( extraction tech companies) like RTI (Radient technologies) or bio pharma.. once the science starts coming out and opiod market gets disrupted you will see a bunch more GWPH clones pop up with novel drug products that treat everything from your dog's headache to pain management in humans and everything along the way.\n\nAlso watch for the health and wellness products .. beauty products , face creams etc.. \n\nAt the root of a lot of this is high efficiency / high yield extraction. \n\nAlso don't let anyone tell you that price compression of dried flower sales is a big fucking deal because they're retarded If they say that.. cheaper flower means better margin on value add products.. literally any of the myriad of CBD/thc oil based products start at first as a base oil compound derived from extracts.\n\nPicks and shovels all day. RTI also has a ton of patents in the pipeline and has novel technology allowing for isolation and reduction or nicotine in tobacco which is a big deal. As well as a host of master service agreements with companies like Aurora Cannabis etc which will keep their proprietary MAP extraction tech running all day and night.\n\nMSO's are a dime a dozen. Also I think canopy will just walk over the border and take over as soon as possible.. they already have a foothold in the hemp market now thanks to the farm bill passing.##", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I'm way more excited about RTI than I am about any of the actual weed cos", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45320481061935425}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "key thing to note in most of the US MSOs is a lot of share unlock overhang\n\nIAN + MPX is the only one with barely any (3%); some others have massive lockups\n\nDYODD", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0829569548368454}, {"body": "Any US small cap Cannabis ETF out there?
