The effect of these will most probably fade away after a couple of years, unless something very bad happens like Elon bot being able to continue working for Tesla, and other changes within the company . There will be some residue but probably small.\n\n I think his presence is quite valuable in terms of marketing and recruiting and keeping top engineers. And most of these stuff he does are probably for those and not to affect the share price. Things like making bold promises on technologies inspire people working on them to work harder. This could be what separates a company with 9-5 jobs and companies where everyone is putting 100%.\n\nMy biggest worries in long term are competition and auto pilot. For now competition seems far behind but most other companies are trying. Other companies will also have an exponential growth. So Tesla needs to keep growing if they want to maintain the lead; it's not like they've won the race and can relax. If they continue at the current rate they might have \"moats\" and could be a cash cow. This is probably why share prices fluctuate a lot on every piece of news like Tesla services, model 3 reliability, new EV companies, etc.  If Tesla autopilot is progressing as Elon mentioned in the recent interview it could be pretty big.\n\nMy thinking could be highly biased since I like the company, and I like Elon's companies for trying bold things.

Publicly available information that has been traded on for nearly a month is not material and therefore would not require approval.\n\nOf course, that argument relies on the assumption that \"we may produce 350k-500k cars in 2019\" and \"telsa will produce around 500k cars in 2019\" (plus actual written guidance for 400k...) are the same piece of information.
