{"title": "Time to Buy Kraft Heinz", "selftext": "Kraft Heinz has had some disastrous news for the company on Thursday which dropped its share price by 27% in a single day. This news included SEC investigations for malpractices, dividend slashes, and massive losses. It is now trading at $35 down from its all-time high of $90. \n\nHow to react to this news? Throughout history the common thing that always happens is that the majority of investors overreact to news. They buy high when the news is good and sell low as the news is bad. Investors like Warren Buffett know this and buy good companies when the price is low. \"Be greedy when others are fearful. Be fearful when others are greedy.\"\n\nWhat makes a good company? Solid profits that can be relied on for years to come. Kraft Heinz has a P/E ratio of near 10. That's a very high level of income for the stock. And its main product, food, is a reliable source of income for Heinz, unlike the products in the tech industry which are subject to massive ups and downs and fierce competition.\n\nBecause of the overreaction of the investors on Wall Street, and Heinz continuing to be a high-income company, against the majority of so-called \"expert\" analysts and Wall Street pundits, I rate Kraft Heinz Co a strong buy.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "atlv5o", "created_utc": 1550864512.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "Great to be greedy when others are fearful, but negative free cash flow, 14 billion write downs, and sec investigations are plenty to be fearful of with a 29 year old cfo at the helm. \n\nAlso keep in mind, those profit margins have been dramatically boosted by dramatic cost cutting (3g are some of the most famous cost cutters)\n\nNot trying to sound like a dick or anything, but the above post is fairly anecdotal. When I was a shareholder of KHC I started to notice how much I personally avoided the products when shopping.

But here's my own jaded take on this this kind of stuff after seeing many of these scenarios play out:\n\n1. A huge Fortune 100-200 company has an absurdly high PE ratio and is objectively not a great buy at regular prices. But it lives on in every ETF and mutual fund.\n\n2. Said company faces a huge scandal. Like, *big*. vile, devastating stuff. \n\n3. The media has a field day. People begin noticing other bad stuff about the company that they should have known in the first place. The stock plummets.\n\n4. Somebody on r/investing says, \"shouldn't we be putting our money in this now?\"\n\n5. Everybody pillories the suggestion with rigourous analysis of why the stock is shit.\n\n6. A year passes. Everybody forgets about the issue and related issues. \n\n7. One day, a year later, you hear the company's name somewhere and vaguely recall that scandal. Out of curiosity you check the stock price. What do you know? Not only did the price go back to normal, it's up along with the rest of the S&P 500 index. \n\n8. Once again, the stock is back in its typical spot with a sky-high high PE ratio, and once again objectively not a great buy at regular prices. \n\nCould I be wrong about this? Certainly. Maybe the third-largest food company in North America is about to go completely bankrupt, or suffer the beginning of a permanent decline that they will never, ever climb out of for the remainder of recorded history.
