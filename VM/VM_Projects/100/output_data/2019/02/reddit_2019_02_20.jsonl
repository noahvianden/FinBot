The two are using completely different go to market approaches.\n\nAlmost zero overlap.\n\nTesla is using as a feature to sell cars.  It is about PR, marketing, increasing car sales, etc.\n\nWaymo it is a business.   It is all about scale.  They are racing to get to scale as who gets scale first secures the win.  It should be winner take all in the robot taxi space.   I suspect all the car makers will have self driving as a feature.   \n\nSDC with a got to market as a feature is NOT disruptive.    Does not change fundamentally transportation.     It does not address the fact that cars today sit idle over 90% of the time.  \n\nRobot taxi service is trying to address the fact that cars today are extremely inefficient.  They cost a fortune and we barely ever actually use them.  \n\nI personally highly doubt Waymo will move into Tesla space and very much doubt Tesla will ever move into Waymo space.\n\nSo you are not going to run a robot taxi service with Tesla cars.    Waymo is NOT going to sell a car with their technology.     Part of it is the natural product to sell is L3 with cars you buy.   But Waymo found that approach is not safe in testing in 2012.   But that is only part of it.  \n\nCreating the self driving tech and offering to car makers is a weak position.  You easily get cut out, has weak margins, and is not sustainable.    All of this is immature but we have an example already.\n\nMobilEye won the Tesla business.    But the MobilEye technology caused a Tesla customer to lose their life.  Might have been more than one.   Tesla ended the relationship.    Now doing their own.   That is what happens when you are just the vendor.    \n\nWaymo is smart and not going to get into that situation.  Instead run your own business.  Why Waymo will not even let Uber use their technology even though they have been publically begging.\n\n\"Uber CEO Wants Waymo's Self-Driving Cars to Pick You Up\"\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2018/05/31/uber-waymo-self-driving-cars-2/\n\nIn business you want the customer relationship.   You do NOT want to be behind the scenes.   There is a huge difference in margins.\n\nWaymo robot taxi service should be able to get 38% net margins.   Done the numbers.  That is with charging 55 cents a mile.   Once they build their own cars that can be decreased.   \n\nIt is vital that Waymo designs their own cars.   It is critical.    Was disappointed to see Amazon got the investment into Rivian and NOT Waymo.\n\nBut we have heard Waymo is building a factory in Michigan and now has a relationship with Magna.    Manga is the Foxconn of auto making.  That is the most important relationship for Waymo.\n\nI said \"relationship\" and NOT \"partnership\".    It should NOT be a partnership but rather Magna a vendor.  Like how Fiat/Chrysler and Jaguar are vendors for Waymo.\n\nWe have this thing where \"partnerships\" are viewed as a positive.   They are almost never a positive.   It is next to impossible to keep interesting aligned.   Instead if need something from someone else then use them as a vendor.  That is how you keep interest aligned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "The reaction when people at autopilot team see this news \ud83d\ude10", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe some will even quit.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08459024876356125}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3779156506061554}, {"body": "I\u2019m paraphrasing, but in the 60 minutes story when asked about why he hadn\u2019t been able to produce as many model 3s as he had said he would produce, he said something asking the lines of \u201cIve never done this before.
