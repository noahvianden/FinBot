But two conditions at Berkshire are far different from what they once were: Then, we could often buy businesses and securities at much lower valuations than now prevail; and more important, we were then working with far less money than we now have. Some years back, a good $10 million idea could do wonders for us (witness our investment in Washington Post in 1973 or GEICO in 1976). Today, the combination of ten such ideas and a triple in the value of each would increase the net worth of Berkshire by only 1/4 of 1%. **We need elephants to make significant gains now and they are hard to find.**\n\nThere are a lot of things that Buffett has said about the auto industry, exactly zero of them positive.\n\nAnyone who knows anything about Buffett knows he hates the auto industry. Capital intensive, unionized labor, super competitive, and very cyclical.\n\nBut here you go:\n\n>If you\u2019d look at the 1930s, nobody could have predicted how much the automobile and airplane would transform the world. There were 2000 car companies, but now only 3 left in the US and they are hanging on barely. It was tremendous for society, but horrible for investors. Investors would have had to not only identify the right companies, but also identify the right time.\n\nAnother:\n\n>There\u2019s a big difference in making a lot of money and spotting a great business. At the turn of the century there were two industries that had never existed before but changed the entire twentieth century: the airlines and the autos. They\u2019ve been wonderful industries but lousy investments. There have been tons of capital lost in those industries, and it\u2019s been very hard to make money by riding on the coattails of the players in these businesses.\n\nMore!\n\n>But there are businesses \u2014 if you gave me first draft pick of all the CEOs in America and said it\u2019s your job to run Ford Motor now or, you know, pick a company that\u2019s in a terribly tough business, you know, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\n>I mean, that it\u2019s just too tough. They may get it solved, you know, if they get cooperation from unions and a whole bunch of things, but it will not be solely in the control of the CEO who has that job.\n\n>He is dependent on too many good things happening outside to say that he alone can get the job, even if he\u2019s the best in the world.\n\nOn Apple, a big Berkshire holding, buying Tesla. After calling it a \"very poor idea,\" he said this:\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cYou can win in auto one year and lose the next. You\u2019ve got a dozen big companies out there with resources. They\u2019re going to keep coming. They\u2019re going to copy what you do.\u201d\n\nCharlie Munger on Musk:\n\n>I think Elon Musk is a genius and I don't use that word lightly.  I think he's also one of the boldest men that ever came down the pike.  Put me down as saying I've always been afraid of the guy whose IQ is 190 and he thinks it's 250.

And how much of a movement do you think is going to come when IPO lockup expires. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly not sure. I just updated my model, and they really seem to be killing it. 11,348 deliveries in 2018, and I'm estimating ARPU for the ES8 to be around $64,000 (estimating about 3/4 of a billion for 2018 revenues). \n\nThe annualized deliveries for the ES8 was just under 40,000 as of Dec 2018, and on Dec 15 they started taking deposits for the ES6, so will be very interesting to see if the release any information about the kind of numbers they're working with. \n\n\nGiven the target market for the ES6, I would guess they'll at least do 1.5x the number of deliveries of the ES8, if not 2x. So making some BIG assumptions, let's say the ES6 has an ARPU of $55,000, and they do 1.5x the annualized deliveries of the ES8 (60,000). Let's also assume ES8 deliveries stay around the same rate as they are now (40,000, though this number is likely to increase far more). \n\nThey'll deliver 100,000 vehicles in 2019, for a revenue of just under $5.9 billion (what is that like 6x revenue growth?). This is also right in line with the estimates from JAC and NIO regarding their annual output. Remember, Tesla is only projecting they'll do 500k across their product line _this year_ as well. Tsla marketcap is 50bln, NIO marketcap is 10bln.\n\nSo all that being said, if earnings go well I could see 20-30% upside from where we're at now ($12-$13). The IPO lockup is a bit of a dark horse, but just because people _can_ sell doesn't mean they _will_. Given the huge number of people that have yet to buy a car in China, NIO has a huge base of people to sell to and could easily outpace Tesla as early as 2020 in terms of deliveries and production. The best part is that NIO's production is managed by JAC, who have a hell of a lot of experience building cars.
