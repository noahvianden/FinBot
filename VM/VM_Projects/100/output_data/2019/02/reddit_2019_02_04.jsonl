Let's look at BMW ... market cap of $47.8B on $112B revenue/2.7M cars (they also have better margin, but let's say TSLA will get their margin in the future). TSLA.. market cap of $55.03B , Q4 results 90k cars, 6.3B revenue, %134 YoY growth... so let's combine this and apply YoY to next year linearly... we can expect 420k cars and $30b revenue. So TSLA will produce 6.7x less cars and 4x less revenue. We also need to consider that DAX has PE ~ 12, while S&P is ~20, so let's say US stock are just 67% more expensive.... so pricing based on forward revenue and using the US company premium we would get 47.8/4*1.67~20B. Which means that tsla has an additional 175% premium based on... future dominance of the market. \n\nThe short thesis can then be not that TSLA will go bankrupt, rather that the \"future dominance\" premium should be lower.

No other car brands that routinely push out big OTA software updates to all their customers for free. Most automakers cheap out of both infotainment hardware and UX design.\n\nAdaptive cruise control and lane assist features are fairly common nowadays although pretty much all reviewers have said that Tesla's Autopilot is the most advanced and complete.\n\nAnd there are various other features other car brands \"also have\\*\" but they often aren't as good. You might get keyless entry, but only with an overpriced key fob instead of your phone. You might have driver profiles, but only on 3 numbered buttons and they're weird to set up. You might have a crappy built-in navigation but it's on a dim, tiny screen, there's no traffic data, and it was outdated before you even bought the car. You might have a few AC vents but you have to position them strategically and it's never good enough; you don't the glorious whirlwind of air the Model 3's giant dashboard-wide vent can pamper you with (seriously, I had no idea it'd be my favorite feature).\n\nBut Tesla's OTA software updates are what I think set the company above legacy automakers more than anything else. If you buy any other car, you've basically bought a snapshot of that model's software and features. Want the latest and greatest safety features? Guess you'll have to get a newer or more expensive model. If you're really lucky you *might* have the privilege of taking your car to the dealership to buy annual bug fixes or map updates, assuming the automaker is even bothering to support your model after 3 years.\n\nRegarding software *quality*, I think it's reasonable to assume that a Silicon Valley startup has a smaller, cleaner codebase than decades of whatever garbage code Toyota has contracted out to the cheapest bidders. The best perspective I can offer is this:\n\n* The average new car contains a whopping [*100 million lines of code*](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/millions-lines-of-code/)\n* the Chevy Volt, whose software designed from the ground up by both GM and IBM, [only had 10 million](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gms-volt-10-million-lines-of-code/). Imagine trying to fix a bug or add a new feature in *90 million lines* of garbage.\n\nOn top of having the overwhelming share of EV sales (a disruptive technology), Tesla's agile approach to software and hardware changes are why I think they're the most ready to adapt to a changing industry. And I'm not alone; that's why their stock is valued so high.\n\n>also, most importantly, people forget that tesla is a battery company that makes cars, and not the other way round, and its battery operations are damn good.\n\nThat's a good point. This, along with other Tesla subsidiaries like SpaceX and the Boring Company, are things people often forget when talking about them.

Yes, super capacitors have a lower internal resistance, but that simply isn\u2019t an issue in electric vehicles, the energy loss due to high current draws from the batteries is relatively minuscule. As is, Tesla batteries are over specd for the power they deliver, and to add super capacitors to mitigate the issue seems like a waste of money and weight.
