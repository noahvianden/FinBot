So many people hate the building mechanics that are a core part of the game but play it just because that\u2019s what\u2019s the popular game (I.e. cod of years past). Pubg and cod blackout both have a ton of flaws that really killed any chance of dethroning fortnite (pubg being a buggy mess that is more geared towards hardcore players, and blackout also being a buggy mess that has very dull gameplay due to the single bland open map and overall lack of diversity/shitty ui) Apex offers the best of both worlds - free to play, casual enough for the average person to be decent, and a big enough skill gap to make competitive play(tourneys and mlg type shit) actually a viable option. Also it implements features that keep team play at the core (the whole respawn mechanic that keeps players engaged in a game even after someone in their party is downed - which will help maintain the shitty player\u2019s interest since even when they die they don\u2019t need to wait 15-20 minutes for the rest of their friends to finish the match) Overall respawn has taken the feedback from all of the previous battle royal games, tweaked it, and produced a polished, fun, game that have extreme potential in the long run and came at a great time because so many gamers have been waiting for something to kill fortnite. Disclaimer - I bought a bunch of calls based purely on emotion on Thursday after I heard the exponential player count growth and knowledge of how much cash fortnite makes off of micro transaction because none of the kids want the noob basic skin that shows the rest of their friends that they just got the game and suck and am pretty drunk typing this out on the train to the gfs apartment.

The wash rule would apply if you repurchase aapl stock (or similar security ie aapl option) within 30 days of that initial sale. So if you bought 25 shares of aapl 20 days after realizing that $1000 loss, and decided to hold for a couple of years that initial $1000 loss would be incorporated into the p/l of that 25 share you bought; you would not be able to deduct the $1000 from the tax year it was realized. So if that lot of 25 shares netted $5,000 gain you would deduct the initial, $1,000 from the $5,000; paying taxes on a $4,000 gain. You avoid the wash rule by not buying aapl within 30 days of selling. Use this for tax purposes at end of year, and buy a stock that moves similarly to aapl (e.g., MSFT),  then repurchasing aapl once the 30 days has passed.

A naked option has a lot more risk exposure for the seller.\n\nLet's say you write a covered call with a strike of $35/share for April 2019. The market price for that option is around $0.75 which means you would get $75 per contract - that is $0.75 * 100 shares.\n\nBest case scenario, TWTR stays under $35 and you get to pocket the $75.  \nWorst case scenario, TWTR goes to $40 (or higher) and you get assigned at $35. That means you're forced to sell 100 shares at $35 per contract. You still get to keep the $75 per contract though.\n\nPro tip: once you've sold to open, leave a Good Til Cancelled Buy to Close order at $0.01.
