The company won't release figures for the number of reservations remaining outstanding. \n Given the amount of deposits sitting with the company dropped $134 million last quarter we can deduce they almost certainly had over 50,000 cancellations last quarter alone.  And why would they be waiting for the base model?  They could get the MR version with PUP for $38.5k after the federal rebate in December.

I don't know the exact number (only Tesla does) but it would be the number of remaining reservations + extra demand that exists. \n\n> Seems like sales in the US collapsed in January despite the price cut.\n\nThat is true. January is generally a weak month for car sales in general. Much of the country had record cold last week for example. Maybe the lower price means they are comfortable with the Profit.\n\nEither way I hope demand around the world is steady for the next several month.

First, because these price reductions come with some feature gone. The current reduction, I hear, was enabled because they took off the referral bonus. And then other price reductions come with things like lower range. What I'm trying to say is that these price reductions are not a mere discount with all other factors staying same. Second, just reducing the prices don't always open you up to a wider range of market segments. Chances are just reducing prices will increase demand in current segments - this doesn't have a big long term value. For example, if some luxury brand which currently sells to celebrities just gave a 50% discount, more celebrities will buy it - you really can't expect all those discount sales to go to normal people. However what Tesla could be trying to do is to tap in to more market segments, people from different countries, different incomes, different range requirements, etc.\n\n>But saying they are production constrained implies they cannot produce enough to fulfill demand at the current price.\n\nThey could be able to fulfill the demand of a single segment. But if they want to address many segments I don't think they can fulfill the demand of all those segments. They are definitely production constrained there.\n\nIt's a question of strategy and current situation. May be the demand of the current segments is lower than what they can produce, which seems to be what you are suggesting.\n\nOr may be the demand of the current segments is higher or close to what they can produce. In this case they have two options, until the production capacity increases.. One is to keep on trying to fulfill current segments without changing configurations or prices. Second is to start tapping into other segments and without fulfilling the current segments' demand.

Someone quoting your own words and demonstrating clear inconsistencies is **not a strawman**. Even if it was, if would behoove you to explain what your meaning was in those cases, and how it was out of context, not just declare that /u/peacockypeacock is making a strawman of your points. \n\n#By saying that's all he does, and therefore he's bad, you're literally making a strawman of him.\n\n/u/peacockypeacock, they do have some valid points. You hold your beliefs about Tesla very firmly, and with consistency. This is good. But it can also make arguing against you unpleasant, particularly because you seem to have more detailed knowledge of finances and investment practices than many around here, and are not shy on letting people know when their knowledge is lacking.\n\nI haven't had any major issues with you myself, mostly because I'm well aware that there's a lot I don't know and I'm here to learn, not contribute in any major way.

I haven't had many interaction with /u/Soooohatemods, and I can't speak for his character or the others, but **I would implore the mods to keep this space minimally moderated**. It is my view that moderation is best served to help keep discussions civil, not choose discussion topics. If something truly is just FUD, people will downvote. From my experience, they do that to stockbroker regardless.\n\nI wish you the best for your time away, stockbroker, and hope you find it helps.\n\n/u/allihavelearned, I *have* had some issues with you, but I respect your right to hold the opinions you do and will gladly discuss anything with you here, so long as I am knowledgeable enough to be worth talking to. \n\n/u/Ephendril, /u/kyriii, I appreciate you defending them.

A little too much like a schoolteacher for my tastes, but I still haven't had to ban anyone involved, so it seems to have worked.\n\nMy preference in these situations would be to encourage people to report comments/posts they believe aren't in line with the intention of the subreddit - in this case, Tesla investment related, regardless of position - and in the case of a ban being needed to make it widely clear why this is happening. It's hard to complain about a ban of a popular user if you write a 12 paragraph explanation of why, including quotes of all the reported moments that brought you to that decision.\n\nNow this obviously wouldn't work on a large subreddit, but on a small one like this with only a half-dozen well-known users who tend to be involved in any trouble?

Got 2 tsla calls and a long amzn call rn, but i hold stock in each (majority) to secure profit but not have to risk all my money in options. Kind of did this unintentionally with my holding style, but its nice because I can bet big and safe. But I still hold 3800 in options rn. 26,000 in stocks of the same ticker.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm mostly in index right now.  Too much risk with China imo for tech.  Not sure how they'll respond to huawei.  To be fair they'll have a much better case for shutting down American tech firms due to proven and possible persisting NSA backdoors.  And I've heard this being tossed around.  \nI only short when I play with options.  My best play last year was a 2700% gain on snap puts.  Rode that shit from 11 to 5.50.  I actually made out enough to buy a model S.  \n\n\nEdit.  Post before I was done with my epic run.  Yeah yeah rh I know. I only do play money on that shit. But this time it turned to real money\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amhx65fiydr11.jpg?utm_source=reddit-android&auto=webp&s=69137c99e535184e7d1c54eba2eabd2b6e693652", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5467909574508667}], "tickers": ["amzn", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1953515261411667}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15414871275424957}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.375699907541275}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37317562103271484}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32594355940818787}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.141769677400589}, {"body": "earnings is 2/8.
