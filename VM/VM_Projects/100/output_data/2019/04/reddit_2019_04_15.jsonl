The one more thing shapes up to be two more things for the Investor event?   \n>  \n> Well, I just thought Raven was mostly it, but nope, that was just scratching the top of it. \n\nCodename Raven is related to new electric motors for the S and X ( [https://electrek.co/2019/04/05/tesla-model-s-new-electric-motors/](https://electrek.co/2019/04/05/tesla-model-s-new-electric-motors/) ). So Raven is scratching the top, this indicates that more new features are coming to the S and X. I think new battery technology makes the most sense. Two more things would be new motors and new batteries. With the same chemistry as the 3 and more efficient motors, Tesla could push the range of the S and X to 400 miles maybe. That would be a nice \"one more thing to add to the event\".\n\nThe actual event, the \"Tesla Autonomy Investor Day\" is the biggest puzzle for me. Elon said that they will be feature complete with their self driving software later this year. This means that right now, they cannot launch anything yet. Not even a geofenced implementation of the Tesla Network. \n\n> On April 22, Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car \n\n [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117096350301085697](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117096350301085697) \n\nThe event is clearly aimed at investors, he mentions them instead of customers. Will there be some special profile for investors with HW3 and FSD? Drop $$$ now to get early builds?\n\nWill they just present the HW3 hardware and do some demos? Musk is been holding the FSD stick and carrot in front of our faces since 2015, people will not be impressed by a demo, everyone can do demos these days. If this will just be a tripling down on FSD promises, I don't think the markets will react much.\n\nWill this include a creative way of raising cash without diluting the stock? If so, why didn't they raise when it was at $380?\n\nThe other thing that is concerning to me is all the talk about appreciating assets. They seems to be pushing the narrative that the cars will go up in value. Perhaps they are selling the SR+ cars at low/negative margin and will use this as an excuse that future FSD profitability will be priced in. This would effectively be betting the company on FSD, which would not sit well with many.\n\nIs there anything that I missed?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "400 miles is 643.74 km", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06819042563438416}, {"body": "> The event is clearly aimed at investors, he mentions them instead of customers.

In my mind, once the initial investment happens and the company gets its money, it's just a used marketplace for buying and selling, and the overall activity doesn't reflect a true investment in the company beyond differing bets; some bet the shares will be worth more, some bet they will be worth less, and there are legal mechanisms to do it (options, short sales, or simply buying shares). I personally don't view buying shares as any different than the other mechanisms, because they are all different ways of achieving the same goal - making money off of speculating on the future worth of a share in the company.\n\nI understand that emotionally, being an \"investor\" is not the same thing as \"trading in Tesla stock\".

Does there need to be an intention to hold the shares for the long term in order to be considered an investor rather than just a trader?\n\nI don't know that there is a good answer to this question.  \n\nPeople who trade almost purely on sentiment or technical often don't know much about a company whose shares they are trading, so I don't think of them as investors.  They are fundamentally no different than computer algobots that are high-frequency trading on behalf of large institutions.\n\nHowever, it could also be the case that someone intends to hold shares for the long haul, but soon after they buy, something changes about the company and changes their viewpoint enough to induce them to sell.  No longer having an intent to hold the shares doesn't negate the fact that they were an investor.\n\nThere are also people who both invest and speculate in the same company.  At Tesla Motors Club, some of the high-rollers, most of whom I believe are no longer contributors there, maintain 2 piles of shares: one pile of \"core\" shares of TSLA that they would plan to hold for at least 10+ years, and a second pile of TSLA trading shares and/or derivatives.  They would both invest for the long haul and try to win money on short term volatility.    \n\nIf this sub was intended to be a relatively unbiased community, it might have been more aptly named \"teslastockclub\".  To me, \"investment\" connotes long term growth and commitment.  When I began investing, I started out with index mutual funds at Vanguard.  Vanguard's idea of investing has always been to grow money by taking a long-term, steady approach.  They specifically discourage fund holders from trading and trying to time the market, although the introduction of ETFs (against the wishes of the company's founder) did open the door to some speculation.

It appears to me from all angles that investing exists only as a way for people who already have money to make more money for simply having money. It traps people who don't have money by telling them that unless they can convince some benevolent rich person to fund their ideas they are worthless and their ideas are worthless. The entire system exists as a way to prevent people without money from becoming people with money by forcing them to sell ownership of their ideas to other people.   \n\nIt's actually worse where this system doesn't exists, or exists with a lower capacity. For example people in many Asian countries are very cautious with their money and very risk averse. Wealthy people with lots of money are afraid of losing money, so they buy Gold, put their money in the bank, and very few invest in new business. Young people with great innovative ideas want to sell, wish to sell their idea but there are no buyer, no moneyowner want to part with their money.   \nWhat I want to say is this system exists because it's a net positive for a society/ a country.
