Do you think that there is good \"reason and intention\" behind suppressing wages until full-time workers, whose labor is necessary to run the business of private enterprise, rely on taxpayer-funded welfare programs for basic subsistence?   It sounds like suppressing wages is always good, but raising wages is subject to intense scrutiny and grasping Fox News-style sound bites.\n\nAnd yes, I'm well aware of popular culture.  It's responding to the increasingly widespread awareness of the the last few decades' steady increase in per-worker productivity contrasted with wage stagnation over the same period.\n\nAt it's heart, it's the _very same gripe_ people are presenting here: \"My utility is more than my 'minimum wage' colleague, but his wages are rising to match mine.  Shouldn't my compensation be greater than his since I create more utility?\"  Likewise, if workers today are producing more economic value than in the past, shouldn't they be compensated accordingly?\n\nThe difference is that it's easy to look at the \"unworthy\" janitor or bank teller and seethe that they are now receiving close to the same compensation you are.  People are now becoming more conscious of the fact that the rising value of their labor has been used by a very small economic elite (who exist in a world of nepotism and upward-failing) to give themselves huge raises.  We're told to ignore the ballooning compensation of executives but get angry at small raises for other workers, and somehow people fall for it.\n\nThe difference is that raising the compensation of workers both creates real upward pressure on the price of labor across the economy (ultimately also benefiting people like you and me that earn much more than minimum wage) as well as recirculates those wages in the form of spending, which benefits business and boosts the value of their stock, as they now have access to more consumer dollars.  Huge raises to executives do none of this except enabling the purchase of more equities, inflating their prices.  Buying up equities is not \"investment\" in new enterprise, as it's often mis-portrayed.
