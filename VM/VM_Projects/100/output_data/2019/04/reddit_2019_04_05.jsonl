I really am more critical of Tesla than anyone else. The regulations are out of Elon's control, but the cool thing is that if they are going to give waymo freedom, they have to give tesla freedom to use self driving. So, it's more about the data building and algorithms made to assess/analyze that data, which is what I 'know' tesla has been doing on a national basis ([https://electrek.co/2018/07/17/tesla-autopilot-miles-shadow-mode-report/](https://electrek.co/2018/07/17/tesla-autopilot-miles-shadow-mode-report/)) (>1 billion miles logged as of july and able to be analyzed by tesla, this number will/is growing exponentially) The limiting factor is actually the analysis and resources they put toward understanding and applying info to the fleet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as 'something may be required that is not present in current vehicles' are you qualified to make that statement/do you have a source?

Until they get through it, there is zero point in capturing more data. Beyond the storage, someone needs to go through each exception to analyze and classify. That's a ton of work when you already know there are fundamental issues to fix. And where the fix hopefully eliminates the majority of new cases that are collected.\n\nTo put this in context: sometimes my team will deploy stinky code. Our normal policy is to have users log every issue, with screenshots and details. But sometimes our deploy is so bad (and rollback is not possible) where we'll just tell users to stop logging. We know there's an issue, and until we work through it there's no need for hundreds of duplicate tickets and other noise.\n\nSo that's where I think they are right now.\n\nI've been giving thought to the 0.1%. I wonder if that's some sampling frame where they still want some data just in case there's something new, but where they expect 99.9% of disengagements to be the same stuff they already know. So reducing to 0.1% over many, many disengagements gives them enough to see new stuff without weeding through a huge stack of knowns.\n\nReally appreciate your work, btw.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4996226131916046}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5060893893241882}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "> The plant will be dedicated to building \u201cLevel 4\u201d autonomous cars, which means the vehicle can do all the driving within specific geofenced areas and under certain conditions.
