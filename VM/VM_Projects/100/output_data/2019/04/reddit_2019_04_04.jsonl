Of course you're being redundant because you think you're making a point but I'll feign ignorance and to be fairly honest you say you live in denver so you don't really have a shot here. Those who work hard as is in California are having a hard time with job competition right now so you will fare fare worse if you can't even figure out where to send a resume. You won't be able to afford a home here unless you sit on a large amount of cash already which would be self contradictory as you'd be a \"millionaire\" then or or you would resort to mortgaging forcing you to maintain a job to pay for the home. You're life coming from Colorado will be worse, People are migrating from California to Colorado and other cheaper areas of living. My grandparents did and they live \"close\" to denver.\n\nAnywhere in the bay or urban centers will cost more and pay more with few industry exceptions. San Fransisco, Palo alto, Sacramento, LA, nappa, ect. will be far more expensive than say Fremont, Hayward, union city, san Rafael, Oakland, ect. The latter being far cheaper than the more established cities yet still being far more expensive then \\*denver\\* lol. The good news is everything is fairly close and you could live in Fremont and work in san fransisco with a 40 min to hour long commute. You could even live in the bay and take a plane to LA in 2 hours if you work a job that compensates for airfare though I've yet to see anyone actually do this other than a few internet people claiming they do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMedicine and silicon is the \"go to\" job so if you have experience in either you will be able to make ends meet. Eletrical, RF, aereospace, software, really all engineering is king in the valley and nurses to doctors are high in demand. RN's who work for hospitals can reach six figures easily after a few years and Nurse Practitioners do so as well very easily. I'm not going to go over pay for doctors as that's self explanatory. If you work in any well paying job between silicon to medicine you're best bet would be to find employment from the top of the bay to the bottom as while it is high density it's not really a large region. Worst case scenario you live/rent in a shit place between union city/Hayward/Oakland and drive 1-2 hours commute to work or take bart. Once again you give no industry experience or qualifications so it's hard to say with any more definitive answers. Doesn't really matter though if you're okay with an hour commute as that will get you to most places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for home prices. I live in union city and my neighborhood had a home going for 850,000 which was under the average of the neighborhood and it's near palo alto/san fransisco/stanford which is where most of my acquaintances and family work. The home was sold very quickly. You'd be an hour tops before traffic. Lets get some actual numbers though. I'm going to disregard neighborhood because you probably won't be able to afford to choose moving to the state so late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome homes/condos found for San Francisco:\n\n**$265,375**   **335 Berry St UNIT 203,\u00a0San Francisco, CA 94158**   **641** sqft\n\nThis is a condo. It's small. If that's your thing this isn't terrible, they can get far more expensive.\n\n**$623,647**    **4201 Ocean Ave,\u00a0San Francisco, CA 94132**   **1,660** sqft\n\nExtremely cheap for san fransisco. Foreclosure home though which you'll find many of. You wouldn't want to live in this area but you might not have a choice and a home is a home.\n\n**$765,370**   **1042 Mississippi St,\u00a0San Francisco, CA 94107**  **2,500 sqft**\n\nsimilar case similar feelings.\n\n**$1,551,217**  **615 Missouri St,\u00a0San Francisco, CA 94107**   **1,990** sqft\n\nA friend lives near here and this home is also a foreclosure home. As the areas and homes get nicer the size will go down and the price will rocket.\n\n**$2,000,000**   **127 Crescent Ave,\u00a0San Francisco, CA 94110**   **2,940** sqft\n\nreasonably priced for it's size. Still not in an amazing area but absolutely nothing wrong with where it's located.\n\n**$4,500,000**   **1358 S Van Ness Ave,\u00a0San Francisco, CA 94110**   **2,930** sqft\n\nVery good location very decent deal. You could get away with not even having a car because of how close to BART this home is. If I had the money I wouldn't mind to live here. I don't though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnion city. Keep note location is still important but it's no longer a matter of bad or good rather better than or less than, Understand Union city is nothing compared to San Francisco:\n\n**$185,000**  **340 Waikiki Cir,\u00a0Union City, CA 94587**\n\nIt's a mobile home. People will judge you, I won't. These will do well for you. Terrible investment but if you don't view homes as investments and don't mind living in this go for it.\n\n**$899,000**  **26623 Tyrrell Ave,\u00a0Hayward, CA 94544**  **2,253** sqft\n\nnothing to say about homes in union city/hayward really. I would have said avoid decoto 10 years ago but times have changed.\n\n**$1,188,000**  **4221 Oliver Way,\u00a0Union City, CA 94587**   **2,310** sqft\n\nnothing to say about homes in union city really. I would have said avoid decoto 10 years ago but times have changed.\n\n**$1,200,000**  **30420 Meridian Circle, Union City, CA 94587**\n\nThis was sold a year ago for 1.2 million. This neighborhood is nice but not the nicest in the city and has a home owners association that could vastly improve itself. It is a gated community but in my personal opinion that actually detracts from the value of the homes due to the home owner association.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Homes near James Logan(HS) retain value very well though I couldn't find one for sale. It's the only high school there and it's not great but being there are no alternatives its a pro for home value. Certain neighborhoods in this area will be considered \"the best\" in the city and I would be inclined to agree though they will also be the most expensive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would keep listing prices so you get an idea of where to go but I don't have infinite weekend. I live in the neighborhood of one of the listed union city homes there so knock yourself out with that little mini game if you'd like. I and most of the people I know are not rich but work in the \"valued\" fields in the bay. We moved here far before prices got to where they are now and I never even had to buy a home so my situation is pretty darn comfortable but I like most others have bills to pay in order to live here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ignored trade jobs which isn't fair to those out there in that profession so I'll say the potential to make a great wage is definitely possible in those fields but not nearly guaranteed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Cali is more expensive than Colorado. It shows how little you know since you even question that. You are probably not qualified to work here or not financially capable of moving here and living comfortably. Info is needed on your profession before any recommendations on where to send a resume can be given. By simply stating \"where do I send the resume\" you look foolish. By saying you will \"move to California for one of these jobs\" makes you look foolish. There's not much to say at this point so if you respond with redundancy I will ignore you and if you respond with worthwhile discussion or actual inquiries of homes for sale I will happily assist.

On top of that what you have in court is all things concerned a guy who got laid, so that social hatred piles up because it's a zero sum game and basically that guy subtracted poon from the poon pool, so fuck him right? \n\n2) Women hate the man they are fighting off in court, and best case scenario they are indifferent to other men being screwed over in courts, but simply most likely they strongly sympathize with all the other women also fighting their own court battle. So to summarize they strongly hate the men they are fighting off in court and all the other men fighting in court as well.\n\nGiven all that you can clearly see where the social hatred is flowing towards, hence it's only normal that courts would act that way as at the end of the day they are made up institutions whose job is to apply made up laws, both do follow the social consensus .\n\nIt all makes sense, when people mention inequality, males at the top of the social ladder, big boys club etc...I legit laugh so hard...they are so rich and powerful because they had to go through miles and miles of walls of fire (or swim across a gator infested moat if you like Buffett-slang), no wonder the reward is enormous.

The winning sperm gets a much deserved prize and becomes a human after having beaten the odds. \n\nThe prize is the ova, which unlike sperm is much more rare , there have only been 12.5 to 16 Trillions ovaries in the history of mankind...so what were you saying about women being favored in courts again??

As they mentioned in their letter, there were a lot emergent circumstances that lead to delays in all markets.  It's very possible they had the vast majority of the 63k sales for the quarter already ordered and produced, just stuck in transit in one place or another.\n\nAs for the lower prices, I think they were planning to launch the SR sometime in Q1 all along.  The idea being, you want to tee up as many SR and SR+ sales as you can prior to the tax credit drop on July 1.  Giving day 1 reservation holders plenty of time to get the car they were promised before their tax credit evaporates is good for the brand, good for customer loyalty, and good publicity that may be worth a short-term margin hit.\n\nBut then why did they drop the prices on everything else?  Upsales.  The whole product line needs to hang together as a continuous progression of decisions.  If I just spend X more, I can get Y.  If there's ever a clear break in that progression, you create a very natural stopping point where a lot of consumers will stop looking any higher.  But if you can have a continuous line of easy steps, you maximize the chances a new buyer will spend the most they can possibly justify on their new car and that helps push them into higher-margin variants.\n\nSo while the chaos of the announcements indicates a little improvisation in the moment, I think a lot of what was done was really just things going according to plan.  If anything, the store closure idea gave them a way to speed up their release by a month or so and that made it look like a good idea and encouraged them to rush a little.\n\n\\*Edited for clarity.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Occam\u2019s razor, my friend.
