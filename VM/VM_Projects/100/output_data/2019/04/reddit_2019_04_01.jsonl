The real question is where they wind up landing in their guidance range at the end of the year and the gross margins that go with that.  I personally think the market is taking all estimates with skepticism because of 2018, while Tesla has switched to a more conservative approach to projections because they are on firmer footing and can handle some negative speculation.  There was a period last year where they had a serious reason to worry about a death spiral sparked by negative news while their production ramp was still struggling.  Delays lead to expenses, bad news leads to customer deposit cancellations, cash crunch leads to difficulty raising emergency cash, or greatly increases the cost of doing so.  But now they can sustain themselves on sales, so they can aim low on guidance without worrying about a panic.  But the market takes their guidance as historically optimistic/unrealistically high depending on who you ask, so it's assuming they will disappoint.  I think the shoe will drop about mid-year when they confirm they are on track to hit the high end of their range and it starts looking like they could reasonably break through the top.\n\nIn the short term, I'm keen to see if they say anything about Model Y orders/deposits.  I think most people are happy to wait and buy later, but it would be interesting if they got like 40k deposits for $100m in spare cash on hand.
