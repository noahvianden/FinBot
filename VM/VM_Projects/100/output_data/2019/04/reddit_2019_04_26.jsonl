Despite their amusing story claiming all of the drop was merely due to delivery logistics, it seems that in fact their demand has significantly weakened. They seem to have burnt through what was pent-up for the Model 3.\n\nThe S&X had better margins than the 3, obviously (unless one actually believes the numbers put out by TSLA in which case go ahead and buy the dip), and those sales were hurt the most.\n\nThey showed ~$2.2 billion in cash at end of Q1. On their current course they can burn very roughly $500 million per quarter quite easily, but they also have the cash conversion cycle working against them from the volume decline and they had negative net working capital already.\n\nDebt is tapped out. They managed to get another $500 million on their ABL which helped to save them this quarter but I don't see a whole lot more of that coming. I'm skeptical a convertible could be floated, but maybe if it was crazy dilutive.\n\nSo the question, as it always has been, is equity. Why they haven't raised already is the ultimate question of the stock. My guess has been a combination of weak demand and Musk rejecting giving any discount. That's only going to be worse now with the stock price so low.\n\nAnd they need to raise a lot. I think $5 billion would be about the lowest that would be reasonable to keep them operating as well as leave enough for a reasonable growth story. That's challenging to do into a ~~$60~~ ~~$50~~ $40 billion falling knife of a stock whose CEO committed blatant securities fraud via a fake buyout last year.\n\nThe market's not buying the pumps anymore. I'm sure there'll be bounces to come, but I don't see it getting back above $300 again. The full self driving / robotaxi claims are not credible on the timeframe Musk is projecting (and portions are not credible ever) and with the slashed R&D to boot.\n\nIt's still a longshot, but I think there's a reasonable chance TSLA does manage to go bankrupt yet this year and give me a large payout.

Literally the biggest movie in theatre history.

I know a factory that delivers steel specifically to Volvo as they require very high grade for their production process (and Volvo is extremely picky about their quality).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall you can say that if the auto industry goes tits up that steel factory follow, but id be very careful with using 1 steel plant to describe the state of an industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, any steel plant that does not operate 24/7 is automatically in trouble as steel requires a huge amount of energy to produce. For this enormous pans are used which need to be kept warm using gas torches (as they take up large amounts of heat). This heat easily dissipates if not kept working 24/7. Reheating a cooled pan takes a long time and allot of energy = costs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at the location of that steel plant you can see that they are landlocked and dependent on railways to provide raw materials. As far as i know, there are no large iron mines nearby (coal maybe) so materials travel from foreign countries or ports to the plant, and steel has to be railed back out to ports (assuming they provide for the auto industry/cater foreign customers) if the steel is used domestically, it is probably low grade construction steel and the factory is very depended on the state of the economy of said country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the rise of TATA India, ArcellorMittal and the huge steel conglomerates in China id say its a very bad idea to invest in any smaller steel smelter that does not have the capital of these giants to wait out crisis / increase in iron ore costs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nFactory not working 24/7 = extra cost = less profit\n\nFactory is landlocked -- > Transport = cost = less profit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not invest in said factory/company", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17687517404556274}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26403817534446716}, {"body": "Trumps wall was supposed to help but it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s happening", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Name checks out.

You're acting as if the limitation on Tesla revenue is supply when in actuality it's demand. Tesla can't sell every car it makes, that's why it dropped prices three times and why it ended the quarter with **four billion** in inventory.\n\nSecond, they don't actually have a lot of vehicles in transit. Sales numbers from some countries in Europe have already come in, and it's extremely ugly. Model 3 sales **fell 82%** in Norway and 76% in The Netherlands. Tesla may be trying to push water through the hose, but the customers at the end aren't there any more. \n\nYou expect profit of 500m-1b? Based on what? Your water hose analogy? Tesla couldn't make that much in profit despite stockpiling carbon credits and pulling all high profit margin high end trims forward. Next quarter is going to be worse than this quarter. US sales will be flat and EU/China sales will fall off a cliff just like they did in Norway.\n\n> (Excluding china business where they will run a loss on construction ofc) \n\nThis is shows you don't even understand how a business financial statement is compiled. The headline profit/loss only counts money from **operations**, building a new factory is not an expense that gets factored in. When a business builds a new factory or buys a new piece of equipment, it adds the cost of the factory to the liabilities column(because it's usually financed) and simultaneously adds it to the assets column(because the factory is worth what they paid for it). This does not affect quarterly or annual operating profit/loss at all.\n\n> Tesla finally started properly delivering outside usa.. but it probably takes 1-2 months to get cars from their factory to customer there (ships,customs etc) It led to them basically missing 1 month of sales while the pipes are being filled but it wont be that way next q.  \nAlso they will optomise these routes to be less expensive once their supply chain figures out what the fuck its doing. \n\nNext quarter sales in EU and China will be lower than this quarter. We've already seen massive drops in sales in Norway and Netherlands(which got the first European allocations).

Going long on puts, as traders say, is also a bet that prices will fall, but the strategy works differently.\n\n>Say Liquid Trading Co. still believes Humbucker stock is headed for a fall, but it opts to buy 100 $110 Humbucker puts instead. To do so, the Liquid group must put up the $11,000 ($110 x 100) in cash for the option. Liquid now has the right to force Paper, who is on the other side of the deal, to buy the stock at this price \u2013 even if Humbucker shares drop to Liquid's projected $50 a share. If they do, Liquid has made a tidy profit \u2013 $6,000.\n\n>In a way, it's achieving the same goal, just through the opposite route.

Options are financial contracts that derive their value from a specific underlying stock.  There are two types, 'calls' and 'puts'.\n\nA 'call' option is a contract that entitles the buyer to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at a specific price (strike price) by a specific (expiration) date.  After the expiration date, the contract goes poof into thin air and disappears.\n\nAn option costs money to buy, and the price of the contract depends on two things, 'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' (or time) value.  Intrinsic value is easy to calculate, it's just the amount you would make if you exercised your right to buy the shares right now.  Intrinsic value defines the 'moneyness' of an option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* In the money (ITM) = the call option strike is below the stock price (has intrinsic value).  The farther below the strike is, the more ITM it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* At the money (ATM) = the call option strike is either very very close or equal to the stock price (but still has 0 intrinsic value)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Out of the money (OTM) = the call option strike is above the stock price (no intrinsic value). The farther above the stock price the strike is, the more OTM it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's say you are holding a call option for a stock that is currently trading at $50, and your contract gives you the right to buy 100 shares at a strike price of $45 per share.  On a per share basis, you would be able to buy shares for $45 and sell for $50.  Therefore, you would make $5 per share on 100 shares ($500).  This potential profit is the intrinsic value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, your call must be worth at least $5 per share (or $500).  The price of an option is listed on a per share basis, and the vast majority of options are for 100 shares. So whenever you see the price of an option in an option chain (list of all the different strikes/expiration dates), just multiply the number by 100 to know how much money it costs.\n\nExtrinsic (time) value is more tricky.  It's described by complicated math (stochastic/partial differential equations).  In a nutshell extrinsic value depends on how likely it is that the option will have some intrinsic value by the expiration date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The farther out an expiration date is, the more 'time' value the option has, because there is more time for it to become profitable by expiration.  So an option with an expiration of one week will be vastly cheaper than an option that expires in a year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The closer the strike price is to the current stock price, the more it will be worth, because the stock doesn't have to move as far for the option to gain some intrinsic value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Here's where it gets tricky.  The last component to extrinsic value is called 'implied volatility.'  To really understand what implied volatility really is can take some time and some mathematical knowledge.  IV is given as a percentage and it basically is the distance the stock is expected to move (up or down). (edit) theoretically the price of the option depends on IV, but in practice IV depends on the option's price. (/edit) Weird.  The more IV an option has, the more extrinsic value it has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, OP basically bought very cheap calls that were very close to expiration, very far away from the stock price, and very likely to expire worthless. The calls very quickly gained value as the stock quickly moved up (only extrinsic value, and extrinsic value increases nonlinearly), and OP profited bigly (because there was a very low chance of this happening, according to math) by selling the contracts to someone else.

Options are financial contracts that derive their value from a specific underlying stock.  There are two types, 'calls' and 'puts'.\n\nA 'call' option is a contract that entitles the buyer to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at a specific price (strike price) by a specific (expiration) date.  After the expiration date, the contract goes poof into thin air and disappears.\n\nAn option costs money to buy, and the price of the contract depends on two things, 'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' (or time) value.  Intrinsic value is easy to calculate, it's just the amount you would make if you exercised your right to buy the shares right now.  Intrinsic value defines the 'moneyness' of an option.\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060In the money (ITM) = the call option strike is below the stock price (has intrinsic value).  The farther below the strike is, the more ITM it is.\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060At the money (ATM) = the call option strike is either very very close or equal to the stock price (but still has 0 intrinsic value)\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Out of the money (OTM) = the call option strike is above the stock price (no intrinsic value). The farther above the stock price the strike is, the more OTM it is.\n\n\nLet's say you are holding a call option for a stock that is currently trading at $50, and your contract gives you the right to buy 100 shares at a strike price of $45 per share.  On a per share basis, you would be able to buy shares for $45 and sell for $50.  Therefore, you would make $5 per share on 100 shares ($500).  This potential profit is the intrinsic value.\n\n\nTherefore, your call must be worth at least $5 per share (or $500).  The price of an option is listed on a per share basis, and the vast majority of options are for 100 shares. So whenever you see the price of an option in an option chain (list of all the different strikes/expiration dates), just multiply the number by 100 to know how much money it costs.\n\nExtrinsic (time) value is more tricky.  It's described by complicated math (stochastic/partial differential equations).  In a nutshell extrinsic value depends on how likely it is that the option will have some intrinsic value by the expiration date.\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060The farther out an expiration date is, the more 'time' value the option has, because there is more time for it to become profitable by expiration.  So an option with an expiration of one week will be vastly cheaper than an option that expires in a year.\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060The closer the strike price is to the current stock price, the more it will be worth, because the stock doesn't have to move as far for the option to gain some intrinsic value.\n\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Here's where it gets tricky.  The last component to extrinsic value is called 'implied volatility.'  To really understand what implied volatility really is can take some time and some mathematical knowledge.  IV is given as a percentage and it basically is the distance the stock is expected to move (up or down).  IV depends on the option's price and the option's price depends on IV.  Weird.  The more IV an option has, the more extrinsic value it has.\n\n\nSo, OP basically bought very cheap calls that were very close to expiration, very far away from the stock price, and very likely to expire worthless. The calls very quickly gained value as the stock quickly moved up (only extrinsic value, and extrinsic value increases nonlinearly), and OP profited bigly (because there was a very low chance of this happening, according to math) by selling the contracts to someone else.
