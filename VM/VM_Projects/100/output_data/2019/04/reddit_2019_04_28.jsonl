He also said over suppliers can be used for the storage segment, and only the cars need to come from Giga.\n\nElon Musk\n\n> Sure. The challenge really is battery cells scarcity. As far as the additional storage is concerned, we basically need an up-sell to support the vehicle production as well as to full power on Powerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for Model 3 as opposed to Powerpack. So we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to continue some level of production on the Powerpack. This year, we think that we will be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs like current, J.B., like what do you guys think?\n\nJ.B. Straubel\n\n> Yes, between 5% and 10%, something like that.\n\nElon Musk\n\n> Yes. So, there are [indiscernible] in a Powerwall in the car so that translates to a \u2013 quite a decent number of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from variety of suppliers around the world. The Powerwall Powerpack, because I don\u2019t have to go through vehicle [indiscernible] are much more adaptable to using variety of cells from other cell providers. So, we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year maybe on the order of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry, sorry. Yes, 300, confirming it, 300%.

From Q1 '19 Earnings CC transcript: [https://www.yahoo.com/news/tesla-inc-tsla-q1-2019-130927603.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/tesla-inc-tsla-q1-2019-130927603.html)\n\n>**Zachary Kirkhorn** \\-- *Chief Financial Officer*  \n>  \n>Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately to 20%.  \n>  \n>In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.\n\nFor simplicity, consider the following mix of Model 3 sales.  I derived ASPs for each of the variants by assuming that customer choice in paint color, interior color, wheel type, and FSD, would amount to about 1000 $US above base price for each car.\n\n30% SR+ @ ASP of 40,500\n\n60% LR AWD @ ASP of 50,500\n\n10% LR AWD Performance @ ASP of 60,500\n\nThis results in an overall ASP of 48,500 $US.  If Tesla is already getting a 20% gross margin on a similar mix of cars when production is about 5k/week, they may have substantial opportunity to reach the targeted 25% GM as the manufacturing process improves and economies of scale get better (assuming that Tesla can expand to 7k/week production at Fremont).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.\n\nthis is the line I heard that I feel didn't get enough play. I found it amazing, BUT and a big BUT, Europe and China haven't had SR+ availablity, so the 25k shipped overseas were all LR and above\n\nSo it's not surprising to have that high of a mix, Q2 and finally Q3 will give us a better idea of the balance of pricing the Model 3 will be able to sell.\n\nPersonally I still want them to produce an even cheaper $30k version of the Model 3 when/if they can get the maxwell tech in play. They can put in 45kwh of battery, optimize the weight of the car, do a solid roof on the car and really make something that is even more affordable. at $30k, it would really be an attractive price and really open up the market.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That is a good point.

My impression from that statement was that it would translate into a higher sustained level of inventory in transit, which has a negative effect on a quarter's worth of profits and cash flow, but a positive effect on steady-state margins.  Once the wave is undone, inventory in transit should hover around 2-4 weeks of production and the change from quarter to quarter should be proportional to their change in production rate throughout the quarter.  That should be a much smaller effect after Q2, which is why they're guiding for profit in Q3 and Q4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo no, Q2's projected profit has a big one-time hit that says nothing about the per-car margin.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4001266658306122}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Tesla is almost -40% from ATHS.
