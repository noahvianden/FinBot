I don't understand what you are getting at here at all.  \n\nThe other big point is that if those orders are all for the Model 3 (particularly the SR+), that might indicate really weak demand for the S/X (which would explain the cut in the standard trims).  \n\n> And with the last question regarding production increase, isn't starting production of the Model Y better news than simply expanding production of the Model 3?

{"title": "The WSB guide to index funds - a buy and hold strategy so ballsy Vanguard won't let you do it (UPRO/TMF + fun add-ons like futures/gold)", "selftext": "We all like money. We all like getting more of it, and [some of us really enjoy giving it all away](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cdx7y5/shoutout_to_jnj_calls_for_being_the_final_nail_in/). Fortunately for the latter this will make your portfolio shoot wildly in different directions before you finally rocket up to the big pie in the sky. This is a plan so wild [it actually made Bogleheads users excited for once in their lives](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007).\n\nNow if the pussies at r/investing had their way you'd plop 50% of your paycheck into some low-cost, broad-market, diversified artistanal GMO-free fair trade certified index fund and you'd keep doing that until you turn 78, at which point you open your portfolio, sell everything for ONE MILLION DOLLARS and use it to pay your hospital bills with maybe enough left to break up the surviving members of your family over your inheritance.\n\nI won't give you a yacht tomorrow but on average with this strategy, you can make in two years what they can make in one. Which means more money to peel off from this fund into whatever options/shady Chinese tech stocks you care to buy. *And that's why I'm posting this here*.\n\nNow Mr. Shkreli always said the secret to riches is to use other people's money. And fortunately my good friends at ProShares (and their slightly gayer cousins over at Direxion, proud owners of [THE NUG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/jnug?ltr=1)) will give you some of other people's money to invest. These are called *3x* funds and are understood by pretty much nobody.\n\nThe way they work is something like this: You have $10,000. You go to your good friend and ask him for $20,000. You take that money and put it into $SPY (or whatever the fund tracks) when the market opens. Then when the market closes you sell all your shares and give your friend back his 20 grand, plus a little interest for being such a good, trusting friend (currently, 1% a year). Now tomorrow, you can repeat the same trick, but if you now have $10,300 after paying your friend, he'll give you $20,600 because you know what you're doing. If you only have $9,700, he'll only give you $19,400 because you don't know what you're doing. However much you have in the morning, you'll get double from your good friend, and all he asks is that little bit of interest. This is called *leverage*, and in our case, it *resets daily*.\n\nIn our case, we want two good friends. One of them is a fund called **UPRO** which just like my example tracks the S&P 500 and gives you 3x daily leverage. The other one is called **TMF** which leverages long-term treasuries ($TLT). TLT works by buying treasury bonds of about 20 years and selling slightly older treasury bonds of the same maturity. The retard's explanation is: when rates go up, TLT goes down, when rates go down, TLT goes up, and when rates stay the same, you make that 2% or whatever the 20-year rate is. TMF is your good friend who will help you buy TLT until it stops being boring.\n\n**But the SEC, Vanguard, r/investing, Morningstar, and my dad's financial advisor told me these funds will all go to 0!** First off, why the fuck are you here? But second off, they've a right to be worried, because if you read this far, thought treasuries are boring, and just went balls-deep into UPRO, [**you could lose 97.5% of all your money** (look at the y-axis)](https://i.imgur.com/xMypC66.png). [Author's note: you'd still beat the market by a few grand if you held through that entire dip.] However while a lot of 3x funds will go to 0 over time due to volatility issues and expense ratios, these two *won't*. Because their underlyings, stonks and treasuries, rise faster than their expense ratio eat away at your gainz. A LOT faster in the case of stock. In fact, *both UPRO and TMF pay dividends* (like a few pennies a share, but still).\n\nI just mentioned volatility issues, what are those? A lot of people on Reddit will tell you, if you bring up UPRO or TQQQ, that these are bad because if SPY goes up 1% and then goes down 1%, you lose a little money, and since UPRO goes up 3 and down 3, you lose more than triple the money. They're not wrong, but that's not the only thing that can happen, and if you actually took their dumb example and did a little bit of shitty probability theory, you'd actually find out you make more than 3 times the underlying: https://pastebin.com/zFFDr7fq. Not guaranteeing that you'll actually 3x the fund though. You could also lose 97.5% of it. But read on and I'll explain how you can double your annual returns. Which adds up to a lot more money than anything else you can do by pushing a single button every month.\n\n**I hate math, just tell me what to do**. I can't tell you what to do but I'll tell you what I'm going to do. For the smoothest ride possible, I want the volatilities to match. To do that, I take my money, **I put 40% of it into UPRO, and the other 60% into TMF, and come back once a month to rebalance it back to that percentage.** The rebalance is key to avoiding that horror story with the 97.5% loss. The long and short of it is, *UPRO and TMF have zero to slightly negative correlation*. If there's a crash and UPRO takes a dump, Treasuries will barely notice, so I'll sell my perfectly good or maybe slightly inflated TMF on my rebalancing day, load up on cheap UPRO, and when the market inevitably recovers, UPRO shoots back up at lightspeed and suddenly more money appears in my pocket. You don't have to do once a month either. You can do every 3 months, or more frequently if you don't mind paying cap gains on all the sales you inevitably make/rebalance via a steady source of income.\n\n**How much do I make?** If you put 100k and nothing else into this fund in 1987, and we pretend both these funds existed pre-2009 with the same rules, [14 million](https://i.imgur.com/Wj1FEIi.png) vs 2 million with 100% stocks. It would've been a bumpy ride up, but note that you'd actually never experience a 50% loss on your investment, ever, which can't be said for people holding 100% stocks.\n\n**That sucks, why did you make me read this?** Because it's lazy and still semi-responsible. However there's a few things you can do if you want to milk more returns:\n\n* **Go 60% UPRO/40% TMF**. You'll potentially lose more on the way down (66% max drawdown, but that's nothing by WSB standards), but you'll make it all back on the way up, plus an extra percent or so.\n\n* **Sub out UPRO for TQQQ**. The Nasdaq will make you more money, and then the dot com bubble will burst and you'll lose it all. So try not to do this when that happens.\n\n* **Use FUTURES to up the leverage!** [I don't know what the fuck this guy did](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4636048#p4636048) but he said 8x leverage and 8 is more than 3! Pros are you get to trade in the future and you get more money which is pretty cool. Cons are the futures might go against you overnight and your broker will nuke your portfolio to cover the cost. Your good friends at ProShares would never do that to you.\n\n**Is this risk-free money?** ~~Yes~~ No. If the market crashes AND rates go up significantly/inflation happens, your portfolio will be in a deep hole. Luckily the Fed is pretty transparent in current year, and post-Volcker they've gotten a handle on not doing funny business with rates. Europe and Japan are close to 0 on long term treasuries and negative in the short term, so we CAN in fact get lower (and TMF will get richer).\n\nProShares can also shut its doors but these are ETF's, not ETN's, which means they won't fuck you out of your money like Credit Suisse did during the Vixpocalypse last year.\n\n**But if inflation happens?** Sounds gay, but okay. Add some gold in there. Except don't be a pussy, be sure to 3x it. Try [UGLD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UGLD/)\n\n**TL;DR** This (and its variations like TQQQ/TMF) is probably the most ballsy buy-and-hold that still actually makes money and makes a lot of it. Make sure to rebalance or you'll lose half your money.\n\nPros:\n\n* You'll make more money if you're bad at options\n\n* Boomers will hate you\n\n* Thanks to TMF your Robinhood account will be different colors every day with zero correlation to what the rest of the market is doing\n\n* You'll actually get to watch a stock split when UPRO does it again (last split: May 2018)\n\nCons:\n\n* You'll make less money if you're good at options\n\n* You actually have to pay attention to what interest rates are doing (Hi, Jerome)\n\n* The market will have a run and you'll still be down for the day because TMF took a dump", "id": "ce7f4e", "created_utc": 1563334090.0, "score": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "This guy could be bullshiting me with all of this and I\u2019d still love it.

However, the backtest below (1992 - present) shows the theoretical comparison. Both P1 and P2 hold 120% in stock. P1 holds 180 in long term (20 year) treasuries. P2 holds 680% in short term (2 year) treasuries. Both portfolios had similar performance overall, but P2 had less volatility and less max drawdown. The theory is that P2 would hold up better against rising interest rates. However, once interest rates have risen and borrowing costs are higher, P2 would be susceptible to poor performance due to the higher borrowing costs because it is borrowing more dollars. In 1980 when borrowing rates were in the double digits and falling rates were more likely, it would have made more sense to borrow less and use long term treasuries. In other words, there is probably a breakeven where it's better to borrow more money and go with short term vs borrowing less money and go with long term. You could just go medium term (10 year), call it good, and never worry about making an active decision.
