That rocket exploded shortly after launch, and the debris destroyed much of the launch pad.  A second Falcon 1 failed in March 2007 when the 2nd stage exploded.  A third failure in August 2008 pushed SpaceX to the brink of bankruptcy.  **It wasn't until the 4th and final attempt, in September 2008, that a Falcon 1 reached orbit, about** ***5 years after*** **Musk said SpaceX would have an orbital rocket.**\n\nThe same has played out with many of Tesla's products.

Model X was supposed to be delivered in late 2013.  Tesla delivered a handful in late 2015, and there was not any meaningful production until mid-2016.\n\nThe consistent pattern, is that Elon Musk sets timelines and never meets them, but he ultimately delivers on the product.

I\u2019m using calls for this example, but the strategy is the same for both calls and puts.\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to take a bullish position on BYND ahead of ER, and that you want defined risk (no naked short contracts). \n\nThe simplest choice is to buy a naked ATM call; profit potential is unlimited, and risk is limited to the cost of the call. Unfortunately, premium is super high for BYND, so even though your risk would be defined using a naked long call, it would still be substantial. \n\nInstead, you can buy the ATM call, and offset the cost by selling an OTM call (lowering the total amount you are risking in the trade). Because the call you\u2019re selling is further OTM than the call you\u2019re buying, it\u2019s value goes up with the value of the call you\u2019ve bought, but it\u2019ll never surpass the value of the call you own.\n\nIn essence, it\u2019s like a covered call strategy, where instead of owning shares, you own calls.\n\nDoes that clarify things?
