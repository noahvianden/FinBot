The price cuts were actually less than the delta from the smaller variants.  Q1 mostly had this as well, but not for cars in the queue when that change was made.\n\nThe actual average sale price MAY go down, totally reasonable to assume that.  That will hurt a little, but margin is probably more important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS/X and M3 were identical 20% margins in Q1.\n\nRaven upgrades on S/X seem to share a few more components with M3 than before, probably saving costs.\n\nThey behave as though they still have quite a few levers to pull to improve M3 line efficiency and production costs.  I really think they're only bringing in cheaper variants when it doesn't damage the margin much if any.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm expecting their manufacturing efficiency to improve... very possibly it will completely negate any problems caused by price cuts or the availability of lower cost variants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ1 was a logistical failure, but not really a financial one apart from the quarterly snapshot catching them at a bad time with way too many cars in transit.  These delivery numbers alone relative to what they produced mean Q1 should have been at least 400M higher, and they get that bonus in Q2 now.

Again I don't have enough VIX shorting experience to know if the theta decay on VXX makes it still worth it, but I do know in my successful long-plays on the VIX, now looks a lot closer to the usual metrics I go with for making a long play.  As such the idea of shorting under situations close to when I go long kind of inherently raises my hackles even though I do concede its theoretically possible theta decay could still make it safe/profitable.

Additionally averaged VIX level tends to correlate but lag a bit with various spreads on the yield curve.
