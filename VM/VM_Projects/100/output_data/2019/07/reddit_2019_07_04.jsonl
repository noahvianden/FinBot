I'd buy this argument if the company was actually spending money on growth, but I'm not seeing it in their financials.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Their cost structure, overall, has to be ahead of their current earnings. Looking at the R&D level today in isolation misses the big picture. Look at the Model S program, when they had to spend R&D and when they had to grow SG&A as they expanded in the US and then overseas. See where the bulk of that spending came and how the financials change. Then repeat with Model X. And then repeat with Model 3. The Model 3 program is a bet the company project with quadrupling of volumes. It meant that a huge portion of the R&D and capex came ahead of the significant volume. But note that the depreciation and amortization rises significantly, taking big chunks away from quarterly gross profits. As production volumes increase, the earnings (losses) drop. The stair step of each of these programs is pretty clear once you look at the financials across these programs.\n\nIt is normal to think that auto dealerships won't make money for 2-3 years after initial establishment. How many new dealerships have Tesla created in the past 2-3 years? The depreciation, amortization, and SG&A is expected to be high relative to gross profits in the early days. That's why growth looks like this in the financials.\n\nChanos's argument, which is mirrored by other prominent Tesla critics, is that Tesla has no operational leverage. When deliveries increase, the costs also increase proportionately. Bulls have argued that hasn't been the case and that increases opex reflect the initial costs of capacity increases (growth). Tesla's financials in the past year show that the critics have been wrong about Tesla's lack of operational leverage.\n\nI feel that many Tesla critics haven't looked at a blank sheet scenario. Given Tesla's capital, what would have been possible? In football stats, there's this concept of DVOA, or Defense-adjusted Value Over Average. That basically asks, how would an average NFL player perform against a defense? That provides a much better metric than raw stats to understand how good a player really is over average.

You can't expect new dealerships to immediately turn profitable. So it is likely better than \"normal\" but still a drag on opex. So better DVOA... or auto industry value over average. But they still have plenty of opex to clean up. And they keep opening up new markets for the Model 3 which increases volumes by 3-5 times usually. That's just hard for any organization to handle.

What we don't know is the demand for the Raven refresh and the timing of whatever else is coming.\n\nThe Audi E-tron is still within its launch burst and honestly, given that perspective, the numbers are quite lackluster. Audi said they have over 20,000 reservations for the E-tron. They have been making this vehicle since last fall and they were supposed to have a great production ramp as a legacy automaker. And yet, between NL/NO/ES, they haven't broken 1,000 units per month. Given the criticism of Tesla for the Model X launch ramp, Audi doesn't seem to be doing well here. It was supposed to ship in early 2018. That got delayed to fall 2018. And then delayed again to early 2019 due to software glitches. People have given Audi a pass on that, especially since this vehicle was supposed be in full production by end of 2018:\n\n[https://insideevs.com/news/340096/audi-aims-for-max-production-of-e-tron-by-end-of-year/](https://insideevs.com/news/340096/audi-aims-for-max-production-of-e-tron-by-end-of-year/)\n\nAnd full production was supposed to be 56,000 units a year.

The E-tron should be expanding the EV market and can leverage the existing fleet/business purchase contracts that are common in Europe.\n\nWe are seeing a drop off on I-Pace, even though that vehicle also had launch production volume difficulties which extended its launch burst period.\n\nOn the topic of capital efficiency, note the costs for the cell manufacturing and battery pack production facilities as announced by non-Tesla automakers and their expected output. You should notice a significant difference there. The vast majority of Tesla's Model 3 ramp came with GF1 costs and remember, Tesla takes all of Panasonic's tooling at GF1 as part of their PP&E which means it is part of their depreciation costs.

What we have now is a perceived notion that Tesla must continue to outperform expectations or the company is a failure (even as they inch up expectations to try and generate a \"miss\").  The reality is, Tesla still has huge demand because the product is a massive success, truly an \"iPhone moment\" for the auto industry.  The company is continually improving their manufacturing and logistics, continually improving their lead in battery tech, continually improving their lead in software, and running away from any sort of competition.  On top of this, they should have 4 to 4.5 billion in the bank after the last capital raise, perhaps more pending results of Q2.
