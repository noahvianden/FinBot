Some methods that may or may not work anymore include funding a checking account with a credit card (sometimes it triggers as a cash advance/cash equivalent and would not work, and sometimes banks have limits to how much can be funded with a credit card, typically around $500-2000 or so). A classic method that doesn't work anymore since the post office stopped accepting gift cards/credit cards for money orders, was to use a credit card to buy a Visa Gift Card (usually online, or at a grocery store using a credit card that gives a nice percentage back for grocery purchases), then using that to buy a money order, then depositing the money order to your bank to pay off the credit card. Not really worth the time/effort in my opinion, but there have been success stories of people making lots of money.
