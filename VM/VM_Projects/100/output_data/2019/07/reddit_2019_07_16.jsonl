Not to mention they're forgetting some key rules of economics.\n\nThe fact is Taxi Drivers are **NOT** going to just quietly give up their livelihoods to self driving cars. They'll fight it tooth and nail every step of the way, and they're actually quite influential in that area. The whole Taxi Medallion system was put in place decades ago to protect the taxi drivers and artificially limit their competition (which is why taxi services are so horrible in a number of places). And look at all the areas that ban Uber & Lyft and other ride sharing services. Sure some people will just ignore those laws and illegally operate a taxi/ride sharing service anyway, but guess what? It's pretty easy to see a car with no driver.\n\nAlso, despite what you might think, a lot of people are still not comfortable with the idea of entrusting their life to a self driving car. Seeing a car with no driver in it is going to freak a some people out for a while. And just a few FSD accidents are going to make big headlines about the 'dangers' of self driving cars, taxi drivers are going to be the biggest spreaders of that FUD. Some politicians are going to want to stand against FSD or slow it down just to cater to those voters. \n\nThen there's a pure economics of it. If you already have taxi medallions or a taxi business then sure, a say $100,000 car could replace 1 taxi driver employee and pay for itself easily. That math is easy to understand.\n\nExcept there's already a huge flaw in that logic. The average salary of a taxi driver (as of 2012) was a measly **$22,820** [according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_the_United_States). Obviously taxi drivers make tips to, but the taxi driver's company doesn't make those tips, and lets be real, who's going to tip a robot? \n\nOf course, while human labor isn't as expense as you might have thought, a robo-taxi can work longer hours, so that is a plus, but that brings us to the next problem. Demand for taxi's isn't a static amount all day long. There's rush hours on the road when everyone wants to get to work, or get home from work. Other times of the day the demand for taxi's is much lower, so having a FSD taxi willing to work more hours doesn't necessarily mean it'll find customers wanting a ride. And lets keep in mind, if your FSD taxi is your main car you're going to want to go to work and other places during some of those busier rush hour times, so that right there reduces your income potential from your own FSD taxi.\n\nBut even that oversimplifies the math too much. If literally every Tesla owner buys FSD and uses their taxi to give taxi rides to people when they aren't using it guess what? The supply of taxi's will be WAY too high, which will drive prices down a lot. \n\nUber actually has this kind of a problem in certain geographical areas. Uber pays drivers a certain amount of money for recruiting other people to work as an Uber driver. Because of this system it was literally **MORE** profitable in some areas to recruit competition for yourself then it was to give Uber rides to other people, because there were way too many Uber drivers in the area. The same is going to happen with FSD taxi's if EVERYONE tries to make money off of it, and no one in the government stops them from driving up the supply like this.\n\nBut how many taxi's are there in the US anyway? According to google **[233,900](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=how+many+taxi+drivers+are+there+in+the+US)**.\n\nSo yeah, adding say 50,000+ FSD taxi's to the US would have a BIG impact on the taxi market. Taxi drivers would all get less passengers a month on average. And Tesla sold 95,000 cars last quarter, imagine what it would do to the market if all 95,000 of them had FSD and owners used them at least part time to give out rides? Taxi drivers and taxi companies have good reason to fight hard against FSD and throw FUD at it.\n\nElon would have good economic reason to charge $100,000 to $200,000 for FSD in Tesla's for this alone. If too many Tesla customers use their taxi's for FSD they'll compete against Tesla's own FSD taxi's, and make them less profitable by flooding the market quicker. Not to mention his taxi business would risk serious political & social blow back for hurting the legacy taxi companies.\n\n**Conclusion:** I think there IS a lot of money to be made in FSD cars, but NOT in FSD taxi's. There's money to be made in FSD taxi's sure, especially if you're the first to the market with FSD, but not as much money as most think. I think the real money to be made is in selling FSD to consumers & promoting it as a driver safety feature.

We'll say 3 and assume a residual value of $20k at the end (generous for a 225k mile car that has been used for public hire). \n\nThis is the most glaring mistake in your calculation, which results in completely bogus valuation figures: **in reality the FSD license and Tesla Network membership doesn't \"end\" after 3 years, it doesn't depreciate**, and an EV of Tesla's class and with the Model 3's design can be maintained indefinitely, with a new battery pack every 500k miles or so.\n\nSo no meaningful depreciation of the car in the 3 years time period you assumed, only maintenance costs. It can be used until end of life of beyond 1 million miles that typical taxis routinely reach in London for example, under a rigorous maintenance cycle.\n\nIf the Tesla FSD license is similar to a NYC taxi medallion (I don't know whether that's going to be the case), then it could reach a total value well beyond the $100k-$200k range given by Elon, in major metro markets.

But big auto in general is a very low-margin business.  And they have an entire empire built on this weak foundation.  Electric cars take batteries and they\u2019re gonna have to start investing serious capital right -now- to have an EV pipeline in place before ICE cars get the rug pulled out from under them.  The majority of existing auto simply won\u2019t survive.  They\u2019re gonna wait until their ICEs aren\u2019t selling anymore, and then try to make deals with 3rd parties for massive amounts of batteries.  And they\u2019re all gonna do it at the same time.  Battery prices will skyrocket, and the vehicle manufacturers will be left with no option but to burn through their cash pile until they\u2019re insolvent.\n\n>I'll happily bet my house that Toyota will still be around in 50 years. They're one of the few that I'm confident will survive just fine.\n\nThis is kind of like saying that as soon as someone else makes a good EV, Tesla will not sell any more of their EVs.  The market is so huge that there won\u2019t be any competition between FSD cars for quite some time.  Only once the market reaches saturation will prices start to decline due to competition.  Given the huge demand for FSD that will exist - this could take 5-10 years.  (In the future, people will rarely own a car unless they have a specific need.  They\u2019ll just ride-hail everywhere.

{"title": "Goodbye friends, it's been a long ride", "selftext": "In the past two maybe three years I got hooked on options trading (aka gambling). I ran up on AMD options back when it was $13-14 from $300 to $15K. Thought I was a god at trading and could just run it up to the millions. Clearly that's not what happened. I quickly lost all of it all and put more money in. To this date I probably lost around $25k maybe a little more (don't want to actually check and get depressed and kill myself :')). But finally I'm going to call it quits, I wasted the whole year's pay which for a 24 year old student is not much ($19k maybe), stuck in credit card debt and finally with some bad car troubles definitely need to stop gambling. It's been really fun reading posts on here and constantly checking stocks but I've deleted it all and just need to get fresh air. It's been fun guys, thanks for the ride. Others who are in the same boat, honestly, we have a gambling problem and just need to stop. We might hit it big but in the end if we keep going all the money disappears. Thankfully my debt is only about 3-4k which is a lot but manageable in probably a couple months of working and living frugally. Thanks guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Somehow this gained a lot of traction and I got my first silvers on this, I guess losing money does have its perks (just kidding not actually), thanks homies and wish everyone the best!", "id": "cdx5yw", "created_utc": 1563284340.0, "score": 6497, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 945, "comments": [{"body": "I made 30 bucks on a Boeing day trade and quit.
