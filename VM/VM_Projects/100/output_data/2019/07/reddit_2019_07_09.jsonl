Plus, their financials looked good last I looked earlier this year.  That said, I'm not too sure on their future and 10, 15-year outlook.  Both Square and Clover seem to have higher favorability than PayPal among people when I was reviewing sentiment (ease of use, price, cost of deployment), and Square's Cash app saw more downloads over the prior month/quarter recently than Venmo I believe.  Plus Cash has a Bitcoin option, which Venmo does not, which is a cool feature that will draw some people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, Venmo's prominence confuses me, considering you can sweep social financial interactions and build profiles among people and demographics; I was curious if this was even possible, and found that people in CS classes were doing this as part of a project.  I figured it's a matter of time until a story breaks where the information is organized and sold in a meaningful way.  Also, Venmo was ahead of the game when it came to their method of payments between friends (PayPal's Friends & Family payment feature was and still is awful), although they took way too long to move it towards merchant transactions (are service based transactions still banned?).  If I am on my phone, I'll just use Apple Pay if it is available; people in China use AliPay; others will use Google Play.  As mobile use increases, and more merchants integrate those three payment methods, Venmo's merchant functionality will fall, as will PayPal's payment option.  Plus there is Amazon Pay these days too, which I've used more than PayPal in 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong-run, I think it will be less about the individual transactions generated by PayPal & Venmo, Square, and Clover, and more to do with the SaaS platform offered for businesses.

A basic CNN has little idea about generalizations of focal point/angle and so on. It is FAR dumber than that. It tends to work but it uses naive correlations and an ABSURD number of examples. What is missing in neural nets is the ability to train from fewer examples because of a deeper understanding about how to generalize concepts like viewer and object and angles and focal points and so on.

You can balance deliverables with getting some things done as long as you are given the autonomy to do so and don't need to watch over your back for the weakest links at your company who don't really identify enough with what they do or their team not to be hungover/sleep deprived from pornhubbing or redditing like us and persistently improve their work -- and not to say anything bad about them, capitalism is great because people are free to live like this.\n\nI can't prove a negative to you, but if you're not going to take my advice and go on GitHub (and track even popular projects that were \"cutting edge\" when they started) suit yourself. A project that is experimental doesn't have to be done in a sloppy or haphazard way where people have to test the water to see if it even works. CNNs aren't crazy to understand or even visualize -- they are doing very simple things, very repetitively, only at a rate much faster than any collection of humans can be paid to. The result is only potentially unpredictable because nobody has time to iterate for that long in their lifetime manually on a task.\n\nSomething that may come off to you as cutting edge may actually not be if you cannot verbalize your thoughts and express trade-offs. All of the tech we use today had a lot of support and the reason is it was simpler or more understandable than what existed before. Good example is BTC: there have been payment systems and ledgers and algorithms for this, they just were not applied succinctly and marketed well. Satoshi didn't wake up and just go \"fuck I'ma try to cut all the thinking out cause I have a vision and want to test it\". A lot of math and cryptography with proven theories and marketing and now everyone knows BTC.\n\nI think the exception is all of these start up accelerators with people out of bootcamp or college; there are so many tools that it's easy to build anything by leveraging other APIs. For something like FSD, the level is too low and resources in the cars hardware are too precious for the throwing-shit-on-the-wall approach.
