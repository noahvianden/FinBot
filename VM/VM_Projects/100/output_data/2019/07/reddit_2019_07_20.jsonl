It's projected that by somewhere from 2021 to 2024 (depending upon who you ask) new BEV cars will be just as cheap as ICE cars in the same class WITHOUT any government subsidies. And battery prices will only continue to get cheaper overtime from there.\n\n* BEV's are cheaper to maintain. ICE cars need stuff like oil changes and work on the transmission from time to time, BEV's do not.\n\n* You can charge your BEV's battery overnight and have a full 'tank' the next day, making the lack of public chargers irrelevant 90% of the time. But the number of public chargers is rapidly expanding, it's easy to make a trip anywhere across the US or Europe now with BEV's if you plan your route out in advance.\n\n* Many governments in the world are passing laws and pushing regulations that heavily encourage the switch over to BEV's.

The algebra involved is literally middle school level. There are 12 year olds that can draw out the P/L graphs of the strategies we're talking about without breaking a sweat.\n\n\"But OP, plenty of people on /r/wsb are morons, at least I'm helping them!\"\n\nNo dumbass, you're not. Because understanding the basic mathematics behind a spread is the easy part of trading one. The hard part is *everything else*. Ya know, picking a ticker, developing an investment thesis, risk management, knowing when to take your profits/cut your losses...all that shit?\n\nIf somebody's too stupid to go to fucking Wikipedia and learn what a credit spread is, then they're *definitely* too stupid to make any money using them. So the only thing that you might be achieving is taking idiots who should be keeping their money literally anywhere else and getting them to lose it on $TSLA 410/420C or something.\n\nPlus you post here, so you're probably stupid, so you're probably gonna [get shit wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfadpo/so_you_wanna_trade_spreads/euaarq6/) anyway. Which means the morons would probably have been better served learning this shit literally anywhere else, or, again, not learning this shit at all and keeping their money under their mattress.\n\nWanna make some content that's actually useful?\n\nHow about you explain how to read a balance sheet? Or an earnings report? Or if you're a TA freak, a chart? If you're swing trading, how do you pick a ticker? How do you determine when to exit a trade? How do you do risk management?\n\nHell, even if you're determined to YOLO 100% of your account into OTM calls on some shit weed stock, you could at least explain what factors you're on the lookout for when you make that play.\n\nI don't do that shit because I don't know how to do that shit because I don't know how the fucking market works. But at least I know I don't know that, so I'm not out here losing all my money because I just learned what a credit spread was and clicked the first stock on my watchlist to open the first one that Robinhood suggested me.\n\n**Edit** to clarify my point:  \nThese types of posts are like teaching somebody the relative hand ranks in Texas Hold'em and acting like you've prepared them for a professional poker career.\n\nIf they learned anything from your lesson, they're clearly unqualified to put any significant amount of money onto a poker table - certainly not if they're expecting to keep any of it.\n\nIt's fine to not understand what a spread is.

The economic value of a line item is dictated by the income account. In fact, a large balance sheet to weak earnings is usually indicative of a business model that is not efficient / scalable. Plus, you need to pay for all the maintenance capex. Nah, its best you just throw it out. \n\nBut you ask *\"pkkiller69, what about the burden of debt? what about excess leverage?\"*\n\nMy response: Under-levered companies are for pussies. Also, I called up my Nobel prize winning boys Modigliani and Miller. They concur. They said the value of the firm is the value of the un-levered firm plus the value of the debt tax-shield (aka corporate tax rate * level of debt). They said it is always true. Debt is literally free money because theft (aka government taxation) is reduced.\n\nBut you ask *\"pkkiller69, what about the liquidation value of the enterprise? what happens if the firm goes bankrupt?\"*\n\nMy response: google sunk cost fallacy you fuck\n\nBut you ask *\"pkkiller69, what about pension liabilities, legal liabilities, deferred tax liabilities?\"*\n\n**-Pension liabilities:** these can stay underfunded forever, you don't need to pay your employees, only promise to pay them\n\n**-Legal liabilities:** courts are run by the corporate class, do you think that they ever lose a court case when they have skadden or davis polk? Do you think that they do not stack juries? Trial of your peers my ass. Just ask OJ how $ influenced his outcome\n\n**-Deferred tax liabilities:** have you ever read an income statement, have the prior year's DTAs ever correlated with the cash income tax paid in the current year?\n\nPersonally, I think its best to buy all these \"electronic\" businesses.

After getting the money, too, I highly doubt she gave it up or anything.\n\nI hate how the narrative got shifted to \"using the ill and dying as commodities,\" instead of \"using loopholes to fuck over insurance companies for money.\" The ailing signatories weren't the victims here, they literally *got paid*. The victims were the insurance companies, who knew they wouldn't win a case with themselves as victims, thus the aforementioned narrative shift. \n\nThe only case that can made for those signatories being wronged is if they really weren't explained the nature of the scheme - in that case, it is completely justified, and such an act is immoral in my book. \n\nBut even then, this case was not made on their (the signatories) behalf - the settlement literally got paid out to *the insurance companies and their investors.* Grade - fucking - A.

It would have been nice to see them compare what Caramadre was doing against the standard corporate \"dead serf insurance\" companies *routinely* take out against their own employees (and specifically it would have been interesting to see how companies get around the \"taking out insurance on other people\" prohibitions that the piece says are in place).\n\nI think where where Caramadre went wrong was trusting people who are dying and their families.  It doesn't take very much for the FBI to come in and lead on them by telling them they could be risking their inheritance if they're found to be participating in an illegal insurance scam.  The FBI/SEC/ETC lies to get people to \"cooperate\" (lie for the FBI) all the time.
