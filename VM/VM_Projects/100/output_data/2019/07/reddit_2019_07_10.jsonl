However, that doesn't sound like they achieved the kind of breakthrough they'd need to increase the output of batteries with a _significant_ amount.  If they want to produce more cars, they obviously need to produce more battery packs.  Suppose they have a (purely hypothetical) 10% increase in battery output, that would 'only' increase their car production by 10% (as long as no new production bottlenecks show up due to increased throughput of battery supplies).  Averaging about 800 cars a day in Q2 would mean this 10% increase would result in 880 cars per day.  Or: 5600 a week would become 6160 a week.  A nice increase, but I'm not sure if they'd want to attract this kind of media attention with it (as most analysts would probably expect a bigger increase and then they'd set themselves up for a production & delivery estimate miss in Q3)\n\nAlso, he never specifically said that they would start producing more vehicles at Freemont.  And then there was this little mysterious nugget:\n\n> \u201cWhile we can\u2019t be too specific in this email, I know you will be delighted with the upcoming developments.\u201d\n\nSo here's my theory: I'm guessing that the improvements they're about to make is mostly about production efficiency gains that will result in more cars being produced per _given number of labor hours_ and not necessarily to produce more cars (though that certainly would be nice as well!).  In other words: less demanding shifts, less overtime needed.  I can imagine that if you're a factory worker on the production lines and you hear management say \"we're going to increase the number of cars we produce\" isn't exactly something you're delighted about if your job stays as hard as it already is, and they're probably not going to be hiring a bunch of new factory workers either, considering recent layoffs.  Knowing that your job is about to become easier however, is probably something that _would_ delight factory workers more.\n\nJust a theory of course... in an ideal world this would be about both increasing the number of cars they produce as well as requiring less labor to do so (which would increase gross profit margins per car as well).\n\nAnother possibility: toilet paper deliveries finally came in, and bathroom throughput increases ;)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "MOONSHOT Guess: They have a new badass casting machine that will make the bodies of all models much cheaper and with much less man hours.

{"title": "BYND is at Costco DD", "selftext": "Costco is now carrying Beyond Burgers. I don't see this in any press releases by either Costco or BYND. There was a vegan blog that mentioned this information (it was brought to my attention by [**relevant\\_pet\\_bug**](https://www.reddit.com/user/relevant_pet_bug)) and I called the stores to confirm it. The item # is 1338620. It is in approximately 15 stores nationwide. A store in San Diego has it for sure, 2345 Fenton Parkway, and the Costco on 1890 S University Drive in Davie, Florida has it. I don't know the other 13 stores. When I called a purchasing manager in the regional area to find out why the stores only carried a limited supply of the Beyond Burgers, he said that Costco would buy as many Beyond Burgers as they could get their hands on, but that BYND only sold a limited amount because they couldn't keep up with demand. He said that Beyond Burgers are selling really well and they are selling out in \"just a few days\". Apparently, BYND will be installing new manufacturing lines by the end of 2019 to to increase supply and supposedly they will be able to provide Costco nationwide with Beyond Burgers by next year. \n\nI asked why Costco would sell Beyond Burgers when they already sell Morning Star and Don Lee Farm's Veggie Burgers and the purchasing manager said that Beyond Burgers just taste different and customers want them. AGAIN: This man is responsible for buying items for Costco in a large region of the US and he said that they would buy as many BYND Burgers as they could, but that supply was limited and that they will stock Beyond Burgers nationwide once BYND can meet demand in early 2020.

They sell okay as far as I can tell, but a lot of people are saying that they are buying just to try. Also we only have like 4 boxes of their patties that are restocked once at the end of the day and I never seen it even close to sold out. It is also worth noting that they are positioned  at the end of the middle freezer aisle, which is one of the most \"unattractive\" areas(a lot of merch brands at costco pay costco to keep their products at more visible areas).

They just get orders from above to put certain products in the spotlight and to make sure there is always an employee during working hours taking care of those products by always making them look nice and restock when needed. So yea, ground floor management is just playing with the cards dealt by above, no real say themselves.
