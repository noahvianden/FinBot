{"title": "Stocks to keep in mind for bulls and bears - 7/22-7/29 trading week", "selftext": "**THIS IS A REVISED POST FROM THE ONE I POSTED ON FRIDAY. I've added a few recommendations for earnings after spending most of Friday and Saturday doing DD for next week.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey y'all! As usual, been swamped with work and research.  Stock picks for last week (and the week before!) were absolute fire. Let's keep it rollin'.  I've received tons of private messages asking for advise, justifications for stock picks, etc. I will try to get to you as soon as I can, but I'm generally much better at replying to the post directly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI usually post (about 20-25) stock picks in the Daily Discussion thread but I do so at very odd hours (usually late at night and on weekends) as I'm swamped with work at more regular hours. My stock recommendations usually rely on in-depth TA and FA, which take some time. I will try posting in the front page more often in the hopes of more tists getting a chance to see the DD. And I will continue with the tradition of posting results for the sake of accountability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs usual, I'll recommend puts and calls, and given the positive feedback and success from this weeks' earnings plays, I've devoted some extra time into DD for earnings next week.   \n\n\n*FOR THE BULLS:*\n\n* Calls: $**TWLO,** $**VRTU**, $**EBAY**, $**COF**, $**FDX**, $**XLNX**, $**OKTA**, $**LULU**, should print good tendies\n* BULLISH POWER PLAYS\\*\\*: $**UBER**, $**SQ**, $**TRIP, $CRWD, $FVRR**\n   * If you get CRWD calls, wait for a day or two - at least wait til market close on Monday. The stock will likely pull back some, but after that it will continue its voyage to the moon\n\n*FOR THE BEARS:*\n\n* For the bears: $**MTCH**, $**IBKR**, $**GRUB**, $**SKX**, $**AMBA**\n* BEARISH POWER PLAY\\*\\*:  $**BIDU,** (buy late Monday or Tuesday), **$CMG** (sell before earnings for safe play, sell after earnings if you want to yolo NFLX style); **$HSY** (sell before earnings)\n\n*EARNINGS*:\n\n* EARNINGS CALLS: $**BIIB; $GOOGL; $PYPL;** $**FB** (easy peasy, though I would buy on Tuesday at market open); \n* EARNINGS PUTS: $**HLT;** $**BA** (don't buy tomorrow. Buy right before earnings), \n\n*For the broke breddas:*\n\n* Penny stock of the week: $**OTLK**\n\n\\*\\*Power plays, in my books, are riskier/less certain plays with potential to print plenty more $. Buy at your own risk, of course.\n\nY'all have a great trading week ahead, and thanks for the kind words!

{"title": "7/21- I pick options so you don\u2019t have to", "selftext": "Instead of providing my thoughts on a bunch of tickers that I choose I\u2019m gonna start off with 1 ticker each week and add whatever tickers you autists want. PM me or comment any ticker you want my thoughts on and I\u2019ll add them here.\n\n$TSLA- BULLISH \n\nI\u2019m confident that Tesla will report a higher than expected EPS (-$0.48). The great thing is TSLA can still report a negative eps and the stock will still shoot up. I have a few reasons for being bullish on the stock. Mainly my position on this ticker is due to them slashing their prices. I don't see a reason why they would slash prices if they were deep in the red for the year. Tesla has had a really good past month and I don't see that ending any time soon. \n\n$ACB- LONG TERM BULLISH\n\nI think this stock will have a lot of gains in the long term especially as more states legalize weed. I would avoid short term weekly/monthly plays due to the stock's volatility, but I think this would be a good buy and hold stock. \n\n$DIS- BEARISH\n\nI think a lot of people are looking at this ticker with too much optimism because of the gains that they got when Disney announced their streaming service. Overall I think DIS will just trail the S&P. If you\u2019re looking at DIS plays you\u2019re better off trading SPY/SPX.\n\n$DPZ- LONG TERM BULLISH\n\nThere\u2019s not much to say about this one. They pretty consistently beat earnings so I\u2019m optimistic for the long term, but I think it will mostly trade sideways for the short term.\n\n$ATVI- BEARISH\n\nBlizzard has done nothing but fall since October of last year. I would say buy puts, but I don't think this stock could go any lower. They always meet earnings (not higher not lower) so even earnings plays wouldn't work. Overall, I'm avoiding this stock. \n\n$EA- BEARISH\n\nMy thoughts on EA are very similar to my thoughts on Blizzard. I think the whole gaming community, especially the PC gaming community is dropping in popularity. I think they will bear earnings on 7/30 but am not doing any plays. \n\n$PYPL- BULLISH\n\nI am currently holding calls that are down a bit. I'm, very confident they will beat earnings on 7/24 (hence the calls). Overall, I think this stock will have consistent growth in both the short term and the long term. The only short term plays I would consider are earnings plays. \n\n$FB- BULLISH\n\nEvery article that has facebook in the title is very negative and raises a lot of privacy concerns, but that doesn't ever seem to affect the stock. I think they will remain popular with the over 30 crowd for a while. Someone PMed me asking my thoughts on FB earnings. As for earnings I'm bullish but am not doing any plays myself. \n\n$ILMN- BEARISH\n\nI think they will not beat the originally expected earnings. They crashed last week after revenue expectations were lowered. I think they will be fine for the long term but as for the short term/ earnings, I'm bearish. \n\n$INTC- SIDEWAYS\n\nI think they will easily beat earnings. Expectations are already pretty low for intel especially if you compare expectations to previous quarters. I think they will definitely be fine in the long term but as for now, I think they will mostly trade sideways even if they beat earnings. \n\n$GOOGL- SLIGHTLY BULLISH\n\nNot much to say here, I fully expect them to beat earnings but I'm not sure that will necessarily result in a stock rally. Definitely not doing any $GOOGL plays this week.\n\n$NFLX- VERY CONFLICTED \n\nI\u2019m very conflicted on NFLX. I think it\u2019s legit a coin flip especially for the long term. I see them possibly cutting prices in the future to gain back some people. I disagree with them ongoing 100% original content. Not doing any plays for now.\n\n$SNAP- SLIGHTLY BULLISH\n\nI think they will beat expected earnings but still report a loss for the year. I\u2019m not sure if the stock will rally following the earnings report. Not looking at any plays for now. \n\n$BYND- BULLISH ON EARNINGS \n\nI expect them to beat earnings and a rally in the stock afterward. BYND is obviously very overvalued and I foresee a crash in the stock eventually, but as for the short term, I'm bullish.\n\n$AMZN- BULLISH\n\nAmazons profits have very little to do with Amazon sales. They make all their money form AWS. I fully expect them to beat earnings expectations. I haven't seen anyone make a single bear case for Amazon\n\nFINAL UPDATE: \n\nOk guys that's all my thoughts for this week. I will make an update post on Friday to see how many of my picks were right and how many were wrong. If anyone has an open position and wants my thoughts on it to feel free to PM me and I'll reply to you directly, but I will no longer be updating this post with new picks. I will be doing these every Sunday and updates every Friday.\n \nThis is not investment advice.
