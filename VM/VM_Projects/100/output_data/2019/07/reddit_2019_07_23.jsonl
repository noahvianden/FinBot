I have been watching 5G and satellite type transmissions, even Google's 'balloons/drones' to deliver internet to places that have not had it before or have not had it reliably. I believe that some of these methods will increase use/access to the internet, but I'm uncertain how convenient it will be to allow it to be a backbone for large-scale/widespread use, especially in the US where people can get relatively low-cost internet as is.\n\n\nFiber has the benefit over satellites or drones/balloons or wave transmission, if for no other reason, because it is reliable/stable. Many companies that have internet have redundancies in place where if one ISP fails, the other kicks on. Fiber is the same way within the ISP itself. They maintain a fiber 'loop' so If a northern route is shutdown for some reason, a southern route takes over the traffic. For this reason, I think governments (federal or state), and businesses will continue to rely on hard-lined connections. Fiber beats out other hard-line connections because of consistency in signal, and oftentimes ISPs compete on price and latency or reliability. If a company can afford or needs a safer connection, they will go with fiber when able (generally). This addresses the stability aspect of the conversation. In a war or conflict with superpowers, satellites can be physically brought/shot down if not hacked. Wave transmissions can be disrupted or unreliable, particularly in physically safe locations. Fiber can get anywhere you put it, so I think that's one major advantage. It is expensive to get in the ground but once there can last a long time. I don't think the safety/security aspect can be downplayed from physical infrastructure. \n\n\nI do think that they are further down the pipeline for market use than they are portrayed-mainly in respect to satellites. 5G is live and slowly being rolled out, but one disadvantage the US consumer has is that we (US) don't have a requirement to update infrastructure for communications like they do in some other countries, which is why internet speeds aren't very comparable to other developed nations (size being another issue entirely). It will take some time for 5G to become a bigger deal in mobile networks and that will certainly be relevant in the coming months and years since it is live now.\n\n\nMy logic with fiber is, aside from ISPs needing huge amounts of cable infrastructure between towns and cities/datacenters, is within buildings themselves fiber is needed. In server rooms fiber is being used. Fiber can break, so the splice kits and fittings are needed. There are other uses for fiberglass in phones and telescopes and whatnot, I don't have as much comprehension of that, but I see fiberglass being used in multiple realms outside my own with an expanded desire for fiberglass/fiber optic products in other fields. Their environmental technologies also make me think they are trying to gear to stay relevant, as desire for gorilla glass may slow/change, they seem to try and stay ahead of the curve.\n\n\n\nSo, I'm not very concerned about satellite provided internet or balloons/drone tech. 5G is more concerning, but I think cost will be a place for fiber to compete, along with accessibility (if fiber is already going through a sparsely populated area, it is unlikely 5G will be delivered there near-term, but fiber can be spliced in and hook up). One of the companies I was with ideally wanted small towns with populations between 5,000 and 20,000 for fiber hook-ups. The state, recently, was arguing for a bill that would provide subsidies so they could get 5G tech on towers in the lesser populated areas. Fiber will be there first, no doubt, but having a presence should help cost there as well.\n\n\nI apologize if this sounds disjointed or hard to follow, I kept thinking of different things to add and change and was listening to the Mueller testimony as I wrote it. I have bought and held GLW since I discovered Corning was a publicly traded company and I was seeing their logos all over the place as well as finding out the reason we were switching from MMM splice kits to GLW splice kits.

More research is needed\r\nregarding the dose-response relationship \rbetween dietary cholesterol and blood \rcholesterol levels. Adequate evidence is not \ravailable for a quantitative limit for dietary \rcholesterol specific to the Dietary Guidelines. \rDietary cholesterol is found only in animal \rfoods such as egg yolk, dairy products, \rshellfish, meats, and poultry. A few foods, \rnotably egg yolks and some shellfish, \rare higher in dietary cholesterol but not \rsaturated fats. Eggs and shellfish can be \rconsumed along with a variety of other \rchoices within and across the subgroup \rrecommendations of the protein foods group.\"\r\r\n\nhttps://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/\r\n\rhttps://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf\r\n\r\n\n>If he has read any studies done the last ten years on the subject he will tell you that dietary cholesterol doesn't affect your blood\n\n The perplexing thing here is that you maintain this position that dietery cholesterol has no effect in LDL cholesterol when every single health authority that you cited said the exact opposite:\n\n\"Avoid full-fat dairy products such as whole milk, cheese, cream, sour cream, cream cheese and butter.
