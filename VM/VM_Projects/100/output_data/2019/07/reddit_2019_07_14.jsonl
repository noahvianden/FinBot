They all have to make at least an 80 mile trek out there, most likely more. The two I recommend are Hertz (HTZ) and Avis (CAR).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, the A-10 ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvIJvPj\\_pjE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvIJvPj_pjE) ) uses AIM-9 Sidewinders, AGM-65's and Mark 77 Bombs. The AIM-9 is made by Raytheon and Ford (RTN & F), the AGM-65 is made by RTN as well. The Mark 77 bomb as far as I can tell was made by Rockwell who was then bought by Boeing  (BA). But we're not going to touch Boeing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, in my Wallstreebets expertise, I recommend the Area 51 ETF to be made up of:  \nSAVE, LUV, HTZ, CAR, RTN, F\n\nLong for profit.\n\n\nEdit: okay, I get it.
