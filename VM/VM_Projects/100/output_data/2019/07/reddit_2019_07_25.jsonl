All their work force who know ICE cars need training on BEV's, a lot of Ford's knowledge on ICE vehicles (a major asset to them) is going to become obsolete. Ford also needs to convince customers to switch over to Ford BEV's while knowing full well that they're going to be cannibalizing their ICE vehicle sales if they advertise to consumers the financial benefits of EV's (like much less maintenance costs, cheaper fuel). \n\nThe BEV transition isn't going to happen overnight, it's going to happen over a number of years, and it's going to be painful for Ford for years due to the cannibalization of their ICE sales and the need to spend many billions on the transition. \n\n> Ford has already invested billions into autonomous vehicles\n\nLets just say until Ford brings something to market their investment in self driving vehicles is getting zero ROI off of it.\n\nSince their tech isn't out in the field like Tesla's is (i.e. I cannot buy a Ford today with Auto-Pilot and try it out wherever I want) we can't really evaluate how good it is.

(If you are not already concerned)\n\nI suggest you look up some youtube videos from stock experts who bought into Tesla. Profits in the short term aren't everything. There's several key facts that make this a much better quarter then the market initially saw it despite the unprofitability:\n\n* Tesla is still growing something like 60% Year over Year despite being a multi-billion dollar corporation. There's few corporations that boast those kinds of numbers, fast growth even at a loss in the short term often helps build profits in the long term.\n\n* While Tesla's profits are down, their revenue is up quite a bit in 3 of the last 4 quarters, so the short term numbers aren't all bad either.\n\nThat said, the point Tesla longs would be concerned about the lack of profits is when Tesla stops growing and is still losing money.\n\n> -What do you think changes about the business model in 2020 and beyond that makes this a good investment? China factory? FSD? Something else?\n\nI think Tesla's will sell decently in China, though and the Model Y will sell a ton, especially in the US where bigger cars are more popular.\n\nThat said, while I'm a Tesla long, I'm actually extremely skeptical about Tesla's robotaxi strategy with FSD. I'm just extremely skeptical that there's anywhere near the amount of money in a taxi business as they think, especially of the $30,000 a year claim by Elon. But I don't think FSD is a money pit fail by any means, I think the auto-pilot and promise of FSD makes it a more attractive car, and long term will be a great safety and convenience feature to sell the car. \n\nI also actually think that Tesla has a decent shot at being the first to market with FSD. I'm a software developer, and I think the way Google & most others are attempting to solve FSD just sounds WAY too time consuming and impractical to work on a world wide scale.
