I think if we don't waste money on stupid trading moves, just sit on shares patiently, we are highly likely to be rewarded in the end.\n\nIf you own a Tesla car, you know how great an EV can be, and it indeed saves money on gasoline. In my view we are transitioning to EV for sure.\n\nOnce Tesla start production in China, the cost will go down, the Model Y produced in Gigafactory 3 will have a gross margin around 26%. If FSD features are released by then the gross margin could reach 30% (even if FSD is not fully achieved).\n\nWhile every media is saying Tesla lost big amount of money in Q1 and Q2, what really happened is that Tesla has been cashflow positive. The situation will further improve in the next 2 years.\n\nTesla is preparing to produce 2TWh batteries a year down the road. That means this company will be producing 10\\~15 million EVs a year plus some energy storage.

I'm more on page with you.\n\n50% becomes an absurd target at higher scale, well, frankly it's an absurd target even at their current scale but they are coming close on the slower of a tick-tock two years. It always depends on what parts of the business can and can't be parallelized. You can't make copies of Elon but you can make copies of the Gigafactory.\n\n50% is a familiar number. Elon has invoked it before.\n\n20M seems crazy. It's a bit less than twice Toyota or VW but the auto industry has been a dull game of approximately equal products competing on price (I wouldn't call it commodity but close). Even 20M cars per year is only a quarter of the current market, which itself will expand if newer products are more significant relative to older ones than prior patterns (i.e. FSD and electric together are a leapfrog). A more significant competitive advantage than historical will lead to a lot of consolidation among companies that can't keep up with change.

I\u2019ll edit this comment!\n\nEDIT - Okay, I found a comment I made on Seeking Alpha (cringe) 4 years ago that showed my math.  Here is my comment from 2015:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The following numbers are for a system sold TODAY:  \n>  \n>$15,759 - The amount of revenue over 20 years from John Doe's lease - downloadable on SCTY's website. This lease starts at .15c/kwh and escalates 2.9% each year. This figure I calculated also assumes a 0.5% yearly panel efficiency loss and it is inflation-adjusted for today's value assuming a 3% per year inflation rate. It would take around a 4KW system to generate the power mentioned.  \n>  \n>$11,360 - SCTY's cost to sell, permit, and install this system. This is assuming a $/W of $2.84 as mentioned in their 2015Q3 shareholder letter.  \n>  \n>We are now at $4,399.  \n>  \n>$3000 - Cost to maintain the system over 20 years, including an inverter replacement. (Remember SCTY will only have to pay the WHOLESALE cost of the inverter.)  \n>  \n>Now at $1,399.  \n>  \n>$6000 - 30% ITC credit to SCTY. This credit is based on the RETAIL cost of the system. It's difficult to give a precise number here, but I think $20,000 is a very fair retail estimate.  \n>  \n>$7,399 - Profit from this system after considering everything so far. (Inflation, efficiency losses, price escalation, ITC credit. If I missed something please let me know.)  \n>  \n>$2,089 - Profit added to this system from renewals. I know this is a topic of controversy, but I feel I was very fair here and assumed a 50% renewal rate, not SCTY's estimate of 90%. Each system renewed would add $4,176 in inflation-adjusted revenue, so I just divided that by two and averaged it into this system. (I have heard the arguments that no one will renew because SCTY will be more expensive than the grid. I'm sorry but I just don't see how this is possible - all SCTY would need to do is to adjust their $/kWh slightly to get higher renewal rates.)  \n>  \n>$9,488 - Profit so far from a 4kW system.  \n>  \n>Now there is the cost of debt, since SCTY doesn't have the cash on hand to own their systems. Here is probably where my ignorance will show through, but I'll do my best.  \n>  \n>$5,742 - Worst-case scenario cost of SCTY's debt for this system. To get this number I used the APR of SCTY's last securitization of 4.4% and assumed they would keep that debt outstanding for the same term as their customer's lease - 20 years. In the real world, I'm sure this number would be much less - There's no reason to let the debt go on for 20 years. Also, SCTY's securitization costs have been going down however the Fed's rate just went up and so I think these two factors will cancel each other out going forward and the interest rate of their debt should stay in the 4.4% range.  \n>  \n>$3,746 - The final profit of TODAY's system.  \n>  \n>Now I have also crunched the numbers for TOMORROW's (2017) system:  \n>  \n>$16,810 - Inflation-adjusted gross income over 20 years from John Doe's system, but starting at $0.16/kwh.  \n>  \n>$9,200 - SCTY's cost to install the 4kW system. This assumes SCTY's price target of $2.30/W. Of course it is debatable if they will reach this target, but I think it is a VERY fair estimate, especially considering the high-efficiency panels being produced in Buffalo. (They explained very well how they will reach this target in that analyst day I mentioned.)  \n>  \n>We are now at $7,610.  \n>  \n>$3000 - Cost to maintain the system, including inverter replacement  \n>  \n>Now at $4,610.  \n>  \n>$6000 - ITC credit.  \n>  \n>$10,610  \n>  \n>$2228 - 50% renewal rate. Again, this number is inflation-adjusted and takes into account panel efficiencies in years 21-30.  \n>  \n>$12,838 - Profit from the 4kW system  \n>  \n>$4,650 - Worst-case-scenario cost of debt on the $9200 install cost.  \n>  \n>$8,188 - The final profit of TOMORROW's system.  \n>  \n>We have not included SCTY's fixed costs of things like R&D, operation center overhead, etc. This is where I will really show my ignorance because I have no idea how to appropriately distribute these costs to each customer. I'm sure there is more than enough income based on those numbers to cover and and all of their fixed costs. R&D costs go down over time, and as SCTY continues to grow their operation center overhead will be diluted into a bigger pool of customers.  \n>  \n>With SCTY's profit on TOMORROW's system, they would easily be able to include a Powerwall with each purchase. This will render any net-metering concerns a non-issue. (Also remember the cost of the Powerwall will continue to decline)\n\nOf course at the time I had no idea SCTY would get acquired by TSLA, so some things in this comment aged well and others didn't.
