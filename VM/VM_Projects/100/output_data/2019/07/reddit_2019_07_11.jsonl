Musk assumed it would fail.  Now that EVs are definitely coming, and much sooner than they probably would have otherwise... I'm not sure he'd consider it a failure if he killed Tesla pushing too hard for the next big thing.\n\nModel 3 is a huge success by that standard, and I'm sure Musk is looking at things that way.\n\nHe just wants the company to survive **if possible** while making this happen.  If it fails as a company but still accomplishes that mission to some degree... it's a success to him.  It's ALREADY a success to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, he's not an idiot.  They're past the fragile startup phase.  Now, any failures or losses are directly a result of the choices they make in how quickly to grow.  They are prioritizing growth over profit, and will be for a while.  They have enough support and enough visibility into these various issues to adapt as things change on the ground.  He has backup capital he can throw in from SpaceX if it came to that, as he's done before.  (Although at this point, Tesla has mostly \"succeeded\" and SpaceX is still working hard toward their goals... so he might not risk the latter much for the former any longer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake Q1 for instance.  That really was more of a nothing-burger than any bear will admit to.  Well over 2/3rds of that loss was just a week or two's miss on boat delivery timing that'll simply show up in Q2 instead.  There were some teaching moments, surely... but from a long term perspective that really wasn't a serious problem.  Taking out the debt payment and the buyback writedown it was operationally profitable.  However, obviously the company as a whole is what matters and you can't just lose money forever.  So... they won't.  They certainly don't have to keep doing dumb things.  They're adapting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that could kill them at this point is an ACTUAL demand cliff, and there's not really a reasonable case for that to happen.  Really all they'd have to do is advertise.  If they actually put a strong voice out there pushing the reality of their cars relative to their competitors, they'd absolutely crush it.  It's really the fact that they're ceding the conversation to the opposition that is hurting them so much.  However, Musk doesn't like advertising conceptually so as long as he believes they're production constrained anyway he's not going to go there.\n\nThis demand thing is actually why I'm fairly confident the margins on the cars are staying pretty good.  If they really were going to die because ASP has dropped to the point that even good margins won't be enough to survive... they'd just need to increase demand to allow them to maintain or increase pricing.  They have tools in the toolbox they can use to do that, they just choose not to.  So, they must not believe it's a problem.\n\nThis doesn't mean that Q2 will be profitable... their calculation may be that there's a short term loss period until GF3 and other production increases happen to make the current numbers viable long term.  They could just be thinking they have the capital to make it through.\n\n(However, personally, I really feel surprises are coming and things are much better than they appear... no FSD isn't one of them yet)\n\nI believe price drops are done when lowering costs make it a viable path.  If it wasn't viable and they had no other path to fix it they'd be advertising by this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think many people really understand just how much efficiency and cost savings Tesla can still pull out of the various processes.  It'll take a long time before they run out of that.  Not many non-engineers could ever really understand how much incredible waste is found in splitting so much manufacturing and engineering work out across a whole lot of companies. How incredibly mediocre of a product you'll get when you have to do something extremely complex and you split your components out across a lot of people who don't talk to each other very much.  From an MBA's perspective it's a great thing... a \"do what you're good at, outsource the rest\" concept.  Funny thing, it sounds like common sense but it's actually pretty awful in highly complex products.  Heavy communication and understanding the end goal of the individual systems is critical to making more optimal solutions.  Openness to getting rid of stuff when there's a better way is very important... vs some contractor not wanting to design themselves into a less profitable relationship. Going vertical and being very much interested in looking at things with constantly fresh eyes turns up all kinds of ridiculous waste and ways to improve.\n\nIt's not just the actual car... it's the processes to manufacture the car.  In fact, MOST of the cost savings is on the manufacturing side.  In a traditional company that is treated almost entirely separately.  \"Here's the design, figure out how to build it\"  (there's SOME communication, but not much)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm not worried.

A BMW, Mercedes, or Tesla would be seen as a wealth status symbol. B.  Tesla is a much more established brand with well selling cars, tons of store and service locations while NIO is a relatively new company. \nNIO\u2019s vehicles price ranges are targeted at the luxury vehicle buyer and it\u2019s just too much for its lack of brand recognition c. Tesla\u2019s model 3 that will be produced in Shanghai is priced extremely well for a premium/luxury EV at just 320k! This on top of the local incentives for EVs makes this much more appealing\n\n2. Tesla sells to multiple international markets, not just China. The stocks shot up recently as investors saw that demand in Eu/US is actually healthier than expected by the market\n\n3. Tesla\u2019s stock carries the autonomy product of Tesla, autopilot, aswell. There is a lot of uncertainty here which makes Tesla\u2019s valuation all of the place.

Using them as good examples of socialism is not cool, since their socialist policies are getting carried hard by the capitalist free market.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not even that but their socialist programs are heavy burdens on their governmental budgets while being extremely inefficient and ineffective. Their healthcare industry is their most socialist program they\u2019ve got, but take a look at it and you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s really not all that great. American leftists love to glorify European socialized healthcare but turn a blind eye to all its shortcoming. If you have a legitimate emergency, you\u2019ll get immediate attention, but for anything short of an emergency you have waitlists. Oh you have acne and want to see a specialist dermatologist? Yeah, get in line because that\u2019s a 6+ month wait list. Also, there are still copays in Norway and most socialized healthcare systems because they realized people were going to the doctor for the most minor issues, clogging the triage pipeline. \n\nThe worst thing about socialized healthcare is that specialist medical fields get FUCKED. Taxpayer funded healthcare means everyone goes to the doctor for every little wart, every rash, every cough. There are like 650 dermatologist in the entire UK, serving a population of 66 million. How do you think are on the waitlist for their acne issues? 750,000. As an American I can go see a dermatologist next week. Actually I don\u2019t even need to wait that long, I can book an online appointment, get diagnosed through photos/videos and pick up my prescription across the street within the day. I did it a couple months ago, no waitlists and no copays. There are people in Wales that apparently waited 2 years for their dermatology appointment. \n\nAnother downside is that socialization of healthcare means that the pay for medical professionals is artificially capped. In a capitalistic system, if there are labor shortages, wages go up to compensate and more people are attracted to that career. But because salaries are capped in socialized healthcare systems, people are dissuaded from enlisting in those career fields. This causes wait times to go up even more.   In the UK nurses start at $30,000 and average around $40,000 a year. In the US nurses make $74,000 average. $30,000 is barely above the poverty line in my city with our high COL. The salaries for doctors in the UK are absolutely pathetic considering the length of education and intensity of training they must endure. Then they wonder why their healthcare system is falling apart. The medical field in socialized countries is absolute garbage, they\u2019re struggling hard to persuade students to enter the medical field but no one wants to because the pay is shit. \n\nNo thanks, I work hard and healthcare in America isn\u2019t really all that expensive. I\u2019ll probably pay a similar amount in increased taxes for socialized healthcare anyway so I\u2019d rather have the luxury of immediate high quality care than deal with year long wait lists and shit quality care. If you\u2019re poor in America, you get free healthcare anyway, what\u2019s the fucking point of this whole socialized healthcare bullshit.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4184618294239044}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6952312588691711}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8314125537872314}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5534707903862}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44625192880630493}, {"body": "Mostly true but todays left has shifted much more to cultural/gender/racial equality instead of income equality.
