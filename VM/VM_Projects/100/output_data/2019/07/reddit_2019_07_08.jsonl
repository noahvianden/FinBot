{"title": "Selling Puts for Income", "selftext": "I've been selling puts for income for about 5 years now. I'd say about 75% of the puts I sell expire worthless, allowing me to pocket the entire premium. The other 25% of the time I get put the stock. In these cases I usually immediately sell a call at the same strike price, which puts more cash in my pocket. If the stock drops significantly below the strike price and leaves me sitting on a potential loss, I usually just wait  for a bounce before selling a new call. \n\nMy basic rule is to pick stocks that I don't mind owning at the price. These are usually time tested companies with proven track records, steady dividend payers, and would be regarded as boring by most standards. Example companies are AAPL, MCD, AXP, PFE, CSCO, INTC, etc... \n\nI aim to make about 15% per year with this strategy, and have been successful at doing this for the past few years. I scan through maybe 30 stocks each week, and look for the 1-2 that are trading near support levels. I then sell a put that expires in 30-45 days. I choose a strike that gives me a small cushion on the downside, and generates my 15% return. \n\nTo calculate the return, I assume the entire amount of capital needed to buy the stock is set aside. So if I'm selling a put at a $45 strike price, I make sure I have the $4500 in my account to buy the 100 shares, should that be necessary. I know some people calculate an annual percentage based on margin, but I've never been a margin trader before. I always make sure to have all the cash on hand to meet any purchase obligations. \n\nMy goal here is just to start publishing my trades and establishing a track record. I don't trade every week, but I do enter at least 1-2 trades per month. When the market over-reacts to the downside, I will sometimes enter multiple trades in order to capitalize on the increased fear, as put premiums skyrocket in these cases. \n\nAt most I like to have 8 positions open at a time. Anything beyond that and I'm typically maxed out in terms of available cash. Feel free to ask questions on any trades I post, or follow along if you'd like.\n\n==========Edit================\n\nI'm setting up a google doc that I'll share a link to, for now I'm just going to list these here \n\n7-11-19   Sell KR Aug 16 2019 21 Put at .36\n\n7-15-19   Sell CSX July 19 2019 75 Put at .39\n\n7-22-19   Assigned CSX at $75.

MS estimate that's 10T mile market. Use $3T and $0.5 profit margin, that's about $1.5T profit per year.\n\nLook at it from another angle, if Tesla starts FSD ride sharing at $1 per mile, I think the car will be busy enough to drive 300 miles a day, taking $200 revenue. That's about $70k revenue a year, $30k profit seems achievable. \n\nOf course, all the above assume Tesla gets FSD first, no competitors, their FSD cars are safe and don't need much maintenance.

They want the contracts to expire worthless.\n\nThis goes back to max pain theory, which is very effective on Fridays. It's allowed me to predict Friday's closing price 7/8 times on TSLA. It's not a guarantee, but it's a reliable indicator for $TSLA. You need to also analyze it with the surrounding environment.  Right now we have low volume...which is somewhat easy to manipulate the stock. You don't even even need that big of a bank roll, you just need to cap the intraday surges & knock it down, sending it into a spiral, before reloading with more ammunition. They aren't selling the whole way down; just making sure the stock doesn't break out of certain ranges. Also, we are unlikely to have any significant news until earnings comes out, so as long as volume stays low the call sellers won't let the stock float above $240.\n\nSo, we can predict Friday's closing price with high accuracy, even when the open interest is only 4k. The further out you go, the less reliable this indicator becomes. So with 9 trading days to the 19th, this is a bit far out to be making predictions, except that there's a *very* *low* Put:Call ratio on Jul 19. The Jul 19 240s have 32.2k open interest, the 250s have 36k open interest, the 260s have 23.5k open interest, and the 70s have 14.2k open interest. That's a shitload of shares and a lot of premium for those call sellers who need to make sure they expire worthless. This is a major reason why I don't think it will go above 240 prior to that date.\n\nNext major reason: Look at the behaviour of the stock when it trades around 240. Go back to Jul 2, the stock popped to 240 on the deliveries release, briefly floating to 245 before getting knocked back down to 240. It remained glued to 240 like a magnet for most of the after-market and following pre-market. Then it opened July 3 at $240, sold off on huge pressure to $236, then surged again to $240.00 hitting it exactly before getting knocked back down. There is a LOT of selling pressure that does not want this stock to go above 240 before July 19.\n\nThis thesis relies on low to medium volume, barring any sort of extraordinary event such as taking Tesla private at $420, funding secured.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Just saw an article that touches on some of your points: https://imgur.com/a/qrVWkLD", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the share, I'll look into it.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21914127469062805}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14054132997989655}], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "My understanding is there are big holder with 3m+ plus shares on hand.

The united states can purchase the rights to those assets and either give holders market value, or take the student loans on to their books and continue to make \"payments\" as millions of students would with literally zero change to the term structure of the existing assets people own.

That's why there is a shit ton of information out there for cheap and free, especially in this internet age. That's why libraries are tax sponsored stores of information. \n\nHigher education, however, is a privilege. The state does its part by sponsoring public, and more affordable options, but a degree is the buyer's choice and should not be society's expense.
