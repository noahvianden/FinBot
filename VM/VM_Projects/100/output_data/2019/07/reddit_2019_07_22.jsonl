{"title": "How Google can make a couple billion overnight", "selftext": "Netflix is in a very fragile state right now, kind of like me since my wife left, due to missing subscriber growth targets.\n\nSo I'm thinking, Google can make an absolute killing by buying puts on Netflix and then removing Netflix from the app store.\n\nThis tanks the price because most signups probably come from mobile devices based on an article that was probably written by a bot that I just skimmed. Plus, android users are probably 50% of Netflix's user base because there are two main mobile OSs (iOS and Android) so 1/2 = 50%. \n\nSo overnight, Netflix loses access to 50% of new subscribers. \n\nBut then, Google can take it a step further. Like in the time when Apple put that bon jovi song on everyone's iPod, or Amazon deleted a bunch of eBooks off people's kindles, Google can delete the Netflix app from everyone's android device citing \"security concerns\". (Security of Google's bottom line)\n\nAt this point, Google just needs to load up on OTM puts, ranging from FDs to LEAPS, and strikes as far as 40% OTM.\n\nAnyways, so now you got all these people panicking about how Netflix is going under and being removed / possibly malware. Once this hysterectomy sets in, Google turns around, closes the puts, and buys a ton of calls and reinstates Netflix.\n\nMaybe Google even force reinstalls Netflix on a bunch of android / iOS users (idk if they can hack apple and install apps but I'm just assuming they can)\n\nSo basically, Google makes a ton of money on this and dipshits who write options get screwed. Google makes a couple billion overnight and EPS for that quarter goes through the roof.\n\nIf anyone has Satya Nadella's contact info, please pass it on so I can tell him about this great plan. I'll give you a cut of the massive paycheck he cuts to me for this consulting work as I generate billions in earnings for Google.\n\nOh yeah, one issue is potential litigation and anti-trust action, but that won't happen for at least 1-2 quarters after the earnings come out, so it doesn't matter.", "id": "cg7dv8", "created_utc": 1563762086.0, "score": 458, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s a bulletproof plan", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "It literally cannot go tits up.", "score": 30, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08925846964120865}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11371081322431564}, {"body": "Yea what kind of fag uses Netflix on their phone as a primary device.\n\nThe hysterectomy bit is great too but damn.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.045914389193058014}, {"body": "this is exactly the type of post i would make after snorting 10 addies and not sleeping for 48 hours.", "score": 156, "replies": [{"body": "comment erased with Power Delete Suite", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0969720184803009}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13407956063747406}, {"body": "Too many words but I saw buy Netflix puts so I\u2019ll try that.

A few years ago I decided to get back into stocks after a long layoff.  I had a brilliant idea.  I understood that biotech stocks get pumped and dumped all the time.  So I was going to research biotechs and try to find a company that had not been pumped in a while and go long.  Through some google DD, I decided that CARA was the one.  So I bought 2000 shares at around $6.50.   A few price swings over the next couple days scared me shitless.  Was I really gonna risk my entire savings on some relatively unknown biotech?  So I ended up selling all my shares at about $6.00 for a loss of $1000.  A week or two later and CARA ends up rocketing up to over $20 a share.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Are you ok?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04854743927717209}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5173104405403137}, {"body": "Amazon was in the 3 digits, lower-mid $900s.\n\nI was trying to save money for a deposit on my apartment, so I was not fully comfortable dropping my savings on it.\n\nIf I had not gotten that job, having to move 400 miles away.
