FB is basically at Phase 5, while Tesla is at the end of Phase 4. Facebook's Libra shows that they are still ambitious, and I think digital currency / payment platform can take FB to the next level.

I've started a business, have taxes on rentals, etc. I need some help this year.  \n\n\nMom calls and asks if I will actually accept one this year. I said \"Go crazy if you want to. I can use it this year.\"  \n\n\nShe did. Even my ex-wife got a large check (she came). To them it was nothing compared to seeing my daughter play with puzzles.
