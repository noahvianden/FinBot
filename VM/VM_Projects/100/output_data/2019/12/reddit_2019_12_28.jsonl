That means the new daily supply hitting the market(mined bitcoins) falls in half. The Cash App and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, assuming current trends continue, will be buying up this entire daily supply by the end of next year. Bitcoin has a large cult of HODL'ers. The mining hash rate has gone parabolic, where even retail won't be able to mine bitcoin unless they operate as a large scale mining farm business. But, if BTC moons, every Tom, Dick, and Harry will be cranking up their old miners making the hash rate fucking skyrocket(even tho it already is). 2. Ethereum has decentralized finance, or DEFI, which is likely to bring in the new slew of not only retail, but I think we get more companies in this next bull cycle. Bitcoin should continue to grind higher and higher for several years following the halving event. If bitcoiners aren't already front running the next halving, they are TOTALLY FUCKING UP! For stocks, the markets likely won't continue to grind higher unless we are facing severe inflation rates or continued quantitive easing(printing of new money). Governments fuck everything up, so it's only a matter of time. Fortunately, Bitcoin has global demand, so all governments will crank their printers on, print the fuck out of Fiat, and be able to exchange it for a non printable money. The next major bull cycle for Bitcoin may not occur until a broken Fiat country like Zimbabwe, Argentina, Venezuela, North Korea, or others decide to switch to Bitcoin, and the house of cards that we call government curriencies start to collapse, one by one, as we have a mad scramble to valuable commodities like Bitcoin, gold, oil, and others.

The law was basically punishing Google & Google News for their success, and the struggles of the legacy Newspaper industry to adapt to the Internet. \n\n* While some places in the US have banned Uber/Lyft, the EU has tended to do it more frequently, as they're harming the taxi industry. And under the taxi medallion system it's actually illegal for Uber/Lyft to operate in many places.\n\n* Due to stricter IP laws & demands for too much money by rightsholders, some popular web services were simply non-existent in parts of the EU until the rightsholders finally allowed it many years after it had caught on elsewhere.

Germany practices a kind of Capitalism called \"Renish Capitalism.\"  This naturally impacts share prices.    We can debate later about whether the average German is happier than or lives better than the average American.  For now, here are some of the differences.\n\n\"In recent debates about the nature and future of capitalism, the United States and Germany are typically understood to represent opposing models  with  deep  historical  roots. In  the  realm  of  business  culture (Unter-nehmenskultur) and industrial relations, American business epitomizes a market-based, \u201chire-and-fire\u201d model of capitalism in which labor unions were never very powerful and have become virtually insignificant. German enterprises ... are still marked  by  a  socially  based,  corporatist  culture  (\u201cRhenish  capitalism\u201d) founded  on  strong  unions  and  labor  participation  in  management  (co-determination,  or Mitbestimmung).  \n\nMethods  of  finance  and  control  provide  a  second  point  of  contrast.  Shareholdings  in  most  large  American corporations are publicly traded and widely dispersed, salaried managers seem all-powerful, and US companies resemble commodities, easily bought  and  sold.  In  Germany,  a  \u201crelationship-based\u201d  system  predominates, in which large shareholders are more common and more powerful, while companies enjoy close relationships with banks, creating significant barriers to takeovers by holding large stakes in each other. \n\nA third element  concerns  their  respective  strengths  in  manufacturing.  American manufacturers still generally adhere to the style of mass production taken to its limits by Henry Ford, using specialized machines, narrowly defined skills, and closely supervised work processes. Their German counterparts excel,  as  they  have  historically,  at  more  flexible  forms  of  batch  or  customized  production,  relying  on  general-purpose  machines  and  skilled workers \n\nfrom  COMPARING U.S. AND GERMAN CAPITALISM  by Dunlavy and Welskopp", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Touche \ud83d\ude0a", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.037635546177625656}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4822395443916321}, {"body": "Germany is pretty dope, just wanna say that", "score": 31, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26851141452789307}, {"body": "Europe may have us beat when it comes to quality of life and social safety net, but their economic growth and innovation is soooooo wack. \n\nInvestors there are way too conservative and don\u2019t have much of a risk appetite, so tech startups have a hard time raising the money needed to grow.

{"title": "Year End Update from $200 to $47,796.80 Journey", "selftext": "Hello everyone and Happy Holidays. I just wanted to post my $200 journey using strictly directional options. I opened up a RH account in 2014 with $200 and started trading with it at the end of 2018 of December 28th. I was too busy trading in my main account so I had forgotten about this small RH account. It's not much of a win, but the gain % was pretty big so I thought I'd share it with the community of fellow autistic and degenerate gamblers like myself.\n\n\\*I provided a imgur link with some pictures. [2019 Stats](https://imgur.com/a/zlQd53Q)\n\nI traded mostly SPY, AAPL, DIS, AMZN, FB, NUGT, and IBM. Most trades were CALLs and did not buy much PUTs. As you can see by the pictures, I withdrew $3,000 cash so I am adding that total into the gain; hence the $47,796.80. I dabbled with some weeklys and bi-weeklys, but mostly 1 month out options. with the strike price about 3% - 7% from the target price.\n\nAfter years of trial and error in my main account, I learned that booking a profit is a win; no matter how small or if you left bigger wins behind by selling early. The more ammo (cash) you have, the more positions you can take. The upward spikes and downward cliffs were the result of Trump's tweets with Xi Xi Panda, so they were obviously not expected.\n\nPictures: [2019 Stats](https://imgur.com/a/zlQd53Q) RH's interface is crap as you can see. Not sure why there is a minus, but it is what it is. I'll be switching to a different brokerage soon.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone here and it is a pleasure reading all your posts whether it's a win or loss. Here's to a good 2020 for all of us!\n\n\\*Edit: I actually withdrew $500 twice (updated pics), so the total gain should be higher by $1,000.\n\n# $200 to $48,796.80", "id": "egk5ue", "created_utc": 1577496598.0, "score": 742, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 237, "comments": [{"body": "shit man all i did this year was read Intelligent Investor and throw that gay shit out the window to get some FDs\n\nfuck bonds\n\nthats sick tho congrats my guy", "score": 430, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck you.
