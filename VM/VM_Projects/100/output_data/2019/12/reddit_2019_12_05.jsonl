I\u2019m more bullish than just about anyone but that seems like the opposite of conservative. I wouldn\u2019t say impossible but I\u2019d say $0 is just as likely. \n\n\nMy best case scenario:\nIn 5-10 years the energy side of the company could be huge. If they can pull off the longevity and capacity claims that have been floated, it\u2019s going to be a game changer. With the solar roof, a significant amount of energy production and storage will provided by Tesla. Both solar and batteries are following cost curves so sales could absolutely go exponential. With electric vehicles, energy demands will be going through the roof which will compound this. \n\nIf they can pull off autonomous driving by late 2021-2022, they will likely have at least 2-3 years of a monopoly on the market. It won\u2019t be perfect since human drivers will still exist but if Tesla charges 70% of the rate, allows you to have the car to yourself, and provides a safer and more reliable service, they won\u2019t have trouble selling fares. The only employment cost would be for people to clean cars, resolve issues, etc. The cars are also crazy cheap to operate. \n\nAround the same time, they will be targeting the goods transportation market. The cybertruck could basically serve as a self driving U-Haul truck that comes to you whenever you need to haul something. Furthermore, the semi could completely change the trucking industry. Autopilot is already almost flawless on the freeway. By the time the Semi actually hits the road in large numbers, drivers on the freeway would basically be there for legal purposes. \n\nBeyond Tesla, one of the most interesting things could be the price of oil. With the fracking boom, we saw what potential there is. A flooded market shook producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia hard. It even fed into the collapse of Venezuela. Demand falling could have the same impact but potentially far worse. If producers start going under and the supply collapses, that would send gas prices through the roof. That would then cause demand to crash and you get a vicious cycle. Major powers could fall. \n\nAnyone that says they can put a price target on that potential is wrong. If they misstep at any point, they could implode. If there is a major software glitch that causes a bunch of crashes, not many people will want to hop in one. If there is a breakthrough in fusion, the energy sector could die in a heartbeat. If another company beats them to autonomy they would go from a monopoly to instead catching up. \n\nIf things go perfectly then it will be the most valuable company on earth. Musk is probably the only person that could pull it off but even then who knows. It\u2019s really a gamble but with 20-1 odds on a coin flip. I\u2019ll take those odds any day.\n\nEdit: Lol, half a paragraph ended up in the middle of another one somehow...fixed!", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Lol.

I try to stop her from eating stuff because you know - could be rat poison or whatever, but she's always way ahead of me - crunching on five week old discarded hot pockets or whatever the fuck.\n\nAnyway, she's super thorough, so throughout her journeys (which she takes the lead on) she points out a lot of coins and bills along the way, just by virtue of me always needing to look on the ground and try to stop her from killing herself.
