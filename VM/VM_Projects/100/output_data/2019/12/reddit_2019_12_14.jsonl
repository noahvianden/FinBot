All the others will probably be in-between at 1.5 years - so the real time window is more like another 3.5 years from now.\n- Single Gigafactory output is not limited to ~10k/week and ~500k/year:\n - Fremont, which we can think of as Gigafactory #0, is already at around 400k/year, and the Model Y expansion alone will likely bring it above 600k/year.\n - GF3 is projected to max out at around 1 million units per year in its current footprint - but there's no reason Tesla couldn't buy more land area nearby.\n- Existing Gigafactories can be expanded in parallel. Incremental expansion is much easier than constructing a new Gigafactory from scratch. In principle GF1, GF3 and GF4 are enough to reasonably cover about 80% of the global automotive market so a fair argument could be made that Tesla already has started the construction of every Gigafactory they'll need, they \"only\" need to scale them up.\n\nSo just ~4 Gigafactories with 1.25 million units/year output by the end of 2024 would be enough to meet the projection, but Tesla would probably be valued above 1 trillion dollars even if it's \"just\" 5 million units/year combined, especially since they are the only carmaker with a good FSD program.\n\nI believe the primary constraint is not going to be time to start construction, but market share and earned cash flow - i.e. the progress of the EV transition and Tesla's position within that transition.
