Stocks tend to increase exceptionally when they earn S&P 500 inclusion\n- Stocks do NOT tend to go down more than usual when they get dropped from the S&P 500\n\nThose two points suggest that S&P 500 inclusion (and the associated index buying) might not be what causes stock prices to increase, but rather the improving fundamentals that qualify them for inclusion. \n\nAnother interesting part is that individual stocks tend to get a bump when they are dropped from the Russel 1000 to the Russell 2000, but not the other way around. This suggests index buying does help individual stock prices -- in this case in a slightly paradoxical way.

And the other way you can't terminate. There's too many, it's going- people go crazy.
