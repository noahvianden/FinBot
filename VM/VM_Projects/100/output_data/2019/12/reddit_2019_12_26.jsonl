Greed and doing overzealous shit cos of over confidence can really hurt the gains. It sure hurt me initially...\n\nBeen trading for 5 weeks now after spending the past 2 months studying. In my 2nd week, I  bought amazon calls and because of the volatility of the underlying stock,  it was up $2k profit in less than an 1 hour. \nConsidering I paid $1480 premium, selling at that point was a no brainer but I decided to give it one more day to see if it would balloon further.\nThat extra day caused that trade to end in added -$1700 ( lost my premium plus additional $1700..)\n\nThat shit hurted to say the least and I stared at the screen laughing hysterically till I was able to come to terms with my foolishness. Waited a couple days and went back in after evaluating everything.\n\nNow I'm happy with anything above 40% and the new approach is to not aim for $000's each trade but $00's. A few people disagree with this but here's my experience thus far: 7 out of 10 trades go how I want and sometimes you win much bigger. On top of that I don't get attached to any positon so once it dips past a certain point, ( unless the dip had been factored into my plan), I exit so even when trades are losses,  a good chunk of the premium spent is reclaimed. \n\nBasically my thought process is this :$400/day on 250/365 days in the year will get you $100k before taxes.  Given that I also work 2 other jobs in IT and Sales, this is just some nice spare cash.\n\nNow I'm up 98% overall and notice that I get more success when I stick to my strategy. That often means leaving money on the table and that's ok . I'd rather make $10000 in 10+ trades than chase 10k in 3 to 4 trades, so I set my orders and walk away to avoid changing strategy while under pressure from the markets. Obviously, using the available alerts within your trading platform when doing this approach is highly advised.\n\nLong and short is,  going in conscious of the reality that this shit is just gambling, allows me to discipline myself and has kept me constantly gaining. Hopefully some of this was helpful, and I'm really excited for you on this journey. \n\nCheers my friend and happy trading. Remember...you can never learn too much.

This \"try it out before you buy it\" benefit becomes non-existant.\n\nA Model 3, and electric vehicles in general, do not require your typical ICE maintenance. The new vehicle also has an 8 year 100,000 mile warranty as the battery has an 8 year 120,000 mile warranty and therefore throws the \"maintenance benefit\" out the window.\n\nSo what are you left with? $20k (more for higher trims) depleted from your income with no option to buy the vehicle, no benefit of \"maintenance worries\", a restricted mileage (usually 15k miles per year), and $20,000 gone that you would have had otherwise with no vehicle to show for it.\n\nSome argue that they are going to lease a Model 3 while they wait for XYZ to be updated and have the latest and greatest.
