{"title": "Bearish indications of a reversal?", "selftext": "The markets went up  today,  but I am seeing a lot of key bearish indications that a reversal  on a longer term time frame is fast approaching.  Here are my notes  from after today's close\n\n\\---/ES, /NQ, & /RTY all closed the week printing a dragonfly doji  (bearish reversal) candle. They are all overbought on the 1hr currently  on RSI readings, however any new highs will result in bearish  divergences on the monthly, weekly, & daily charts on /ES &  /NQ.../RTY already has short term bearish divergence on the hourly. One thing to note is that /NQ is lagging and parked right below resistance  from last week. Why is that? Well..\n\n. ---Apple, although it has had an amazing few months, is showing  signs of a longer term reversal. It is overbought on the monthly and  weekly(extremely overbought) and has bearish divergence on these time frames. The daily today  broke to a new high and isn't overbought on that time frame yet so it already has bearish  divergence. It has left 2 gaps behind to fill on the daily and has printed a hanging man (reversal candle) on the weekly.\n\n\u00a0\\---What about good ol' Microsoft?  Same thing. Monthly & weekly charts are overbought with bearish divergences with a weekly hanging man candle. The kicker on here is that it is in a weekly rising wedge (bearish reversal) pattern and printed a weekly reversal candle at the top of  the wedge. Another puzzle piece to add to the table.\n\n\u00a0\\---Let's look at Amazon. Closing at the bottom of its trading range that it's been in for 6 months now...nothing bullish about it\u00a0\n\n\\---XLV(healthcare) it's been in a channel on the weekly since 2016.  Currently in the upper area of the channel while overbought, with bearish divergence and printing a dragonfly doji reversal candle.\u00a0 It is also overbought on the daily with bearish divergence. Bearish  divergence on the 4hr, 1hr...you get the picture.\n\n\\---XLF(financials) printed a dragonfly doji reversal candle on the weekly closing at resistance. The daily chart has a gap to fill with bearish divergence. It has bounced off the lows without consolidating on the 4hr chart and is extended at this point on that time frame.\n\n\\---XLF, XLV, & XLF have 1 gap close now on the daily to fill.\u00a0 XLK, XLY, XLC have 2 gaps to fill since Tuesdays bounce.This is more than just RSI running hot. It's RSI being overbought +  bearish divergences + bearish weekly candles + bearish reversal patterns on weekly & daily charts + gaps below to fill with no reason to not fill them especially since Trump made it clear that he is willing to wait until after the election to make a deal. Remarks made today by Kudlow were \"Trump is not ready to sign any trade deal with China\"...shorts got caught with the jobs numbers that was all and I suspect that to be short lived.", "id": "e78nym", "created_utc": 1575686510.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Thank god you didn\u2019t post this during market hours.
