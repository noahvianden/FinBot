Turkey has one of the highest bond rates in the world (which means that people really don't trust them to get paid back, so they have to entice with a huge yield). These countries are like US dollar heroin addicts. The US got its power because the rest of the world needs it's dollars to function (only recently have contracts begun to be denoted in non-US dollars). The 70s Saudis and the Petro dollar is an interesting read. It suddenly becomes a huge realization that the US got the upper hand by doing things like giving weapons to countries who denoted their contracts in US dollars.\n\nOne thing to understand is that all markets are at some base level speculative. A share of Microsoft is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. The difference between a share listed in the US and one listed in (for example) Hong Kong is that there's volume in the US ($30+ trillion market, compared to Hong Kong which is under $4t) and stability (the US doesn't have riots all over the streets at the moment). Things like war, corruption, civil unrest, dictatorships, etc are all things that are huuuge turn offs for investors. The US is even a bit of a turn off for investors because of Trump, but if people dont want US government bonds (because they don't trust Trump) they will flock to US stocks. Even real estate comes with risk cause it's not easy to sell a house, so they would call that illiquid. \n\nSo basically the US is a bit of a life raft right now. I'm Canadian and am looking on in horror at their politics, but always remember that the stock market is a Ponzi scheme - it's not the economy.

Scandal may be one of them but when looking at where to invest your money you need to really look at everything going on in that sector and in that business.
