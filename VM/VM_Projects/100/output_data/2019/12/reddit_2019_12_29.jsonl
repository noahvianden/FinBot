Do research and find the ten best possible stocks to invest in that will grow, preferably immediately. Invest $10k on the first stock, which (let\u2019s suppose) is trading for $100/share, and wait for it to climb by as close to 10% as possible. Let\u2019s say that you bought 1,000 shares of that stock. It appreciated by 10% two months later and trades at $110/share. Add a stop-loss at the price $101/share. \n\nNow, let\u2019s assume that there\u2019s a recession, and prices crash by 40% over the course of two months. When the price of your stock declines to $101/share, the sell order will automatically be triggered, and the chances are that you won\u2019t lose any of your original capital. \n\nIf there is no recession and things still look good, invest the second $10k in a similar manner, and keep going, until you\u2019ve invested all of your available capital. By staggering your purchases and waiting for share price appreciation in this way, you\u2019re performing good risk management that will protect your original capital.\n\nWhen you do \u201cstop out,\u201d that\u2019s great. Hold on to your capital and wait, to see just how low the price of the stocks will go. When you think that they\u2019re at a bottom, buy back in. This way, you\u2019ll have bought them at a discount, at near the lowest possible price. When the recession ends, you\u2019ll start gaining a LOT more than you would have otherwise. \n\nAlthough this could take a while to implement, that\u2019s the whole point. By keeping most of the available capital in cash, and slowly and pragmatically buying into the market, you\u2019re both trying to make money and defend your money. By getting into the market in small steps, you\u2019re allowing time for the market to drop, so that just in case a correction or recession does occur, you\u2019ll have lots of cash on hand to take full advantage of it.\n\nWhat should you do if the share price of a stock doesn\u2019t appreciate by 10% within a few months of your purchase? Sell and pick something else. It wasn\u2019t the right stock to be in in the first place.\n\nAnd one more thing: for stocks that do appreciate, as they appreciate, raise your stop-loss limit ever more, so that when there\u2019s an inevitable reversal, you\u2019ll be able to lock in as much profit as possible before the stop-loss triggers. \n\nYou really can manage your downside risk this way.

I've been doing a small bit of paper trading in various blue chip stocks and only a small but of actual real money trading with $200 but I'm 19 and I've recently landed a $1220 weekly income as an independent contractor in logistics and I now have $13000 with more coming in every week. I've said this idea to my old fashioned parents which their response is \"Lifes not that easy\" and that kind of ideology. The stock broker I've been looking on is Etoro which seems pretty bad compared to the American apps but Etoro is what I've found to be the best available in Ireland as the main ones like WeBull and Robinhood aren't yet. But with my 13,000 leveraged X5 which is $65,000 worth of an investment which is available to every retail investor on Etoro at a $14.41 daily rate and a weekend rate of $43.23. What is the catch with investing in Big stocks such as Coca Cola, Tesla, Apple, Facebook etc and cashing out exactly when it rises over 1% which it seems to do at least once a week bought at the right time like when its in the red.  1% of 65,000  is $650 minus however many days it takes. It would take weeks for the fees to accumulate $650 which is to say it only rises one percent. Can anyone. Is it possible to rinse and repeat this process to hopefully accumulate over $1000 a week or is there something huge that I'm missing out on. \nP.S. I know it isn't certain that stock prices will rise and have the ability to fall and cost me a considerable amount of capital as well as running into arrears but this is all said with the intent of researching into big companies which are nearly guaranteed to not fall dramatically soon and have a high probability of rising even by %0.5 over a few days which would still fetch a profit of 325 with the figure mentioned at present.\n\nI would greatly appreciate other peoples opinions  on this and I'm sure this has been said millions of times before so I want to know what's the catch before I do something foolish.

I still believe in the viral nature of Tesla sales.  The more people who own them the more who see them and the more who order.  Unfortunately that viral demand was not enough to offset incredible pull forward on demand from Q1 2019 into Q4 2018.  \n\nI\u2019m also familiar with the auto industry and afaikt q1 isn\u2019t just seasonably slow its a standstill.  This led to the big demand scare of 1/2 (first half) of 2019,  the pricing convulsions,  the announcement to close retail stores and ultimately they drop to $170.\n\nHowever, long before the SP recovered demand recovered.  Elon said as much but it fell on deaf ears.  Q3 combined strong demand with cost efficiencies and we got whala, surprise profit.   When did Elon say q4 and q1 would break even?  During the demand \u201chole\u201d.\n\nSo now I expect demand and viral demand are stacking up en-force while cost efficiencies are still in place.  Shorts are already off guard and on their heals.  Elon is going for the kill with 2k perf upgrades,  pushing as hard as ever on deliveries, etc.   They will sail past the 260M profit needed for S&P inclusion consideration and all out panic will ensue.\n\n\nThe writing will be on the wall when delivery numbers are announced so that\u2019s when it starts.   Finally, a much smaller pull forward,  pent up and viral demand,  and Chinese income will make Q1 profitable by a safe margin as well.\n\nSolar income may also sneak in a surprise.\n\nEdit 2: everything I\u2019m seeing regarding inventory, used inventory, m3 sold in China through q1,  deliveries being postponed till after eoy would seem to me to support my thinking.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "so what youre saying is we're gonna be rich", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Well ya - my target is 10k/share or north so I won\u2019t be selling regardless - unless it gets obviously silly.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25866612792015076}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27058523893356323}, {"body": "I've been checking for any model 3 inventory deals.
