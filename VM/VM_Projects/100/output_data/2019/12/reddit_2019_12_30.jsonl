The difference in CPU yield can be huge.\n\nWhen working with silicon to make a CPU, if there's a defect on the silicon the CPU can't be used (or if it only affects one core, they'll downgrade the CPU, like i7 -> i3). So having a modular chiplet design is highly adventageous because you only have the throw away that chiplet and not the whole CPU die like with a monolithic die.

I don't think we'll see this kind of explosive VW-style short squeeze. The \"taking private\" buyout at $420 might have delivered such a squeeze.\n\nYou can also chalk this down as a failed prediction/expectation of mine.\n\nNevertheless even if you bought $600-$700 calls near the $200 bottom, they are now 20-baggers and 40-baggers, depending on expiry date, so the exact top of the squeeze doesn't really matter. \ud83d\ude0e", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I don't even want or care about a short squeeze anyway.
