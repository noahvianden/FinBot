{"title": "Post your 2020 Picks for 2030 and reasoning behind them", "selftext": "Like the title says, post your picks for 2020 that you will hold til 2030. \n\nLet's rewind to December of 2009. FB is not yet public. TWTR's tweets are still petite and the stock is unlisted. GOOG is back at $300 for the first time since its pre-recession peak. AAPL is also nearly back at $30, returning to pre-recession highs. MSFT is also at $30, where it has been stagnant since falling after its monopoly-esque problems. \n\nFast forward to 2019. FB is at $200. TWTR is now listed and at $30, down from its IPO and recent highs near $45. GOOG is now at $1345. AAPL is $280. And MSFT is $151. Hot damn. Had you been holding since 12/2009, you would have made quite a return on any of these giants.\n\nInternet consumption tripled from 50 minutes to 157 minutes from 2009 to 2019. TV dropped from 187 minutes to 163. \n\nBut this major shift is IMO what is driving the internet boom. \n\nSo what does this mean for 2030? What stocks should we pick now for 4-10X return in 10 years? \n\nI think the trend from 2009-2019 will continue through to 2029 even if the relative gains of internet consumption decrease. There is still XX time elsewhere to cannibalize, on TOP of 163 minutes of daily TV time. \n\nThat internet time consumed by average person has tripled, and that the companies that benefit from this have more than tripled, belies the importance of media consumption and the tech revolution as we look forward to 2029. So to that end, what will still be around in 2029, what will be more consumed, what will be more profitable, and what will people be DOING more than today?\n\nI think the 107 minute per day gain in media is going to hold over the next ten years re: internet use. As people have more free time in general due to the proliferation of the gig economy (tech insecurity = semi-unemployment / gig economy = media use in off time, besides increasing media use in general), FB, TWTR, GOOG are only going to become more engrained into society's everyday functioning. \n\nI am currently long on FB, and I think TWTR will be the next addition due to its recent drop. TWTR was tracking FB nicely post-2018 correction, and I believe the current price offers an entry target that is substantially undervalued. \n\nI see 2020 offering a major boon to both companies as election attention ramps up. TWTR will be a bigger name than ever this cycle as it plays out on the internet vs. TV more than any previous cycle (a trend that will only continue in 2024 and 2028). While concerns about FB's reach exist, I do not think they will result in a break-up as long as TWTR survives, as it removes the claims of monopoly. So TWTR's survival is actually also in FB's interest and as it survives it will only become more ubiquitous now that it is profitable. \n\nI think MSFT and AAPL and GOOG are probably great bets for 2029 as well, but I love FB and TWTR's potential over the next 10 years and would argue FB in particular could be like AAPL around 2009 in terms of impending growth. TWTR could be more of a GOOG. But both offer major return potential. \n\nLooking ten years ahead, what are your picks, why are the above picks wrong, ETC? :)\n\nI also like ADBE ($37 in 12/2019 to $303 today), Cloudflare aka NET (IPO @$18, waiting til lockup to consider buying but I love it), OHI (Omega Healthcare, $19 in 09 to $42 today with big dividend), and maybe UBER next year.", "id": "e9edxl", "created_utc": 1576103378.0, "score": 408, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 248, "comments": [{"body": "TER - chip-testing company which is now in robotics, both industries should see great growth over the next 10 years. Solid cash flow, good balance sheet, and growing earnings. I am a big fan of Teradyne long-term.\n\nHON - extremely well run industrial conglomerate, now trying to be a pioneer in IIOT (Industrial internet of things) - I personally think this move is genius if they are able to capitalize correctly, I work close to the sector. Good cash flow, enough cash on hand to pay down debt. Stock is pretty well priced considering the growth opportunity in the software sector. \n\nURI - I work in construction and think they are extremely well positioned in equipment rentals. They have diversified a bit with a porta-potty business so that they should be tied a bit less to the construction cycle. Despite the recent run I think it is a still cheap stock. Good cash flow and earnings but this one comes with a lot of debt which is what causes the price to be cheap.\n\nILMN - A leader in genetic sequencing and genomic analysis. Growing earnings at 40% plus the past 5 years, outpacing revenue growth. I think revenue will start to pick up faster over the next 5 years as well. Again, good balance sheet, solid cash flow and not much debt.\n\nBABA- playing off growing middle class in china, and thry are expanding into new markets, they just signed some preliminary agreements in Africa. I know the numbers are always suspect, but with the release in Hong Kong (the Chinese people love Alibaba) I think this makes some pretty serious gains over the next couple years. If you believe the numbers, they are well priced as well. \n\nBIDU -this one is a gamble, I think they are cheap if you believe their reported numbers or even close (I am skeptical anything chinese). It got beaten down a ton earlier this year and it is still a large company so I think it could bounce back.", "score": 131, "replies": [{"body": "Stay away from Chinese stocks they sit on a house of cards.

I would say that I find BABA a much less risky investment than some of the names noted in this thread (CRISPR, EDITAS) The potential upside over the next ten years I believe can be weighed against the possible downside. I also think China as a country has a lot at stake to keep their international reputation on the up and up if they are going to start replacing the US on the global stage which is absolutely their goal. There you go, both upside and downside are addressed, all of the above recommendations are based on each individual's risk tolerance. Does that make it safer than clinical-stage biotech with no revenue in the foreseeable feature and 5+ years to put a drug on the market? I think perhaps yes, others will think no. Also with BABA starting to list on chinese markets, I see a pretty good upside just from their own chinese nationalism buying into their local companies. They could always get de-listed from the US exchanges which is definitely a risk.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "China does not have a proper system of checks and balances or due process.

There's a reason why wealthy Chinese people move so much of their investments out of the country. Their government can take anything and imprison anyone on a whim.

For example Argentina's entire market dropped 50% in one day because of the election results. China doesn't even have fair elections. Just look at what's happening in Hong Kong right now. \n\nThe thesis for investing in BABA hinges on the growth of China's middle class. After all it's a country with 4x the population of the United States which represents massive buying power. Do you honestly believe that such a massive growing middle class will be content living under an authoritarian dictatorship? As people move into middle class and have discretionary income they also will want more individual rights, things as simple as the freedom of speech. What they want is democracy, a fair system that protects and works for all of them. Meanwhile Xi Jinping wants to be President of China for life. These ideologies are at odds with each other and he's made it very clear there will be no voluntary transfer of power in China. It could a very swift coup that stabilizes quickly or it could be a long drawn out fight that destabilizes everything, the point is no one knows what will happen to China so how can you be confident in holding a Chinese company for the next 10 years? \n\nAlso if you bought AMZN, APPL, or MSFT in early 2017 you'd be up over 100% in addition to receiving a nice dividend as well so that's really not saying much.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4515475630760193}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4378613829612732}], "tickers": ["de"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Agreed.

Their economy certainly has problems but I think that the American-listed stocks have been beaten down a ton for this exact reason making them fairly attractive buys if you are willing to take on some risk. Maybe it is a bubble and will pop eventually but when you look at the developments that China is making all over Asia and into Africa I happen to think those are good long-term moves that will help their companies gain exposure to other developing economies and could get them through a large downturn.

TSLA is a part of two major changes happening right now.\n\n* Electric Vehicle shift\n\n* Self Driving Cars\n\nOn electric cars, the technology is just better, and all the focus on combating climate change & pollution will farther help this shift through the helping hand of government. EV's also tend to work better with self driving cars, because of the fuel source (this is why most self driving cars you see are EV's. It's not just because the people working on it love EV's). The only thing holding EV's back right now is battery prices, which will continue to fall over the next decade & make EV's much more affordable.\n\nThere's going to be some big losers from the shift to EV's, the most obvious being the oil industry (we use oil for other things besides automobiles, but slowly losing a bunch of automobile demand overtime will definitely hurt oil stocks), and legacy automakers who fail to adapt fast enough (there's always companies who fail to adapt to new technology in their industry). Then there's the suppliers for those industries.\n\nSelf driving cars will cause even more shifts, regardless of who wins the self driving race.\n\n* The importance of software in cars, and user entertainment (like video games for example that TSLA offers) will become a lot more important. Some people have been saying the auto companies/dealerships will need to make more money by selling you software add-ons like this to your car.\n\n* Unless there's government intervention to stop it (like the taxi medallion system) there's probably going to be a glut of robotaxi services that hit the legacy taxi industry hard.\n\n* Businesses that specialize in maintenance of self driving cars (like refueling them at gas station, or cleaning their cameras/sensors) will probably surface at some point once self driving vehicles are mainstream.

Combined with the Silent Generation, they own the vast bulk of real estate in this country. \n\nIn another 8 years, the ENTIRETY of the Boomers will be at retirement age, and over half of them will be early 70s+, with the oldest now 81. Mass death will be commencing at this point, as well a major transfer from single family housing to assisted or independent living facilities. \n\nThis is already happening in many of the areas with older median ages. And the glut of RE is HORRENDOUS. Places in suburban NY specifically never recovered from 2008, and now their listings are being filled with enormous properties, many of which were built 30 years ago (1985-1990) and are now falling apart and / or heinous. \n\nThis is only going to get worse in the 2020s. And it will peak in the early 2030s. At that point prices will be MUCH lower than where they are today at the top of the market (IMO, like 500K+ homes). The adjustment at the lower end will not be as severe and smaller homes may actually continue to see stability / price increases. \n\nBut the larger homes, the bulk of commissions etc, are about to begin dropping in price in a BIG way and it is not going to change for 10-20 years. Not only are the Baby Boomers about to flood the market with homes, Millennials are generally too debt-burdened to pick up the assets now being dumped. While they will buy houses, they are buying smaller homes, and the floor for ugly massive McMansions from 1989 that are now maintenance and property tax nightmares could potentially be 0, or transition to slum-like sub-dividable rental housing. \n\nI think this also belies hope for the stock market, however. Stocks have vastly outperformed real estate on returns for the Boomers. I think that while keeping a house is a huge cost, keeping stock is a major source of income (whether through growth or dividends).

Note: I\u2019m unsure if this report is specific to Tesla or the general auto industry, it\u2019s unclear. Tesla did not disclose its own savings.  \n>  \n>The battery factory\u2019s initial output will be 10 GWh. Capex to get to this initial output is \u201cless than 100s of millions\u201d, which is financial speak for somewhere above $100m.  \n>  \n>The China subsidy policy will bring the Model 3 price down from 328k RMB to 299k RMB including VAT.  \n>  \n>Tesla plans to build 100 supercharger stations per quarter in China. This can possibly be accelerated to 150-200.  \n>  \n>**Berlin Gigafactory:**  \n>  \n>Tesla still expects construction to begin around January 2020. Vehicle production from the Berlin Gigafactory is expected to begin in 2021 or a max two years from the start of construction.  \n>  \n>Capex for GF4 is indicated to be slightly higher than GF3.  \n>  \n>**Model Y:**  \n>  \n>Since Tesla wants to be at volume production for Model Y next summer, Deutsche Bank believes Tesla will start ramping initial production of the car in Fremont as soon as a few months from now.  \n>  \n>Manufacturing costs for Model Y are about the same as the Model 3, yet ASPs are \\~$4k higher for CUVs, suggesting higher margins.  \n>  \n>**Other tidbits:**  \n>  \n>There was a 27% take rate for FSD at $6k. This must be data from before the recent price hike to $7k.  \n>  \n>Today, less than 5% of Model 3 sales are from reservation holders.  \n>  \n>Tesla did not provide an update to its battery cost curve.

If I sell it for more then I'll gain more. This has worked but of course leaves me open to a big decline. In case that happens I always have enough to potentially average down shares and wait it out. Also to make premiums worth it I'm often selling at the money or even in the money if I'm really bullish, which means I've got a pretty good chance of being assigned.\n\nSo I've been looking up different options strategies since you posted here with this. I see use in some: spreads, iron condor, collar, strangle. But I'm most interested in somewhat consistent income at this point. That's why I've been trying to sell puts, calls, and shares only lately.\n\nSo this is an iron condor right? Which means you need it to stay within a range, above that or below that and you'll lose money.\n\nI went through your position trying to do the math and understand, let me know if I got it.\n\nFirst things first, your net credit, which is your max profit is $680.5? \nI did difference between leg1 .13 x 100 x 10 = 130, leg2 .24 x 100 x 10 = 240, and leg3 .315 x 100 x 10 = 310.5. Your max loss is 631.5? I did spread distance minus credit received leg1 69-67=2 so  2-.13=1.87 so 1.87 x 100 = 187 leg2 72-70=2 so 2-.24=1.76 so 1.76 x 100 = 176 leg3 85-82=3 so 3-.315=2.685 so 2.685 x 100 = 268.5.\n\nMax profit will be achieved if at expiration it closes greater than 72 and less than 82, right? Will max loss be if less than 68.87 or greater than 82.31? I got those by taking high strike for puts and subtracting .13 credit, and by taking low strike on call and adding .31 credit. And you'll have about 39 in comissions I think.\n\nI might try this, or just a bull credit put spread on something. Main advantage I see with this compared to how I've been doing it is that this allows you to choose strikes that are further away from current stock price and still make good money. Currently I have to choose near money or it's not really worth it to me. With the condor or spread there's less chance it'll hit those strike prices. The margin requirement is also likely less on this. Currently I can only really have two or three put sells running in a week depending on stock prices since the sold puts have to be cash secured. Drawbacks I see are that if you're wrong then you just lose your money in thin air whereas sold puts at least give you shares to hold for a rebound or to write calls on, so the money isn't gone it's just unrealized loss. The other drawback might be ease of closing position early. If I sell a put then the stock jumps up my put is already near max profit so I just buy back. With this I'm not sure if that's possible since it depends on theta decay, which is why I might just do bull credit put spreads.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you understand spreads, then you understand Iron Condors.  An Iron Condor is literally just a put credit spread and a call credit spread.\n\nIf the distance between your strikes in a put credit spread is $10, then your max loss is $10 x 100 = $1000 (minus premium received).  Thus many brokerages will hold $1000 from your account as collateral in case things go badly for you.\n\nHowever, if you then turn around and open a call credit spread on the same stock, same expiration, and the same distance between strike prices, most brokerages will be smart enough to realize that they don't need to hold an additional $1000 in collateral, because it wouldn't be possible for both positions to expire with a loss.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5653189420700073}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7025587558746338}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13712389767169952}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17103414237499237}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37366390228271484}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3601401150226593}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13980194926261902}, {"body": "Every stock market crash occurred when the general investing public believed the bull market was never ending.
