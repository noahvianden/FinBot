Debt expenses are tax deductible, but current earning aren\u2019t, so by reinvesting your current earnings and using debt to finance dividends you actually create a tax shield for yourself, saving money for the company by paying less in taxes and earning more in the long run by reinvesting in ventures that will exceed the interest costs of the debt.\n\nIf you want to learn more I\u2019d read into the Modigliani-Miller Theorem; its really interesting stuff on capital structure!\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani%E2%80%93Miller_theorem\n\nFree cash flow is certainly a financial indicator.

What other studio is producing this amount of consistent medium grade quality?  People will go to Disney for the blockbuster shit, but you can't just live off Star Wars and Marvel. People want some normal shows.  What is the actual competitor?  We'll see what Apple can do but their lineup so far looks pretty meh.  Amazon Prime seems to be more of a threat than anything, shrug.
