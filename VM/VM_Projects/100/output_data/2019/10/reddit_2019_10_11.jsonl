Invest steadily every month in an index fund;\n2. Don\u2019t day or swing trade, with one exception (see below);\n3. Get in at the right time (low price) and get out at the right time (high price);\n4. Be very patient. In my experience, long-term investing delivers superior returns to short-term trading, which delivers superior returns to day trading, which usually results in growing losses;\n5. Look for companies that won\u2019t go away, and that are priced low as the result of bad news;\n6. Don\u2019t rely on financial advisors and economists. They\u2019re frauds. All of them. They don\u2019t know what the market will do any better than you or I do;\n7. Don\u2019t panic sell. You have to buy strong companies. Once you do, no matter what, never sell, until you retire and need the money. You\u2019ll be glad (and wealthy);\n8. Don\u2019t even think about investing in IPO\u2019s. It\u2019s too dangerous. You need a few quarters of financial statements to figure out what\u2019s going on, to be able to make informed decisions.\n\nRelated to 2, the exception is to generate money in an emergency, if you\u2019re truly desperate (and fearless). It can be done, but it\u2019s a full-time job and not much fun. And even if you\u2019re successful, you need around $30k to do it (preferably $50k, because of the time that it takes to \u201csettle\u201d a trade, before the money is available again), and you might realistically make $50 or $100 per day. The people who claim that they made $1k or more per day don\u2019t tell you about their losses. It does no good to make $1k and lose $3k.  \n\n\nThat said, if you want to trade short-term, you need familiarity with the market sectors and the major players within them, the state of the overall economy, and specific industries. For example, most people think about investing in tech, but don\u2019t know anything about, say, copper. Well, there\u2019s a cooper company, FCX, that I made $1,400 on (before short-term capital gains tax) in the past two days. I noticed that it was trading at around $8.50/share, a multi-year low, two days ago. I knew that copper demand was expected to increase steadily over the next five years. I also knew that 50% of copper is imported by China. People were terrified of the China trade problems, so they sold FCX. This is just the type of situation that attracts me. I saw FCX\u2019s trading range over the past year, and that it was also trading at the lowest possible point during the day that I bought it, so I threw $10k on it (my usual amount is between $10k and $20k). The next day, it gained around 7%. Today it gained 6%. I could sell, but that would be dumb. If you hold on to a stock for 366 days, the long-term capital gains tax rate is much lower than the short-term (less than a year) rate, and I know (unless we have a serious recession) that it\u2019s going to go way, way up in one year. I\u2019m actually hoping to double my money, or come close, so I\u2019m going to wait patiently, especially knowing how high FCX is capable of trading. Remember 4, above. Even making 30% or 40% would be pretty good.\n\nIt\u2019s important to find companies that others are ignoring. For example, NVDA crashed about two months ago or so. Relative to its absolute trading range, as well as where it was trading on the particular day that I bought it, I decided to throw $15k on it. Lots of online articles argued that NVDA was terrible to invest in. Three days after I bought it, NVDA held its quarterly earnings call and reported much better than expected earnings. The price per share shot up by 20%, then declined, and as you can see now, it\u2019s on a tear. So far, I\u2019m up by 21.5%. I fully expect it to break $200/share, and go much higher over the long haul. I\u2019m holding out for $300/share or more. I just wish that I\u2019d bought a lot, lot more of it.\n\nAAL and SAVE seem like no-brainers to me, for similar reasons to FCX. Both airlines have real, tangible assets, and they\u2019re trading low on their absolute range. If you\u2019re patient, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money. MDB is my main tech play, but I\u2019m also in WDAY, FB, and AMZN. The trick is to not buy unless the current share price reflects that the company is undervalued. At least, that has worked for me. \n\nI guess that you could say that I\u2019m a very patient value investor with an opportunistic streak. If I see something I like, I\u2019m not afraid to pounce on it. But right now, I would be extremely cautious about investing in the market. A recession will happen, but nothing like 2008. When it does, tech stock prices could decline by 30% to 50%. The former is more likely. Right now, most companies are significantly overvalued, so with or without a recession, you\u2019re going to see a correction between 10% and 30% at least, although I can\u2019t predict when this might happen. \n\nBecause humans are so bad at predicting bottoms, buying at the right time, and selling at the right time, the best bet is to just keep investing more and more every month. Over the long haul, recessions and booming markets will average out.\n\nOne final thought: the more money that you have, the more difficult it is to make big bets, because you\u2019ve spent your life accumulating that money. You don\u2019t want to lose it. That\u2019s why, as people become millionaires, they get more conservative. In my case, you can bet that I\u2019m not going to sell AAPL and invest it on NET, for example. If forced to sell and invest the money in a single stock, I guess I\u2019d probably throw it all on AMZN at this point, since I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019ll see $3,000/share at some point in the next ten years. It\u2019s more important to not lose money than it is to make a lot of money. Just small gains compounded over a long period of time will make you a millionaire. Don\u2019t make dumb moves. Index funds are the safest bet. If you have to invest in individual stocks, be very aware of the industry and company that you\u2019re investing in, what the company\u2019s competitors are, whether that company has a real moat, and whether it\u2019s able to grow its cash and be increasingly profitable. \n\nAnd remember: even if you could beat the S&P 500 by doing this, you\u2019d have to spend so much time reading and analyzing companies that it would become a full-time job, it would stress you out, and you\u2019d have a lot less time to spend with the people who really matter, or on doing things that you love. Money is important. It buys freedom. But freedom has a price.

In the course of managing a project, a powerful executive befriended me, and I wound up working for him for twelve years. He became one of my best friends, and his kindness enabled me to start a tiny company. I didn\u2019t know anything about investing, so after asking a bunch of people at work, I finally found a financial planner I liked, and gave him all of my money to manage. The bad news is that a year after I did that, the Great Recession (2008) came. The good news is that that\u2019s when I bought AAPL, and the money never stopped coming in, so I had more and more to invest. \n\nBecause I figured that my money was safe with this financial planner, I never really monitored it too closely. Big mistake. He consistently underperformed the S&P 500, in the name of risk management. Ha. I finally fired him, and took control of things myself. At first, I didn\u2019t have the faintest clue what was going on. He had purchased a couple of dozen mutual funds and some individual stocks. It was a mess. In my defense, he was supposed to be the expert. I didn\u2019t understand finance, company valuation, and all of that stuff. Anyway, I wound up getting an MBA, and very slowly started to get a handle on how the market actually works.\n\nThere\u2019s so much contradictory information out there that it\u2019s hard to make sense of it all, and it can paralyze you and prevent you from investing in anything. The place to start is with index funds. This is often-repeated, solid advice. If you have a long time horizon, like 30 years, just throw as much money as you can into an index fund each month, and don\u2019t touch it until you retire. I can\u2019t emphasize how important that is.\n\nAnother (perhaps controversial) suggestion that I have is to never hire anyone to manage your money. Learn to do it yourself. Other people will rip you off, because no one can predict what the market will do. Why pay someone thousands of dollars each year (often as a percentage of total capital invested) to \u201cmanage\u201d (that is, mismanage) your money? It\u2019s not hard to just throw your money into an index fund. Or just use betterment.com or something like it, or vanguard.com. \n\nI learned how to invest and trade very slowly and haltingly. I do a lot of things to prepare, but I also know that even the best preparation can\u2019t dictate to a particular stock how it should behave. The best plan could always be wrong in its assumptions about what will happen. So, you need to learn to make reasonable statistical bets over a long period of time.\n\nOne thing that I noticed is that in my limited experience, it seemed as if I made the most money on very long-term investments, less money on shorter-term (e.g. one-year) investments, and the least money when I day- or short-term (i.e. with a duration of a few days to a few weeks) traded. Also, the shorter the time horizon, the greater the risk. I started subscribing to various websites, such as fool.com, seekingalpha.com, the Linde Equity Report, and some others. I ditched everything except for SeekingAlpha.\n\nI read articles online (e.g. on investopedia.com), or parts of books, and I watched videos and tried to educate myself as best as I could, even though I don\u2019t feel particularly comfortable in finance. (My strength is linguistic rather than quantitative, but at the same time, you don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist.) The good news is that all of the data that you need is freely available. I mostly use Yahoo Finance and SeekingAlpha, as well as the iOS app that I mentioned, StockPro. (I use Schwab to invest.)\n\nEven then, I really didn\u2019t know what I was doing. There was just too much information. I felt overwhelmed. I\u2019d look at the various websites/newsletters that I subscribe to, see what their recommendations were, and rejected most of them. My background is in tech, so those are the stocks that I tend to drift to. The other problem that I had with really long-term investments is that it\u2019s just too long of a time horizon. I like to plan annually and have a scorecard, to compare expectations against reality and not kid myself that I\u2019m some investing genius. I\u2019m constantly learning, and trying hard, just like everyone else. \n\nI noticed that most of the recommendations that people made either were flat-out bad bets, or only made modest gains. It\u2019s dangerous to follow fool.com for 30 years and risk underperforming the S&P 500, because that could cost you a great retirement. So, it really comes down to this. Either you can find a way to consistently beat the S&P 500\u2013I mean, *really* beat it\u2014or you shouldn\u2019t even try, and just invest in index funds every month, cost-averaging your way to retirement. And don\u2019t forget this:\n\nhttps://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/\n\nWould you really make a \u201cHail Mary\u201d bet that you\u2019re going to be able to do better than 95% of active fund managers, all of whom (supposedly) know the ins and outs of finance and investing? I wouldn\u2019t. A lot of my money is in index funds. If 95% of financial planners/advisors give bad advice\u2014advice that underperforms the S&P 500\u2013why would you pay them for advice? \n\nStill, I understand the strong desire that most people have to \u201cmake a killing.\u201d I guess my AAPL purchase is an example, but that could well have been a once-in-a-lifetime bit of great luck, kind of like winning a small lottery. You can\u2019t count on that ever happening. \n\nI have this opportunistic streak in my personality, and kind of like to play the Stock Market Game. In fact, I\u2019ve thought about starting something to do with social investing\u2014getting a small group of people together, studying and learning together, and investing (wisely). I can wait ten (or thirty) years if I have to, but it\u2019s nice to see a stock that you buy appreciate by 20% two days later, right? So I had most of my money invested in index and other types of funds, but I took around $30k, divided it up, and started small-scale experimental investing. To my very great surprise, I made a much greater gain than the S&P 500 over the same period, but because I didn\u2019t invest all that much money, I didn\u2019t make very much, even if the percentage gains were impressive.\n\nBecause of the opportunistic streak, I like to take some small part of my portfolio, say $100k [edit: okay, $179k, but who\u2019s counting?] (but only when the market is clearly in an uptrend, and there\u2019s no risk of a significant recession) and \u201cplay\u201d with it. So I happened to notice that FCX somehow drove into a ditch, and figured that copper demand isn\u2019t going to go away (unlike SAP, for example, which could be, and is being, displaced), so what the heck? Why not throw $10k on it, since it\u2019s trading at a multi-year low, and see what happens? I knew that if I waited long enough, I wouldn\u2019t lose money on it, and I\u2019d probably make a better return than the S&P 500, so why not go for it? If there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m talented at, it\u2019s finding the local minimum (low point) of a stock. I seem to have a knack for that. It\u2019s not perfect, but pretty good. So, I buy. A lot of the time, the price immediately declines, as if the stock market had been watching me, just waiting for me to buy so that it could race to $0. And, like everyone else, I freak out, second-guess myself, call myself an idiot, tell myself I\u2019ll never do that again, etc. And then, something surprising happens, e.g. unexpectedly strong quarterly results, or a trade agreement with China, etc. (Negative events can happen, too, but I see those as buying opportunities in otherwise strong companies.)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Part 2 of 3\n\nOr I noticed that AAL took a dive, so I educated myself about the airline industry, saw that AAL was trading much lower than its all-time high, and much lower than its competitors.

BUY! <click>\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said that I investigated all of the nuances of the financial statements. A cursory look on Yahoo Finance, and reading news about AAL, as well as understanding how the economy is doing overall and knowing my time horizon was really all that it took. I don\u2019t believe for a second that I\u2019ll lose money on AAL. \n\nNow, consider something like OSTK. There was an internal scandal, and the stock price raced toward $0. Would I buy it now? No. Why? Sure, it\u2019ll probably double, triple, and quadruple, if you have ten years to wait, but I could make a much better return elsewhere. I plan on an annual basis, but I constantly check my assumptions every single day. It\u2019s not good enough to believe that AMZN will trade at $4,000/share at some vague, unspecified date far in the future. I want to know a concrete ROI number that I can realistically make in one year, for each security that I own, and keep a scorecard to see how I actually did, so that I can either improve my methods or give up and keep everything in index funds.\n\nI can tell you what my method is\u2014if you\u2019d like to call it that\u2014but I urge you to not worry about how I do it, and find what\u2019ll work for you. I don\u2019t know anything about real estate, but you might know a lot about it. I do know a lot about tech, and a lot of other people might not. I think it\u2019s good to play to your strengths and invest in what you understand (at least, to some degree). My method is pretty simple, and nothing new. \n\nI look for profitable, hopefully growing companies, that are undervalued, but nevertheless have a real and sustainable moat, and (ideally, at least) I very cautiously buy them. If I put $1k down, and it goes south, so what? But if it goes in the right direction, I\u2019d consider putting $10k down, or perhaps $20k. Sometimes I feel really confident, as I did with NVDA and FCX, and just pounced with everything right away instead of gradually buying into them. Then, I wait, and try not to worry too much. (I always fail.) Sometimes I get busy with other things, forget about a particular stock, return to it in a year, and see that I\u2019m up 67%. At that point I say, \u201cWhatever happens from here, even if it quadruples, my goal was just to make 40% in 366 days, and I\u2019ve exceeded that, so I\u2019m selling. Thanks!\u201d And I SELL. <click> Then I move on to the next one.\n\nKeep in mind that most investors are in it for the long haul. A great idea would be to set up an account at Vanguard, and just keep giving them money every month. They\u2019ll take care of you over the course of 30 or 40 years, if you have that kind of runway. But if you\u2019re either desperate, or hell-bent on outperforming the market and getting rich quickly, you really have to make a commitment to learn a whole lot. Basically, investing would need to become your (second) full-time job.\n\nWithout taking you through my (ideal, which I don\u2019t always practice) process, it would be difficult to explain everything that I do. I think by \u201cdisciplined\u201d you probably mean patient. :) I can be disciplined if I could only find another AAPL (or a dozen AAPL\u2019s at $16/share!), but I prefer to make lots of money quickly, and grow it, and grow it, and grow it. But I\u2019m also realistic. Sometimes you just can\u2019t make money in the stock market, and no one else can, either, because it\u2019s declining like it did in 2008. I know how to make money in bull markets. They make everyone look like a genius. But I really don\u2019t know what to do in sideways-moving markets, and I\u2019m positively terrified of bear markets given my current situation (a huge stockpile of cash and all kinds of economic warning signs, with an unstable lunatic in the White House). \n\nTo make up for these failings, I rely on other people, such as an economist that I know, for their assessment of economic and stock market conditions. I don\u2019t mind admitting that I\u2019m very scared and cautious right now. I\u2019m worried that something is going to happen that\u2019ll hit the labor market first. Unemployment will rise just a little. People will notice and start to freak out. Consumer spending will go down, taking corporate profits with it. Then, there will be a systemic decline in stock prices. My guess is that it\u2019ll be between 10% and 30%, or more if accompanied by a recession. \n\nWhy do I think this? I watch certain stock market price movements very closely, on a daily basis. It\u2019s almost like a form of meditation for me. Anyway, I remember a few months ago when Drumpf was firing shots at China. One day, the market would be green across the board. The next day, it looked like Armageddon had come. Two days later, green again. How can you trade in *that*, unless you get really lucky? \n\nMostly, I learned how to trade, and invest, in a trial-by-error fashion, except that the \u201cerrors\u201d often turned out into successes because we were in an amazing bull market. That\u2019s not true anymore, so please do what everyone says that we should do: invest every month in index funds. It really is the very best bet, unless you\u2019re somewhat crazy, like me, and have enough cash to play with so that if you lost it all, you\u2019d still have a roof over your head.\n\nI want to say this one more time. I\u2019ve seen so many kids (I\u2019m in my forties, BTW, and not done being young yet :) ) open RobinHood accounts, try day trading, and lose everything. Many even got themselves into debt because they used margin, which is insane, IMHO. Please don\u2019t do that. Like Warren Buffett says, investing is very boring. Index funds. Index funds. Index funds. \n\nSo, with my play money, it really is like playing a game. If you don\u2019t mind reading, using FinViz to screen for stocks, looking up some numbers on Yahoo Finance, and if you can tolerate staring at Excel for hours at a time and comparing things, the chances are pretty good that you can learn to make good bets. Even if you\u2019re wrong 40% of the time, if the 60% make a lot of money relative to how much the 40% lose, you\u2019ll do well. I guess you have to have the right type of personality to be willing to tolerate small losses in order to chase big gains. This isn\u2019t easy. No one likes losing a penny. We all wind up selling things just before they skyrocket. But that\u2019s why I have this theory that the stock market is sentient, and determined to do the inverse of whatever my brain decides, right after I press BUY or SELL.\n\nOne note of caution: if you use Schwab, and look at their ratings system (\u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d), and actually pay attention to them, IMHO you won\u2019t do very well. My biggest winners have been rated \u201cF,\u201d \u201cD,\u201d and \u201cC.\u201d I\u2019m personally convinced that if Schwab rates something an \u201cF,\u201d and it\u2019s trading at a historic low, that\u2019s a sure way to make a killing! (Just kidding, but not by much. :) )\n\nInvest as much money as possible every month in an index fund, and if you have $30k to play around with and an adventurous personality that isn\u2019t (too) afraid of losses, read some books and educate yourself about identifying individual stocks, and how to trade options. (Stay away from options until you\u2019ve got a good handle on stocks, preferably after a few years of success, or you could lose a LOT of money.)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Part 3 of 3\n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Buy low, wait a long time, and sell high (hopefully). Know that some of your bets will fail. Don\u2019t hang on to losers, but do hang on to winners. Invest for at least ten years. Don\u2019t overtrade. Read SeekingAlpha articles and be diligent about learning from others who know a lot and have been investing for decades with success, through recessions and bull markets. Have clear goals for yourself. Don\u2019t be vague. Keep a scorecard. Know where you stand every quarter, and certainly every year. Modify your approach as necessary. Most importantly, DON\u2019T LOSE CAPITAL! That means that in bear markets, guard your money. Make use of government bonds, or a large cash position. Wait for the right opportunity. Sometimes not acting is the best action. \n\nTo wrap this up, I estimate that my average gain on stocks that I\u2019ve painstakingly (and sometimes on the spur of the moment) picked has been about 35% in one year. But again, that was during the bull market. I always target at least 30%, and hope for 50% or more. The only problem is that it\u2019s usually very hard to identify those stocks. It takes a lot of time and effort, and patience. And sometimes you pick the wrong one. Guard your capital if things go south, and don\u2019t be afraid to sell if one of your fundamental assumptions proves to be wrong. There will always be other opportunities. No one makes money every time.\n\nI have two other suggestions. First, set up an account with a brokerage that\u2019ll let you \u201cpaper trade.\u201d Then, give it a shot. See how you do, before you invest any real money. Learn how it all works, and know that it might take a year of very dedicated study and asking questions to start to form the faintest concept about how to invest with any confidence. Second, remember that even Nobel laureates in economics can\u2019t tell you how the market will do over the next year. Fortunes aren\u2019t made overnight, usually, but over the course of decades. Roll the bowling ball down the middle of the alley; play the percentage game to knock down as many pins as possible by investing consistently in index funds, and you\u2019ll be set for life by the time that you retire.

Those assumptions could always prove to be wrong. Wall Street analysts often revise their 1-year forecasts for a company\u2019s share price when conditions change, and they can change quite unexpectedly.\n\nTo me, trading is about the trader making money as quickly as possible. It\u2019s like scalping other people\u2019s money when they make wrong guesses. Investing is about putting money into a company, as a strategic asset, over the long haul, to enable it to acquire additional assets and, through operations, generate ever greater revenue and profits. When you build a portfolio of stocks, you\u2019re building a machine\u2014hopefully an amplifier with a huge gain, as electrical engineers would say. Investing means oiling the pistons of the engine of that machine to keep it humming.\n\nI only rarely day trade. I don\u2019t like doing it at all, and it\u2019s a whole lot of effort and stress for very little reward. I have a friend who does it a lot more often than me, and I often ask him: Nick, why are you making hundreds of trades per year to chase $100 in after-tax profit when I invested the same capital in LGIH, sat on my arse for a year, and made a > 60% profit? It seems to me that the latter method is a lot easier and much more profitable than day trading. \n\nSometimes, when something unusual happens, like TSLA dropping by 10% in a single day for no particularly good reason, I might throw $10k on it and try to make $500 before short-term capital gains tax. I did that twice, under similar conditions. What actually happened? Instead of making $500, or even $50, I made $1, both times! After the first time, I swore I\u2019d never touch TSLA again. I was convinced that I\u2019d lose money and barely averted it. The second time, I\u2019d forgotten about not touching TSLA, and went for it. Ironically, had I hung on for just 24 more hours, I\u2019d have made $1k. Instead, I got out with $1. Still, that\u2019s much better than a loss. \n\nI\u2019d tell friends whenever I day traded, it was just for lunch money (and it really was). But I had a backup plan. I\u2019d only attempt a day trade if the company was one that I wouldn\u2019t mind buying at the current price level and holding for ten years. So, if something went wrong with the attempted day trade, I\u2019d just \u201clet it ride,\u201d and move on. I can only do this because I have a lot of cash on hand. I realize that many people don\u2019t really have that option. Also, personally, other than for the \u201cexcitement\u201d (translation: stress), day trading is frankly a dumb and very risky way to try to make money. It\u2019s long-term investing that makes people wealthy. You have to be patient, and either pick the right stocks (which is almost impossible), or consistently put more money into an index fund every month for 30 or 40 years and not touch it until you retire. I wish that there were some insight or secret, but there really isn\u2019t. Investing is, and should be, boring. Day trading may be a lot more exciting, but at what cost\u2014losing all of your money?\n\nHaving a background in finance won\u2019t help you much in the stock market, in my opinion. It\u2019s not that hard. Anyone can learn to read financial statements and evaluate the most important fundamentals. It\u2019s just not all that exciting, unless you really like that sort of thing. (I don\u2019t, particularly.) Every investor is making a statistical bet that over the long haul, the market will rise, and compounding will generate wealth.\n\nRegarding technicals, in my opinion, there is no such thing as an \u201cindicator,\u201d and there certainly is no such thing as a \u201cpattern,\u201d unless you believe that you can see Jesus in a burrito (https://www.buzzfeed.com/arielknutson/people-who-found-jesus-in-their-food). There\u2019s only the price action. Everything else is just another way of viewing the price action. There\u2019s nothing that you can learn from a so-called indicator that you can\u2019t identify by looking at the price action in real time. What matters is the price action, the volume, the news affecting either the general economy or the specific industry group or individual company (supply chain dependencies are important, too), how the market is doing overall (red or green), and quarterly reports. All of those factors will affect price action, but volume and hype or bad (or good) news tends to have a greater impact on share price fluctuations with regard to day trading. \n\nIf you want to fight against other investors and the machines (algos that day trade) possibly a dozen times each trading day to make $50 after short-term capital gains tax, good luck. I\u2019d rather put down $10k on a single stock and wait a year, with the goal of doubling my money by sitting on my arse.\n\nDifferent companies have different price movement \u201csignatures.\u201d Some hardly move, such as FCX. Others are schizophrenic, like TSLA. If you want to day trade, find the companies whose signatures make some sense to you. If the price fluctuations occur too rapidly, you won\u2019t have enough time to react, and you\u2019ll stand a much greater chance, statistically, of losing rather than making money.\n\nI wish you good luck!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You're not doubling your money in a year by sitting on one stock unless you're extremely lucky with some biotech shit or something. 100% gainers (outside of options) are rare.\n\nThere are absolutely patterns in stocks.

I'll paste it for you.\n\n++++++\n\n**Know when to fold 'em: Foolish selling principles for long-term investors**\n\nBy Ron Gross and Andy Cross\n\nOne of the most common questions our analysts get from member Fools is: **How do I know when to sell a stock?**\n\nOur chief investment officer, Andy Cross, and our director of value investing, Ron Gross, talked through their answers at a recent member event. Here's an edited version of that conversation.\n\n**Andy Cross:** There's an investing adage on Wall Street saying: \"There are numerous reasons to sell a stock, but there's really only one reason to buy it \u2014 because you think it's going higher.\" But selling is a little bit more nuanced.\n\n**Ron Gross:** Let's talk about some **misconceptions about selling** before we get into the real reasons why we think it'd be fair to sell.\n\n**Bad reason 1: \"The stock market correction is coming\"**\n\n**Ron:** I don't know about you, but my crystal ball has been broken for quite some time. And if history has taught us anything, it's that it's pretty much impossible to correctly predict the stock market. You'll see someone who says, \"The market is way too high. Move to cash.\" Then the next year, the stock market is up 20%. That's a very painful decision, not only because of transaction costs but because of capital gains taxes that could be triggered if it's in a nonretirement account.\n\nAnd statistics show that \u2014 you can pick your period of time from 5 to 20 years \u2014 **a fair amount of returns are based on a small amount of days.**Days where the stock market has had a significant run-up. And if you happen to be out of the market on just a handful of those days, you will significantly underperform the S&amp;P 500. My crystal ball just doesn't tell me when to get in and get out on the proper days, so it behooves us all to stay invested for the long term.\n\n**Bad reason 2: \"I'm losing money\" / \"I'm making money\"**\n\n**Andy:** I hear this from friends and family members all the time. \"Bought a stock at $26 three weeks ago, and now it's at $23. I think I'm getting out. I have a floor price I put in; I'm losing money and I'm going to sell the stock.\"\n\n**Ron:** The stock **market doesn't care what price you paid for a stock**, by the way. All of your future returns in any stock you own will be based on the future. None of it will be based on the past, so you have to evaluate where you are today, or a stock price is today, and where the company goes from here. The past is irrelevant to all investment decisions.\n\nThe same thing goes for \"I'm making money.\" Just because you're up on a stock doesn't mean you'll continue to go up. Doesn't mean you'll go down. Doesn't indicate anything, really, because that, again, is based on the past, and the past is over. You have to look to the future for all investment returns.\n\n**Bad reason 3: \"I'll just get back to break-even and then I'm going to sell\"**\n\n**Ron:** That doesn't work. Usually what's going on is that the company is doing something that is not going well, and you're just hanging on because you hate the concept of taking a loss. What ends up happening is**you often end up taking a bigger loss** because the company isn't operating appropriately.\n\nTaking a loss can be painful. Psychology shows us that it's more painful than the benefits of a gain, but sometimes it's necessary if you're not feeling right about where a company is going.\n\n**Bad reason 4: \"The company cut its dividend\"**\n\n**Ron:** Paying a dividend is a capital allocation decision by the board of directors and the management team. Most of us like a nice dividend, and when it gets cut, usually a stock will take a hit because there's usually a reason for it.\n\nIf it is a good reason \u2014 if it is a capital allocation decision that makes sense (a company should really do it to shore up its balance sheet, or a company needs to retain more cash, at least for the time being) \u2014 that's a smart decision. It might be painful in the short term, but it's smart.\n\nIf a company decides it wants to go into acquisition mode and needs more cash on its balance sheet, then, again, it's a smart time to cut. Just the **knee-jerk reaction of a dividend cut should not be a reason to sell.** You have to look under the hood to see why management is doing so.\n\n**Bad reason 5: \"My stop-loss order kicked in\"**\n\n**Andy:** We're not fans of those, typically. We don't think this is a good way to buy and exit stocks \u2014 to set prices like that \\[where brokerage actions\\] kick in if a stock goes below a certain price. Try not to use them. There are better ways to buy and sell your stocks, including options. We're not big fans of a stop-loss order.\n\n**Ron:** In my hedge fund days, I never used stop-loss orders because I wanted to be in control of every investment decision. I didn't want anything to happen automatically, and if you have a stop-loss order, **you could get sold out of a stock when you really didn't want that to happen.**\n\nVery often, we'll see a headline come out in the morning that a stock is down 10% before the market opens. Then the market opens with the stock down 10-12%. But then the company holds a conference call an hour later, and the stock comes back because the news wasn't as bad as the headline indicated ... but you've already been stop-lossed out of that company. You're like, \"Darn, I really shouldn't have sold that.\"\n\n**Part 2 in next comment**", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "**Part 2**\n\n**The bottom line on selling**\n\n**Andy:** The simple truth is **you make more money buying and holding than you do buying and trading.** Individual investors trade way too much. But if you buy correctly, selling hopefully takes care of itself \u2014 meaning you don't have to worry about it so much if you have the right framework. The goal we set for the Fool's Partnership Portfolio is 6X/10Y, trying to identify companies that have the potential to earn 6x their value over the next 10 years. That's about a 20% annualized return.\n\nMultibaggers can be game-changing, and it's really painful to sell out of a stock that goes on to generate multibagger returns. They can really change your portfolio and your life. Don't sell \u2014 or at least aim to sell very rarely.\n\nAnd ... there's a big, old \"but.\" **There are times and reasons to sell**, so let's get to it.\n\n**Selling makes good sense if ...**\n\n**The fundamentals of the company have changed.** If the underlying business has deteriorated or you believe it will, that's certainly a reason to look at not owning that company. This could be revenues, margins, or profit declining, or now there's a loss at the company. Any of those reasons could indicate that profit could be coming down in the future \u2014 it may not be a company you want to own.\n\n**The competitive landscape has changed.** Think twice if a new competitor comes into a marketplace or an existing competitor ends up having the upper hand. If you own a company that is not going to be grabbing market share in the future and its share is going to continue to deteriorate, that will hit the fundamentals, and that will hit profit.\n\n**A platform shift threatens your investment.** You've heard of Kodak. That was a company that did not benefit from a shift. We're talking about big, trending ideas. Paradigm-shifting trends would be good if we could all recognize them. Sometimes we recognize these a little late, but still better late than never!\n\n**You need your money in the next three years.** In this case, your portfolio should not be fully invested. It's inappropriate, in our opinion, to have all your money in the market in this situation because you will not have the time to weather a severe correction, which inevitably will come. That's our best advice for that.\n\n**A position becomes too large.** \"Too large\" is in the eye of the beholder. For some, that's 5-7%. For others, think above 10%. If a stock became more than 10% of your portfolio, would you be okay with that? And from the perspective of letting your winners run, hopefully those stocks naturally gravitate and make up more and more of your portfolio, and the losers make up less and less. That's what you want to see. Warren Buffett has talked about this, too. Those big stocks make up a larger and larger percentage of your portfolio, but it really is down to each individual investor and what you feel comfortable with.\n\n**You find a better opportunity.** If you are managing a fixed portfolio (not adding money to it), you ideally want it to be full of your best ideas at all times. And if you're fortunate to uncover a great idea, you may have to make a tough decision to sell your worst idea \u2014 even though you may still like it \u2014 to free up capital for the new opportunity.\n\n**You need to rebalance.** This largely is based on your life experience where, let's say, as you're getting older, you don't want as much exposure to stocks. Bonds may be appropriate. Cash may be appropriate. Alternative vehicles other than stocks may make sense to you. In those circumstances, rebalancing (reducing your position in stocks and increasing your position in other types of investments) may be necessary. It may help you sleep at night. It may optimize your returns better for your stage of life.\n\n**You disagree with the ethics of the company.** At The Motley Fool, we try not to put our ethics into our recommendations, because everyone is different, but I do encourage you to take your ethics and morality into account when building your portfolio. It's perfectly acceptable to take your own ethics into account, and if something changes about the way a company does business \u2014 and you don't like it \u2014 it may be time to say good-bye.\n\nAnd finally ...\n\n**You need to put your investing dollars to use.** We invest to make money for ourselves \u2014 for our future, our families. So if you need that money for some reason (your family income situation has changed, or you want to buy a home), you're going to have to sell some stocks. Even David Gardner did a few years ago when he was switching homes! (He told members about it, of course.) If you need to use the money, most likely you'll have to sell some stocks. And that's okay!

When a guy posts +45k gain everyone for some reason assumes he turned 100 bucks to 45k. Without knowing the % gain +45k is a meaningless number that might indicate 3% gain. Also with premium selling the gain is not telling the full story, we need to take into account the collateral. If the guy is selling naked options and makes enough money it means his account is very likely over 100k to begin with. If we calculate the gain % properly without drolling over 45k gains his story won't be nearly as impressive as you imagine, I guarantee it.\n\nSo how I ended up losing money. Firstly I picked TSLA because the premium was high. I figured high premium makes the most sense for selling premium. But guess what, the premium is high for a reason, you will have to deal with wild 3% swings on a random day, and boy it swings. I was selling 1-2 weeks out put spreads, usually risking around 2500 to gain 500 (this is delta -0.3). I also tried selling naked couple times, but with the cash account collateral requirements this was just pennies. The problem is it can blow through your \"safe\" strikes in 2 days no problem. It went against me just 3 times where I lost almost full collateral amount, but with 1 to 5 win to loss ratio 3 losses wipe out 15 successful bets (which I didn't even have, I think I won maybe like 5 times before that).\n\nNow before you say \"you can just keep rolling it until you win\". This is usually coming from people who never actually tried rolling anything, it's not as easy. Rolling is nothing more than selling for a full loss and opening even worse position than before to cover your loss, digging yourself into the hole deeper, both losing time and lowering your chances for success.\n\nAnyway, selling TSLA was the last drop. I tried selling premium on other stocks before (safe stocks, safe strikes, 30+ days out, etc) and always ended up losing at the end or gaining pennies. I switched to buying ITM and it finally feels like odds are not against me. For the hell of it I tried buying ITM on TSLA, I thought it was the dumbest choice because of high premiums, but guess what, haven't lost once yet. Now I am thinking maybe high premium options are actually better for buying than for selling, want to test this theory once the dust settles a little from current trade wars.\n\nNow theta gang will tell you how I just don't know what I am doing, that with selling premium you are the casino, etc.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry to hear about your loss.
