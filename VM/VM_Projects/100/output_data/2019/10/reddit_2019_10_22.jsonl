(it is expense for giving people stock grants and options that requires no cash payment by the company)\n\nCash flow Statement is divided into three categories: Operating, Investing, and Financing.  \n\nOperating is basically all the business functions.  So you take your net income, add back non-cash items that were baked in that net income number, and then add in changes in working capital.  Changes in working capital  include things like inventory build and whether or not you collected more/less AR than you sold for the period.  \n\nInvesting is for things you invested in.  The biggest number for Tesla is purchase of CapEx (buildings/machines).  \n\nFinancing is all the stuff that reflects how you finance the company.  So paydown of debt, taking out new debt, selling stock etc.  Note that interest expense goes in the operating section because that is part of the servicing of the business.  \n\nThe easiest way to calculate free cash flow is just take the cash flow from Operatings (first section) and then deducting CapEx.  Think of Cash from Operations as \"how much cash did I make/spend to run my business\"... but since we excluded depreciation as a non-cash item, that isn't really fair... after all that stuff really does cost cash!  So basically for free cash flow we deduct current capex spend (located in investing section).  \n\nSo cash from ops minus capex.  \n\nOne thing I like to consider is taking out the \"change in working capital\" section of free cash flow.  Speicially Q2 2019 Tesla sold a lot of vehicles out of inventory.  The opposite was true in Q1.  So if you look they invested 800M in inventory in Q1 and then took out 500M in Q2.  That really swings FCF and makes it look very lumpy.  But realistically that's a short term fluctuation.

It's very tempting to buy options before earnings reports, but each earnings report is really just a volatility event triggered by a handful of unknown numbers becoming known. No one, without at least tens of thousands of dollars of data, is any better at predicting these unknown numbers and translating them into actual stock price movements than a random number generator (over time). Many people, however, have been successful at identifying exceptional companies and investing in/against them for more extended periods of time. You can still have an exciting portfolio using leverage/options, but IMO with a higher success rate over time than gambling on a dozen companies you only understand at a surface level.

The repo market stuff is standard practice, there's no change to anything, you don't understand finance!\" Seriously, fuck off.\n\nI turned bearish in the summer of 07 when I saw [Jim Cramer famously freak out at Bernanke's possibility of further rate increases](https://youtu.be/SWksEJQEYVU). People love to shit on Cramer, but that episode was really seared in my mind as an admission that things were starting to fall apart. (Cramer probably now knows better than to have such honesty with the public about financial conditions. He's probably been told not to spook the markets).\n\nIn the summer 07, markets were still booming and recession was nowhere in sight. However, the housing market started to slow and then decline in price (similar to recent declines in Seattle and San Francisco and some other markets). In summer 07, there was chatter about whether we'd get more Fed rate *increases*, very similar to the kind of chatter we heard around December 2018.\n\nA few months later in September 2007, the Fed reversed course and *cut* rates, similar to the Fed's reversal and cut in July 2019. But they continued to reassure is that the economy was very strong and that recession was unlikely. \n\nIn 2009, it was declared that the recession actually began in Q4 2007 - right around the time of the first Fed rate cut, right around the time the market hit all-time highs. Bernanke testified to Congress that there was no hint of recession - right as the recession was starting.\n\nThen in late 2007 and early 2008, there started to be news stories about mortgage losses at Countrywide Financial and Bear Stearns. That some hedge funds were blowing up, that banks were suddenly writing down $2B at a time. \n\nWhat did it mean? What were these losses? Were things contained? What does it mean when a hedge fund blows up? It was confusing as fuck. No one knew what it meant. \n\n**That's where we are now.** What does this repo stuff mean? Why aren't banks lending to each other? Is it normal? It's normal. No, it's not normal. Is it the Chinese? Is it a foreign bank going under???\n\n\n#The confusion and Fed actions we had in late 07/early 08 are similar to the confusion and Fed actions we see today.\n\nHowever, the market didn't really collapse until 6 months later, once Lehman went under. We even got a late spring rally after Bear Stearns collapsed, and it looked like we were on our way back to all-time highs!\n\nHistory doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes.

But, despite that I'm seeing a lot of odd stuff.  For example in my town where prices are a bit lower overall I've seen prices climb by a pretty good percentage, maybe 20% in many cases.  That could be fueled by all the lower-income folks that can now get mortgages.  But then in nicer towns that are much more expensive I've seen the polar opposite.  In towns you couldn't find ANYTHING in for less than $350k back in like 2012 or so (and those options were very few and there was something wrong with all of them to push the price down) I am suddenly finding a LOT more inventory and a LOT lower pricing, like $250k gives you a really good chunk of options.  That's a big difference in what entry-level was into those towns, like 1/3.  Something is fueling that uncertainly and pushing prices down on these homes.  Maybe a lot of people are downsizing or moving to cheaper homes because they're protecting themselves from a future downturn?  Don't know.  Some in my state will blame the state and the fact that a fair number of people expressed interest in moving out of it and to a lower COL state but the reality is the net numbers of people moving out of the state aren't high enough to fuel that big of a drop in value.\n\nThen there's the student loan bubble, that fucker might tank half the economy when it bursts.  That's a LOT of unsecured debt.  At least when housing blew up the banks took back actual assets.  They might have lost money on those assets, they might have sat on them years before they sold them (my house was vacant 2.5 years when I bought it), and they might have been trashed when they were taken back but at least they were worth something.  60% of original value is still better than unsecured debt.  Worse still is the government is usually the one bailing out businesses when they fail, the government is one of the biggest debt holders in this crisis.  When they take a massive hit it's going to be quite a big shock to the system as they try to print money to bail out everyone while they are still trying to right their own ship. \n\nThen there's the car loan market.  It's looking a LOT like housing in 2005-2007.  No documentation needed, zero down, you don't need a social security number, etc.  They are loaning money on rapidly depreciating assets to people that have no ability to pay.  New car dealerships are doing this with $30-40k cars and people that make $20k a year.  What's worse is most of them because their credit sucks or doesn't exist are getting 20%+ interest rates, that's a recipe for defaults.  Guess what's worse than taking back a house that lost value, how about a car that lost value.  You know that every second it sits on the lot it's losing value.  If you sit on a house long enough eventually the value will bounce back.....a Kia minivan won't.  I know a LOT of people with trash credit, low income, etc driving around in luxury cars, this will not end well.\n\nThe worst part is we have all of these possible recession triggers happening in our own borders with no outside influence.  Add trade wars on top of it and this can all go up like a powder keg.  I've been selling a lot of shares and not buying anything to replace them (except a few shares of GLD occasionally when it takes a hit).  I was going to upgrade to a nicer house but I'm waiting on that for now.  Why bother, prices in my town are going up and prices in nicer towns are dropping like a rock.

Well, if you can get the full Pell grant you can get your $13k in loans plus the Pell grant which is \\~$6k.  Everything above and beyond that is coming via private student loans or out of your pocket in cash, most people go with loans.  Without me Googling anything I can at least give you a few for-profit companies doing student loans, Chase and Discover.  AFAIK you can include private student loans in a bankruptcy so you might be able to completely get those written off, I'm not 100% on that.  And even if that's not possible you can just plain stop paying them, plenty of people have done that.  \n\nOn the federal student loans those definitely can't be included in a bankruptcy but you can just stop paying them.  Eventually, the federal government can go after you with garnishments on your wages, go after federal payments such as Social Security, lien your property, take your tax return, etc so yes they have more power to get their money back than most private agencies but if there's no money to take they are fucked.  If as part of a bubble bursting we get another economic downturn jobs will be affected and there won't be anything for the fed to go after if people aren't working.\n\nThen there's the other fun part.  When all those private loans dry up a lot of people going to more expensive schools are shit out of luck.  I was in the middle of one of my degrees during the 2008 meltdown.  Chase loaned me my first year's money no problem, I did my first year and was lining up my loans for the second year when it all went to hell.  Chase flat out told me they couldn't approve me as their lending got MUCH tighter.  Fortunately the school I was going to allowed me to float along on credit with them until I could get money elsewhere 6 months later but I almost got booted from school.  Can you imagine all those private schools if they had to boot half their students?  What would happen to them?  What would happen to their staff who suddenly would be jobless?  We're talking all the top tier schools having issues with every single student they had that wasn't getting tuition paid in cash by mom and dad.

Trump trying to pump markets pre election with rate slashes could prop up the market and make the fall worse if banks decide to put more money into market and have nothing to fall back on. Also, fed can\u2019t keep doing what it did then lowering rates, not sustainable. \n\nAfter doing this research I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to take most of my money out of market for month of January and watch from afar, if all is well, I\u2019ll put it back in, if it happens again, keeping money out of vulnerable markets.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You dont understand finance.
