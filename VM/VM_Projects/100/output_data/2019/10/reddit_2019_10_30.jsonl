The China trade war was in its relative infancy, and global weakness was only starting to become clear in the data.  \n\\- In 2018, it could easily be argued that interest rates should have been in the 4s (vs. 2%), as much of the economic data was similar to 2006.

These buyers and sellers started gathering on wall street, and then. not long after, the large players united together and agreed to only do business with one another and squeezed out the little man. This was kind of a necessary thing because it led to more uniformity in pricing. \n\nLater they entered into a building and all trading was done on the floor. They had runners who would be representing a single buyer looking for someone who was representing a single seller. If your prices matched, you executed the trade. Trades may have taken all day to be executed due to the inefficiency. If you were the buyer you may not know your order was filled for hours after the fact. \n\nThen came along market makers, who would guarantee a market for a particular stock. They would keep a book logging buyers and sellers and allowed the use of \u201cmarket orders\u201d which didn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a fixed price, but you could guarantee execution of the trade, at the best \u201cmarket\u201d price. But this was still largely done in person with pen and paper with individuals who merely represented clients. \n\nThis eventually evolved to include the use of the telephone and slowly began incorporating more modern technology that sort of came to a head with the advent of over the counter markets, rather than exchange market. New YOrk Stock Exchange. Exchange is literally a buyer and seller brought together and they exchange a stock for money. Over the counter markets allowed brokers and agents to buy from sellers and sell to buyers, and they could pocket the difference. This created far more liquidity and bid/ask spreads narrowed. Think about the NASDAQ. Wouldn\u2019t be possible/fair without real time pricing and real time order execution, using the use of super computers. Eventually this evolved to cut out agents, cut out the floor, and gave far more autonomy to the individual buyers and sellers.

That's right, he created a situation where AMD needed to lose 95% of its value or the brokerage would put him in a margin call over *covered calls*.\n\nThis is, plainly, because RH is absolutely retarded.

Technically he is operating at a loss, but this loss hasnt been realized yet because the shares have yet to be actually sold. \n\nIn the meantime, RH's system is considering the cash he made after selling the contracts AND is still considering the shares he technically sold but still retains when calculating his MBP.
