The e-sports league helped sell more copies of their game for free.\n\nBut then along the way Blizzard muscled out the 3rd parties sponsoring the e-sports and took full control of it, and paid out the prizes themselves. Instead of getting free advertising when people really liked their games and made an e-sport out of it, they turned e-sports into part of their advertising budget, and spent valuable development time focusing on making the game better for the 1% best players, and better for e-Sports viewing. The problem with that is people **don't** play games just because they're fun to watch as an e-sport. They watch e-sports **because** they love the game. Blizzard, and many other gaming companies trying to create their own e-sports leagues have it completely backwards, this is why most e-sports fail to take off in any meaningful way.\n\nAlone the above point wastes some developer time and advertising money, but it's not going to get backlash. What gets backlash is when the game fails and the developer (i.e. Blizzard) decides to pull the plug on the e-sports and cut off the funding. A lot of people took the death of Heroes of the Storm's e-sports league as a sign that Blizzard was declaring the game dead, especially when they also moved half their developers off of it. Some games fail yes, but Blizzard magnified the PR backlash by propping HOTS up with an e-sports league, and then cancelling it out of nowhere after promising everyone there would be another year of it (including mentioning that at Blizcon just a few weeks before cancelling it). And any decisions you make running your tournaments that create controversy like the Hong Kong incident, or the 'cheater' who won a Hearthstone tournament, also create more black eyes and hurt Blizzard's brand.\n\nSo essentially, ride it out, and as long as Blizzard controls their game's e-sports expect more messes like this to tarnish their name from time to time.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "How much of this thought is due to Activision than Blizzard?
