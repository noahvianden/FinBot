Is it to make a decent profit? to get super rich? to have fun? to support something good for society? Whatever your goal is, your approach should be optimized for that specific goal.\n\nAlways keep your mind open. There are tons of people who want to screw you so they can benefit financially. Follow Buffett's suggestion, stay with trustworthy people/companies. Follow Munger's suggestion, stay away from risk.\n\nDiversification is important for long term success, this is especially true if your net asset is very large. Those who are near retirement age should take risk seriously. You don't want to gamble and lose your lifetime savings. If you love gambling with stocks or options, use dividend or trading profit to gamble. This way you won't be hurt badly.\n\nStop loss is important if you have a large size in investment. The only thing that's truly downside safe is a broad index (will not hit zero).
