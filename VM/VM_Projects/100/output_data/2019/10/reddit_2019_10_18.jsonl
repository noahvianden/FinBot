The numbers are likely to be poor (unless there's some windfall FSD recognition), but there's a number of catalysts that can be talked about on the call, including guidance, that could extend the bull run. In other words, big up or big down, but like Q3 deliveries if TSLA misses expectations the downside will be a more than the potential upside because the stock has already run-up. The downside will be short-lived because they are in a LT bull trend.\n\nI'm happy if Q3 earnings causes a -8% correction because I will just buy hand-over-fist.
