{"title": "Sold a bunch of stocks to buy more TESLA (update)", "selftext": "Original (6 months old): https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bgi7zp/sold_a_bunch_of_stocks_to_buy_more_tesla/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHalf a year has passed since the post. I continued to purchase $TSLA stock throughout April and May 2019. My thesis has not changed, nor my conviction. Tesla continue to execute their plans. I am holding long-term but I wanted to provide an update, and a prediction (see further down).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust so everyone's clear: I've been acquiring Tesla stock since early 2016. It's just that 6 months ago, I found myself facepalming so hard at how much analysts, media and \"investors\" were missing or just had plain wrong. I'm an opportunistic investor. I saw opportunity but didn't have much cash so instead of buying with savings, I nuked most of my stock portfolio and bought more Tesla.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe stock is $316.73 as I type this on the back of strong Q3 results.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Results:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n|Purchased|Cost Basis|Gain/Loss|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|22-Apr-2019|$264.17|+19.90%|\n|23-Apr-2019|$262.04|+20.87%|\n|23-Apr-2019|$261.79|+20.99%|\n|24-Apr-2019|$252.63|+25.37%|\n|25-Apr-2019|$248.60|+27.41%|\n|26-Apr-2019|$234.55|+35.04%|\n|20-May-2019|$205.25|+54.32%|\n|31-May-2019|$185.41|+70.83%|\n|31-May-2019|$185.49|+70.75%|\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Predictions:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Short squeeze underway.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Q4 2019 results will be bonkers. Record everything that matters including net profit, production, deliveries, gross margins. This is so obvious it hurts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- By Q4 2020, Giga 3 should be fully ramped, Giga Europe will be under construction, annual output over 500,000, over $5 billy in the bank.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Unless Elon drops LSD with Joe Rogan very soon, this is probably the last time we'll see the stock under $300.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Stock will continue on a bumpy, upward trajectory throughout the 2020s.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't buy the stock because of this post BUT if you have questions about Tesla and why I am comfortable for that one single company to make up the majority of my stock portfolio, go for it. I'll do my best to answer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo you own $TSLA?

GM US hasn't been producing cars for a month, Uber and Lyft won't turn a profit in years. Netflix is trading at 100PE,even tho they lease most of their popular content and have insane competition coming this year.The incentive for Tesla to be profitable again is extremely high, and they were in Q3/4 what makes you think they won't be again after the China and the model Y ramp.

At the time Elon was forecasting that FSD would be feature-complete by the end of the year and the network would probably be approved 6 months later.  I knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen that fast, but I thought, and still do think, that as soon as consumers have their hands on that (no pun intended), it\u2019ll slap the big investors in the face a bit - like \u201cHey, this is happening.\u201d  Once robotaxi equations start getting factored by the buy-side analysts at the big firms - watch out.  imo, that has the potential to shoot the stock well past $700.  Maybe over $1000.  With the network approved the stock could go to $4000; I don\u2019t think Kathie Wood is in left field on this.\n\nAll that being said - I remember thinking to myself \u201cWhat if that doesn\u2019t happen at all?\u201d  My contingency was that I believed that TSLA would be at my strike price even without FSD.  At the time the stock was in the low $200s, which I knew was undervalued to start with.  There was a lot of concern about demand problems and margins at the time.  Demand I wasn\u2019t the least bit worried about, but I did think for a bit about margins.  At the time the Model 3 margin was around 19% iirc, and Elon was saying there was a lot of room for improvement, which I believed.  If nothing else through sheer economies of scale as the 3 ramped.  In addition GF3 was coming along nicely, and I knew they\u2019d be producing cars before Q1.  I think Elon had already stated a 3k/wk run-rate.  And Fremont still had room to expand.  Then there\u2019s the Model Y which is higher margin and there\u2019s tons of demand for, and GF3 which would undoubtedly produce higher-margin 3s than Fremont.  I figured investors would start to worry less about margins.  Multiply that by increased production at the same time - and there\u2019s no reason the stock wouldn\u2019t be over $400.  It would have been at $300 already if it weren\u2019t for Elon\u2019s legal troubles and Q1.  Then there\u2019s the pickup reveal, the start of Semi production, GF4, energy storage ramp, potential short squeeze, etc.  These were all items with a lot of bullish potential, and I figured any combination of a couple of those would make it easy to see $400.  So I was looking at which strikes to buy and I saw $420 and I said that\u2019s the one for me.  Picked them up for $4.69/share avg and right now I\u2019m so glad I did.

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\nI don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on.
