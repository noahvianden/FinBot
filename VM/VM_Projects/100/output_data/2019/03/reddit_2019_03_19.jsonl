As with politics, there is a tendency to dismiss the bad behavior of one's own side, while playing up the faults of the opposition.  \n\nIn the past, I have read and participated in TSLA discussions on Twitter, Tesla Motors Club, and other forums.  Twitter *is* brutal.  A good number of super-Bulls on Twitter have storehouses of Bear predictions from years past, and do not hesitate to tweet taunts with screen shots of past Bear predictions that turned out to be entirely incorrect.  However, the Bears are not entirely blameless here.  Twitter Bear personalities like Mark Spiegel, \"Tesla Charts\", and Skabooska (I don't think that's the exact handle -- it was someone who claimed to be using a drone to spy on the Fremont factory) have made plenty of incendiary posts, including a good number that turned out to be false or maliciously misleading. \n\nTesla Motors Club was also a regular target of Bear accounts.  I stopped posting there after it became apparent that the owners of the site were either overwhelmed by the volume of traffic, or simply no longer gave a shit about the rampant trolling.  Some people who were openly Bearish in the investors sub there, would go into the owners' subs and actively spread lies and misinformation about Tesla products to prospective buyers, presumably to discourage demand.  Many would openly lie, and post information in direct contradiction to published quarterly delivery and financial results.  I saw it all: everything from subtle concern trolling to blatantly profane insults from Bear accounts.  \n\nAt first, I believed that this was a matter of financial interest, but it's become much more than that.\n\nThe TSLA debate is no longer IMO about money.  It is about ego, and people fearing total humiliation in public.  The uncertainty around Tesla feeds this.  The company has survived a global financial meltdown that should have killed it, and survived many botched product launches, yet its continued rise is far from assured.  People who have made solid and fervent declarations on what they \"know\" will happen (when they actually cannot possibly know the outcome), have a lot of credibility on the line.  In the end, reputations will be ruined and credibility destroyed, but we don't know who will suffer this fate.  People are *scared*.

They! Are! Not! Elon Musk literally said on television that he was not going to have a lawyer pre-approve his tweets! He further clarified that the reason he was not going to do this, even though it was arguably required by the terms of his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, was that \u201cI do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them.\u201d The fact that he then tweeted without getting his tweets pre-approved is the least surprising event in the history of the capital markets, and I guarantee you that the SEC is not surprised. They don\u2019t even really say that they\u2019re stunned. They say that it\u2019s \u201cstunning.\u201d Very different. It\u2019s stunning, sure, but no one, at this point, is stunned.\n\n>Anyway here is the SEC\u2019s latest filing in its effort to get Musk held in contempt of court for tweeting stuff about Tesla without pre-approval. We talked about that effort here, and about Musk\u2019s response here. Musk\u2019s view is that he only has to run tweets by a lawyer if he thinks they might be material, and so now he tries to only tweet non-material things about Tesla. The SEC disagrees: \n\n>>The Court-ordered pre-approval requirement for Musk\u2019s written communications lies at the heart of the settlement. Musk\u2019s unchecked and misleading tweets about Tesla are what precipitated the SEC\u2019s charges, and the pre-approval requirement was designed to protect against reckless conduct by Musk going forward. It is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the Court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect. Many of these tweets were about the topics specifically identified by Tesla in its own policies as potentially material to shareholders. Musk reads this Court\u2019s order as not requiring pre-approval unless Musk himself unilaterally decides his planned tweets are material. His interpretation is inconsistent with the plain terms of this Court\u2019s order and renders its pre-approval requirement meaningless. \n\n>Ehh. Look, I see Musk\u2019s lawyers\u2019 point: The settlement doesn\u2019t literally require him to pre-clear all of his tweets, but only to pre-clear the tweets that might be material, which gives him some wiggle room. I see the SEC\u2019s point: Musk has uniquely terrible judgment about what he should tweet about his company, which is why we are here in the first place. One path forward would be to change the settlement slightly to make this determination simpler, for instance by requiring Musk to pre-clear all tweets about Tesla, whether or not he thinks they are material. Obviously Musk would object to that. When we last talked about this, I suggested an opposite approach of just letting him tweet whatever he wants and declaring it automatically immaterial. Obviously the SEC would object to that. It feels a little like Musk and the SEC don\u2019t have a settlement at all: They reached an uneasy (and short-lived) truce by signing a piece of paper, but they don\u2019t agree on what the piece of paper means.\n\nYou can subscribe to his newsletter [here.](http://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/join/4wm/moneystuff-signup&hash=54223001ca3ffcf40f2629c25acea67a)\n\nI highly recommend it, he's never written an article that wasn't at least worth glancing at.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is such a stupid case.

Judges have extremely wide latitude to enforce consent decrees that are being violated.\n\nIn practice I expect a fine and for the judge to amend the original consent decree to explicitly require pre-approval of all tweets related to Tesla. Almost certain of the former, about 50/50 on the latter. There are potentially other possible remedies to bring Musk in line with what the settlement was intended to make happen, but I can't think of any.\n\n>What if he isn't?

They can continue behaving as they were prior to the SEC asking the court to find Musk in contempt.\n\nThis would, I think, be the worst of all possible outcomes, because it would lead Musk to believe that he is legally invincible (with some evidence to support that theory, to be honest).

The numbers you quote seem to come from InsideEVs, where if you look at other non-Tesla cars the site is tracking, the Honda Clarity sold 18,000 last year but only averaged \\~1200 for the first two months of this year for an annualized rate of 14,400.  The Bolt also sold 18,000 last year but only averaged 1075 in the first two months of this year.  Their tax credit didn't expire so this is 100% cyclical.\n\nIf you look at Tesla, the S and the X last year sold 1500 and 2100 in the first two months, but a total of \\~51800 throughout the year, which is over double the rate suggested by their first two months (2.3x actually).  They started this year roughly where they started last year, with 1825 and 1900 respectively so those cars at least suffered only barely from the tax-credit pull-forward.\n\nI think it's completely reasonable to think some of the drop-off on the Model 3 from Dec 2018 to Jan 2019 is pulled-forward demand, but I don't think it's reasonable to assume Jan/Feb sales are a solid predictor of the year for any car company.\n\nIf we took the S/X multiplied of 2.3x the Jan/Feb rate, that would suggest 170,000 Model 3s this year.  The price drops will increase that number but the tax credit expiration will decrease it - I'm not sure where that leaves us but 170,000 seems like a decent guess for US sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, you mention that you're only talking about US, but then never go on to add in an estimate for the rest of the world.  It would be pretty reasonable to assume the rest of the world will buy roughly as many 3s as the US does.

Last year they absolutely nailed their guidance for S and X sales.  I think they were driven to post ambitious numbers for the Model 3 because they were worried about triggering a death-spiral of missed deliveries and canceled orders.  But now they've proven they can make the 3 in volume and that people love it, so they don't feel so much need to convince anyone.  I think the market is currently underestimating 2019 sales because they are factoring in Elon's usual bluster when the company is actually issuing solid guidance.\n\nRegarding reasons 2 and 3, I think they are legitimate concerns and a good reason for the stock to be down.\n\nFWIW, I own Tesla stock because the cars are great and I think that will continue even if Musk is forced into a more passive role like he currently has at SpaceX.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "**Mark Cuban comes to the defense of Elon Musk and his \u2018ongoing public belligerence\u2019**\n\n>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mark-cuban-comes-to-the-defense-of-elon-musk-and-his-ongoing-public-belligerence-2019-03-18", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Cuban looks like a moron here.\n\nCuban:\n\n>Let\u2019s say @elonmusk wanted to know what was permissible for him to discuss, who could he ask ?
