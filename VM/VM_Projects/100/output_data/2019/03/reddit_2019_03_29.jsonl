AirPower's design, which incorporated overlapping charging coils, was prone to overheating. Some engineers within Apple reportedly believed they could solve this problem, but as time went on, those working on the project inside the company became less optimistic.\n\nWhy the effort? Because Apple wanted their AirPower mat to be better than other charging mats, in that you could place *numerous* devices *anywhere* on the mat to charge:\n\n> Apple said it would be a wireless charging mat that could simultaneously charge your iPhone, your Apple Watch, and your AirPods, regardless of where you placed them on the mat.\n\nTurns out, the laws of physics didn't like what Apple was trying to achieve. Can't blame them for giving up; it seemed pretty infeasible to develop in the first place given the number of coils you'd have to incorporate.\n\nAirPower would have been a pretty awesome charging mat, had it worked.
