Here, if students stop paying, the government will obviously feel it, but as you noted the solution is to cut spending, or one of their other mechanisms for reducing debt. The main difference here, is that banks and the private sector will be fine - less than 10% of the debt is through the private sector. That part of the economy can keep turning.

FWIW, my best guess (which doesn\u2019t count for anything), is that any economic slowdown caused by student loans will be just that\u2014a slowdown. It wouldn\u2019t be 12-24 months of negative GDP growth and a 50% drop in the stock market...it would be 10-20 YEARS of 1% GDP growth. Wage garnishment puts a damper on discretionary spending and/or saving.\n\nAccordingly, I suspect that we would need a better metaphor. A certain number of defaults isn\u2019t going to cause a crisis where one bank topples after another and folks can\u2019t get money out of their ATMs, but it could slow down the economy to the point where individuals aren\u2019t able to take risks and grow their wealth.\n\nAs for the size of the potential problem, the relevant numbers are the loans going into default.

(I would be shocked if student loan default were that high, and, again, I suspect that you\u2019re right that the size of the problem is different.)

It's one of the more reasonable arguments I've seen for student loans causing a recession (or close to it).

If this is about marketing, then it's stupid, because Musk is only winning over the people who already love him. \n\nMusk tweeted he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share. He later [settled with the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226) over it:\n\n>The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Elon Musk, CEO and Chairman of Silicon Valley-based Tesla Inc., has agreed to settle the securities fraud charge brought by the SEC against him last week.  The SEC also today charged Tesla with failing to have required disclosure controls and procedures relating to Musk\u2019s tweets, a charge that Tesla has agreed to settle.  The settlements, which are subject to court approval, will result in comprehensive corporate governance and other reforms at Tesla\u2014including Musk\u2019s removal as Chairman of the Tesla board\u2014and the payment by Musk and Tesla of financial penalties.\n\nNow the SEC believes that Musk is in contempt of the settlement, relating to tweets that he did not get pre-approved. Tesla and Musk argue he didn't need approval for those tweets. The SEC says he did. A judge will decide.\n\nIf a $50 billion ICE automaker or oil producer behaved as Musk did (tweeting about a nonexistent buyout during market hours, without firm commitments or even talking to their boards), the SEC would have gone after them, too. If the SEC doesn't throw the book at high profile CEOs, then everyone will only think that it's okay to break securities laws.\n\nThe SEC could have screwed Musk when he denied the initial settlement only to come crawling back to sign a slightly worse settlement offer. The SEC could have said \"screw it, let's go to court and make a mockery of this guy, and try to get him barred from being CEO of any public company ever again,\" but they didn't. Instead, the second settlement offer was just for a little bit more money. Pennies, in the grand scheme of things. \n\nBasically, Musk got pulled over for speeding, which isn't a big deal. Then he paid his ticket, and went on national TV and said \"F--- the securities police\" and behaved in a way which indicates he doesn't care at all about his settlment.\n\nYou can pretend that the SEC is just protecting the interests of oil and gas companies.
