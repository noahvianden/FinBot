Light vehicle SAAR in Jan and Feb were both weak due to weather, gov shutdown (in Jan), rising interest rates. In Feb, passenger car sales were down 12% y/y\n\n\\- Tesla's EV credit pull forward in December\n\n\\- Perhaps some impact from international orders that could have slowed US sales in Jan and Feb (I'm not sure if this is true or not)\n\n\\- Reliability issues that could be hurting the brand (consumer reports pulling their recommendation)\n\nThe first three are cyclical/temporary factors that should work itself out over time and do not point to something more structurally wrong with Tesla. The fourth though is definitely more of a structural concern. However, I do think that the first two accounted for most of the slowdown in sales. Reminder that 75% of 4Q sales were new orders, suggesting that normalized demand should be higher than what we saw in Jan and Feb. Non-preorder car sales don't just drop off a cliff. Even reliability issues, which are a legit concern, were not serious enough to lead to this much of a drop in a matter of months.\n\nA few other things that, from a timing perspective, could help Tesla get through this rough (and what seems like temporary) patch.

There is the offset that stores are closed, but the point is that the net benefit is likely higher overall (remember that the stores were closed to enable the 35k car).\n\nSecond, although there have been some rumors of international weakness, international orders have probably been high enough for them to ride out this rough patch in demand in Jan/Feb until the 35K car gets ramped up in terms of production.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "We're at 130k Vin registrations this quarter: www.model3vins.com,\n\nSo demand doesn't look like a problem, but who knows?\n\n", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yes that's something I've been trying to square away as well.
