I\u2019m generally bearish (especially at $360/share but still somewhat bearish at $270. BUT...I admit that my uncertainty level is moderate to high. That is to say that my conviction is moderate to weak because there are admittedly plausible \u2014 albeit speculative right now \u2014 revenue sources that could redefine TSLA in the future. \n\nAll that considered, I offer two things. First, I do have a bias but it isn\u2019t necessarily anti-TSLA. My bias is toward the present day vs. the future. Yes, we could colonize Mars, we could travel the country by underground trains, we could operate \u2014 at a profit \u2014 a transportation system without the combustion engine. In the future, robotic cars could operate 22-23 hours per day with no driver, turning the personal automobile into an all-day asset. In the future, the possibilities are incredible. Solar roofs power a wall-mounted battery, and like the entrance of the light bulb, the telephone, and modern aviation \u2014 our lives are forever changed.\n\nBut the future is not (yet) the present. And those who are fixated on the future sometimes underestimate the cost, the difficulty, and the likelihood to get there...profitably. \n\nThere have been many many amazing feats of engineering in the last 150 years. Supersonic flight, globally connected broadband, among others...they don\u2019t always turn out to be profitable for the people and companies who bring them to the market.\n\nSecond, I don\u2019t know the ages and backgrounds of people on this thread. I\u2019m on the very very front end of the Millennial generation having graduated in the early 00s. But I\u2019m old enough to have lived through 9/11 and the Great Recession as an adult.\n\nOne thing that is on my mind is that pretty much most people aged 32 and under are not old enough to remember the Great Recession as an investor or out in the working world. 35 year olds were barely in college during 9/11. And TSLA attracts a lot of younger investors.\n\nThis concerns me from an analysis perspective as many of the conversations in this forum express shock and surprise when they see what they perceive as good news being completely ignored by the market.  If that is your take, you should probably not be investing in TSLA or any other individual stock for that matter.\n\nIn the long run of investing there will be many many periods of time where stock prices don\u2019t seem to have any basis in logic. Back in 2009, you had AAA mortgages that were less than 50% loan-to-value being liquidated for pennies on the dollar.  \n\nTSLA is making a lot of promises. Many will come true. Other will come true but later than expected. Others not at all. \n\nInvest wisely.\n\n\n\n", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with you.

There are some offsetting factors, namely the \"flash sale\" of EAP and FSD. EAP sales generated some revenue in the current period, though most if not all of the FSD sales will be deferred revenue rather than revenue in Q1. \n\nIt's my opinion that anyone who owns a Tesla and was considering adding EAP/FSD likely did so in Q1. Market will want some detail regarding EAP/FSD attachment rates on the Tesla fleet this quarter. It's super important to marginal profitability from a GAAP and cash flow perspective. Given EAP/FSD cost $8,000 combined, a 10% swing in attach rates = $800/unit. Real money.\n\nRemember that Tesla can only book revenue from the sales of software when the functionality is actually delivered, but the deep discount on EAP and FSD will have helped Tesla bring in some cash. The Model Y definitely helped bring cash in the door, too, since many have argued that was the point of the Model Y launch in the first place.\n\nOf course, Tesla also paid off a $920MM convertible in cash in Q1. A subsidiary of SolarCity has a $180.6MM term loan that was due in December 2018, rolled to January 2019, and rolled again to April 2019. This term loan may or may not be paid off in cash in Q1. I suspect, though, that it was or will be rolled again, but there's no way to know with certainty. It's another potential drain on cash that investors should watch.\n\nAll eyes should now be on Q2. Musk said Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in all quarters where there were no large maturities. Q2 is one of those quarters. If Tesla guides for a \"maybe\" profit in Q2, or a loss in Q2, it's going to be ugly. Though many have abandoned hope for a profit in Q1, I think there is still some hope that Tesla will be profitable in Q2 and Q3. \n\nThe tax credit cliff in Q2 ($3,750 drops to $1,875 for the remainder of the year) should help Tesla move cars in Q2. That should bring some demand forward, though obviously it will be less impactful than the cliff that we saw in December.  \n\nAs for Tesla's cash position, the next big debt maturity, excluding the ~$181MM rolled over SCTY debt, is in November 2019 when ~$566MM of convertible debt comes due. \n\n\n\n", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I already miss the $300+ days :'(", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Be patient.

Materiality is a big fucking deal to securities lawyers, and the SEC just brushes aside Elon's arguments without assertions or defenses.  This is a major deficiency in their argument.  They are arguing that a broader standard should apply to Elon than the default 10b-5 statute, yet they cite no case law in support of this position.

{"title": "Buy MIK Puts - Thank me Later", "selftext": "Michaels (MIK) is an arts and crafts retailer in North America. In FY\u201918, the company generated 49.8% of sales from general and children\u2019s crafts, 22.0% from seasonal and home decor, and 11.6% from papercrafting. 90.6% of top line was generated in the US, while 9.4% came from Canada. Although the company currently trades at a 5.28x price to earnings multiple, representing a 48.4% discount to it\u2019s one year average, I am loading up on puts in anticipation for earnings being released before the bell on Tuesday (3/19). \n\nMIK began fighting against slowing sales and margins in 2018 with initiatives geared towards improving store layout and digital offerings. The company introduced flexible merchandising areas (FMA) to promote seasonal items. There are 700 stores with the FMA layout, up from 420 (lol) in FY\u201917, which includes 238 conversions in 2Q\u201918. FMA space was used to sell back-to-school, halloween, and holiday products in 3Q\u201918, and management plans to use it to boost kids creative gift sales in 2019. These FMA stores are reflected in MIK\u2019s same store sales, which grew 3.8% in 3Q\u201918 after only growing 1% in the same quarter a year ago. It is important to note that unlike other retailers (TGT, WMT, KSS), MIK\u2019s share price does not historically trade in line with same store sales figures. After MIK released 3Q\u201918 earnings, which included a 3.8% increase in SSS, the share price fell ~28.3% in the weeks following the report. \n\nWith digital initiatives, the MIK is adopting a buy online, pick-up in store (BOPIS) model. The company expanded online selections by 35% in 3Q\u201918, and now offers over 100,000 items online. In terms of executing the BOPIS model, MIK doubled the amount of stores capable of fulfilling these orders to 450 stores. The company also brags about upgrades to its app, which has over 6.5mm downloads. I think an e-commerce push is essential for MIK to survive in today\u2019s retail landscape, and is exactly what TGT, WMT, and others have done to succeed. But in MIK\u2019s case, online sales make up such a small part of top line I don\u2019t see these initiatives having much of an impact on earnings or investor\u2019s opinions of the company. I couldn\u2019t find any specific numbers, but management hinted at how insignificant this segment is to the business. \n\nMIK has continued change in 2019, when CEO Chuck Rubin \u201cmutually agreed with the Board of Directors to transition out of his role as CEO.\u201d A CEO just doesn\u2019t leave a healthy company, so I\u2019m guessing the Board of Directors isn\u2019t satisfied with 4Q\u201918 results, and is not very confident about the future. This event caused JPM to downgrade their outlook from overweight to neutral. Two metrics that could have been responsible for the CEO\u2019s departure, and I think will hinder the business moving forward, are gross margins and costs of goods sold. Gross margins have fallen 5.57% and 3.69% YoY in 2Q\u201918 and 3Q\u201918, respectively, largely due to higher COGS. COGS rose 1.46% and 5.6% YoY in 2Q\u201918 and 3Q\u201918, respectively, and if this trend continues without strong sales, MIK is in for a tough quarter. Analysts expect MIK to report 4Q\u201918 adjusted EPS of $1.43, which would be a 20.2% YoY increase, thorough in the past four weeks this consensus has fallen (0.17%). Revenue is expected to come in at $1.78B, representing a (5.8%) YoY decrease, and this estimate has fallen (0.05%) in the last four weeks. \n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think 2018\u2019s growth initiatives will be enough to support MIK this quarter. Although the stock trades at a crazy discount, I think there is still room for it to go lower. \n\nTLDR: Buy naked MIK puts today. \n\nEDIT: Up 6.5%+ pre-market...
