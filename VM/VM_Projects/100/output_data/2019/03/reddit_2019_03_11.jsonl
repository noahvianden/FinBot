The second part is based on that often a gap lower isn't the low of the move, and stocks will continue through the day lower on bad news.  As a stock continues lower after a gap lower, the Vola / IV (implied volatility) may actually increase, or at least remain high.

The pilots of JT610 had enough time to get their bearings and request a block altitude from ATC before MCAS finally did them in. JT610 was in the air for 7 minutes longer.\n\n>A part of what MCAS does is increase hydraulic pressure in the system that manipulates the elevator to four times normal system actuation pressure and decreases the effectiveness of rudder input using the yaw damper. Combine this increase in pressure with the stick pusher being activated and MCAS trimming the aircraft down, it is easy to see how an inexperienced crew might find themselves in an uncontrollable dive, with the resultant overspeed resulting in airframe damage that might have been able to cause a fire.\n\nDo you even know what you're talking about? \n\nFirst off, the 737-MAX is a fly-by-wire system - an \"increase in hydraulic pressure\" (which wouldn't even affect the effort needed for a pilot to change input and wouldn't even affect the manipulation of the aircraft control surfaces) wouldn't be noticeable to the pilot. Second of all, MCAS literally only controls the horizontal stabilizer trim - it doesn't even have a stick pusher. MCAS functions very similarly - almost exactly the same, even - as the Speed Trim System (STS), which would trim the nose down when CG is aft of normal during high-thrust procedures in order to reduce stab trim runaway and crash. It's very likely that pilots used to the STS system assumed that moving the yoke would shut down auto stab trim - something that MCAS overrides.\n\n>I would also remind you that the crash site is quite small, less than 500M between furthest known debris objects. This is consistent with an aircraft impacting the ground at high speed and a very high angle, and aircraft which was attempting to land in a field would leave a debris field several thousand feet long and wouldn't leave a giant hole in the ground.\n\nI would also like to remind you that the Atlas 767 that crashed a few weeks ago also impacted the ground at high speed and a very high angle... because unfortunately that's generally how fatal plane crashes happen.

There are even a lot of pilots on PPRuNe that are discussing (and were discussing after JT610) the similarities and differences of STS and MCAS.
