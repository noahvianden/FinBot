I've met with many honda reps, one of which was from japan. I asked them all about tesla. They laughed and said 'just wait'.\n\nHonda is the biggest automotive corporation in the world. They make bikes, boats, cars, jets, even a robot. They dont give a shit about chinese made cars that rely on the batteries of another company. One day, within the next ten years, they will offer electric versions of all of their civics, accords, bikes (look up the new electric cr250), etc. The electric and hybrid options of today are for emissions and efficiency. Making a powerful one is a matter of going to panasonic and buying the same shit tesla buys from them. Tesla isn't doing anything special that every other auto maker can replicate. They are working on their own pace, because tesla isnt even remotely a threat, and they are busy already selling millions of cars a year. Comparing teslas to older, economic electric cars that are designed for niche markets and small production is just flawed thinking. You could argue people will want to still buy teslas due to the 'luxury' aspect, as if putting a big screen and large moon roof is somehow impossible to replicate, but those people will buy an electric lexus or bmw.
