Tesla basically pulled all the price levers multiple times to find it which is pessimistic and why I haven't jumped on the selloff. \n\n2018 plug-in EV sales were 80% higher than 2017 in the US (Tesla US growth even higher). I think it's reasonable to believe that organic growth is much lower than that, but it doesn't take long to pick up the slack. My firm assumption is that by 2030 only small niches still have preferred interest in ICE. If that's wrong then all bets are off. If it's right then organic demand has to grow at a substantial pace (though not 80% per year).\n\nSo we're in a period of uncertainty. It is possible that most of future demand gets grabbed by competitors, that's the chief theoretical concern, not that Q1 sales are down really.
