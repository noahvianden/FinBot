The reason there aren't more fires is because most of the aircraft utilizes a OBIGS which fills cavities with an inert gas, which prevents ignition.\n\nThis guy doesn't know shit and he is just trying to make the 737 situation worse for profit.\n\nEdit: Additionally, using [this](https://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=787&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=787&ViewReportF=View+Report) page and the internet archive I determined that Air Canada had received 10 aircraft through September 2015.
