The thing is, I agree with him on his stance on China, IP theft, no access to capital markets while they IPO a new Asian stock every fucking week, our AI vs their AI (Bill Barr can go fuck himself with that antitrust bullshit and Trump to a certain degree for signing off on it, FANG represents the very best of America), etc. But if he cuts a deal, I think you see such a boom in CapEx spending, 5G rollout, global trade, and that trend just compounds itself and Trump is running on a very strong economy. If that's the case heading into 2020, he has every right to say \"our economy is the envy of the world\" type lines and it will be true.
