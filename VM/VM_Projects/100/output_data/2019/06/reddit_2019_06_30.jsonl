{"title": "6/30- I pick options so you don't have to", "selftext": "Qualifications: \n\n* A positive all time.\n\nI wrote my first draft of this post on Friday so I had to rewrite pretty much the whole thing because of tariff man. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$SPX- ***EXTREMELY BULLISH*** \n\nI am very confident that we will see an immediate rally at open, and then have it level out throughout the day/week because orange man said \u201ctrade talks with China are going very well\u201d at G20. I\u2019m planning to buy a bunch of calls at open and then possibly selling by noon depending on how well they perform. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$BYND- ***BULLISH***\n\nMany of you autists are familiar with this one. I bought some $152.5 ITM calls for no real reason other than them being cheap on Friday as the stock dropped 1.27%. Obviously, I\u2019m bullish only for the short term, They\u2019re way to overbought. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous for a fake meat company. I\u2019m definitely gonna sell on Monday if I see any kind of profit (something not too common here), as I don't foresee a big rise this week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$REAL- ***BULLISH***\n\nThe stock jumped a whopping 44% the day it IPOed (Friday). Most people predicted this because of the founders previous IPO history. By the time we actually can trade options on this stock, I could turn bearish if the stock becomes too overbought, but for at least the next week, I'm bullish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$AAPL- ***BEARISH*** \n\nMy position on Apple is obviously mostly due to Jony Ive leaving the company and them moving production of the Mac Pro to out of the US. I currently have $2.5k in 210 ITM puts expiring on the 5th. I don't expect a big crash or anything so if I see some gains by mid-week or even mid-Monday I'm probably going to take it and run. At this point, the only reason I can think of for a possible rise in Apple stock would be due to the trade talks with China, as the tariffs would heavily affect Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$DIS- ***BULLISH***\n\nThe stock peaked this week at $141.18. I expect it to go down to at least $138 by mid-week mostly due to Toy Story 4 not doing as well as predicted. I currently have $7k in 135 ITM calls. I hope to sell on Wednesday\u2019s open.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$UBER- ***BEARISH*** \n\nThe stock went up 2.77% just Friday. The stock is too overpriced, and the company is way too overvalued for a company that for whatever reason doesn't seem to have a path to profitability. Overall, I\u2019m bearish on this stock for both the short term and the long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, only 6 stonks this week. This took me well over an hour so please give me some free internet points. I have a lot of thoughts on some of the earnings this month, so I\u2019ll definitely start doing this weekly to take the place of the legendary u/SoRefreshing. Next week I will post from my other account u/SoAutistic. I couldn't upload from that account today because it has to be at least a week old to post on this sub. \n\nIf you have any stonks you want my thoughts on PM me.
