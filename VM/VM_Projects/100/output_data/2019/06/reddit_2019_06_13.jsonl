Watch a documentary on the great depression. I went to find a block of text for you from CFAI. For context the FED is a member of the Basel Committee. \n\n>The Basel Committee developed the international regulatory framework for banks known as Basel III, which is the enhanced framework succeeding Basel I and Basel II. The purposes of the measures contained in Basel III are the following: \u201cto improve the banking sector\u2019s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, improve risk management and governance, and strengthen banks\u2019 transparency and disclosures.\u201d10 \n\n>Three important highlights of Basel III are the minimum capital requirement, minimum liquidity, and stable funding. First, Basel III specifies the minimum percentage of its risk-weighted assets that a bank must fund with equity capital. This minimum capital requirement prevents a bank from assuming so much financial leverage that it is unable to withstand loan losses (asset write-downs). Second, Basel III specifies that a bank must hold enough high-quality liquid assets to cover its liquidity needs in a 30-day liquidity stress scenario. This minimum liquidity requirement ensures that a bank would have enough cash to cover a partial loss of funding sources (e.g., customers\u2019 deposits, other borrowings) or a cash outflow resulting from off-balance-sheet funding commitments. Third, Basel III requires a bank to have a minimum amount of stable funding relative to the bank\u2019s liquidity needs over a one-year horizon. Stability of funding is based on the tenor of deposits (e.g., longer-term deposits are more stable than shorter-term deposits) and the type of depositor (e.g., funds from consumers\u2019 deposits are considered more stable than funds raised in the interbank markets).Among the several liquidity-monitoring metrics described in Basel III,24 two are discussed here: concentration of funding and contractual maturity mismatch. Concentration of funding refers to the proportion of funding that is obtained from a single source. Excessive concentration of funding exposes a bank to the risk that a single funding source could be withdrawn.>The rationale for the Net Stable Funding Ratio is that it relates the liquidity needs of the financial institution\u2019s assets to the liquidity provided by the funding sources. With assets, for example, loans with long-dated maturities require stable funding whereas highly liquid assets do not. With funding sources, long-dated deposits and other liabilities are considered more stable than short-dated liabilities, and deposits from retail customers are considered more stable than deposits with the same maturity from other counterparties. The standards set a target minimum of greater than 100%.\n\n>Among the several liquidity-monitoring metrics described in Basel III, two are discussed here: concentration of funding and contractual maturity mismatch. Concentration of funding refers to the proportion of funding that is obtained from a single source. Excessive concentration of funding exposes a bank to the risk that a single funding source could be withdrawn.\n\n>Contractual maturity mismatch refers to the maturity dates of a bank\u2019s assets compared to the maturity dates of a bank\u2019s funding sources. **In a normal yield curve environment, where long-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates, a bank can maximize its net interest income\u2014all else equal\u2014by borrowing short term and lending long term. In doing so, the bank would minimize the interest paid to its depositors and maximize interest earned on its loan assets.** In excess, however, such maturity mismatches expose the bank to liquidity risk if the bank needs to return cash on its maturing deposits prior to the time that it receives cash repayment of loans from its borrowers. Monitoring maturity mismatch is thus an important tool in liquidity risk management.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m actually retarded and gamble my money with FDs despite my background.
