So it depends if you\u2019re placing a limit *buy* or a limit *sell*. When you\u2019re buying something, you want the lowest price, right? So a limit buy will fill at the lowest price possible under the limit price you set (most of the time you\u2019ll get filled exactly at the limit, unless you\u2019re trading illiquid securities), and vice versa for a limit sell. So if you\u2019re buying and put the limit above the current price, then it\u2019ll be no different than placing a market order. Since your broker will fill your order at the limit price or better and you put the limit above the market price, you\u2019ll be instantly filled at market because it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d (lower) than the limit you set.

For a bank to tell an equity analyst to lie about a stock in order to make some money off of a few options would be absolutely horrible business practice.

Nobody is question the size of the market for this - really the debate around market size is people debating between 'really big' and 'really fucking big'. \n\nThe real question is *much* more along the lines of 'how defensible is BYNDs intellectual property?' and 'can BYND fill the gap between demand and supply while fighting off competitors?'  BYND is a $10B company, and the *vast* majority of that valuation is based on BYND perfectly executing their growth strat for the next (say) 3-5 years.  They aren't priced for any serious fuckups and they are *definitely* not priced for the entry of competitors.   \n\nI don't cover equities, and I definitely don't get involved in hype-stocks, but I'll share what ppl on the street are talking about:  I had this convo last week - there are two other 'older' tech companies that both hit $10B (nosebleed) valuations and could be proxies for BYND - TIVO and GPRO.  Both of them were 'game changing hype-stocks' and everyone saw the obviousness of the story behind both TIVO and GPRO.  Go pull both of their charts - both of those stocks saw the exact same 'straight up and to the right' stock trajectories....before losing ~80% of their value over the next few years.  \n\nBut importantly, the 'market' for what TIVO/GPRO produce/manufacture has inarguably grown insanely - its just that neither of them were able to fight off competitors.  Nearly every hose that has cable has some sort of DVR, but not a TIVO.  Reddit/Youtube/social media is *full* of video shot with tiny/portable cameras, and video like this has changed the world - its just that relatively few of these videos are shot on actual GoPros; you can get a chinese knock-off for like 1/10th the cost that's 95% as good as the real deal.  \n\nOn the flip-side, you could look at TSLA as a first mover that's worked....so far.  The future is obviously emissionless cars globally, but the question is whether or not we will be driving electric Teslas or VW/GM/F/Nissans.  Or we could look at smartphones: AAPL & Samsung were successful in defending thier market; Palm, HTC, Motorola, RIM/Blackberry, Nokia, etc.....not so much.\n\nThe same is probably true for BYND - plant-based meat is likely to boom over the next few decades; I doubt that many really disagree with this.  And the price will certainly drop - maybe cheaper than the real thing? But the *real* question is how much of this can BYND capture - will plant-based meat become a commodity?  Is someone like Purdue or ConAgra going to come in and beat the shit out of them? That's a *much* harder question to figure out.
