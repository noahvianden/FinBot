Outrageous guidance has been part of his visions for as long as I can remember.  \n\nThere are a lot of people who invested in Tesla stock without knowing what they were getting into.  When I first started reading about Elon Musk, SpaceX, and Tesla, around 2005-2006, everything surrounding the man and his businesses looked like chaos.  \n\nSpaceX kept blowing up rockets, despite Musk claiming in 2002 that they\u2019d have a Falcon payload in orbit by 2003.  The Roadster project was constantly in trouble.  By 2007, Tesla has churned through several CEOs in a very short time.\n\nMy assessment in 2007-2008 was that there was basically no viable path forward for either company.  Musk\u2019s insane behavior, the chronic chaos at both ventures, cash burn, and then Great Recession, should have finished them both for good.  But that didn\u2019t happen.  \n\nSpaceX reached orbit at the end of 2008 and won a NASA contract.  Tesla somehow secured funding as a Daimler supplier.  \n\nIt really makes no logical sense to me, but there is something about Elon Musk that defies reasonable expectation.  He gets away with things that nobody else would have gotten away with.  The result has been SpaceX becoming the largest, most innovative private commercial rocket launch provider, and Tesla becoming a mass manufacturer of electric cars.  \n\nThat\u2019s why I gambled on TSLA in 2012 (and still hold all those shares).  Extreme risk, with potentially extreme reward. \n\nI think that Musk is actually crazy.  I understand why people hate him.  I understand that his outrageous guidance is almost always wrong on when his company will reach a milestone, but that they usually get there somehow at some point in future.   People who haven\u2019t taken the time to understand Musk, will not be able to tolerate being a shareholder in Tesla for any significant period.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "recession", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I owned AMD when they went from $10 to $14 to $10 to $32 to $17 back to $24 and now $27.
