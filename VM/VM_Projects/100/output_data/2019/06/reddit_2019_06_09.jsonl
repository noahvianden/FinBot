I get worried, sell a 6/21 120c for $138 thinking, \"I'll at least make something back from that $571, and this thing is probably going to stay level at this point because of the matrix of small float vs not a multibillion dollar company.\n\nGets closer to earnings. I'm down a bit on the 110c, and  -$138 on the 120c. I have a serious meditation session trying to determine what the best course of action is. The small stupid part: I say, eh, if this thing tanks I'll get the full premium of the call I sold and I can wait a week to see what the 110c does over the next week. If it goes up, It can't go up that much, so hopefully it straddles 115-120 and I can figure it out based on what to do.\n\nSo Friday morning, I'm feeling good because this thing jumped to the mid 120's, but I want out of the 120c obviously. At $128, I buy to close the 120c for $1180, exercise the 110c. I'm like this because I am not on the hook for the $12k+ alone if I had been assigned with a crashing 110c that isn't exercised. Prior to the exercising, I'm looking at the value of the 110c and 120c on top of each other trying to figure out risk/benefit of assign/exercise or sell and gain benefits from the contracts themselves. Meanwhile the share price is going all over the place from 135 down to 122 then up to 127.\n\nShare price down to 122 10 minutes later. I'm now realizing my cost basis on my shares isn't just $115 (for the IRS it is), which in my mind it was because I wanted out of the 120c. \n\nThe cost basis in reality is now $11500 + $1k ($1180-138 premium) plus the various TDA commissions.

I would have made ~$270 total from that. My worst case was losses all around (-$400). Instead I did the rookie autist thing where I burned $1180 on that 120c buy back that I could have waited on, and shouldn't have sold in the first place.\n\nAs someone said in the thread with that doof who sold 10 110c on margin: Don't try to pick up a quarter in front of a juiced up steamroller running on retard strength.\n\nI also screwed up and sold a 200c TSLA call when it hit 170's this week. Panicked (appropriately) when it hit $198 premarket a few days later and lost $400 on that plan. Lesson there is don't screw around with TSLA.
