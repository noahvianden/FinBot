At 7 cents a KWH they can sell the trucking providers $140,000 worth of electricity and likely take home $70,000 per Semi by delivering it at 3.5 cents per KWH (reasonable assumption with the cost of solar and batteries going down), but less say it's just $35,000 per million miles of travel.\n\n> Number of Miles Driven - Truck drivers drive an estimated 140 billion miles every year, and a single semi drives about 45,000 miles a year on average. According to the Federal Highway Administration, long-distance trucks travel upwards of 100,000 miles a year. 42% of all miles driven by commercial vehicles are driven by semi trucks.\n\n140 billion miles per year, let's say they make 10% profit on each 7 cents of KWH so 1.4 cents per mile ... If Tesla captures just 5% of the market share in the first 3 years, that is 7 billion of the miles and $98,000,000 in profit!\n\nNow imagine they take 25% of the miles and make 20% profit on selling electricity? $840 million a year in profits. \n\nThat is a huge on JUST selling the fuel to trucks, but considering 140 billion miles at 8mpg @$2.50/gallon is what we are right now, it's a huge market to disrupt.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "All great points especially the business case per mile - assuming maintenance costs at parity between diesel and electric, which is probably very pessimistic, diesel trucks get 4-8 MPG.

So fuel will cost 1/2 as much, with the business case strengthened to the extent the vehicles require less maintenance.  \n\nCapital costs I've seen estimate $180k for the 500 mile version of the tesla, and $120k for the typical diesel.  Assuming a 700k mile lifespan before a major overhaul, again conservatively but reasonably acknowledging the million mile battery is not yet a reality, you're looking at capital costs of $.26/mile for the tesla and $.17 for the Diesel.\n\nNet, under all these assumptions, is that you might be ahead a few cents per mile with electric today - maybe $14k over the vehicle life above or about 5% over six years.  Not nothing, but not a leap to take without better real world data and with the other changes required by a shift to new tech, although also without including any of the lower carbon benefits.\n\nYou can see why Autonomy is the lynchpin for so much of the Tesla strategy.  The cost not accounted for above is the truck driver herself, at $38k per year.  If the Tesla is self-driving, or substantially so (such as on the Highway), the capital advantage goes from about 5% to about 87% or a savings over six years of about $242k.\n\nThis would explain why companies are ordering the tesla semi and doing testing and evaluation, or because it supports their CO2 strategy, rather than on a strictly cost per mile basis - at least until the things can drive themselves.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I didn't check your math, but I also think the Semi will be great for Tesla.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5410025715827942}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4508984684944153}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think short squeezes are tied more closely to a positive change in outlook, rather than a specific share price.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Positive change in outlook plus many shares tied up and unavailable to buy.

Luxury foreign cars are status symbols... I'm reasonably sure Tesla qualifies.  If Tesla is not quite yet thought of that way in the majority, there are still plenty of Chinese who do think that to buy the cars and show them off and get that perception established fully.\n\nThey said the Chinese website crashed when it opened for business.  That might have been engineered to happen (it does seem silly these days), but I'd believe it to be entirely possible the demand was really just way larger than expected.\n\nThe only potential issue is China typically likes to heavily subsidize 100% domestic alternatives to foreign companies whenever possible. However, since Tesla is the first foreign company in the world allowed to exist in China with 100% foreign ownership (to my understanding.. ?) this is probably less of a concern with Tesla... they seem to have incredible governmental support... at least for the first few years.\n\nChina is going to be huge.\n\nPeople don't tend to internalize correctly how big China is.

It is important to emphasize that refinement and validation of the software will take much longer than putting in place the cameras, radar, sonar and computing hardware.\n\nEven once the software is highly refined and far better than the average human driver, there will still be a significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction, before true self-driving is approved by regulators. We expect that worldwide regulatory approval will require something on the order of 6 billion miles (10 billion km). Current fleet learning is happening at just over 3 million miles (5 million km) per day.\n\nI should add a note here to explain why Tesla is deploying partial autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point in the future. The most important reason is that, when used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.\n\nAccording to the recently released 2015 NHTSA report, automotive fatalities increased by 8% to one death every 89 million miles. Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number and the system gets better every day. It would no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in aircraft, after which our system is named.\n\nIt is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot as \"beta\". This is not beta software in any normal sense of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal validation before it reaches any customers. It is called beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average, the beta label will be removed.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Dude, the shift to 'Robo Taxis' was a narrative shift, and also those stats have been debunked many times.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Narrative shift?
