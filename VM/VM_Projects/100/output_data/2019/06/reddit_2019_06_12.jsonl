Since the crash of '08 with a subsequent miraculous bull run, it seems everyone is in constant anticipation that something will break it, and a recession will be upon us, perhaps resembling somewhat like the last crash. However, Howard Marks notes that although there are problems in our economy, there are also aspects to feel optimistic about, and we're unlikely to experience anything remotely so severe. I'm uncertain of what posture is appropriate. If any investors have lived through multiple past cycles of boom-and-bust, what do you anticipate is coming? What do you think it will *feel* like?

On one hand you have a high value dollar, on the other hand you have a lower value dollar. If the scale tips too far in the direction of a high value dollar, it triggers a cascade of events which attempt to rebalance so that exports on oil and trade are not lost. If the rebalancing is too much, i.e. the Fed creates too high inflation and angers US dollar holders who then unload their dollar holdings on the foreign exchange market, it could tip the scale too far in the opposite direction.

A lot of smart people that I respect (both actual futurists and YouTubers like CGP Grey and Kurzgesagt) fall in to the same trap in this regard, and I feel like Andrew Yang is one of these.\n\n\nAI is just a continuation of our increase in productivity, [which has been consistently increasing for decades](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vjLTa098Pc0/Tb1zPo2VT9I/AAAAAAAAPRA/Pfsjn7o_Jgk/s1600/prod.jpg), that breaks over the barrier that has prevented us from applying that increased productivity to many services as opposed to manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\nThe basic lesson from economic history is:  Historically, what happens when we get more efficient at doing something we either (A) use more of it, OR (B) use the saved money to by other things.\n\n\nFor (A):  When we invented the vacuum cleaner, we thought it would reduce the number of hours people spent cleaning.  Instead, it increased our standards for cleanliness.   When we invented the steamroller, luddites ran articles in the paper decrying that it would put road pavers out of business.  What did it do?  Well, it drove down the price of making roads, *so we built way more roads*. \n\nThe record player was supposed to put musicians out of business.  And it did, sort of- it mostly killed the orchestra.  But it also increased our expectation that *every home and public place have music*, leading to a huge boom in the music industry.\n\n\nFor (B):\n\nIncreased manufacturing productivity from automation results in *things getting cheaper*.  If you *don't* consume more of it like in the (A) examples, what happens?\n\nWell, what happens when you make the same income, but the TV you wanted to buy costs half as much?  You have more money to spend on other things.\n\nRight now, roughly 15% of the US economy is the production of goods.  70% is services.  This ratio used to be totally different.\n\nThis is the reason why.  The goods got cheaper.  So we started spending more and more money on services.  TVs, smartphones, computers, toys, furnishings, etc are cheaper than ever.  So we spend more and more of our money on services.  Eating out at restaurants, getting delivery, getting our lawn mowed, getting coffee, going to the doctor, etc.\n\n\n\nNow, traditionally, automation has only applied to manufactured goods.  Now, AI is going to allow automation to start going after *some* service jobs.  But we'll see the same thing.  AI will drive down the cost of those sectors, and then people will spend their money in other sectors.\n\nIf AI creates self driving cars and trucks, what happens?  Shipping becomes cheaper and cheaper, driving down the price of goods.  Taxis become incredibly cheap, leading to either more usage, or more money to spend on other services.\n\nIf people consume more, great- that means more people going around town doing things, or ordering delivery, etc.  If people pocket the savings, great- they're spending money on other services.\n\nWe'll spend less and less money on the services AI replaces, and more on the ones they can't.  Doctors, contractors/handymen, counselors, engineers, housecleaners, etc.\n\n--------------------------\n\n\nHowever, I'm not saying \"all is well\" and \"don't worry\".\n\nI'm saying the \"no jobs\" gloom and doom won't happen.  But these kinds of transitions can cause a ton of pain from the *movement* and change of job types.\n\n\nFor example, manufacturing jobs tended to be unionized and have good pay.  Unskilled (I hate that word to describe workers who work a hard job, but it means people without a specialized education) workers could work a manufacturing job with a union that negotiated for them and they were pretty happy.\n\n\nAs those go away, people are moving into the service sector, which is often much less centralized and has also resisted unionization better.  Your local coffee shop doesn't have a union to negotiate for you.  Your local housecleaner doesn't have a lot of negotiating power either.  Big chains like Walmart resist it.  Costco has one- if all basic jobs treated their workers like Costco (lowest paid workers make $14.50 and have paid vacation and healthcare), a lot less people would be complaining about their manufacturing jobs going away.\n\nAlso, the new jobs being created are in different areas.  If a worker plant in a rural town in Michigan closes, and costs go down, creating service jobs in California...well, everyone who lives in the rural town in Michigan is screwed, while no one in California working a minimum wage job at Starbucks credits automation for driving down the cost of coffee to make their job viable.\n\n\nAnd finally, the biggest issue of automation is inequality.  The people who \"own\" the automation/AI make a lot more money relative to the workers, whose value is driven down.\n\n\n\nSo yeah.  The transition is ugly, lots of people will be hurt.  Andrew Yang isn't wrong to want to create safety nets to help people.  But I don't think we're going to see mass unemployment as AI makes people as useless as the car made the horse, to paraphrase a popular YouTuber.  AI is just going to drive down costs of a lot of things leading to more money spent in services.

If anyone knows, please let me know.\nThe stock market appears to be artificially pumped up by banks and corporations buying massive quantities of their own shares. This can be seen by drops in the S&P and DJIA in the hundreds of points throughout the day, only to see it rise hundreds of points within minutes.  Stocks will continue to go up until they simply don't anymore. Quantitative easing is an emergency measure, but it doesn't seem to be effective anymore.

Without getting political, I think that the US military positions are brilliant. From what I conceive, we're essentially using other countries oil to run the global show while we increase our capacity to make our own. We are keeping other countries (in Europe, specifically) dependent on our military so that they do not develop a force that can challenge our own. So, the US will not pull out of global positions for any small reason. The US, up until 2015, was the global standard for all oil transactions. If a country wanted to grow, it needed to have US dollars on reserve to buy oil. This has changed. Venezuela is now dealing oil directly with Russia without US dollars. China and Russia are both dumping US bonds and hoarding gold. The gold they get from the US is being melted down because they don't trust the US to give pure precious metals. If the global economy shifts away from the US dollar, a very large influx of $ will come home, severely inflating its value overnight. \n\nI'm rambling at this point.

You seem to always have a meltdown whenever somebody says there is no demand issue but can't seem to find anything that isn't opinion based that PROVES a demand issue.\n\nThe easiest way to see the demand issue is to look at the drop in ASPs over the past year.  In Q1 of 2018 automotive revenue per vehicle delivered was $91,186.35.  In the following quarters that number has dropped to $82,360.70, $72,799.36, $69,511.89, and finally to $59,091.08 last quarter.  Now, that is obviously being driven by the introduction of the Model 3 into the sales mix, and it isn't a concern by itself since total deliveries have increased so much.  The hugely concerning bit is the drop last quarter of over $10k *when deliveries also dropped*.  Now, there are of course a number of factors explaining a soft Q1 (sales dragged forward in Q4, seasonality, etc.).  But the drop in ASPs couldn't be blamed on pushing more Model 3s out the door.  Which brings us to Q2, where the company is claiming they will potentially hit delivery records *but still make a loss*.  That is because ASPs are continuing to drop.  \n\nTo bring this all together, remember demand is a function of price and quantity sold.  If the company can only maintain the same number of sales by significantly reducing prices, that means the demand curve is lower.  \n\n> The CEO of the company says they are selling more cars than they are making, and with his statement you have agreement of other team members, but somehow they are all lying and you (a Reddit user with ZERO ties to he company) seems to believe you know more about insider business than the people running the company. A big fucking LOL.\n\nBut as I explained above, he is only selling more cars than they are making because he is selling much cheaper cars.  I'm not claiming the absolute number of sales are down, I am claiming they have a demand issue.  They are different concepts and you seem to be getting them confused.
