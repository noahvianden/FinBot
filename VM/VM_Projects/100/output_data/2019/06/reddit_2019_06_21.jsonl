It\u2019s an auto company.\n\nAuto companies cannot scale quickly, and are capital intensive, and have a cyclical earnings cycle. That why they usually trade at 6-10 times earnings.\n\nTesla is working to build out this business, but is having trouble turning positive cash flow, let alone profits. Tesla will continue to expand the auto business, but at the end of the day we need to see efficiencies increase and the business needs to start producing cash. \n\nThis really is the sole item to focus on in the short term.\n\n*Energy*\n\nTesla seems to be scaling this this down on the solar side, last quarter it repainted single digit revenues , at a 2% gross margin (of memory serves me right).\n\nSo we have solar, which is a loss for the company. \n\nThen we have battery storage. Battery storage seems to have much better margins, but isn\u2019t broken out separately. Still if Tesla is battery constrained, storage doesn\u2019t make sense to grown. The automotive segment has higher margins. I don\u2019t expect to see battery storage grow much in the next 3 or so years while the auto side of the business grows.\n\nRight now the energy side of the business is costing Tesla money, and is slowing down the automotive side from scaling. Due to contracts with NY and Panasonic, Tesla can\u2019t shut down this business. It will have to operate it as lean as possible, and not let it mess with the automotive portion of the business.\n\n*insurance* \n\nI don\u2019t imagine Tesla will enter this business directly, since insurance companies have such tight regulations that affect cash reserves. Tesla probably sell insurance via a 3rd party, for a slight markup. \n\nAs for putting a value on this, this is difficult, insurance companies are usually priced on price to books (P/B) not on a PE ratio. It\u2019s hard to say how this would look, but considering Tesla has a small market to sell to. And probably high costs due to 3rd party performing most of the service. I don\u2019t imagine this will be a profit center, it\u2019ll be a selling tactic more than a cash generator.\n\nSomeone here will be for familiar with this sector than me, and can chime in.\n\n*taxi*\n\nIdk you\u2019re on your own here.
