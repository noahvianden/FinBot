Endogenous growth theory holds that investment in human capital, innovation, and knowledge are significant contributors to economic growth. The theory also focuses on positive externalities and spillover effects of a knowledge-based economy which will lead to economic development. The endogenous growth theory primarily holds that the long run growth rate of an economy depends on policy measures. For example, subsidies for research and development or education increase the growth rate in some endogenous growth models by increasing the incentive for innovation.\n\nTLDR: My 2 cents; If trump wins this trade war by holding out gradually, he will use the tariff money to incentivize US innovation. \n\nSo you and OP are wrong.
