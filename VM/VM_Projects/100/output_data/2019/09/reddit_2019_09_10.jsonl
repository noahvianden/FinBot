Features include Dolby Atmos audio, WiFi 6, an ultrawide camera lens and enhanced camera features. You'll be able to take landscape selfies and videos and slo-mo video. It gets a power boost in the form of a new A13 Bionic processor (with a faster graphics processor). We saw a new action RPG game, Pascal's Wager from Giant Network, to show off the GPU performance and spatial audio. It isn't an Apple Arcade title, though, which is interesting. \n\nIt starts at $699.\n\n#Apple Arcade and Apple TV Plus\n\nApple took the opportunity to introduce us to some new games for its upcoming all-you-can-eat game subscription service, coming later this month which will run $4.99 per month per family, with a 1 month free trial. You can get Apple TV+ for free for a year if you buy Apple devices.\n\nApple TV Plus launches November 1st in over 100 countries, for another $4.99 per month for a family subscription.\n\n#iPad 2019\n\nThe company is replacing its sixth-generation model with a new 10.2-inch seventh-generation model optimized for the new iPad OS. It's got improved brightness, a better viewing angle, A10 Fusion chip and adds Smart Connector plus a new smart keyboard cover. \n\n#Apple Watch Series 5\n\nThe new Watch Series 5 features a new always-on display that can drop as low as 1Hz refresh to save power, compass and optimized faces. With fancy new bands and faces! GPS models will start at $399 and $499 for cell models. Series 3 stays in the line, but the price has dropped to a start of $199.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You're a real bro even if you're gay", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "He is the Q in LGBTQ", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.330921471118927}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01950998045504093}, {"body": "You're like the gay brother that I never wanted", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06773248314857483}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Ooh it tells time", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09654272347688675}, {"body": "Takeaways:\n\niPhone 11 camera is ugly as fuck\n\niPhone 11 ProMax is a stupid name", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "iPhone 7-37max plane color", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2932872474193573}, {"body": ">\tiPhone 11 ProMax\n\nIt has 2 names so we can charge double\n\n-Tim Apple", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Wake me up when apple releases the quadruple uranium platinum plus premium ProMax 5 iPhone 15 with optional dildo attachments", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Teledildonics.
