However growing closer to ITM strike prices, the delta increases and the premium to purchase tends to be exponentially higher. If I have a finite amount I'm willing to invest, does it make sense to buy the cheaper strike prices so that I have more contracts that can potentially make me more money? I know it doesn't make perfect sense but here is an example. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$0.58 AMD Call $30\n\nDelta: 0.62 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$.0.31 AMD Call $30.50\n\nDelta: 0.43\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe $30 strike price premium costs 88% more than the $30.50 however the delta increase is only 44% So if I have limited funds, it would make the most sense that the cheaper options can possibly make me more money if I only plan to sell it after a day or so (and not so out of the money no one buys it)?
