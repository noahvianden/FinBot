And, you can deduct $1.70 from that amount as you calculate your P&L so it is already lower by that amount.\n\nThis will likely not be called away until expiration, or perhaps the week of expiration unless it goes much further ITM. \n\nBe aware that IWM will have a dividend coming up this month (\\~9/26?) that may have a risk of early assignment.  You can check out this to see if you are at risk as the ex-date approaches.

Looking quickly shows an additional $37 to roll out 1 week and $68 to roll out 2 weeks.  The 15 Nov shows $166 to move the date out to then.  You can keep rolling this over and over to collect more and more premium until the stock drops where you can close to keep the premium plus keep the stock as well to sell more rounds of CCs, or if the price goes a bunch higher and the stock gets called away.  \n\nYour only real risk is IWM dropping significantly, but by collecting the above premiums you are building up a cushion in case that does occur.  \n\nAgain, congrats for getting started off so sensibly as you learn!  -Scot", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are welcome and glad to hear you are well above your net stock cost!  With the profit you would make even if assigned on the divi you would not be too concerned.  Although you would miss out on the dividend itself.  A trick is to roll your trade a couple of days before the ex-div date to \"reload\" the extrinsic value that will make it less appealing to the buyer to want to exercise and get the dividend.  You end up getting more credit for the roll and also the dividend.\n\nOne of the nice things about covered calls is that when your net stock cost is below the strike price you can kick back and let the trade work without any stress.  If it expires you keep the premium but if it gets called away you make a profit on the stock plus keep the premium too!  The real risk is the stock dropping, but at your low net cost, you are not even really worried about that either!\n\nIt is normal for the call to show a negative amount as the stock moves higher and it goes ITM.  This would be the loss you would incur had you sold the call \"naked\" but does not calculate in the overall P&L that you see.  Also, as it nears expiration it will price more closely with the intrinsic value if there is any as the stock may drop back.  You will want to learn more about TOS, but if the position shows a -1 on the position page then you did sell a call, and since you own 100 shares of stock, it automatically is a covered call.  Ignore the numbers for now, or better yet call TOS and ask they explain it to you.\n\nKnowing when to roll can be a bit of an art and a lot depends on what you are working to do.  If you want to see the stock get called away and move on to another stock, then do nothing to see how it plays out.  However, if you are looking for an income stream then roll when the stock is at or close to the strike price as this will make rolling easy and usually for a good amount of premium.  You will typically roll for the same strike price, but do the math as there will be times you can move the strike price up $1 that will add to the stock profit if assigned but may only lower the credit by something less, perhaps .50. \n\nOnce you get this stock called away be sure to check out a strategy called the wheel where you can sell puts over and over without owning the stock, but then if assigned stock from the put you can sell these covered calls.  It is a way to make money on the way in and way out, but be sure to trade on stocks you don't mind holding if you have to.  Have a good evening!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.
