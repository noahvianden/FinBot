So i downgraded the Reserve to a free card, and will use the Apple Card as my daily card.\n\nSo far, my impression it's that very 'apple esque'.. Signing up takes 2 seconds, just press next few times in the wallet app, once approved, it automatically gets added to your wallet and you can use it right away. The physical card comes in a 'apple white' packaging, you just open your wallet app, and hold it up to the card, and it will automatically activate. \n\nThe experience is cool. The wallet app also has a cool visual breakdown of your spending, but alot of credit card providers are starting to do that too now, so i guess its nothing special. \n\nOverall perks, its just a regular credit card. The thick titanium physical card feels nice though. One perk, the card itself has no numbers on it.
