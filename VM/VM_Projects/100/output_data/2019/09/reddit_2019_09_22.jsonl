Publishing predictive results. This is more of a BI thing they are looking to incorporate into client reporting, but they are looking to.\n2.also a lot of firms now have thematic investing, their own styles, and again, correct, it is usually after the fact where they explain how their investments have fared. However, sometimes now they are publishing fund manager inserts where they explain why investments were made.\nCorrect again though these go to clients.\n\nEnjoyed your writeup mate", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m not familiar with the term IRM?\n\nI\u2019m a PM (portfolio manager) of quant focused credit fund. We are a little old school, but all our PMs write their fund commentary; it\u2019s more client service than anything else. The mega-platforms like surveyor, millennium, balyasny do a more consolidated type of reporting; they just have a different business model. \n\nTo your second paragraph: you can\u2019t forget that hedge funds engage in marketing and branding the same way, say, proctor & gamble or Coca Cola do. People don\u2019t think about it this way for certain companies, but you have to remember that *every* successful company brands and markets itself and that includes hedge funds (and other companies that people wouldn\u2019t normally think of having a \u2018brand\u2019 including law firms and hospitals, and so on). \n\nA ton of the terms that people throw out in regard to hedge funds (quant, smart beta, factor/factoring, fundamental, macro, etc etc) are more marketing/branding terms than anything else. I mean none of those terms are really will defined. For example, fundamental long/short is way way out of favor right now. I know a fundamental L/S PM at another shop that had some of his juniors pull down a bunch of data sets and mash then in excel and now he brands his fund as something like \u201cquant-driven bottom-up analysis with a grey box focus\u201d. None of that shit actually means anything, but it sounds good when he\u2019s raising money. You\u2019d probably be shocked at how frequently people pull shit like that. \n\nThe point is that all the stuff you\u2019re referencing is honestly more marketing than anything else. You really *never* want to put hard predictions in your market commentary bc you have to deal with your investors pulling shit like saying \u201cI think you\u2019re over exposed to housing, which I\u2019m convinced is going to tank. Lessen your exposure or I\u2019m pulling my money at the next window.\u201d  Additionally, funds tend to put on thematic trades which may leave individual investments not making sense without the context, which creates situations where clients pull the \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be long/short X\u201d. When I\u2019m meeting people in person, I can control the conversation and explain how everything fits together. \n\nAnd lastly, shitty/smaller funds are notorious for copying bigger funds, and this contributes to \u2018crowded\u2019 trades or positions becoming \u2018hedge fund hotels\u2019 (eg \u2018short BYND\u2019 is a laughably crowded hf trade right now).

In fact, this dynamic was a hidden, but very real, part of what led to the 2008 crisis. I was doing struc fin at an investment bank at the time and it turned out, after the fact, that all the banks and investors were using nearly identical models, were reading all the same research, were all putting on the same hedges, were all using the same math, stressing portfolios in the same way, etc etc etc. And when shit hit the fan, it turned out the entire structured market was serially correlated to the max.

If you think, hope, want something to be true, it's not hard to find or force data to fit it. This is doubly so when the people who make the data agree with your narrative. Small example...when you get an email that asks if you loved a product, if you say 'yes' you'll be taken to write a review, if you say \"no\" you might not be.

People who use a car a lot aren't giving it up for uber. People who didn't use a car much didn't do much to maintain it in the first place.  Really struggling to see how Uber hurts them.\n\nAmazon gaining market share - Probably correct to a certain extent.  However, car parts at least at the moment, seem like they'd be somewhat resistant to amazon.  When my mechanic needs a part he calls over to autozone and they bring it over that hour, not the next day.  When something on my car breaks that I'm going to repair  I take the broken thing to autozone and I say, \"I need a replacement for this\" and they get it for me.  Amazon currently isn't doing those things.  \n\nPeers missing earnings:  Here are the most recent earnings reports for the peers with relevant price data. Format is day before earnings > day after earnings > end of week (if day after earnings wasn't already end of week) > Friday.  You saw 3-5% declines the next day all recovering somewhat by the end of the week and at new highs currently. All of the peers have a worse history of earnings miss than autozone over the last year with the exception of AAP.  \n\nORLY 396 > 376 > 383 > 399  2 miss, 1 met, 1 beat\n\nGPC 98 > 95 > 98 3 miss 1 beat (sources differ on miss/beat, some say 2 miss, 1 met, 1 beat)\n\nAAP 142 > 136 > 137 > 156  1 miss (most recent) 3 beat\n\nAZO 1159 currently 4 beats \n\nA miss doesn't seem unlikely, but the reaction is probably going to be pretty muted given what the peers experienced.  So let's just best guess say they drop 5% matching the worst performance of their peers this earnings season.  So we're expecting them to go to 1100. Buying a weekly ATM costs us 3,000 per contract. If it stays down 5% we get $6000 at expiration.  We can sell earlier of course but given the short max duration of the trade I like to look at what happens at as a pretty good approximation of what we'll get.  So IF they miss and IF they fall as much as their worst peer did we double up.  If we want to risk less we could buy a 1140 which costs us 2200 and gets us 4000. Not quite double but risking quite a bit less.  Then at 1120 we risk 1600 and get 2000, definitely not worth it.  \n\nSo how sure are you it drops as much as ORLY did? After every peer missed you don't think people are kind of expecting AZO to miss too?  With a history of beating for the last 4 quarters you don't think they're tending to sandbag guidance a bit?  If you don't think there's a better than even chance that they do the WORST of their peers (not just miss, but do worse than everyone else) then it's a bad bet.

But it's not just that, it's generally younger people that use it the most. I forgot where I read it but something like 50% of their consumer base is aged between 17-30 or something like that. That means these people are less likely to be buying cars and less likely to be doing auto repairs. So you're right the people who do auto repairs most might still be there, but these auto parts stores don't have new consumers (millenials) coming in and their consumer base will shrink over time.\n\nAs far as how much it moves, over the last 4 reports it had an average maximum move of 7.1%. A lot of what I'm looking at is techncials though, and I won't post a chart since this sub hates TA anyways. But, I do think AZO falls back down to test $1,025-$1,030 support by next month (if it does miss).\n\n> After every peer missed you don't think people are kind of expecting AZO to miss too?\n\nNo. The stock is just off all time highs and up 38% YTD. A miss is definitely not priced in. In fact, if you compare their performance to their peers (ORLY +16% YTD, GPC +1%, AAP -1%) it has massively outperformed. And I believe with a miss they will actually see an out-sized move lower to catch up with the rest of the sector. I think AZO sees a new bearish cycle like it did in 2017.\n\n> So we're expecting them to go to 1100. Buying a weekly ATM costs us 3,000 per contract. If it stays down 5% we get $6000 at expiration.

So IF they miss and IF they fall as much as their worst peer did we double up.\n\nWell, I'm looking at a horizontal put calendar spread. The October 18th/September 27th $1,000 spread to be exact. It closed Friday at about $2.85 (though spreads are wide). The key support level I'm looking at is $1,020-$1,030 which is about 11.5% away from current prices. Let's say I'm wrong on the out-sized move, but right in the direction, and AZO falls 6% which is less than the average max move over the last 4 quarters. That would put the stock at $1,090. Current IV in the October $1,000's is about 42%, for the weekly's it's 73%. Assuming vol gets crushed down to 30% for the October's, at $1,090 on the stock the spread would be up about 70%. I'd only need AZO to fall to about $1,110 actually to break even. Even if I'm being conservative on the IV crush (that's current Jan vol), and I drop it to 25% instead.. then break even is around $1,085.\n\nThis will be a relatively small position for me though.

If we could use a simple piece of data like car sales to predict future price movement we'd all be millionaires. You have to be ahead of the curve.
