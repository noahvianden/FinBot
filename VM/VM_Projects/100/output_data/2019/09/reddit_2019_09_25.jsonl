When Tesla is lowering Price and Quantity is increasing, it is actually evidence of a demand issue.\n\nThe thesis in simplicity is that, let's say you are selling 100 cars for $100 each. The amount of people willing to pay $100 for a car is 100 people. If you want to sell 120 cars in a quarter, you will need to lower price to $95 for example.\n\nNow, how does this relate to Tesla? As Tesla has been increasing production, they've been doing two major things to match cars to a buyer: 1) expanding to new markets (which in theory shifts the demand curve) and 2) lowering the price of their cars. As they are lowering the prices of their cars (which they undeniably have), their margins are being squeezed as the drops in ASP are dropping at a rate faster than they can drop the cost of production.\n\nTo argue that the \"no demand narrative\" is dead, shows an underlying lack of understanding on what a demand curve is and how it works.
