Basically you only pay taxes on stocks once you sell. Bill Gates portfolio is majority equity so as long as he doesn\u2019t sell he won\u2019t pay taxes for it (obviously he pays taxes on dividends) but the value of an asset you hold going up is not considered income. It\u2019s only considered income if you sell. So if he owns 1000 shares of Microsoft at $1 per share and next year the value increases to $2 per share his net worth went from $1000 to $2000 but he had no income so he would not pay taxes. If he were to sell his stock then he would pay taxes on $2000-how much the stocks originally cost him.\n\n\nSource: https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax-101/", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "You pay taxes on gains and income.

We don't live like animals in the woods, thanks to their sacrifice alone.\n\n>I'm not sure about what you mean by acedemics being hated.\n\nCapitalism is inherently anti-intellectual. Many capitalists are very vocal about telling people NOT to go to college or to respect CEOs more than academics. You seem the kind of person who would follow that advice\n\n>But the rest of the people were not given a silver spoon and worked to get up there.\n\nYou're assuming that's the majority of rich people, when it's really only 0.01% of rich people today that actually weren't given a silver spoon (and just got really lucky afterwards). The vast majority of rich today didn't \"pull themselves up\" at all - they were born vastly privileged.\n\n>Rich people . . .  make our economy and society fair by creating jobs, creating new inventions\n\nRich people don't create jobs - they just tap into markets where jobs would always exist thanks to consumers. Consumers and workers create jobs.\n\nRich people don't create new inventions - workers do. Rich people simply exploit those inventors, take credit, and pocket most of the money generated by those inventions.\n\n>investing in new technology, donating to charity,\n\nThe people could just as well invest in new technology, democratically deciding where money should be invested (like NASA/JPL). We don't need rich people to create technology.\n\nCharity is a scam to get tax incentives, farm some popularity, and do absolutely nothing to help people. It is not sustainable and not viable to base a society's economic distribution on.\n\n>Wouldn't exploitation be mental work to think about how to steal work?\n\nIn that case, robbing a bank is a lot of work too, and therefore bank robbers should keep everything they steal because it's only fair! Your \"logic\" doesn't hold up. A criminal CEO is not justified by their blood and sweat spent exploiting and stealing from workers. It's unfair, parasitic, unsustainable and immoral.\n\nIn fact bank robbers are LESS evil than CEOs. At least bank robbers steal from the rich - CEOs steal from working class.\n\n>you claim that it is both slavery and exploitation but I believe they're different.\n\nNot all exploitation is slavery, but slavery \\*is\\* exploitation.\n\n>They agreed to do work for the boss, because they are okay with trading work for money\n\nThat's like saying \"the slave agreed to be a slave\". It's not true - the worker only \"agrees\" because they are subject to the boss's authority in every way, in a capitalist society. They are forced to rely on the boss's good graces to SURVIVE and feed their family.\n\n>The boss does work to . . . manage money, investments , and other things\n\nThose could very well be done by the workers, collectively. Literally no one \\*needs\\* a boss to do those things.\n\n>The boss does work to hire people, create new jobs, innovations\n\nAgain, bosses do none of those. Jobs are created through supply and demand of consumers, not the boss.\n\nInnovations are created by workers alone. You think Steve Jobs \"invented\" the iPod. No, of course not. His designers and engineers did, and pitched the idea to him.\n\nEven hiring people is most often a delegated task to other workers, so you're wrong there again.\n\n>I'd say college graduates (smart people), make more than ones who don't have degrees (dumb people). That's why many people go to college, to make more money.   \n>  \n>Only the CEOS at the top make multiple times of what their workers make.\n\nExactly - and THAT is the problem. Colleges are merely training workers to be exploited more, and make marginally more pay that  way.\n\nBut there's another hierarchy outside of academia - the hierarchy of money. Where the rich can bribe prestigious colleges to get their kids in, and billionaire CEOs have a lot more power (and influence in society) than the most respected academic experts.
