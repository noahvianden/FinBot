All prices mentioned below are the official Belgian prices, in Euro, and include 21% VAT.  Note that I have no experience with configuring a Porsche or their sales process.\n\nFirst, I pick the Taycan Turbo since I don't see the point in spending an extra 34K to go to the Turbo S.  This already puts me at 157.8 K.  I'm going with the standard rims and default paint (it was set to blue, which I like as my model S is also blue).\n\nI immediately get prompted that I have to pick a required _option_ (if it's required, why the fuck isn't it included in the base price?) and get to choose between \"Porsche Mobile Charger Connect\" (1185 euro) or \"Porsche Mobile Charger Connect incl Home Energy Manager\" (1778 euro).  Seeing as how I already consider myself to be the Home Energy Manager at my house, i'll go for the regular Porsche Mobile Charger Connect option, because let's face it, it would be nice to have the ability to actually charge my electric car.  I don't know what the extra feature would offer since the site times out when I try to press the information icon next to each option.  I'm now up to 159K.  \n\nI now have the ability to pick options for the exterior of the car... I first thought this was weird because I already picked a color.  There's a bunch of unnecessary things you can select to pimp your ride, but then I spot the option to have the side mirrors foldable.  It seems weird that this isn't included for free in a 159K car, but yes, I'm used to that feature and would like to have it.  Another 326 euro added to the total.\n\nThere's a bunch of powertrain-related options to choose from, but none of them seem absolutely necessary to me so i'll just skip those.  \n\nAh, panoramic roof... my daughter likes that a lot, so I'll add it here as well.  1754 euro's added to the total.  I'm up to 161K now.  Window tints?  Have that now as well, wouldn't wanna go without it.  544 euros.\n\nBackup camera? Didn't know i'd have to pay extra for this but sure, sign me up! 750 euro.\n\nPorsche InnoDrive including Adaptive Cruise Assist? That seems like a must-have to me... 3351 euros :o\nIt then prompts me to include one of the _heated_ steering wheel options, which is apparently required to get Adaptive Cruise Assist.  I'll go for the cheapest one, which is just a heated \"multi functional\" steering wheel.  Another 290 euro.\n\nLane change assist? Absolutely gotta have this... 847 euro.  \n\nPorsche then recommends I get the Comfort Access feature. It's basically the only way to get self-presenting door handles and keyless access.  I'm really used to this from my Model S, so yes, I want this.  1197 euro.\n\nWe are now at 168K.\n\nAh yes, I would like to be able to fold down the backseats... 520 euro.\n\nNow this is weird... the 270 kW charging speed only works on 800 volt fast chargers... if you're unlucky enough to end up at a 400 volt fast charger (meaning: the _vast_ majority of them), you'll need to get the optional On-Board 150 kW charger for an extra 459 if you want to be able to charge at over 50 kW.  There's no way in hell I'm gonna be out-charged by a fucking Kia E-Soul if I'm standing there with a Porsche so I'll have to add this as well.\n\nI can also add a heatpump to use waste heat to warm up my cabin.  It's free in my Model S, but here it costs 847 euro.\n\nAnother 314 euro gets me the Porsche Intelligent Range Manager. This basically gives speed-recommendations to optimize and minimize your charging and travel time.  My Model S has this for free and I like that information, so it looks like I should get this as well.\n\nI end up at 170K.  And most Porsche customers would know I cheaped out on the looks because I didn't get any of the options that make it look better.  It's as close to standard as it allows you.  What good is owning a Porsche if you're gonna get looked down on by other Porsche owners?\n\n2 years ago, I paid 120K for my Model S 100D.  I don't need the performance upgrade, so I could get a brand new one for 98K right now.  This car would have higher range (370 vs 335 miles), a better suspension, better screen (MCU2 vs MCU1), better cameras (AP3 vs my AP2) and a next-gen CPU (HW3 versus HW2 chip) than my 2 year old Model S.\n\nApart from the performance, I don't see how the 170K Taycan offers me anything better than what I _currently_ have on my 2 year old Model S.  Compare it to the current 98K long-range Model S and it gets even worse.  Granted, the \"cheaper\" editions of the Taycan will come out later.  But those will compare even worse to whatever the Model S will be at that time.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Great work seeing how all the \"options\" add up.

It shouldn't be an option to quick charge on existing DC fast chargers capable of 150 kW, especially when they've provided about zero of the special 800V chargers. And basic charge equipment should just be included. It's great that Porsche made an impressive EV, but they're still acting like most other automakers and don't seem interested in making it compelling beyond the brand and performance. They aren't providing the great ecosystem to use it as a daily driver, unless you cough up even more money, and that's just a shame.
