The premium market. Well, as you may or may not know, premium segment platforms have historically better profit margins than high volume economy segments (per vehicle).\n\nThis is largely why BMW has long since been the most profitable OEM in the world (very commonized engine platforms, transmissions, parts, etc while still retaining a luxury image). BMW has a very solid business model, while Daimler is maybe a bit weaker. However, Daimler is making a very good effort at trying to target lower cost segments which will improve customer engagement and retention (basically, get more people to enjoy your cars, and eventually they will buy the higher ticket cars later on). BMW has a very flat playing field though they do offer lower priced models (that seem to do better in Europe).\n\nOut of the two, my pick would be Daimler. Why? They have always invested heavily in adopting new innovative features. What has changed is seen with the A class. For once, they are attempting a pump prime approach rather than trickle down (used to be the S-Class would get all the new shit and eventually get adopted to lower cost models). Daimler also has a commanding global presence vs BMW.\n\nOut of the big 3 Germans though, it will be VAG. Despite me having personally issues with them as far as quality, they have the scariest market reach out of any OEM in the world, and have proven time and time again to adapt to global markets almost as well as Toyota, Nissan, or Honda which has been the profitable silver bullet for the Japanese since the 60's and 70's.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Super interesting, thanks for sharing your reasoning.

The brand factor is also cut down by the association Porsche has with mid engine boxster etc rather than electric especially very first electric.\n\n10x is a made up number obviously but if you take two cars on average and make one twice the price and simultaneously less practical i think you come upon 10x pretty quickly. The taycan doesn't even really take the mantle on any particular metric like the s did on straightline speed. For the price of the taycan you can probably get a stronger ICE track car and I doubt being green is much of a factor.\n\nWe'll see. It's a nice looking car. I prefer German styling over Tesla. My guess is strong start and then mediocre ongoing demand. Maybe the cheaper models do better but Porsche has to be careful with cannibalization.
