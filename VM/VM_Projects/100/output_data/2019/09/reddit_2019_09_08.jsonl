{"title": "Since I angered some Chads on /r/investing here's why I think China is the next \"big short\".", "selftext": "Fellow idiots,\n\nI posted [this comment](https://i.imgur.com/av1WTXI.png) which seems to have angered the highly sophisticated /r/investing community. I don't mind being downvoted but at least provide some counter arguments if you're going to be a dick. So in the pursuit of truth and tendies for all, I have prepared some juicy due diligence (DD) for WSB Capital on why China is on the verge of collapse.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\n\n**Point 1:**\nDefaults in China have [been accelerating aggressively](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-07/china-defaults-hit-record-in-2018-the-2019-pace-is-triple-that), and [through July 2019, 274 real estate developers filed for bankruptcy, up 50%](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3020099/bankruptcies-among-chinese-developers-are-half-amid-slowing-economy) over last year. A bonus? Many Chinese state controlled banks have been filing for bankruptcy as well. Just google \"china bank defaults\" or something similar. Notice how many articles there are from 2019? When the banking system fails, everything else usually fails too.\n\n\n**Point 2:**\n[The RMB has depreciated significantly](https://i.imgur.com/JeyxVSD.png). Last time this happened, in 2015-2016, there was a significant outflow of foreign invested capital. According to the IIF, [outflows reached $725bn due to the currency depreciation.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emerging-china-iif/china-net-2016-outflows-at-record-725-billion-iif-idUSKBN15H1FL). This time is different why again? I have heard some arguments why there will be less outflow this time, but I struggle to buy them.\n\n\n\n**Point 3:**\nDespite wanting to operate like a developed economy, China still has not been able to shrug off the [middle income trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_income_trap). Their GDP per capita is comparable to countries we [normally associated with being developing/emerging markets](https://i.imgur.com/O3rVFZF.png). Tangentially related to point 10.\n\n\n**Point 4:**\nChina is an export-dependent economy, with [about 20% of their exports contributing towards their GDP](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/China/Exports/). Less exporting means less GDP, less consumption (because businesses make less money, they pay people less, who in turn spend less), which has a greater effect on GDP than any declines in exports would have at face value. Guess what? [Chinese exports dropped 1% in August](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/08/chinas-exports-to-us-fell-16percent-in-august-as-trump-escalates-trade-war.html), and [August imports dropped -1%, marking the 5th month this year of negative m/m export growth.](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/event/49ec580e-7985-4efb-afb8-7edcbd64685a).\n\n**Point 5:**\nBusiness [confidence has been weak in China](https://i.imgur.com/oe1UtC5.png) - declining at a sustained pace worse than in 2015. When businesses feel worse, they spend less, invest less in fixed assets, hire less until they feel better about the future. Which takes me to my next point.\n\n**Point 6:** [Fixed asset investment in China has declined 30 *percentage points* since 2010](https://i.imgur.com/yy8Md2j.png). While rates are low, confidence is also low, and they are sitting on a record amount of leverage, which means they simply will not be able to afford additional investment.\n\n**Point 7:** They are an extremely levered economy with a [total debt to GDP ratio of over 300%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-debt/chinas-debt-tops-300-of-gdp-now-15-of-global-total-iif-idUSKCN1UD0KD), per the IIF, which also accounts for roughly 15% of *global total fucking debt*. Here's an interview with [someone else talking about it too](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/chinas-debt-levels-amid-its-slowing-economy.html).\n\n**Point 8:** Their central bank recently introduced a [metric fuckton of stimulus into their economy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-06/china-cuts-banks-reserve-ratio-to-ramp-up-easing-support). This will encourage more borrowing....add fuel to the fire. Moreover, the stimulus will mechanically likely weaken the RMB even more, which could lead to even more foreign outflows, which are already happening, see next point. \n\n**Point 9:** Fucking LOTS of outflows this year. As of MAY, according to [this joint statement](https://www.amcham-shanghai.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/Joint_survey_on_tariffs_May_2019.pdf), around 40% of US companies are relocating some portion of their supply chains away from mainland. This was in May. Since May, we have seen even more tariffs imposed, why WOULD companies want to stay when exporting to the US is a lot more expensive now?\n\n**Point 10:** Ignoring ALL of the points above, we are in a global synchronized slowdown, with [many emerging market central banks cutting rates - by the most in a decade](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/EMERGING-RATES-FACTBOX/0H001QETE864/index.html). Investors want safety, and [safe-haven](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/daily_trading_lesson/2018/12/13/safe-haven-currencies.html) denominated assets are where we have seen a lot of flocking into recently. Things that can be considered safe-havens have good liquidity, a relatively stable economy, and a predictable political environment.\n\nWould love to hear opposing thoughts if you think China is a good buy. I am not against China, nor any other country for that matter, but I am against losing money (yes, wrong sub etc.), and I can not rationalize why anyone would be putting in a bid.\n\n***TL;DR: the bubble is right in front of your face, impending doom ahead, short everything, fuck /r/investing.***\n\n\nEdit, since you 'tards keep asking me how to trade this, there are a few trades that come to mind:\n\n* US treasuries still have room to run (before the autists say that's not yolo enough you could trade OTM calls on UST-linked ETFs, US govvie futures for gainz)\n\n* Japanese yen\n\n* Sell SPX companies with big supply chain exposure and heavy cost of capital, buy their competitors without these features.\n\n* Open up apparel factories in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and sell to the US.\n\n* Buy soybeans assuming farmers get a bailout from US\n\n* I am sure there are plenty of China based ETFs which could be played, DYOR.\n\n* Short any US listed company with mainland China domicile. If shit REALLY hits the fan between US/China, there are levers that US Govt. can pull to fuck them.\n\n\n^^*not ^^investment ^^advice*", "id": "d1dsb9", "created_utc": 1567962987.0, "score": 1567, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 456, "comments": [{"body": "Should I read this", "score": 960, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely not", "score": 324, "replies": [{"body": "fuck u mom, I might live in your basement but u can't tell me what to do", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "https://i.redd.it/hbuyifdqzq211.jpg", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10506471246480942}, {"body": "r/SweetHomeAlabama", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10898677259683609}, {"body": "hey leave your mother alone she has the finest titty milk in all of mainland chyna", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2732516825199127}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.016281332820653915}, {"body": "Dont tell me what to do you asshole.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "https://i.redd.it/hbuyifdqzq211.jpg", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "A society that requires \u2018/s\u2019 after every joke.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12229262292385101}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20226095616817474}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0536586195230484}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09991660714149475}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 324, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe", "score": 111, "replies": [{"body": "No", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "Tendies.", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "How do I PUT the entirety of China for Tendies?", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "YANG", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "2020", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15716451406478882}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24074748158454895}, {"body": "Wtf is a tendie", "score": -10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5145546197891235}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5795252919197083}, {"body": "I see an article or reddit post like this saying China is about to flop every few months over the last 8 years.

Basically there is tons of real estate speculation, because it makes far more sense for people to put money into real estate rather than equities since they are so volatile and non-transparent, and there's lots of bribery, corrupt money, etc. - so that money has to go somewhere.  Chinese citizens can't really invest outside of the country due to capital controls, so it goes into real estate.\n\n> Point 2 - Yuan Valuation\n\nYeah, but this will affect the trade balance and increase exports.  If the Yuan goes down by 25% but the US puts a 25% tariff on all Chinese goods, that's a 0% change from the standpoint of importers, volume will stay the same.\n\n> Point 3 - GDP Per Capita\n\nYeah, China is huge, if you're talking about the whole coastal area and about 100 miles inland, that area has exploded phenomenally in terms of GPD per capita growth.  Rest of the country has dragged things down, but it could expand in the future for sure, particularly with the belt road initiative.  Also this area acts as a sink for costs which again helps exports.\n\n> Point 4 - Exports\n\nYeah but only 3% of that GDP involves trade with the US, basically 18% of exports, and arguably the export rate has dropped from 20% down to 17%, so that may be more like 2% now. The US is the only country putting pressure on China, we only have leverage over about 3% of that export trade, which has been shrinking as a percentage of their domestic economy because their domestic economy has been growing (because it's a developing economy, hundreds of millions of non-coastal areas wanting more luxuries).\n\n> Point 5 - Business Confidence\n\nTide goes in, tide goes out...you can't explain that.\n\n> Point 6 - Fixed investment\n\nYeah because they literally had no roads prior to 1980, and then they spent 30 years building roads and other stuff necessary to have a country.  Shenzhen was a fishing village with 30,000 people in 1980, now has 18 million people and a building taller than the Sears Tower.  Looking at the percentage change is misleading because they had such massive fixed asset investments in the decade prior - it was like the USA from 1870-1900.\n\n> Point 7: They are an extremely levered economy with a total debt to GDP ratio of over 300%, per the IIF, which also accounts for roughly 15% of global total fucking debt. Here's an interview with someone else talking about it too.\n\nThis is different than public debt.  US Public debt is around 102%, while China's public debt is around 52%.\n\nThe US Private debt was around 200% in 2017:\n\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/private-debt-to-gdp\n\nUSA TOTAL Debt = 102%+200% = 302%\n\nChina TOTAL Debt = ~300%\n\nSo it's about the same.\n\n> Point 8 - Stimulus (or lack there of?)\n\nYou know what other tool the Central Government has other than bank stimulus?  State-owned enterprises - that accounts for like 40% of the asset value of their economy.  For the US - well, we owned a huge amount around 2008-2012, but sold them off, but I don't have numbers.  The US owns the postal service, Amtrak, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FED, NASA...?  Chinese government owns steel companies, telecom companies, banks, utilities etc...all of those institutions are super inefficient probably...like if the post office were your internet provider.\n\n> Point 9 - \"We're moving out of China.\"\n\nYeah, that's bullshit.  No they aren't.  They are releasing that statement to sound good, but in reality they are looking to lower costs.  If they can lower costs by moving to Vietnam, they will do that.  However if the Yuan goes down, they will make more orders back in their China facilities.  It's all about making a buck.\n\n> Point 10 - Entire world dying\n\nYeah, that doesn't matter, because if everyone loses their shirt, then I guess buy gold or some other asset that does not involve human effort, not not-China.  Just short humans in general.\n\n\n---\nI guess overall when you say, \"Short China,\" - the question is over what time period?  Short-term, they are probably going to be fine, relative to the rest of the world.  That being said, there is a lot of political instability, so that makes things risky.  All of the economic indicators are halfway decent except real estate.  However if there is some kind of political revolution, they are fucked.  I have no idea what or if anything will happen.\n\nI think we could just see China go sideways for decades, it could go up again, or there could be some kind of huge revolution and it could collapse...tough to predict.  I don't think shorting China within the next 90 days or 6 months is a guarantee by any means at all...they have a lot going for them.  We in the US tend to think of ourselves as the only country on earth, in reality we are only 20% of the Global Economy, not 100%, China sells everywhere and is diversified.\n\nChina is not really as brain-warped as North Korea, but they are slightly brain-warped, and extremely nationalistic.  I would guess that 90% of Chinese people are very pro-China.  That serves as a sort of currency as well.  Because what is currency, anyway?  All currency really is...is people's shared belief that a piece of paper will continue to be tradable for a physical good at a future date, as remediated by a third party.  Well, if you have 800 million people who think that third party is solid, you have a currency, regardless if the rest of the 7 billion other people don't think that.
