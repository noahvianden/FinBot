From 131 to 147 about 1,600 dollars. \n\nYou would not mind if the 146 short call were exercised, and carried to expiration in the money, perhaps.

Ratio back spread would be a short call near the money, two long calls away from the money, enter for a small net credit. \n  \nThere is a technique on the bullish side, when the stock goes down, to use a ratio spread, buy call, near the money and sell  two calls out of the money, with the intent of getting the options for little or no cost, with the use of collateral, called \"stock repair\". \n\nIf the underlying swings up modestly: the stock goes up, the long call goes up, and the two short calls may not be reached, and the premium is kept.  If the underlying swings down, the loss is not increased (for the options--the stock still loses), if the ratio spread was entered for a credit. \n\nOption Repair Strategy - Schwab    \nhttps://www.schwab.com/active-trader/insights/content/the-option-repair-strategy\n\nI have not done this ever, but...\n\nFlipping the stock and option repair concept upside down,  \nusing ratio spread with short stock, that would entail:   \n- long put at the money,  \n- and two short puts farther from the money,   \n- for a small net credit, and requiring collateral.   \n\nOn a down swing the long put gains,  the short stock gains, and maybe the short puts expire out of the money. \n\nYou would have to decide when to close this, on a swing down, and take \"good enough\" gains on the swing down, and close the long on the ratio spread, and the short stock; perhaps let the short puts continue to decay to expiration.\n\nGiven the trend of interest rates downward and TLT upward, it seems likely the swings down will be only a couple of dollars between 147 and maybe 143 before resuming upwards, the swings occurring as they have been for the last couple of weeks.   \n\nSo, you could swing trade that ratio spread on down moves, to obtain gains to reduce the loss on short stock.  \n\nI guess you could confidently have several ratio spreads of this nature, (for a net credit) if you're confident that TLT is not going to swing too far down, with the potential risk that TLT continues upwards and the ratio spreads don't help that much, but you keep the option credit premium. \n\nHope that gives some perspective.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great thoughts.
