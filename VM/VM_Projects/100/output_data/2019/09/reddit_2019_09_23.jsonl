And of course there will be trades I lose ($1.20 - $2.00), so it's just about that 70% probability overall.\n\nI just want to make sure I'm not missing something crucial if I decide to go ahead and start this strategy tomorrow (which I won't, just saying).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The first example would be if you sold a put spread at 30 delta and SPY shoots so far past it that you are basically at max loss.

However, I noticed when I plugged these trades into TOS my payoff seemed to take a lot longer to mature than I anticipated. \n\nPlease feel free to chime in with any info you can offer about trading calendars and diagonals but essentially I am trying to understand what exactly are the optimal conditions for trading calendars in your opinion and how do you structure your trades to reach your desired profitability while maintaining your risk?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> SPY double calendar: -1 10/2 292p 305c, +1 10/18 293p 305c @ 2.44 db (opened 9/17)\n> \n> SPY double calendar: -1 10/18 289p 304c, +1 11/15 289p 304c @ 4.20 db (opened 9/26)\n\nThese calendars are widely spaced, and subject to sag as shown in the T+1 profit and loss line in the Think or Swim analyze tab.  \n\nI would be inclined to space the calendar spreads around 4 or 5 or so points apart upon opening the trade initially, measuring from the short strike to the short strike.  \n\nThat would necessitate a third, or fourth calendar spread, to attempt to cover the \"expected move\" range of SPY, all of this to reduce the profit and loss line's sag as the calendars mature. \n\nFor the Oct 2nd calendar spreads, you could manage the trade, presuming SPY does not jump up to 303, and if SPY goes down on Monday, or stays the same, around 295.50, you could exit for a modest gain, and if SPY goes up moderately, you could buy a call calendar around 298 or 299 to lift the sag, and also harvest the calendar at 305 by closing it (likely out of range to be useful).  \n\nOn the Oct 18 calendar spreads (with Nov. longs), I would be inclined to place an additional calendar spread around 295 or 296 to eliminate the sag, or alternatively might look at adding a new pair, one at 294 and another at 299. \n\nCalendars are subject to volatility adversity, and this is a reason that traders tend to put them on when Implied Volatility is fairly low, so that the chances of the IV going even lower are limited.   The profit in a calendar resides in the long leg, and that leg is valuable to you when the IV rises, and less valuable when the IV declines. \n\nWe are in a moderately high volatility regime, with the VIX around 14 to 20 , and calendars benefit from a low volatility regime, with the vix around 12 or so.  The reason for seeking to place them when IV is low, is if you buy a calendar when the volatility is high, say VIX at 18, the calendars can suffer from implied volatility value decline when SPY goes up and the IV goes down.    If the trade is placed when the VIX is at 13, and the volatility goes up, the calendars will typically gain. \n\nThe Vega for both trades is around 30, which means for every point the Implied Volatility drops, the trade value will go down about $30.    \n\nEspecially with a position with sags in the middle of the strikes.   \n\nGavin McMaster at Options Trading IQ usually has educational things to say.  \nHere is his survey of calendars.

And you may not have to wait to near expiration. \n\nSome traders also will put on a large calendar, out of the money, two or three months out, waiting for a down move, and taking the modest gain from increased IV, and an early exit for a gain, without waiting for maturation.  \n\nAn example of such an idea at this time might be:   \nBUY +10 CALENDAR SPY 100 17 JAN 20/20 DEC 19 280 PUT @1.23 LMT\n\nFor $1,250, and ten contracts  the trade has a Vega of 90.

He really tip-toes on the lines quite often, and the tone he uses is often just slightly abrasive enough to get the other party riled up.  It\u2019s usually not outright snark anymore (a couple of warnings ago took care of that), but I honestly feel that he brings a lot of this on himself.

We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.\n\nSolarCity going bankrupt would have not only hurt Elon (and apparently SpaceX) financially, it could have killed the myth of Elon The Visionary. This myth is probably what keeps his companies together and innovating more than any other thing in particular.\n\nJust imagine trying to ramp up Model 3 while also facing headlines of the sister company going bankrupt.

People are just way too much in debt. We're at the point where people are taking on life-long debt for immediate daily purchases. They don't save anything, and they're not going to be able to take on any more debt. Soon enough, people will start defaulting. And they're going to be defaulting on decades of debt, not just a payday loan.\n\nGovernment debt - the government is already in way too much debt, and it's taking on hundreds of billions every year just to keep operating. Any real stimulus to save the consumer economy will require taking on even more debt. I guess you could argue they can just write off their debt and never pay it; the result of that I guess would be bad.\n\nIn summary, no I don't think corporate debt is the next bubble because it's being propped up by government and rich people.
