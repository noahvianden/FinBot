Shoreline Blvd., Mountain View, CA 94043. \n\nIs anyone going to the Annual Shareholder Meeting?  What do you think should be addressed?  \n\nI am not able to attend, but I hope that someone at the meeting brings up the following issues:\n\n1. **Badly missed guidance.**  Production and deliveries of Model S and X in Q1 '19 was *far below* the expectations set in the Q4 '18 announcements.  Delivering only 12,100 Model S and X was only 50-60% of guidance.  Investors still don't have clear answers as to why this happened and what Tesla is doing to counteract the revenue loss.  This needs to be addressed.  \n2. **Elon's behaviour.**  The \"pedo\" tweet, insulting the SEC on the television programme \"60 Minutes\", and plainly incorrect statements that existing shareholders might be able to hold their shares within a privatized Tesla, are IMO damaging the company's brand and potentially deterring customers.  People spending a lot of money on a car want to know that the company is well run and stable.  When the top man is picking unnecessary fights and demonstrating erratic behaviour, that causes some people to question whether the company has it together.  \n3. **Board oversight.**  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-27/tesla-chair-defends-musk-tweets-even-as-habit-lands-him-in-court](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-27/tesla-chair-defends-musk-tweets-even-as-habit-lands-him-in-court) : *\u201cI don\u2019t think he poses any challenges,\u201d Denholm said. \u201cThe company is running very well and the board itself is very engaged. We meet with him all the time.\u201d*  This is oversight?  **If the company was \"running well\", why did things go from \"cash flow positive every quarter going forward\" to \"tiny profit possible in Q1 '19\" to \"700M loss, possible recovery in Q3 '19\".**\n\nI have very high confidence in Tesla's products and technology.

It's pretty obvious that there was a massive pull forward in demand with the $7K govt incentive, S/X struggled due to challenges with swapping out the drive train, and 3's struggle was international logistics. Q1 also had lots of one time costs, and don't forget they are dumping $300M+ quarterly into FSD.

I'm from Europe, btw.  \nSUVs are growing as a segment globally afaik, including in Europe. People here historically mostly preferred small and efficient cars as well as hatchbacks for the storage space.

They are buying a lot more smaller form factor cars, Honda Jazz/fit, Toyota Yaris type cars because they are more space constrained in their high density areas.\n\nWe probably would have to look at numbers to make that determination. There are different preferences depending on socio-economic status. Many people can't afford anything else but others explicitly prefer large cars.  \nMy knowledge on this is only anecdotal as well, mostly from conversations like this or vlogs that I follow, like [these](https://www.youtube.com/user/serpentza/search?query=chinese+cars) [two](https://www.youtube.com/user/churchillcustoms/search?query=chinese+car), or [Gali's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1LAjODfg7dnSSrrPGGPPMw/search?query=nio).  \nI *think* that the country is large enough to accommodate one Tesla factory but it's possible that the Model 3 falls exactly in between the two classes of people, right above affordability yet right below status.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I would definitely say they\u2019ll max our a GF or even 2 no worries.

The only parts that actually matter in a response are 1. the admissions and denials and 2. the defenses.\n\nIf you want to examine the actual legal arguments made by Musk's team, turn to Judge Wilson's [order denying the MtD](https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/3cddrxs4o/california-central-district-court/vernon-unsworth-v-elon-musk/).\n\nI'll quote the major thesis sentences wherein the judge lays out Musk's arguments, since I have a feeling you won't actually read the order yourself:\n\n>Defendant contends that his motion \u201cboils down to a single question: Accepting [Plaintiff\u2019s] well-pleaded allegations as true, would a reasonable reader believe that [Defendant\u2019s] statements were supported by objective facts or were instead \u2018nonactionable opinion\u2019?\u201d Dkt. 30 at 5. Defendant argues that his statements constitute nonactionable opinion.\n\n>Defendant makes two arguments regarding the general context. First, he argues that statements on unmoderated internet forums are presumptively opinion because \u201c[i]nternet speech is unique.\u201d\n\n>Defendant also contends that speech on Twitter, in particular, is subject to a \u201cheavy presumption\u201d of opinion.\n\n>Second, Defendant argues that his statements were in the middle of a back-and-forth with\nPlaintiff, which weighs in favor of nonactionable opinion.\n\n>Taken as a whole, the broad context of Defendant\u2019s tweets does not cast doubt on the possibility that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Defendant\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements implied assertions of objective fact.\n\n>Defendant argues that his statements used the same sort of imaginative and non-literal insults\nthat courts deem opinion.\n\n>Defendant also suggests that his statements were colloquial and thus were not reasonably\ninterpreted as statements of fact.\n\n>Defendant contends that Defendant expressed uncertainty, showing that his statements did not\nhave a concrete factual foundation.\n\n>Defendant additionally contends that the allegations are nonactionable opinion because readers\ndid not interpret them as factual assertions.\n\nAnd here is the judge's summary of the legal arguments, quoted *in full*:\n\n>In sum, considering the totality of the circumstances\u2014including the general context of Defendant\u2019s statements, the specific context of the statements, and the statements\u2019 susceptibility of being proved true or false\u2014a reasonable factfinder could easily conclude that Defendant\u2019s statements, as pleaded in the Complaint, implied assertions of objective fact\n\nNotice something that's conspicuously absent: any discussion of reputational harm. Why? Because it's moot, thanks to the *per se* presumption. That is a complete and total non-starter of an argument, and Musk's lawyers know this, which is why they did not bring it up at all in their MtD.

FSD and the Tesla Network was clearly the direction the company was going for years, and the introduction of the FSD chip was an event that was forecast long in advance.  It was a perfect opportunity for a deep dive into the chip and the FSD program, which is what they did.\n\nThe press and short sellers of course spun this differently and they will continue to.
