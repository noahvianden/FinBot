You may be more informed than the average investor, but its likely most average investors arent touching Tesla stock. \n\nI'd call a solar roof and power wall a battery company, not an energy company. They arent directly providing energy, merely providing a consumer product for people to produce there own.

Also, these analysts, they're responsible for exploring many other companies so their attention is divided.\n\nP.S. - some of these analysts post extreme price targets, like $10 and $36 because it gets them headlines. You really think a car company that did $22bn in revenue last year is worth only $2bn total? I don't think you do, and I don't think these analysts believe their own price targets either.

Take a look at the market share of launches year over year : https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/07/as-the-spacex-steamroller-surges-european-rocket-industry-vows-to-resist/3/\n\nThey will keep losing market share as they simply cannot compete with reusable rockets. \n\nAs for Tesla, well there is 3 major things that I see they are trying to do and that are very achievable.\n\n1) full autonomous driving. Everyone in the industry is making progress in this space. But afaik Tesla is the only one using camera, everyone else uses lasers.  Cameras require a more advanced AI (which Elon is betting on) because you are more or less asking the computer to analyse what he sees like a human does.  If he turns out to have the winning bet on this, Tesla\u2019s tech could have a significant edge over competitor\n\n2) Regardless of 1, Full Autonomous driving is coming. This is guaranteed. If it takes 2 years or 10 years for regulation to keep up, thats up for debate but its coming fast. Tesla recently announced their vision of \u201crobotaxis\u201d which, needless to say, would be a extremely disruptive. Imagine basically calling a uber but instead of a human showing up, an AI cars shows up and drives you. This is no longer science fiction. Their vision also includes customers being able to opt in their Tesla into the robotaxi\u2019s fleet. It makes sense when you think about how useless cars are 99% of the time. They are just sitting in a parking spot for the vast majority of the day. I\u2019d rather just commit my car to a fleet and earn revenue.\nThis is disruptive because it drastically reduce the cost of \u201crenting a driver\u201d, human taxis will not be able to keep up. At one point, it might also not make sense to own a car either (car as a service).\n\n3) Tesla trucks. Trucks are a large part of how we move things around. Again this entire industry will get disrupted by robots. Shipping companies ultimately make money on volume and time. Having a robot that can drive 24/7 for free is obviously a no brainer. \n\nTesla is not the only one doing these things.

I am not a fan of Tesla at all, for one simple reason, it over promises and under deliver. \n\nRegarding Russian rocket technology, you forget that Russia is under US sanction.

Jerome's customer-facing facade may be pleasant, however internally to Tesla he's extremely difficult to work with, abrasive (borderline abusive), and power-hungry. If you ever get the chance to peek behind the curtain and watch Jerome hold a meeting, you'll see episodes of him berating some of the hardest working engineers in the business, constantly interrupting them, ignoring data presented to him (that he had asked for), losing his temper, threatening knee-jerk firings, and storming off. It is a toxic environment. Maybe it's a common occurrence in most high-profile, high-pressure corporations that is rarely aired out. However the sad part is that those traits indicate a lack of maturity, a lack of true leadership, and are symptomatic of him not being able to handle the stress of Tesla effectively. It's true that after Elon, he probably has the most amount of responsibility (read: stress) at Tesla, however this is something that he certainly needs to work on before I think he can be alluded to as a \"legend\". He has certainly been the face of many successful programs, but as with most leaders, their teams are really the ones doing the hard work.  \n  \nI thought this comment summed up my own evaluation well:  \n  \n> This scenario unfortunately happens in a lot of companies.

Still, even a long-term investor typically aims to make a profit. No matter how much one loves a company \u2013 if the shares tank, it's still a bad investment.\n\nAs for the idea of influencing the share price: There are several problems with that scenario.\n\nRetail money isn't anywhere near enough to move the needle for the share price or public offerings.

However, Model 3 production \u2013 which was supposed to be the key to profitability \u2013 is still way behind the original projections, and instead of the promised profits, the company recorded the worst quarter in its history.

If, e.g., they do indeed manage to master Level 5 autonomy with the next 12 months, they won't have to worry about being able to raise capital, as that would put them far ahead of the competition and be evidence of money well spent.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the company keeps up its recent history of delays and losses with no real FSD in sight, retail investor money won't be anywhere near enough to stabilize the share price.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6313797235488892}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Investors interested in Tesla as a way to make money include people who take short positions.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "In the broadest definition, yes.

I believe Musk is the Devil Reincarnate. Hah, no but I'll explain myself with a wall of text.\n\nA few years back, I only had a cursory knowledge of Musk and thought he was a true visionary genius trying to save the planet as that was the narrative told and thought Tesla was cool. Then one day I saw Musk dismissing public transit and got really curious about him.\n\nI discovered pretty much everything about him being a genius engineer and a savior of the environment is just a false narrative. He's a very motivated and smart entrepreneur but even then Musk does not really have any track record of running a successful ongoing business, in fact the story at Paypal says he's not really fit to be a CEO, at least not at a company like Tesla, a large manufacturing company first and foremost.\n\nSpeaking of the public transit and Tesla, I also noticed a concerning trend. Those who liked Tesla online tend to agree with Musk on his dismissal of public transit, for mostly the same reason, \"it sucks\". There I really saw Musk as an active threat to environmentalism because he was basically selling the idea of consumerism - buy our cool luxury vehicle and it'll solve our problems! - instead of solving real problems which is a lot tougher, and it was having an effect on some of the general public.\n\nThus I began to look at Tesla with a high skepticism. As mentioned previously his opinion on public transit - it sucks and I don't want to share space with strangers - pretty much told me that Musk doesn't really care about saving the planet outside of it being a cool futurology idea where he can be the king. It was a bonus to find out Musk even had his private jet flying in LA just so that he could save 20 mins or so while spending an awful lot of time making dank tweets. \n\nI mostly am clueless with accounting and business but have some basic knowledge. After looking at the financial statements and running numbers through [Damadoran's Excel model](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/blog/teslavaluation.xls), I just couldn't figure out how Telsa could justify the market cap. It just made no sense since we knew how car companies and energy companies were valued at, and I was very skeptical of any self-driving deployment in near future, not just for technical reasons but so many potential legal ones too. I listened to Gerber and other bulls but I couldn't really see any upside that wasn't wildly optimistic.\n\nFinding out how the Solarcity acquisition went down and later the \"Funding Secured\" fiasco were just the cherry on top that really made me decide Musk was the type of entrepreneur who would have success with making early exits but should never be given a CEO job at Tesla because he's a narcissistic huckster at heart, albeit obviously a smart man who really wanted to be a cool visionary. For a tech start up a being a huckster to some extent is required if you want to make it. However I don't think that's the right mindset for Tesla, you need a \"stable genius\". (sorry)\n\nAlso furthering the comment on the environmentalism, I see Musk as a false idol in the cult of science where \"brilliant\" individuals with easy cool prepackaged solutions are offered  as the antidotes to whatever ailments we have in our society. I suppose raising awareness and getting the public excited about science are all good but not when someone rides the tide to boost his unprofitable business and unrealistically large ego as well as the high lifestyle that comes with it.\n\nSo that's why I post at those two anti-Musk anti-Tesla forum and enjoy the snark there. However I'd never go out of my way to post such negativity in other Tesla-related places. It just doesn't work even though I really think having a skeptical voice is crucial in making a rational investment choice. When a company's value isn't in its financial statements, one should really think hard before investing into it and what kind of downside and upside there are. For that reason I thought getting rid of the Enron comparison was bad too as at least it was argued with some semblance of evidence whether it's valid or not. \n\nSorry for the long trite Tesla-hater speech, and I still wish all of you best of luck regardless of my feelings on Tesla and Musk.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "e: **Also**,  \n\n> /r/realtesla and /r/enoughmuskspam poster here.\n\nGiven that your account is four years old and you only have 503 karma to your name it's fair to say that you're safe.

But it is also a false dichotomy. He can care about the environment a lot and simultaneously pursue that in a way that pushed for it on the automotive rather than mass-transit front first and foremost.  \nIt's the same deal with Green politicians or environmentalists who push for an exit of nuclear technology prior to the end of fossil fuels, in the age of anthropogenic climate change. These beliefs are not mutually exclusive and moreover, it has not been established that BoringCo or Hyperloop are entirely at odds with mass transit, always and forever.\n\n> I mostly am clueless with accounting and business but have some basic knowledge.

The value is drastically different between viewing it as a car company in the now, versus a growth/technology company going into the future. And I really mean **significantly.** That's also part of why the valuation has been dropping recently. Some people are increasingly doubting that the company will manage to pull its vision and transition off and fear that it will forever stay as merely a car company as it is now.\n\n> Also furthering the comment on the environmentalism, I see Musk as a false idol in the cult of science where \"brilliant\" individuals with easy cool prepackaged solutions are offered as the antidotes to whatever ailments we have in our society.

A good future in which solutions to problems are pursued and perceived as interesting has a lot of value. And in the face of incrementalism and \"climate delayers\" I'd say that every push is needed.

He told me in conversation that Musk may not always follow what you say but he has and continues to have a much closer business relationship and a better sense because he's done multiple millions of dollars of business with him for Space X and the likes of Richard Branson for his airplanes; his view of Musk is far more respectful. He praises him for his overall deep knowledge and willingness to learn from others- yes his hard headed-ness but also of his business sense in making deals.\n\nIf anything there was for me to criticize as an outsider/investor it would be to Musk to pick one of his endeavors to laser focus on and let others manage each of the others as he's spread way too thinly.\n\n So to make the round and generalized assumptions based on things you are not privy to I think is just an exercise.

I have no money involed, I support the rise of ev's, im not in the insurance or dealership business, and im not a troll. Im genuinly just fascinated by how tesla operates as a company. I was first interested when there was the OSHA scandal last summer where elon apparently cut down on safety becuase \"he hated the color yellow\". After reading that the only question I could ask is how is a company operating but making decisions like this? So that lead to more and more research and a lot of skepticism on whether tesla could survive in the long term as a company.

No. The issue is when things start to look good for tesla they are now suddenly wrong and instead of admitting it they just dig their heels in. In the end they just want to be right more than anything else to sometimes a selfish extent. \n\nAlso, not everyone there wants tesla to fail, there's a common though that tesla just cant exist in its current state. The idea that tesla can go bakrupt and shed a lot of it's issues like the remnants of solar city (or for some people elon musk) so that they could continue into the future as a profitable automobile manufacturer.

In October of last year, as Tesla's stock broke down to new lows, Musk started shopping for some super-jumbo mortgages on the mansions he owns. He was able to borrow around $50 million against those homes in December. Was he doing that borrowing to pay off some of his loans collateralized with TSLA shares?\u00a0\n\nFor the first time in years, Musk had a small reduction (relatively speaking) in the number of shares he's using as collateral for his borrowing. We only get an update on the shares being used as collateral once a year (in a small footnote in the proxy materials for the annual meeting); little additional information is available to the public-shareholders about this borrowing -- even though, about 40% of Musk's TSLA-holdings are pledged as collateral for his borrowing, and the company specifically names this borrowing as a risk-factor that could -- if Musk defaults on the loans -- negatively affect the share-price.\n\nIn 2018 Musk had 13,774,897 shares pledged as collateral in these loans; in 2019 we now see he has 13,394,056 shares pledged as collateral -- that's a reduction of about 380,000 shares he's using as collateral.\u00a0\n\nThe stock price recovered after it hit its lows in October; if the investment banks (who know all the terms of this borrowing, even while the public-shareholder is \"in the dark\") knew Musk was shopping for mortgages -- and there would be a pay-off on the loans Musk had likely gone into technical default on -- they would have been able to trade on this information -- they'd even \"control it\" if they were a lender in the mortgage deals as they could alter the terms giving Musk time on when payments would be due.\n\nMusk is wealthy on-paper, due to the large number of TSLA shares that have been given to him as part of his compensation package, but has little in the way of liquid assets. I think it's likely at least some of the money he's borrowed recently was used to pay off a tranche of debt he's taken out using TSLA shares as collateral.\"", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": ">Yea I mean they for sure get bought\n\nNo, they don't.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.60727858543396}, {"body": "He can put up more $, I think, and he recently mortgaged 5 houses for like $60mm\u2014maybe to hedge against this.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow good for him.
