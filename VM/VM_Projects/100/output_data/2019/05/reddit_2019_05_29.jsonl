You can remove your obligation to buy the stock if the price drops by buying back the same option for less than you sold it for, and you keep the difference. So if you sold a 123 put, and the stock runs to 130, the option is probably heavily depreciated and you can buy it for cheaper. The same strike and same expiration.\n\nSo when you BUY calls, you have a limited risk (the cost of your call(s)) but theta(time) works against you. So if the price goes down it loses value and as time passes it loses value. If your call lost 90% of its value, chances are the strike price is unlikely to be hit and is far out of the money. I recommend holding the call until expiration, as you have more to gain if AAPL reverses than lose at this point.

That\u2019s not to say that Netflix has nothing going on outside of Stranger Things (I love Black Mirror, GLOW, and a few other shows they produce) but rather that content is a very hit or miss process and if you don\u2019t have the quality backlog of content like Disney, HBO/Warner, NBCU, and Viacom does then you are going to be much more dependent on generating smash hits year in and year out. \n\nSo Netflix will end up being a lot more dependent on producing hit content than relying on having a lot of content pulled from various other sources and originals.

{"title": "we're fucked", "selftext": "Fellow Degenerates,\n\nAs most of you (probably) know, it's looking like a recession is imminent. This is because of a few things:  \n\\- The trade war with China will make importing/exporting goods harder both ways (RIP the slave labor gravy train)  \n\\- President Donald Trump\u2019s trade frictions are also a risk to the economy, and the Fed could potentially become too aggressive in its interest rate hikes and accidentally do the economy harm.\n\n\\- Economists also point to the \u201cyield curve\u201d as a sign an economic downturn is coming **\u2014** a wonky indicator of what\u2019s to come. As [**Robert Samuelson at the Washington Post**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-feds-crucial-choice-on-rates-this-week/2018/12/16/b72b512e-ffcc-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f79f253936f3) recently explained, the yield curve refers to the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates, generally on Treasury notes. Normally, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates, because it\u2019s riskier for investors to lend money for longer periods of time. When short-term rates get higher than long-term rates, the yield curve becomes \u201cinverted,\u201d and that\u2019s often a bad indicator. [**Every US recession**](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2018-07.pdf) for the past 60 years was preceded by an inverted yield curve.\n\n\\- Some (but not all) factors also [point to a potential slowdown](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/housing-market-perspectives/2018/housing-indicators-to-watch) in the housing sector.\n\n\\- The Federal Reserve can usually cut interest rates in the event of an economic downturn, but because right now they\u2019re relatively low, the Federal Reserve has less room to maneuver. And the US already has a lot of debt, meaning there will likely be more political and economic resistance to government spending if a recession does hit. \u201cIn many ways, the recent tax cuts and spending increases have actually made it even harder for us to fight the next recession,\u201d Goldwein said.\n\nThe question now is more of a when than if. A recession will most likely not start in 2019, but things are looking shakier as we go into 2020 and 2021. That being said, keep an eye out for other factors that could point to a recession. I know you guys don't really like this kind of stuff, but this time, it's [important](https://i.redd.it/z35ub2tl0eh11.gif). This is something that has the potential to severely damage you and your financial wellbeing. Don't be afraid to sell. As for long term investments, try to stay away for a little bit. If you're trying to make a quick buck, you can still do so - there's just much more risk. After all, there's more than plenty to gain on the ride back up after a recession. ***Just don't get yourself caught in the downturn.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Long term investments aren't the best idea. Hold them for now. Short-term investments are still fine - there's just more risk. Pay close attention to the market/signs and don't be afraid to pull out if you think something bad will happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's just my two cents. Better safe than sorry. Stay safe out there, bois.  \nI'd love to see your guys' thoughts.\n\n\\- u/ccamaisa", "id": "bu87j3", "created_utc": 1559091704.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "My (unqualified) opinion is still the same.

I bought in hard because on August 1st, 2012, AMD announced that they'd hired Jim Keller. Keller is a legendary CPU architect. He designed DEC's Alpha 21164 and 21264 CPUs, Apple's A4 and A5, AMD's K8 (which made them competitive with Intel at the time), and many other chips.\n\nWhen I heard he was coming back, I knew what would happen. AMD would become competitive, at least in the CPU space, once again. Keller is one of the most respected CPU architects on Earth. When he talks, everyone listens.\n\nThat said... this is a wave you're only going to be able to ride for about 3-4 more years, and here's why. Intel hired Keller in 2018, under the guise of helping with their 10nm process issues. But that's not why. They've already revealed why they hired him... he did the same thing at Intel that he did at AMD. He pushed Intel away from enormous monolithic cores to chiplets and connected cores. What makes AMD's Ryzen such an impressive processor is that you're literally gluing together 4 core chips to make 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 core processors, and they're interconnected through AMD's Infinity Fabric, which is just a shared memory connection between each set of 4 cores. This is why faster RAM speeds up Ryzen CPU performance so dramatically, while it does next to nothing for Intel processors - all the cores are already on a single chip with Intel.\n\nThat said... people crow over TSMC's, GlobalFoundries's, and Samsung's 7nm process but fail to realize that Intel's 10nm process packs more transistors. I suspect the problems Intel are having are related to trying to get large-die 8+ core CPUs with high yields on their 10nm process. Intel is going to keep pushing along, sure... they'll probably be neck and neck, or only slightly behind AMD for the next 3-4 years.\n\nBut after that?  Watch the fuck out. Intel has the most advanced CPU fabs on the planet, and by then Keller's design will have long been complete. Whatever advantage AMD has right now, Lisa Su needs to press it hardcore, because the storm clouds are already forming on the horizon.\n\nAnd this is just the CPU side of things. They probably won't be able to afford to compete with NVIDIA for at least a few years. They simply do not have the money. Top-tier talent has no reason to go work for AMD other than a desire to help the underdog (which, I admit, is a powerful motivator for Americans). If AMD can push hard these next few years, they can start to hire the best GPU designers and maybe make start taking shots at NVIDIA.\n\nIn total, while AMD is a true American underdog story, a lot of it really is luck... they got lucky that Intel got hung up on 10nm for so long, and they can really press their advantage, because word on the inside is that Intel's 10nm is so fucking fucked up, that it won't be available for large-scale deployment to desktop and server markets until 2021 / 2022 at the earliest. That's right around the time that GloFo (Global Foundries) and TSMC are expecting to have their 5nm process ironed out and ready to start producing chips.\n\nIntel isn't just on the back foot right now, they've taken a haymaker right to their glass jaw. AMD needs to capitalize on this, and they could actually become the dominant CPU chip maker if TSMC and GloFo manage to get their 5nm process ready to roll by 2022. But long-term, Intel will fix 10nm, and they'll push - hard and fast - into 7nm and 5nm territory.\n\nTo beat NVIDIA, AMD needs every domino to fall as it should. They need cash to hire the best GPU designers, and they need to make in-roads into the enterprise and laptop / ultrabook markets to do that.\n\nExciting fucking times, WSBers...\n\nYou really wanna roll hard? Short Intel hard in late 2019... their 10nm process is no-fucking-where near ready and they're gonna miss every single target on their roadmap.

Super insightful. I have two questions, if you'll indulge me: \n\n1. Does it not make sense to long INTC right now till Aug, simply because smart investors like yourself know that the valuation right now (with dividend) is fantastic? \n2. Does it make sense to long QCOM? From what I read, they basically have a monopoly on wireless chips (no one else even comes close). Any insights here?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If I was a smart investor I wouldn't be on /r/wallstreetbets.\n\nAs far as QCOM? QCOM's greatest strength I would argue is its IP portfolio, moreso than even their chips, although the new 8cx chip is pretty impressive. From a pure benchmarking standpoint, its as powerful as an Intel Core i5-8250U, which is a quad-core, eight-thread processor used in a lot of mid-range ultrabooks. Yes, the Qualcomm 8cx doesn't support as many applications as x86-64 processors like mobile Core and Ryzen series, but its inexpensive and its battery life / performance profile is superior to both, by far. In fact, an 8cx chip has nearly double the battery life. Surface Book 2 can get about 14-17 hours battery life on a charge, so you're talking 28-34 hour battery life under similar usage scenarios.\n\nThat's big. In fact, I suspect once ARM support becomes commonplace for Windows 10 applications (Unity game engine is already being ported to ARM, and should be ready to go soon), QCOM might be a more significant player in the mobile space.\n\nI dumped my position in INTC last year, and since I don't have any skin in the game there, its hard for me to tell an investor to hold or not. The 10nm problem was well-known to industry insiders since 2017, and once it became apparent to me that it would get worse and not better, I got out.\n\nI just know that INTC had bet the proverbial farm on 10nm, and its so fucked up and so far behind that I legitimately believe the stock could lose up to 30% of its valuation by Q4 2020.\n\nIf you turn the clock back 5 years, Intel expected to be on 10nm+ (right now they're using 14nm++, 3rd generation 14nm lithography) by Q1 2019. Here we are near the end of Q2 '19 and not only has there been only one 10nm chip (i3-8121U), but its so fucked up that the GPU on said chip isn't functional and has been disabled on all chips sold. Even then, the Core i3-8121U was only sold to Chinese markets in an entry-level Lenovo ThinkPad.\n\nI mean... if you're comfortable with risk and want to hold INTC, be my guest. I personally think they're going to end up like one of my ex-girlfriends... shitting the bed after a night of too many drinks and too much anal sex.\n\nEDIT: Right now, Intel's 10nm yield is single-digits percentage-wise. CPU dies are produced on circular pieces of silicon called \"wafers\". Most CPU wafers are 300mm. So if you take the die size of Cannon Lake, which is 70.82 mm^2, and apply that to a 300mm wafer, you get a maximum die count of 863. Single-digit usable yield mean 77 chips per wafer.\n\nFor a mature process, 90% yields are normal. For processes that still have some bugs to work out, but can be considered ready for mass supply, you want at least 50-60%. Intel can't even break 10% yet.\n\nAnd even worse, they're not even getting 77 fully usable chips.

Both of you points #1 and #2 focus heavily on that.  Why do you believe a reduction in volatility points towards a bullish market?\n\nWhy do you use the VIX Call / Put Ratio, rather than the CBOE Put / Call ratios?\n\n...\n\nCan I suggest an alternative, anyone?\n\nFor those that don't know:  [A put / call ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/putcallratio.asp) is the number of puts traded, DIVIDED BY the number of calls traded.  For example, if today there were 1200 puts traded and 800 calls traded, you would have a put / call ratio of 1.5.  *(1200 / 800 = 1.5)* \n\nThis metric is useful, because if overall there are a lot more puts being traded than calls, that suggests that market sentiment is turning bearish (or at least that a lot of people are hedging their long positions).  A put/call ratio above 1 means more puts are being traded than calls, and vice versa.\n\nOkay, so:  [I just made this chart for sharing.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/zkbxeZ3o/#)\n\n**The black line is the put call ratio.**  The horizontal yellow line just marks 1.00.  If the put / call ratio is above that, that means there's a more volume on trading puts than calls.\n\n**The thin purple line is the 12 day moving average**, of that ratio.\n\n**And the blue shaded area is $SPY.**\n\nOkay, so why the fuck is my chart useful?  Look at areas where the moving average of the put / call ratio is above 1, then look at $SPY.  Then look at areas where the moving average is below 1, then look at $SPY.\n\nThe leading indicator that I'm pointing out, is where the MA of the put/call ratio crosses 1.\n\nLook back, with that in mind.  Where ever the put/call ratio MA crosses one, there is a predictable pattern to the price of $SPY.\n\nGiven that the MA of the put/call ratio is currently above 1, **I think you're full of shit.**  I mean that in a loving way though.  I mean, I'm also probably full of shit.

The 12 day MA crosses 1.00 what... 7 times in the last year.\n\n>The reason I like VIX put call ratio rather than equity is two reasons. One: Looking back in history it is clear the VIX C/P ratio spikes for large swings in the market. See Feb 2016, 2018. Before these spikes in volatility, there were large bets going long VIX. Second: The people who trade VIX options have more money, influence, resources what have you. You average mom and pop retail trader is not hedging with volatility options.  \n>  \n>The VIX is a complicated product and the people who go long and short it via calls and puts usually know what they are doing.  \n>  \n>Let me know if I didn't address your question.\n\nThis is absolutely *hilarious*.\n\nYour logic is thus:\n\n* A single data point, chosen as the absolute bottom of December, confirms my strategy.\n* The smart people use VIX.\n* The people with lots of money use VIX.\n* It's complicated and I have no idea what is going on.\n* Do the thing Vix does?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPay really close attention to this one:\n\n> Looking back in history it is clear the VIX C/P ratio spikes for large swings in the market. \n\nYes, the call and put volume DOES change drastically, when the market changes drastically.
