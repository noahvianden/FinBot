I do not remember it was a close vote, everywhere I saw were people praising how amazing of a strategic move it was, and as someone who follows that industry, it was clear that most Tesla cheerleaders didn't know a thing about that sector.\n\nHonestly, I'm thinking about exiting my position as well, Tesla may or may not become the long term success people say it will become, but I'm a lot more certain that Elon himself is a man of questionable integrity who's suffering a serious case of both inferiority complex *and* narcissistic personality disorder (yes those actually go hand in hand).

It depends mostly on S/X recovering. I just think it's interesting that if the financial results were there you would ignore your concerns about management. Something to think about as it simplifies the analysis. Honestly everything for me turns on the probability I give (intuitively) for them winning some kind of large autonomy business with the automotive business serving as some backstop of value if that fails but not all that much. There's quite a few significant high-level, essentially Elon, decisions that need to be made to situate Tesla Network exactly right. I'd say I'm basically relying on Elon getting those right, so I'm entirely reliant on him and management for my thesis. A simple early decision can maybe be win/loss for the whole project, e.g. LIDAR or not, or how they are handling the leasing program with no buy option, or the decision to make the cars more expensive to have redundancies and shoot for 1M miles, or Tesla insurance even, or pricing on FSD, etc. These are the key things happening right now imo. A few billion up or down in cash flow to me is easily bridged by the market cap.\n\nIn most cases that is.

But like I said, I now have some doubts about his strategic sense and more importantly, great doubts about his personal integrity. However if short term cashflow is stable then I am much more likely to switch from a bear sentiment to a let's-wait-and-see sentiment.\n\n>A simple early decision can maybe be win/loss for the whole project, e.g. LIDAR or not, or how they are handling the leasing program with no buy option, or the decision to make the cars more expensive to have redundancies and shoot for 1M miles, or Tesla insurance even, or pricing on FSD, etc. These are the key things happening right now imo.\n\nI don't disagree, but if you do have doubts on his personal integrity and honesty like I do, then it puts *all of the above* under an incredibly dark cloud, as if he's trying to lie/exaggerate/hype his way into a more favorable round of fund raising. Out of all the issues above I'm most familiar with the technical side of FSD, and honestly his position is incredibly difficult to get behind the more you understand this field and after these many years there are still **zero, zip, nada** supporting evidence of his vision-only approach is actually the right approach.
