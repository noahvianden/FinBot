I guess the difference is that with your average luxury car brand you're just getting a better version of a normal car. Better build quality, faster engine and so on. If you want an even better car you pay more. \n\nWith Tesla it's really a completely different thing so you don't really care if you have a better or worse version of that thing because people don't even know what that thing is so having a better or worse version doesn't really matter. With any Tesla you already have full self driving, electric car and at that point maybe you don't even care about 240 miles vs 310 miles, as long as it's enough for you. \n\nA parallel would be the Iphone, for the first couple of generations all they had was 1 type of iPhone. They had the iPhone, iPhone 3, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 as the only offering in each generation. It wasn't until the generation after iPhone 5 they launched the iPhone 5S and the cheaper iPhone 5C at the same time, selling the iPhone 5s for $649 vs iPhone 5C for $549. Apart from that generation iPhone has always just been 1 version with the same specs and slightly larger variant, it wasn't until very recently where Apple actually launched two price classes of iPhones with the iPhone X vs iPhone 8 (+plus).

Only a few small sections of the massive general assembly building do not have roofing yet, and the same is true for Gigafactory 3\u2019s walls. Around the facility\u2019s grounds, workers continued their activities, and cement trucks were seen heading inside the massive factory, hinting at the work being started inside.  The pace of Gigafactory 3\u2019s construction is unprecedented, and it is one that will likely make it to books in the future. China itself, which holds a solid reputation for quick, surgically-precise buildouts, will probably set records with the construction of Gigafactory 3. As Tesla\u2019s electric car factory in Shanghai rises, it is pertinent to note that there was a time, not too long ago, when the idea of Gigafactory 3\u2019s factory shell being completed in roughly five months was considered implausible.\n\n[Tesla adjusts Autopilot to comply with new EU regulations | May 17 2019](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/17/tesla-updates-autopilot-europe/)\n\nTesla will push an updated Autopilot in Europe that scales back on a couple of functions in order to comply with new regulations. The changes will require faster lane changes and limit how far you can turn the steering wheel on Autosteer. Electrek reports that while Tesla's Autopilot was approved under older rules, it had to be dialed back in order to comply with the new UN/ECE R79 regulation on driver assistance systems. The update only impacts Model S and Model X vehicles; Model 3 already complies with the new rules.\n\n[Tesla Completes Acquisition of Maxwell Technologies | May 16 2019](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-completes-acquisition-maxwell-technologies)\n\nAs of the expiration of the exchange offer, a total of approximately 36,764,342 shares of common stock of Maxwell were validly tendered in the exchange offer and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 79% of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Maxwell common stock outstanding immediately after the consummation of the exchange offer.

CEO Elon Musk is turning to the insurance business in an attempt to achieve what the automaker has so far struggled with on the vehicle pricing front: lower costs for customers. Tesla says it will start offering insurance this month that taps internal data from the AutoPilot driver-assist system to reduce rates.

As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That\u2019s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we\u2019re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features \u2013 Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance \u2013 help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.\n\n[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)\n\nThe chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a \u201chalf-trillion dollar market cap company,\u201d said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn\u2019t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.\n\n[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)\n\nDuring its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.\n\n[The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther | April 23 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther)\n\nBeginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle\u2019s range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging.

As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with \"crazy torque & a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,\" noted Musk in a previous tweet.

A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. \u201cIt has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,\u201d Musk said. \u201cSo this thing will be really tight on corners.\u201d The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 \u2014 both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won\u2019t be available until 2021, Musk said.

Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we\u2019re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.\n\n[Tesla\u2019s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.\n\n[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)\n\nAccording to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017\u2014 and that doesn\u2019t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it\u2019s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a \u201cStandby\u201d state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car\u2019s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an \u201cAlert\u201d state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an \u201cAlarm\u201d state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car\u2019s audio system. If a car switches to \u201cAlarm\u201d state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They\u2019ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\n# [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n**Elon Musk - CEO**\n\nElon oversees the company's product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers.
