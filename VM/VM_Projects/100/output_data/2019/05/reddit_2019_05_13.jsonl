Same thing with my smart phone. Americans want good smartphones for a low price. China wants purchasing power. Win-Win. International free trade is always a good thing. You want to have less illegal immigrants guess what has happened to the rate of illegal border crossings after Bill Clinton passed NAFTA? If they have a job, why would they want to feel the need to come here? International free trade is ALWAYS A GOOD THING. Tariffs, subsidies, worrying about exports versus imports, back room deals, occupational licenses, limited trade, and abandoning international trade agreements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't Capitalism, this is Mercantilism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDonald Trump is a mercantilist, most if not all Republicans are mercantilists. A capitalist wants the best car, or phone, or computer they can buy regardless of who made it. A mercantilist is someone who wants crap made in America, because of some sense that if you make something here, even though the Chinese could make it better and cheaper, then it is better somehow? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany people espouse the idea that Mercantilism is dead. This is why so many socialists, communists call cronyism Capitalism. The thing is that Mercantilism is not dead, it is well and alive. \n\nThe United States of America has a Mercantile economy. (The idea that government should work with businesses, subsidize small businesses, limit foreign imports, limit the labor pool, government should cooperate with businesses to enhance the safety and quality of an industry. The government must charter companies and individuals need to be certified to work in an industry, a strong sense of national pride, and how something made in your own country is inherently better than other products because you are supporting your neighbor)\n\nSwitzerland has a Capitalist economy. (The idea that land, labor, capital, and tools should be controlled and owned by private individuals and that international trade and cooperation between independent and sovereign communities are a good thing. If a country makes better Operating Systems say the US in the case of Windows and macOS, Fedora, etc. Then why should Switzerland waste it's time and resources doing that when Switzerland is better at the management of currency and other stores of wealth? If a society is better off with people that specialize in different fields and professions, then wouldn't be the same for entire countries in which different countries should specialize and everyone benefits?)\n\nChina has a Socialist economy. (The idea that land, labor, capital, and tools should be owned and controlled by society. The idea that everyone works to fulfill their altruistic duty to society rather than for their own personal gain. The idea that no one can do anything or in actuality is anything other than what society believes each person to be. Ultimately socialists believe that the individual is an extension of society, while capitalists believe society is an extension of individuals.)\n\nNorth Korea has a Communist economy. (The idea that private property doesn't or at least that it shouldn't exist. The individual does not exist. Instead society as a whole is the primary organism of humanity. To allow entrepreneurs, capitalists, in short, the  Bourgeois to pay wages for the labor of their fellow human being is exploitation. That is to say that the very idea of working for a wage rather than for the advancement of society as a whole is not a kind of exploitative behavior, but in and of itself is exploitation of the working class, the impoverished, in short, the proletariat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sooner people come to terms with the fact that Donald Trump is a Mercantilist, then it makes a whole lot of sense why he does what he does. When you realize that the Republicans are generally speaking mercantilists, Libertarians are Capitalists, Democrats are Socialists, and Greens are Communists then and only then does it all start to make sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDemocrats want what is best for Society\n\nRepublicans want what is best for Individuals\n\nLibertarians want everyone to mind their own damn business\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe as Americans have for far too long been arguing symptoms and not the underlying disagreements. To argue about healthcare, education, etc. but not the underlying premise of why you form the opinion that you do then you simply talk over everyone and everyone ends up angry. But when you realize that Democrats generally speaking want free college because most Democrats are Socialists, and  that Republicans want to mostly focus on trades, political science, and accounting, and have people pay for college, but government to subsidize it because generally speaking Republicans are Mercantilists that Libertarians just want to completely privatize all education because they are capitalists, then calling someone names because they disagree with you simply misses the point. To say that free college, or subsidized student loans with an emphasis on the trades, or that wholly privatized schooling is will get the economy on the right track depends upon which station you are leaving from. So of course people who believe that society is an extension of the individual would support everyone having guns to defend themselves thus making society safer, but if you think that individuals are an extension of society then why would you want to give individuals guns when the authorities in the society already has the capacity to protect you? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we as a society do not wake up to this reality, that in many cases no matter how much you understand someone, no matter how much to talk to someone, there are many things that people will simply not agree with so we should agree to disagree and move on, we will be doomed.", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.453632652759552}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7285858392715454}, {"body": "Yeah, burn down everything to hurt China.
