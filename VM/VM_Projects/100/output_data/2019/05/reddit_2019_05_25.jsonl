So let's do some math to get some perspective on whether TSLA would be a good growth stock (it's certainly not a profit story atm). Here's how I look at it, making a projection of decent 2019 Q2 results (actual results could be lower/higher):\n\n70k M3 @ $46k $3.2b\n\n8k MS @ $85k $0.7b\n\n8k MX @ $90k $0.7b\n\nEnergy $0.6b (this may be old, didn't update it)\n\nTotal Revenue $5.2b\n\n2018 Q2 Revenue $4b\n\nYoY growth ~30%\n\n==\n\nAnnualized Revenue $21b\n\nMarket Cap $34b\n\nP/S ratio 1.6\n\nSo I think the question is whether you'd want a growth stock with 30% YoY growth for 1.6 P/S. That's not a super high premium, but growth isn't as high as it was previously. Tesla P/S has been above 2 for a long time, so sentiment has cooled.\n\nThoughts?", "id": "bsu7bw", "created_utc": 1558789046.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "I definitely think Tesla is still a growth stock.

The big guys may have more spending, but they still spend much of it on ICEs.  Their core competency is building engines, which unfortunately is almost obsolete.  They need to completely remake themselves to be competitive.  This is so difficult (ask Kodak), it more likely that most of the legacy auto will die in the next decade or two.  This is what happens in disruptions.\n\nThese big industrial companies are not innovative, at all.  Sandy Munro said it best, \"All they do is put together parts off the shelf.\"  They've been doing it for years, and they're really good at it.  It used to be an asset.  They've been competing on manufacturing efficiency for so long, they've lost the ability to innovate -- which is what's required in a fast moving space like EVs.  The problem is that there are no off-the-shelf parts that can compete with Tesla.\n\nLook at the Audi eTron.  Audi is a super competitive company, one of the best.  They make great ICE cars (well, at least as good as they can be).  Their first EV is absolute trash.  They just don't understand the problem.  They're not used to designing for efficiency, you don't need to with ICE.  Luxury customers don't care about low gas mileage.  They have a poor drag coefficient.  The car is really heavy.  Even with a giant battery, it only has a 200mi range.  Ouch.  It's a huge mistake.\n\nBuilding a great EV is a science project.  You're pushing the limits of the state of the art.  The legacy guys don't do that.  Not in the last hundred years.  \n\n> Same thing for FSD with Waymo, or for semis with Nikola\n\nI have no opinion on developing technologies.  We'll see whether any of them can get it right.  I don't think it's baked into the valuation anyway.\n\n> Maybe there is no Tesla killer out there right now, but there could very well be one in 2 years, especially if Tesla keeps floundering.\n\nIf there's no good competitor for 2 more years, then this investment has a great time horizon.
