My problem with social media is when you are not on social media,  you are constantly thinking about it.   You shape your life around it.   Going for a quiet walk in the beach?  I'm going to spend 10 min trying to take a cool pic with an angle and think about a caption and post it on Instagram.   On your spare time,  you are thinking about what Brad did yesterday in the mountains with his buddies snowboarding and having a great time.   Why cant I be with them?  Oh look,  he goes to a big university while I can barely pass my grades in community college.   \n\n\nMy sister in law posts her entire life and everything she has done to details on Instagram.   Millions of women do the same thing.   Worse she is single and you could tell she is lonely in her instagram world.  Even worse when she can see her friends now have kids and live a beautiful married life when she is single and by herself taking pics of sunset.\n\n\nMy wife used to be a teacher.   There is a dude who travels around the country and gives speeches to high schools to limit use of social media.  Kids now 13+ have phones in school.   staring at phones when on break.   Kid was walking by cafeteria and fell with his lunch plate.   He was instantly recorded and posted on social media.   Entire school laughing at him.   \n\n\nSocial media no doubt has benefits but we are not programmed to constantly stay updated what our friends around the country did 5 min ago.\nWe are meant to live in the present and be happy with whatever our social situation is and not be instantly comparing each other.\n\n\nOf course moderation is key and its perfect fine if you spend 20/30 min per day.

I see teens posting constantly instagram stories all day.   anything interesting they come across,  it is posted immediatly on Instagram stories.   Fact that image disappears after 24 hours and it doesn't have to be perfectly manicured to be posted in your profile,  people are posting anything slightly interesting they come across.  \n\nAt least before instagram stories,  people used to give it a thought and post something interesting.  Now its just random things all day on instagram stories.   Facebook did an incredible job and they understood how to keep people addicted all day.   They are incredibly powerful and understand probably how humans work better than any other scientific organization in the world.\n\nPolitics wise.   Look at what happened in our last election?   Complete nightmare and foreign powers were able to influence elections through social media.   Mueller report goes in details of what happened.\n\nSocial media is incredibly powerful but right now its something we cant control and its running wild.

It's purchasing the right to either buy or sell a stock at a given time for a given price. This can be good if you're more familiar with options because you can do more complex things - like hedging your position. It can also be dangerous because unlike a stock, if the expiry date on your option comes around and your option is out of the money you lose it all.\n\nA call option is the right to buy a stock on a given date at a given price. A put option is the right to sell a stock on a given date at a given price.\n\nA simple example here would be imagining if you had $1000 and Tesla's stock was $250. If you're confident the stock will go up, you might buy 4 shares for 250 apiece. Even if the stock dips to $240, you still can sell your four shares and walk away with $960 dollars. If Tesla's share goes up to $270, you can sell your four shares and you've made $80.\n\nLets say instead though you'd bought call options (the right to buy TSLA shares). Options are usually sold in bundles of 100, so for this example lets say you instead had spent your $1000 on one contract of $10 call options that allowed you to buy 100 TSLA share at $260 in exactly 1 year. If the stock goes up to $270, you now can exercise your option in a year and make (270-260)\\*100 = $1000. Much more than you would have made purchasing the stock! But before you get too excited, lets also consider the case where the stock goes down. If in a year the stock price is at $240 - well there's no value in your right to buy the stock at $250 (because its more expensive than just buying it $240), so your option would expire worthless. So while you have potential upside, you also have higher risk.\n\nA put option is the reverse of a call - because you're buying the right to sell, you'll make money if the stock price is lower than your strike. Let's say you thought the stock would go down, so instead you might buy $10 puts with a strike of 250 with an expiry in exactly a year. If the stock price goes up to $270 you'll lose your $1000, but if the stock goes down to $240, you'll make ($250-240)\\*100 = $1000.\n\nTypically people use options in more complex strategies - like a collar, iron condor, straddle, etc. If you're holding TSLA, but concerned that in the short term it's going to tank, you might buy shorter term put options to offset the short term losses to protect your portfolio's value.\n\nThere is a lot to learn about options (how options are priced, how to incorporate options into your trading strategy, etc), but hopefully that's a useful primer.\n\nSide note: Highly disrecommend following what WSB does with options - although its fun to read about, buying short dated out of the money options and hoping to get lucky is an easy way to lose a bunch of cash.

The fact that so many fast-growing unprofitable unicorns are going public this year, and investors are cheerfully buying them, suggests that public markets are perfectly able to focus on long-term stories. Still, the stereotypes have some intuitive appeal; there does seem to be some difference in how public and private markets trade off long-term growth and near-term profitability. For instance, I wrote not too long ago that \u201cA big public tech company that came back to the stock market every year to raise billions more dollars to subsidize its losses probably would not be doing that at ever-increasing valuations.\u201d\n\n>Even as I typed those words I thought, in the back of my mind, \u201cwell, except Tesla, obviously.\u201d And here we are:\n\n>Tesla Inc. plans to raise about $2 billion through debt and stock offerings, after Elon Musk overestimated the ability of the Model 3 sedan to generate enough cash for the company to be self-sustaining.\n\n>The electric-car maker filed Thursday to sell $1.35 billion in convertible notes and about $650 million in shares. Tesla stock, which had plunged 30 percent this year, rose 2 percent to $238.65 at 10:09 a.m. in New York, and its bonds advanced.\n\n>It\u2019s not quite \u201cever-increasing valuations\u201d\u2014Tesla last sold stock in 2017 at $262 per share\u2014but, still, the fact is that Tesla spent a long time saying that it would be profitable and wouldn\u2019t need to raise capital, and now it is going out and doing $2 billion of equity to cover its cash burn, and the stock is up. Tesla\u2019s investors believe in Elon Musk\u2019s long-term vision and are happy to throw in some money to subsidize losses on the way to achieving it.\n\n>The weird thing is that no one believes those stereotypes more than Elon Musk. The guy complains constantly about the distractions and short-term pressures of the public markets. He launched a pretend going-private transaction for Tesla because he wanted \u201can outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,\u201d and because he thought the only way to do that was by being private. Whatever, man. \n\n>By the way, imagine if Musk had taken Tesla private. Imagine if he\u2019d been able to just snap his fingers and Tesla was no longer a public company. It would not be raising $1.35 billion of convertible bonds right now, I tell you what. (Convertibles work a lot better if the underlying stock is publicly traded, so that arbitrageurs can hedge them.) I suppose it might have been able to go to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (which Musk seems to have thought was willing to put up limitless money to take Tesla private, though that turned out not to be true), or the SoftBank Vision Fund I guess, for a couple of billion dollars of private growth capital; that\u2019s definitely a thing that big private tech companies do these days. Maybe it would even have gotten better terms?
