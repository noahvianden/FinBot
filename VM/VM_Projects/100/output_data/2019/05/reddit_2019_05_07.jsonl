They have the best, most efficient battery electric drivetrain.  Period.  Bull or bear, I would expect general agreement with that.\n\nBut... \n\nThey've cut R&D.  The S and X have been mostly unchanged (I'm aware of a few incremental upgrades, including the upcoming small \"refresh\", but they're still basically the same cars) for years.  They've got a lot of capital costs ahead of them - the model Y ramp, the semi (maybe?) - and they've got a stressed balance sheet.  \n\nHow long can they be expected to maintain their advantage against the rest of the industry?  Even looking a couple years ago, Tesla was *way* farther ahead of the competition in terms of the basics.  That gap has narrowed, even if it still exists.  \n\n Add to that the pivot to autonomy, which seems to be the new focus and a significant R&D cost.  They've got a lot to focus on despite cash flow challenges.   Yet they're actually spending less on R&D right now than they were the same time last year.  \n\nThey have a undisputed moat right now.

These two points are very disconnected from one another.  \n  \nI see Tesla constantly advancing their tech. Be it software, the autonomy computer (holy fuck yes), the UI, or features like Sentry Mode. Traditional manufacturers might put out a new version every year, but those are mostly facelifts, different buttons on the console, or maybe even an updated motor every now and then that boasts 10 hp more under laboratory conditions.  \n  \nOf course it is possible that VW or BMW or GM could crush Tesla's market share with a combination of a high rate of innovation and six-sigma manufacturing. Realistically, however, I do not see that happening due to the risk involved. Perhaps they could distribute risk amongst battery, electric drivetrain, and UI suppliers while they focus on design and manufacturing. With that supply chain, however, I'd be astounded if they could maintain a high rate of innovation.  \n  \nVW wants to crank out a million iDs per year in 2025. I think they can achieve that.

I thought I was clear about that, apologies if I wasn't.  In that context, there's no confusion - Tesla makes software updates and improves things like the autonomy chip, but the physical car itself tends to not change at all.\n\nThey may have some advantages in autonomy, etc, but those are not as clear and not as obvious.   \n\nOTA updates and autopilot improvements may help, but they're not the reason the reason why Tesla gets better range and performance at a given price point/market segment than anyone else right now.  \n\nThe moat I'm talking about involves the real basics.  In terms of basic functionality *as an electric car*, Tesla has an advantage, but that advantage is shrinking.  You seem to be suggesting (as Elon basically has) that software related future updates will take the place of that advantage using the same hardware.  I'm very skeptical of that.  If other companies start releasing higher performing EVs at lower price points they're going to start seriously eating into Tesla's market even if they lack some of the software features.\n\nIf the iD can actually get 340 miles of range at a reasonable price point it will match up very favorably with the Model 3.

Thank you very much. The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla only see it as an automotive company. Can you speak to the energy side of the company specifically, the roadmap for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenue for the company?\n\nElon Musk\n\n> Sure. The challenge really is battery cells scarcity. As far as the additional storage is concerned, we basically need an up-sell to support the vehicle production as well as to full power on Powerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for Model 3 as opposed to Powerpack. So we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to continue some level of production on the Powerpack. This year, we think that we will be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs like current, J.B., like what do you guys think?\n\nJ.B. Straubel\n\n> Yes, between 5% and 10%, something like that.\n\nElon Musk\n\n> Yes. So, there are [indiscernible] in a Powerwall in the car so that translates to a \u2013 quite a decent number of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from variety of suppliers around the world. The Powerwall Powerpack, because I don\u2019t have to go through vehicle [indiscernible] are much more adaptable to using variety of cells from other cell providers. So, we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year maybe on the order of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry, sorry. Yes, 300, confirming it, 300%. So this is a very big percentage growth rate. It\u2019s much faster than an automotive. So over time, we expect that sort of growth rate would hopefully be able to continue and then battery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla\u2019s business over time. We also have \u2013 we are also finding a significant increase in retrofit solar this year, because we have finally refined the product offering to be something that\u2019s extremely compelling and much more cost efficient to deliver and install. So, to radically streamline process from what has been done before and we will have more to say on that possibly next week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we are on Version 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confident that the Solar Roof is going to last on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of 20, 25 years and so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down by [indiscernible] which you can do accelerate aging on the roof and we want the installation process to be simple and easy, which is actually the Tesla Buffalo factory a few weeks ago and I was pretty impressed with the team and we are looking forward to scaling that up significantly through the balance of this year and next.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35564494132995605}, {"body": "I think Tesla had inside information about the China//US deal and raised right before the market downfall.
