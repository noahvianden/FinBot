I think if Tesla is around in 10 years, they will be an absolute powerhouse. That\u2019s what I\u2019m betting on. \n\nYou see, I made some good bets on Apple and Nvidia back in 2007. The modest investment in 2007 has turned into a sizable one today which I very recently sold and dumped into Tesla. This only took 12 years. If that investment does well in Tesla stock over the next 12 years, it\u2019ll pay for a lavish early retirement. If it goes to zero, that\u2019s fine too because it was play money to begin with. Because I don\u2019t need the money, it\u2019ll could be 10 years (or maybe 20-40 years) before I sell the Tesla stock assuming it doesn\u2019t go BK between now and then so having an exact date for profitability is less important for me.\n\nAdditionally, the family has owned exclusively Teslas (3x) since 2013 and I\u2019ve seen the growth of the technology and the company itself first hand since a sub 5k vin Model S to today. And now I have a front row seat to watch the growth in testing their latest AP software on my daily driver. I feel like that\u2019s almost cheating the game in a way since I can compare where AP is today to where it was a year ago.
