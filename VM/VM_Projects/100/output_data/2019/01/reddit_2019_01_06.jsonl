People won't spend notable amounts of money on something like that and a lot of it comes to the fact that no one wants to place a big hunk of plastic or metal over their eyes. Ask everyone around you and ask them if they'd want it and want to buy it. They'll all say no. Until Facebook or anyone in VR figures out a way to make it less cumbersome, it won't sell. Most gamers are perfectly happy just playing on their console or their PCs. But Facebook has strengths in other areas. They've accumulated capital and wealth off its advertising and its other services are doing just fine, despite the backlash in the media. They have the money to make a difference and they will.

This is likely a bet that the trade war will be resolved by summer, and Chinese stocks will spike. UPDATE: /u/HurtByBubble pointed out that these have already been closed.\n\n**$NVDA** \\- buyer of $5.6M of March $145 calls. Someone is placing a **big** bet on NVDA being oversold going into earnings.\n\n**$SPOT** \\- buyer of $10M+  04/18/2019 $120 calls. This is a huge bet on Spotify. There could be a variety of things happening here. Either someone thinks they are going to have blowout Q1 2019 results, or they're anticipating a buyout. It has been rumored that Apple is looking at buying them.\n\n**$BMY** \\- buyer of $2M March $52.5 calls. The stock declined roughly 10% on news they were buying Celgene Pharmaceuticals. A drop will typically happen on news of an acquisition, and heavy call buying after is a bullish signal. This trade is in addition to another $1M in calls purchased on various strikes / expos.\n\n**$IQ** \\- buyer of $500,000 in February $17.5 calls.\n\n**$CAR** \\- buyer of $3.9M in January 2021 $15 puts. This is a huge out-of-the-money bet that Avis Budget Group will continue declining in the medium term. The stock is down 54% from highs earlier this year, and has earnings on Feb 26th.\n\n**$SPY** \\- buyer of $1.28M in 1/16/2019 $240 calls. Short-term bullish call on the market. This could be fueled by good trade news and the end of the government shutdown.\n\n**$AAPL** \\- buyer of $2.8M in January 2021 $120 puts. We've all read the negative news on iPhone sales. This trade is interesting because of how far out of the money it is. This gives some indication that big funds see it hitting the $120 area, from the current $148 price. UPDATE: u/[imduanereademy5isfly](https://www.reddit.com/user/imduanereademy5isfly)/ has pointed out that this may be a large fund deploying a delta-neutral strategy, and thus isn't necessarily indicative of the implied direction of Apple. \n\n**$PYPL** \\- buyer of $2.61M in 2/01/2019 $84.5 calls. PayPal has earnings on 2/04. This looks like a bet on a run-up into earnings.\n\n**$BAC** \\- buyer of $4.1M in March $22 calls. Note that these calls were purchased on Thursday, before Powell spoke. We know what trade was made, buy not why. They could've been speculating on either positive news from Powell and also a positive earnings report. $BAC reports earnings on January 16th.\n\n**$BUD** \\- buyer of $3.4M in March $70 calls. You know what people love during a recession? Beer. They love beer.\n\n**$IYR** \\- buyer of $1.19M in January 2020 $75 puts. This is a real estate trust, someone is betting on declining house prices + sales over the next year.\n\n**$SQ** \\- buyer of $3.5M in June $65 calls. Someone is expecting $SQ to pop over 22% in the next half year.\n\n**$SMH** \\- buyer of $1.3 in February $75 calls. Big bet on this semi-conductor ETF.\n\n**$CZR** \\- buyer of $3.1M in January 2021 $12 calls. Long term play.\n\n**$AVGO** \\- buyer of $15.5M in July $250 calls.

The main risk characteristics of it is what most option traders would call \"skew\" (the implied volatility difference between out of the money calls and out of the money puts), and \"roll\" risk (the difference in the forward price relative to the spot price, as implied by \"put-call parity\").  Therefore, I believe that the originating customer interest was likely betting on the Jan21 \"forward\" price declining relative to \"spot\", and/or betting that the positive implied volatility difference between out of the money puts and out of the money calls will decrease.
