Again, why should I be forced to pay for someone else's inability to think about the future...especially pay the government who is the most corrupt entity in our country because they say they can best redistribute that money to those that need it most.\n\nWhy don't you address falling wages, the real estate bubble popping, inflating USD, personal debt at all time high, government unfunded liabilities all time high, and no intention to deregulate the economy to pay for any of this socialism?

It's a wealth redistribution program that \"the swamp\" skims a significant portion off the top which had lead to out becoming unsustainable - just like every government policy that steals from the poor and gives to the rich. The government borrowed $49B to pay for SS in 2010 and will continue to borrow money to pay for SS until 2034 when they can cut back on how much they promise to deliver because the government's creditors are going to stop lending cheap money.

That is like you writing a check to yourself with stolen money except you would never do that for the obvious reasons. The money is spent on other things than SS, so the government then has to borrow money to actually pay out SS - because they have already spent SS funds. This is why SS does not fund itself and the government \"owes\" SS nearly $3T. But we also know the government borrowed $49B to pay for it in the past for one year thanks to federally released information. Constitutionally, the Federal Government can't owe anybody anything (for what its worth). The Federal Government also doesn't produce any goods so they only suck money which is why the federal government is unconstitutional at this size and they have no obligation to \"pay\" any of the $2.7T to SS. The entities that give lines of credit to our government are seeing that we have no way of paying the interest on that debt, so they are going to stop lending money to our government so freely. This means the government-funded SS will not be able to pay out as much as they do now in the future. If it were funded by taxpayers alone, it would run on indefinitely as long as it never became part of the bureaucracy; however, SS funds have been hijacked by Washington and we can prove this because SS is not going to pay out what it promised to pay out. Again, this is all on the books and we know it's a ponzi scheme because the government can't write a check to itself, because the government doesn't provide a product in the free market, and doesn't have to worry about returning a profit, so it has no value; and knows people don't care enough to drain the swamp. \n\nAnd on top of that the workforce is not growing fast enough to support this ponzi scheme nor is the economy.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07207600772380829}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.166575625538826}], "tickers": ["bubble"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6985191106796265}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2824907600879669}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.246904194355011}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26530423760414124}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1264992654323578}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17419365048408508}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2247694581747055}, {"body": "The classic ravings of a trumpist.

I can handle one company having dips like this, I can\u2019t handle 2 lol, not in an equally weighted portfolio. Mind you I\u2019m only down 1.62% on Snap right now.\n\nWhy I picked it though is because I wanted a small cap social media company and I really love their product. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a replacement for FB/IG, at all, they\u2019re just another option. They have a devoted user base who are power users and sucked me into it. I haven\u2019t seen people this excited about an app since IG years ago. Their most devoted power users are young but they\u2019re starting university, where other social networks flourished.\n\nWhat they do, they do very well, especially for a smaller company, they have great talent working there, there\u2019s a reason they get copied. The experience of using it is just fun, it\u2019s not as heavy as FB and not as aggressive as IG(I get so much bot/sponsored content on my IG feed it\u2019s annoying).

I waited the best part of the year last year to buy in actually. I only wonder if I\u2019m a bit early still lol.\n\nDo I think they had an insane IPO? Yup(I hate IPOs). Do I think their management is screwy? Kinda, there\u2019s definite issues but they\u2019re still a young company so it\u2019s not simple. Was today annoying? Yup lol.\n\nAs I said though, I don\u2019t know if it has a place in my main account moving forward, I can handle if one company does this but not two. \n\nEdit: Could I be wrong? Yup.

Writing this was because I enjoy posting DD that I put a lot of research into.*\n\nNetflix is banking on International subscribers this quarter for their record-breaking subscriber growth guidance from Q3, and they are certain to miss.\n\nNetflix\u2019s top four international traffic metrics grew an average of about 13%. With about 78 million international subscribers last quarter, if EVERY SINGLE international visitor subscribed they would increase their subscriber count by 10.14 million international subscribers.\n\nThis is also bearing in mind that this growth is only between November - December, and November was a down (and lowest) month while December was their peak month of the quarter \u2014 so their actual traffic growth for the quarter is even less than that. We also have to remember that Netflix offers a one-month free trial, so even the December peak will not make a huge impact since those are not paid accounts yet.\n\nRight now they are guided for 6.1 million new paid international subscribers this quarter. That means about 60% of ALL visitors would have to be new subscriptions. With an average site time of just over 2 minutes, we know that less than half of the new visitors are not creating new accounts \u2014 and a generous number would be 10% - 20% of new visitors are signing up. This would mean at 20%, their subscriber growth for their ONLY growth month this quarter would have been around 2.028 million new international subscriptions \u2014 while they likely lost subscriptions in November and were stagnant in October.\n\nWith the same math being applied for US subscriptions, a generous growth rate from November - December would have been 585 thousand subscribers.\n\nThey also got a lot of web traffic from being linked to as a result of Bird Box, so their traffic numbers are propped higher with a higher-than-average bounce rate.\n\nThey are going to have a HUGE miss on guided subscription growth, largely due to a over-the-top estimate on international subscribers. They will miss on both domestic and international subscriptions. Beyond that, they are going to guide down in their guidance because of increased competition, investment into original content, and less-than-expected international growth.\n\nOn top of all this, due to the recent prop-up of the stock we can expect a high volatility drop-off on a miss. We can expect to see Netflix drop into the $250 - $300 range on earnings easily.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\\- They guided that their operating margin would decrease from 12% to 4.9% this quarter, but their huge investment into original content shows that this is very unlikely.\n\n\\- Netflix has had a consistent negative cash flow, and that is expected to grow vastly this quarter -- once again due to investments into original content.\n\n\\- The Price Hike ahead of earnings is bearish, as they would have waited for ER to announce it if they expected ER to be Bullish. It is likely being used to buffer guidance due to lower-than-expected subscriber growth.

Our position is probably 10x larger than every dollar that went into playing it on this sub combined. I've committed dozens of hours creating a variety of models on predicting subs and pricing over time. Would you know that these earnings were 9% above historical trend? Would you know that Brazil is inning 4 of 9 in the S-curve adoption that exactly mimics the US? Would you know that based on $ / value of usage that Netflix is the cheapest entertainment source by more than half giving them pricing power up to $20 at current usage rates? Would you know that Netflix churns less that 2% of their accounts annually and THAT is why the only number that matters is subs? Would you know that content spend per user crossed over revenue per user in Q1 2017 and the gap has expanded to 20% as of this quarter? Do you know the multiplying effect on total library value? Do you know the contractual complexities of what Disney is trying to achieve? Do you know the Net Neutrality legislature and the scenarios of how that may affect Netflix?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy guess is that you fucking don't.
