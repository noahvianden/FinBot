If you really think your data is going to be more secure managed by an internal T&I team than with Amazon, you're delusional. That's like comparing a treehouse with a state of the art facility. From a high level view moving forward, it makes very little sense for a company to try and build out their own network and support it with their own staff instead of just offloading all of that to a cloud provider. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cInternally facing your servers isn't any more secure. You're still going to have an internet/MPLS edge that goes to locations outside your datacenter and those will terminate at a firewall somewhere else anyway. \u201c \n\nAre you trolling? Yes an internally facing server will still terminate at a firewall but that firewall only allows traffic to flow outward through certain ports, while all other ports are closed. This is why when your setting up a network you use a multilayer approach. Any servers that need to be connected to the internet in order to operate such as email and web servers would be in an outer zone. Servers that don\u2019t need to be connected to the internet would be in the inner zone (Only connected to the internal network with network traffic restricted to only allow travel away from the server). This means that if your outer zone becomes compromised your internal networks are still protected. This goes along with what I said about cloud networking being a good tool for certain applications but not a one size fits all solution. If you want to host an email server on the cloud that is perfectly fine. It makes absolute zero sense for a company to store any type of sensitive information on the cloud though.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like comparing a treehouse with a state of the art facility\u201d.
