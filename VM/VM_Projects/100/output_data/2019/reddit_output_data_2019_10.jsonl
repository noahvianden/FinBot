That premium is two components: Intrinsic Value, ie. The value of the current price difference between market and strike (can only go as low as 0 if you're the buyer because remember, you're buying an OPTION to buy or sell at the strike, not an obligation, so you can always walk away and lose just the premium), and Time Value, or the \"YOLO factor\", the chance of things happening before your expiration.\n\nYou bought a contract with just a few days left. That means that every single day, that TV will plummet, because every day erodes that factor of \"anything can happen\".\n\nIf the position is not going your way as your time value erodes rapidly, it'll erode your position's value in general. TV always goes down over time, if you're winning the position, it becomes intrinsic value. If you're losing, the value drops as the time value is wasted.\n\nAnother thing of note, time value is based on market sentiment still, in terms of reselling your contract. So, while it always goes down over time, it doesn't go down at the same rate all the time. Decay gets worse the closer you get to expiration, because with only a few days left, it's much more unlikely for big moves to happen from 3 days to 2 days left, than compared to when you go from 30 days to 29 days.\n\nIf the position is down 27% it's probably nbecause you only have a few days left, and you're losing the position.

And since i assume you're trading on robinhood you get to keep that $4. that $862 that you spent is now $858. and when that contract expires on 11/1 you can turn around and sell another one for 11/8. yes, this is chump change. but it's an easy way to make a few bucks, especialyl if you buy 2000 shares. \n\nNow if you look at a real company like AMAT, you can get 100 shares for about $5370. and turn right around and sell a contract that expires tomorrow at 55.5 for $45. if it gets exercised you made $58 for doing nothing more than making a few clicks. \nif you decided to sell an 11/1 instead of a 10/25  $54.5 you could put almost $100 in premium in your pocket. plus the difference of your purchase price and the strike price. here that's about $13. and they pay $.21 a share quarterly, so if your shares don't get exercised in a year of selling premium against then, you'll make an additional $21.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As I have been looking for a similar answer, is buying the shares outright any different than just opening a spread?
