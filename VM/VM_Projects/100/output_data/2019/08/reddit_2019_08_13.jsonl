When either of the two tech companies that were part of the original Hewlett Packard tech conglomerate are in the news, shares of oil services company Helmerich & Payne (HP), which actually trades under the ticker symbol \"HP,\" often moves in the same direction. PC company HP's ticker symbol is \"HPQ\" while Hewlett Packard Enterprises trades under \"HPE.\"\n\nSnapchat parent Snap (SNAP) and tool maker Snap-on (SNA) often get confused. Newly public web conferencing firm Zoom Video (ZM) and Zoom Technologies (ZOOM), which is a thinly traded Chinese wireless company, are often mistaken for one another. And iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and Apple Hospitality REIT (APLE), a real estate firm that owns hotels are, often mixed up.", "id": "cps4vh", "created_utc": 1565697612.0, "score": 402, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "A small part of me wants to call these people stupid.\n\nWho mistakes these stocks and then proceed to buy them without making sure it's exactly what they wanted?

This doesn't take away from the American victory in the revolution - but it's important to put things into perspective.\n\n-The pirates were from the Barbary States in North Africa, not in Somalia. Furthermore, while some some nations paid \"protection money\" (including the US at first) many others were protected by treaties, while other powers chose to use more punitive measures to dissuade attack. The US did not begin their attacks until 1801 - it was certainly not the first action you undertook.\n\n-The Great Depression affected every nation on the planet. It was also over by the time WWII had kicked off, so you can't really use it to claim that the US was in a weakened state when Japan attacked. The US Pacific Fleet took a beating, but it wasn't wiped out; no aircraft carriers were lost and 6 of the 8 battleships damaged in the attack were restored quickly. You should also remember that the US didn't fight WWII alone. In the Pacific most of the Japanese forces were concentrated against the Chinese, not the Americans. In Europe meanwhile 9/10 German deaths were caused by the Soviets rather than the Western Allies. \n\n-China isn't developed and prosperous because of Britain and the US, but in spite of them.
