I\u2019m forecasting free cash flow on a go forward basis and the picture is ugly for this company. They have massive liabilities, massive off Balance sheet obligations, and massive potential lawsuit liabilities, plus declining margins and sales.

Typically the market sells off 20% from it's high during the yield inversion. Sell off generally occur 18-24 months from the first inversion.

I would tell you any rally 2900 onwards is the bubble. You ideal entry is actually SPX 3600 based on analytics. \n\nThe reason the markets don't tank is that usually when inversion occurs money is cheaper to borrow, and if you're an investor cheap money = good.

When an inversion occurs money is cheap to borrow and that has an immediate impact on assets today and what it means when yields normalize. The basic principals of how our money system works don't just change because things are faster. \n\nIf you're asking me I don't think a yield inversion has any major effect to cause a 2008-like recession or collapse because interest is simply too low for inversion to matter.\n\nYou're not wrong that everything moves faster, there's a reason why the market reacted the way it did to inversions and why it's so quick to recover as we've all seen the last 3 weeks.
