Since you're interested in understanding other sides, I'll start off saying: I consider myself socially liberal, fiscally conservative, governmentally libertarian. I like more freedom to individuals to choose our own destinies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPolitics in general are sluggish, and I think conservatives and liberals both have serious flaws in legislation. Those industries (oil and coal, etc.) definitely have had too much power to hamper innovation in the past, and I'm very happy Elon has bested them using engineering and economics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Trump, I think he is a populist and truly wants what is best for America. He does have some dinosaur philosophies about him, but not near as many as the neocons who inhabited the Republican party before him. I think he's a realist, and would support Tesla if it was made about the manufacturing, jobs, and etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't like most politicians, and as I said I think Trump is a realist, and I like that about him. His strategies are often very grounded in supply and demand, natural principals of economics. He finds things that countries and people hadn't thought of as negotiating chips, and puts them on the table to make change. I find Elon is similar. Elon talks a lot about sustainable energy, but something he mastered between the lines is SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS. Elon thinks outside of the box, he doesn't need to legislate the changes by overtaxing people or banning/regulating gas and oil. He makes you realize a better path, and you take it because it is better for everyone. His business is as sustainable as the energy it will create. I like that a lot; Free and not forced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I see it, is that democrats usually present UNSUSTAINABLE ideas as solutions. Taxes, and banning things hurt the people they claim to represent, but they make it seem like it would only take from big businesses, evil rich people, evil (other identities here). The truth is, a GOOD big business can help people, as in the case of Tesla. I believe in less regulation overall, and more GOOD business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's unfortunate when party lines get in the way of progress, because I would love to see Trump kill dealership regulations or energy sale regulations that hamper Tesla's progress like he has killed other industry regulations. As someone who touts less taxes, and less regulation: Trump -- in theory -- should be open to  things like EV credits, that help people of all types afford great items in a growing American industries. The democrats, if they weren't just trying to make him look bad, might be able to work with him on things like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, wrapping up my fun beliefs, I believe sovereignty of nations and citizens is important. My happiest thought in regards to sovereignty -- and the relation of Tesla in this case -- is that Tesla will create a financial sovereignty soon. Normal people like us who buy these cars and are able to use them as tools to retire early, living off of Self Driving revenue, while fueling cheaper transport for others. It's like bringing the leverage of factory-floor robotics to the average citizen, and I've never seen a bigger opportunity brought down into such an affordable economic scale.
