OP had to implement financial, time-series and linguistic feature engineering pipelines, as well infer the architecture and hyper-parameters used in all papers AND train all these models. ALL WITHIN 7 MONTHS. All while previously being a trader professionally i.e. not likely an expert in many of these fields.\n\n- OP also claims he \"web scraped\" all the data which is highly unlikely as price datasets are often sold for a pretty penny and not publicly available in the detail described in several of these papers.\n\n- Down the thread, OP says he does not know what a \"meta analysis\" study is al the while being capable of implementing 130+ papers.

NBD, robinhood does their thing and i lose my collateral. i get this. \n\nI start checking my account, and all of a sudden it goes up 1k, then 2k. cool, maybe im getting some of my collateral back since some ppl arent exercising. Next thing I know, my account jumps up to $2.8 million dollars. Holy shit! thru some options magic fuckery, i made $2.8 million! \n\nBeing a responsible investor, i tried to withdraw this money but wasnt settled yet. ok NBD. I'll just invest it in MSFT. It's down, but it'll go back up. So, i bought 20,000 shares of MSFT.\n\nDuring my sleepless night of staring at my $2.8 million account, I came to the realization that my logic was most flawed.

Even made $7k. nice. \n\nNext comes lots of back and forth emails with RH and my account doing fucky things all day. Finally, this morning, it's all resolved.

{"title": "I shorted Argentina and i was right, now hear my next play", "selftext": "First of all a few things to tell,\n\nMy previous post was deleted because as i am new at wsb i didn't read the fucking rules and i got banned. Thats one thing but I'm over with it.\n\nI learned a lot of things first of all that wsb is indeed more retarded than it looks, and most you guys take options as literally gambling and do absolutely no DD whatsoever.\n\ni was also in the middle of a mess because my family will face an imminent financial crisis and that is fucking hard. Thanks for all the guys that supported me while some autist where trash-talking me. IM HERE TO STAY.\n\nFor a brief moment, i got the sensation that i was in the big short, the movie but nowhere near that amount of money. haha.\n\nNow, more DD, i was right before and i think i am right again. On Monday of this week, the etf was down more than 25% while even most of the Argentina adr on wall street fell 50%.  Also, the local currency devaluated more than 22%. Against a parity between us dollar and the Argentine peso.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/3mcFwzQ](https://imgur.com/a/3mcFwzQ)\n\nAs you may see this week was as an absolute shitshow.\n\nHow can we profit?\n\nA few things happened during the week.\n\nFirst and most important is that the international monetary fund president Christine Lagarde talked with the winning party of the elections and \"apparently\" they will not default on the loan.\n\nSecond, the current president Mauricio Macri, both in fear of not getting reelected plus as a necessity to help the taxpayers. Imposed serious economic reforms. The most important one is that, \"basically\" the taxation is going to be lowered to mid-income citizens, then food will not have aggregated sale tax. The cost of this economics reforms is estimated to be worth 100000 million pesos,  the government thinks that the inner circulation of capital will reactivate the economy.\n\nIn addition to that, the gas priced was artificially frozen for a period of 90 days. I know how fucking ugly and totalitarian this shit sounds. But as an immediate impact. If the prices are the same, then the transportation of goods will not be more expensive and that translates directly to the prices of food, supplies etc.\n\nThird, since most of the argentine stocks in wall street fell for more than 60% in some cases, there had been announced that some stocks will be privately bought back in order to increase its intrinsic value. How much are they gonna be bough back is uncertain. Pampa Energia which is one of the most important energy distributors in Argentina confirmed that they will invest 50 million usd in buying back the stock. (this is legit no elon musk twitter bullshit).  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PAM/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PAM/)\n\nMost stocks such as ggal and ypf are expected to do the same. These stocks integrate on a large scale the etf.\n\nFourth, till Tuesday no more bonds where printed, this has 2 effects 1 positive and 1 negative. The positive one is that it will automatically start to reduce inflation.  The negative one is that it discourages argentine investors to actually use the fucking shit of a currency. But for the short term and for reasons i explain down i believe that the positive outweighs the negative.\n\nTo finish of there is no more money on the streets most of it has been already put to us treasury bonds or some type   of private usd hedge fund. What i try to say with this is that there is LITERALLY no more demand for the us dollar and there is plenty of offer, so the price will decline\n\nMy predictions.....\n\nWhile is it way more easy to predict that a stock is going to go down. The criteria i followed led me to belive the opposite in this situation.\n\nI predict that the  **Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT)**  will hit 26.20 at a 85% of assurance and that it will hit 26.85 at 60% of assurance. And that it will hit 27 at 35% of assurance.\n\nI predict that GGAL will hit 18.10 by Monday and that it will continue to grow up to 20.10 at the rest of the week. (it is a very good stock to hold tho)\n\nI have insufficient data to predict MELI or YPF. So don't ask, please.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen play your bets.\n\nIT LITERALLY CANT GO DICK DOWN\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: actually read the shit you fucking idiot it's your own fucking money, are you for serious?", "id": "crb44k", "created_utc": 1565983223.0, "score": 769, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 252, "comments": [{"body": "Just spoon-feed me symbol, strike, and expiry, daddy.", "score": 652, "replies": [{"body": "TSLA, $420, 8/23", "score": 440, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "I mean you'd make about 2 mill off of $100 if that happened.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "But to truly ascend into the wallstreetbets heaven you need do blow it all on CGC calls or similar retarded shit", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck $CGC, $TLRY calls is where it's at", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5744571685791016}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17315232753753662}, {"body": "So you're saying there's a chance.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29332950711250305}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08801109343767166}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15923653542995453}, {"body": "Fuck you mean 8/23?
