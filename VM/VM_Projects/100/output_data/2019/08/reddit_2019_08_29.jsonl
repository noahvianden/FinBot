Your voting matters, and those people do too. There are good ones, and bad ones, just like many other parts of life.\n\n\n2. Failed liberal social experiments? I live in the Netherlands, which would have a very left leaning government in comparison to yours. Here we see it more as in between. Social healthcare is mandatory. I pay a 120 bucks a month, and I have to pay 500 until my insurance kicks in. I don't make much (25K a year) so I get 80 per month back. \n\n\nEducation costs 1800 a year. We actually had money allocated to every student which was a gift for 4 years (the average time it takes to finish a bachelor). Nowadays we have to pay everything, but it's still great. \n\n\nI'm living in a system that so many Republicans hate, and I don't feel like the government is interfering too much. I think I need to pay around 30% taxes, but again, because I don't make a lot I don't have to pay much. In the end I live my life like I want to, and it's relatively stress free. It helps that I don't have kids and won't have them, and therefor can work around 25 hours and sustain myself. Friends of mine who do have kids work 32 or 40 hours a week, and most if not all of them are quite happy with the way things are.\n\n\nThis is just to give you an example of how a real life liberal experiment works. Now news inlets are talking about how what the left want is communism and using those extremes to deter people from seeing what it actually is; it's a safety net for everyone. It prevents people from going bankrupt because of an injury, and it prevent unnecessary stress. \n\nUnemployment is 3.4% here right now, and most jobs are proper jobs. Even the minimum wage jobs are good enough to support yourself. 10 an hour is the minimum here, which is enough to get by (though not enough to survive very easily, I know because I worked at minimum wage for years).\n\n\nNews outlets are hard to follow and it's hard to gauge which one is true and which one isn't. But the fact of the matter is that Trump has really damaged the political system. He hurt the communication of the white house with its people, seeing as those briefings never happen anymore. He responded to the killing of LGBT people by nazi's in Charlottesville by saying there are fine people on both sides. I get that there are multiple outlets and news is hard to come by, but listen to what he is saying himself. Just one example, because to me this shows how he sees news.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdkBH8ZYYE Look at the first 6 seconds of this and read the tweets. You can find these tweets here; \n\nWhen Fox news loved Trump: https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/934551607596986368\n\n\nWhen Fox news didn't love Trump enough (according to Trump):\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1166711516701347842\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1166711517536030720\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1166712943196680193\n\n\nAnd how come all of a sudden there happens to be so much fake news? When Bush was around it there wasn't much. There weren't also this many lawsuits and other things going on. There also wasn't a president who refused to give daily briefings, talk to the press, etc etc. He's screaming fake news but he's refusing to engage himself. Which in the end only gives us news outlets to get our news from.\n\n\nI don't know if I can convince you, and if you support Trump that's fine with me, as I'm not directly affected by it.
