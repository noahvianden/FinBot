Rubbish.\n\nRecessions are a part of the normal market cycle.  While they are always accompanied by deflation in certain assets (in this case, equities) the amount of deflation is not necessarily a function of the size of the recession, but more a function of the damage done to future earnings expectations and valuation.  \n\nRemember, equity values are a bet on future earnings expectations.\n\nWhen will we know when we've entered a recession?  The answer is well after-the-fact because a recession is generally identified by a fall in GDP over two successive quarters, and even reports of GDP get \"revised downward\" well after-the-fact.  So as difficult as it may be, it's very useful to be able to predict recessions beforehand because by the time a recession is publicly acknowledged, it's far too late to take cover.\n\nSo what is an inversion and why does the 10/2 year inversion matter?\n\nAn inversion occurs when long-term rates are less than short-term rates.  In other words, it occurs when lenders can get a better return lending money for a shorter term (like 2 years) versus a longer term (like 10 years).  In a healthy market, longer durations mean higher rates, not the other way around, because the lender's money is tied up longer.\n\nThe first inversion in this market cycle occurred earlier this year, on March 7,  2019, when the 5-year and 3-year bonds inverted.  Since then several other time-frames have inverted too, culminating with today's inversion of the 10-year /2-year bonds.  It's a consistent message along numerous time-frames:  the bond market expects domestic growth to deteriorate.  It's also consistent with bond markets around the world that have also inverted:  growth is slowing dramatically.\n\nSo the main thing to understand about inversion is that it necessarily implies slower (or even negative) growth in the future.  That slower growth becomes a recession when GDP falls in two successive quarters.  Just as stocks are a predictor of future earnings expectations, the bond market as a whole acts as a predictor of future growth.  \n\nAlso noteworthy is that many experienced people observe that the bond market typically leads the stock market, and that is my experience too.  Whether that's because the bond market is savvier or because it focuses on different data, I don't know, but just as the 10/2 is widely watched, many people consider the bond market as a leader to the stock market.\n\n\"Okay,\" you might say, \"but what's so magical about the 10/2 spread?\"\n\nThe answer, as best I can tell, is nothing really, except it's widely-watched and considered the harbinger of a recession for having inverted almost every time prior to a recession in the last century.  But that doesn't mean it's not a real metric, as you can say the same for the 200-day moving average or any number of market metrics that are used.  It's safe to say, however, that when the 10/2 inverted today a number of trading programs were triggered to sell, so having an 800-point drop is not terribly surprising.  It's also not a big deal.  It's only 3%, and the S&P is still up well over 10% year to date.  If we're going to \"correct,\" we've got a long way to go.\n\nAt this point, it's worth mentioning that bond yields have cratered, and in a very short time.  This is not an exaggeration.  In October 2018, the 10-year traded over 3.25%.  But, look where we are now.  Rates have collapsed ~50% in less than 12 months.  If the stock market cratered 50% in that time period, you'd better believe people would take notice, but since it's the bond market and (this is my guess) most people are not heavily invested in bonds, it's easy to ignore.  \n\nAdding to all this, you have things like Greenspan talking about the potential for negative rates in the U.S. (yesterday).  Warning lights are flashing.\n\nBut, let's look a few others, *besides* bond inversions, from the last 12 months:\n\n*  Saving rates at historic lows\n*  Stocks at historic highs / overall valuation & limited participation (FAANG)\n*  Margin balances are at historic highs\n*  A lot of real estate considered \"overvalued\"\n*  Low to no wage growth\n*  Slowdown in real estate sales\n*  Bubbles (like Bitcoin and corporate junk bonds used for share buybacks)\n*  Euphoric earnings expectations / blowouts\n*  Complacency and record low market volitility\n*  Consumer optomism is high\n*  Rates in an upswing / up-cycle (until last month)\n*  Employment growth is slowing\n*  Low unemployment generally (below 5%)\n*  More than ten years since last recession (we're overdue)\n*  Shit-talking by Trump\n*  Disasterous IPOs\n*  Gold spiking\n*  High number of CEOs predicting a recession\n\nI'm probably going to regret making this list because it is not exhaustive and none of these in isolation are predictive of anything or meaningful to everyone.  Taken together, however, and especially coupled with an inversion in bonds, a recession is all but baked into the cake.  It's really just a matter of \"when\" within the next 6 - 18 months (i.e., this is a typical timeframe based on historical measures).\n\nDoes this mean you should panic?  No.\n\nDoes this mean the stock market won't shoot back up?  No.\n\nDoes this mean it's the beginning of a bear market?  Maybe.\n\nDoes this mean that you should move to cash?  No, *unless* you plan to retire in the next 5 years and you have a substantial AA in equities.\n\nShould you put more money to work here in the equity markets?  I wouldn't try to catch that falling knife at this stage, but that's me.  I would keep an eye on the VIX and look for it to shoot the moon before putting any long term money to work.\n\nAnyway, those are my thoughts.  I've free-associated, probably made some kind of mistake, probably going to regret posting, and probably going to have someone tell me why I'm wrong.  But it sure beats \"hey guys, I've been doing this for a year and think I have it all figured out\" comments.  We all have to start somewhere and there's a lot to learn, so I'm not discouraging people from being candid about their experience, but a symptom of this extraordinary bull market (like those before it) is the widespread sense of invulnerability that permeates the late stages.  It's when thew shoeshine boy is giving out stock tips or when people who've been in the market for 1 year give out advice.\n\nAs Buffet says, \"A bull market is like sex.

But, they\u2019re not.  \n\nFirst, homes are deeply personal.  Finding the right one takes effort.

If you\u2019re not going to live there for 5-7 years or more, you shouldn\u2019t be buying in the first place.  Transaction costs will generally kill you and you cannot and should not expect appreciation to save you.  Appreciation, outside of the rate of inflation, is merely gravy.\n\nIf, however, you\u2019re just starting your search now and have no big reason to buy, I can\u2019t see any harm in waiting a little longer to get a better deal, but you have to know your market really well.  In fact, what I would do is spend lots of time learning every aspect of the real estate market that I was looking at, including looking at how prices fared in the real estate collapse.

{"title": "I'll explain why negative yield curve is bad for the economy and how it causes recession", "selftext": "Everybody says negative yield curve is bad but no one explains why the fuck that is. \n\nBanks borrow money from the Fed, central banks around the world and other entities in the short term market and lend it to people in the long-term market. Also, the interest rates of depositors is determined by short term bond yields while interest rates of borrowers is determined by long term yields.\n\nBasically the bank borrows money for 1% and lends it to you for 4% and makes money on the 3 percent difference. When the yield curve is zero or negative, banks can't make money by lending money, so they stop lending money. This means less money in the system and credit crunch. If people and businesses can't borrow, the economy can't grow. That's when you start sucking dick for money.\n\nThis also depends on how long the curve remains negative. If it dips for one day and reverses the next day it might be ok but if it is persistently negative, time to start getting worried.\n\nIf you can't get loans you can't buy cars, houses, mail order brides, roll your debt over...etc. That's how it causes recession.

If it happened to be raining during the last 2 recessions, then people will start saying raining is an indicator and then work backwards to explain why. Rain = depression = take money out of market to do drugs and feel better = market crash.\n\nSo hear me out - cheap borrowing is usually needed when revenue and incomes are lower. Having capital negates the need for borrowing, so if market fundamentals are bad, an inversion is terrible, because now people can't borrow to buy things they couldn't afford anyway.\n\nWhen fundamentals are good (like increased manufacturing, high wages, and record profits), no one needs to borrow as much to continue spending. This is true for individuals and corporations. Inversions become less deadly.\n\nSo what sets the yield value on the bonds? Interest rates (inverted) and bond price (inverted).\n\nInterest rates have been hiked up over the past couple of years with very little down easing. In theory, this means that there is a lot of room left to reduce the fed rates without causing a major rate crisis. Remember, the fed rate was 0.5 in 2016 and has steadily increased to 2.5 with the VERY FIRST quarter drop this past month. We've got a lot of smoothing runway before things get nasty.\n\nWith respect to the bond price, that is determined by the market trading the bonds. Bonds are just debt. Bond devaluation makes bonds cheaper. Who is holding most of the US debt? China. What is China doing right now? Devaluing their currency. What happens when currency goes down of your debt holder? Buying your debt costs more. Debt costs more, bond price goes up. Bond price goes up, yield goes down. Yield goes down, yield curve flips, market crashes, everyone cries, and you buckle and make a bad trade deal. This is what China is up to right now.\n\nProblem is, China is playing a nasty, nasty game of chicken. Their market is hurting worse than ours and we have a few more levers we can pull. You can look at the recent tariff delay in one of two ways - 1) Trump was making a good faith gesture to bring them to the table or 2) Trump is starting to cave because he realizes we don't have as much runway against China as we thought. I'm inclined to think it's scenario #1 because, as I said earlier, we've got breathing room in the fed easement and can easily pull a market turn around. The yuan can only drop so low before China needs to start borrowing to keep their economy afloat.\n\nAdditional trouble from China is civil unrest that is popping up. TBH, we're probably behind the HK uprising (they are waving US flags FFS), which will be very expensive for China - especially if the UN starts breathing down their neck.\n\nPersonally, I think that since our fundamentals are still tight and we've got room with the fed, we can outlast China - even if Tariff Man isn't reelected and they will have to come to the table for a deal eventually. They do this before we run out of room on the interest rates, and boom, yield un-inverted and it's back to bull gang all day.", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": ">RedPillCafe\n\nNice analysis in this sea of autism", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Except that both the analysis and the OP are false.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3104369342327118}, {"body": "You should see the BluePillCafe", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck that guy", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10814196616411209}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3409605026245117}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23508320748806}, {"body": "I agree with much of this theory.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Me too because if I'm wrong I'm super poor", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I have no dog in that fight.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15921737253665924}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1390274167060852}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2013666182756424}, {"body": "I think this is a great explanation.

The underlying principle is that as risk increases, so do returns. So when returns are lower on 10 year bonds than they are for 2 year bonds, that means the risk 10 years out is lower than the risk 2 years out.

Second, bank stocks tend to follow interest rates, because that is a primary profit driver for them, so the delta in their negative return is not completely explained by changes in rates.\n\nAnd, if you look at historical inverse yield curves, the recession hits after the yield curve \u201ccorrects\u201d itself, which would make sense according to your theory because the banks should be willing to make loans during those periods, as they would still be able to charge profitable interest rates.\n\nNext steps would be to determine the correlation between loan originations and inverse yield curves.\n\nUntil then, maybe hit \u201cpause\u201d on that long", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but doesn\u2019t an inversed yield curve signify that investors are more bullish on the next 2 years than on the next 10 years?
