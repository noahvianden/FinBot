{"title": "Short Thesis from Markopolos: General Electric, a bigger fraud than Enron", "selftext": "Markopolos  is the guy who uncovered Madoff so he has some credibility. He alleges that GE has commited $38 Billion in Accounting Fraud, by collecting premiums on long term care insurance since the 80s without holding back enough or any capital to pay for those who need them 30-40 years later (now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The GE Capital insurance unit with the largest losses is ERAC and that unit\u2019s average policy-holders\u2019 age is now 75. The losses in this unit led to GE\u2019s unexpected late 2017/early 2018 $15 Billion reserve hit. Unfortunately, the fast approaching 5-year age group between 76-80 will see a 77% increase in LTC claims filed which will see GE\u2019s losses increase several-fold. We expect to soon see loss ratios of 750% to 1,000% or more on some of GE\u2019s reinsurance agreements. According to industry data, approximately 86% of GE\u2019s LTC claims are ahead of them and the accompanying losses are growing at an exponential and un-survivable rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>GE \u2019s cash situation is far worse than disclosed in their 2018 10-K, in fact once GE\u2019s $9.1 Billion accounting fraud tied to its Baker-Hughes GE (BHGE) acquisition is accounted for, GE only had $495 Million in cash flow from operating activities in 2018 and it ended the year with MINUS $20 Billion in working capital. After we accounted for the $38 Billion in accounting fraud GE\u2019s debt to equity ratio goes from the 3:1 ratio it reported at the end of the 2nd quarter 2019 to a woefully deficient 17:1.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe says its analog to AIG, where they collected the premiums and accounted them as profit and payed them out as dividend, because they didn't think a rogue wave could hit them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> GE LTC story is very similar to AIG\u2019s Financial Products Corporation (AIGFP) and how that ill-fated unit destroyed AIG\u2019s share price and resulted in a $189 Billion government bailout to keep AIG alive. For many years AIGFP sold credit default swaps, took the premiums as \u201cearnings\u201d and never set aside proper reserves until the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crises revealed that the underlying securities AIGFP was guaranteeing were anything but the solid credits AIG thought they were. AIG\u2019s stock price enjoyed those \u201cearnings\u201d for many years until the risks became apparent too late for AIG to survive without government assistance.    \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>GE\u2019s LTC reinsurance units are part of GE Capital (GEC), and GEC was very happy to imprudently account for LTC insurance premiums as \u201cearnings\u201d in the 1980\u2019s, 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s while policy-holders were still young and weren\u2019t filing claims. GE continuously failed to fund adequate reserves to offset its LTC liabilities, allowing itself to book billions in \u201cearnings\u201d over a period of decades and pay dividends to the holding company and then to shareholders. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf [this short thesis](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/199a11600490e42b3dcf6d2ee/files/fa29f469-c222-4a94-a324-ccf2cfea50ef/2019_08_15_GE_Whistleblower_Report.pdf) ([website](http://www.gefraud.com/)  link if pdf is not working)  is correct, fuck the news about bankrupcy, those people who are dependent  on the long term care insurance now or imminent future and paid in the  last 30 years will be fucked over so bad its undescribable.", "id": "cqpe9q", "created_utc": 1565873473.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "1000% in losses?

The leverage amounts aren't that much (from what I can tell as a retard, maybe $100 trillion), but I'm willing to accept that we're back around 17-23x right now.\n\nI think you're missing the point - not attacking you here, just trying to convince you. The problem with 2008 was that the banks could literally have meetings where they all conspired together to basically make all of these bets that looked good on paper, and then they got the lawyers to promise that no one in those meetings would get punished. And then with enough corruption, the lawyers actually pulled through.\n\nThe same thing could happen again, right now. HSBC got caught laundering some paltry sum of like $2 billion for the cartels+terrorists/something, and they paid a $200 million fine, which was likely their profit for those transactions. What they're not telling you is that if you're laundering billions, you go for it *all*, you don't stop at 2.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Goldman was laundering Chinese+Iranian+Russian+Saudi money and then throwing a little bit at GE for float to keep the US treasury officials off their back.\n\nLaundering money, surprisingly, is actually fine for the world economy, as long as taxes are being paid on it. However, if you can move money around embargoes, you can likely move it around taxes. \n\n*That's where the real shit starts to happen.* Once rich people realize that *no one* can take their money, they start hoarding, which causes deflation, and it becomes a deflationary spiral. As long as no one knows how much money the rich are hoarding and how few people hold it, the illusion remains in place. Effectively at a certain point, if one of the hoarding retards flips a switch and decides to buy a country/declare a war/eradicate a race/take over a country, well, no one can stop them and the other rich people can't tell the world how much money that crazy rich person has because then *they* would get questions asked about *them*. \n\nThe only difference between these rich people and governments is that governments print money, and these people effectively just corrupt their way to money that the governments have handed out. As a reminder, the banks essentially launder the money that the Fed creates.\n\nEpstein was basically a posterchild for this shit. \n\nIt's unclear how batshit crazy the people over at GE are, and how common a story GE appears to be.

The problem with his thesis is that while factually correct, his model assumes a policy lapse rate of 1.5% per year. This is far too pessimistic. What GE will do in the face of losses (ratios > 100%) will be that they will go to the state and refile premiums. The state will have no choice but to accept the new premiums because otherwise GE will say that they will file chapter 11, giving it protection from creditors and each year that this court battle ensures, more and more future claimants will likely die (we have seen this play before in other companies), thus reducing the total liability count. \n\nEither the state allows the new premiums -> thus incredible amounts of policies will lapse (i bet >10% per year)\n\nor GE will file chapter 11 and let new claims go in limbo and again avoid paying these liabilities.
