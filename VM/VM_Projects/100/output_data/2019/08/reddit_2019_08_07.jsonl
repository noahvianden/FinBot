I'm imagining the car coming out of a parking row and coming to pick up the driver standing outside the store. If it needs to turn left or right I don't think it would have the room to do the pre turn thing in a lot of parking lots. At least in some parking lots where I am, you can't do much pre turning. You have to pull out a little into the lane, and then initiate the turn. This also means that even with a small sized car, you may need to wait for both lanes to be clear as even with a right hand turn you will need space in both lanes to make the turn.\n\n> I think the \"and also followed the rules\" will be the kicker.

That means if you are standing outside a store directly in front of the parking lane you are parked in, with a standard 2 way parking lot street between the storefront and the parking lane, you need to have parked within the first 10 or so spots for it to work (based on google maps measurement with my local mall).
