Since Tesla is a US company, a 10% purchase tax would normally apply at time of purchase (this is different than import tax, which is a separate thing - and presumably the import tax will continue to be applied for imported Tesla cars).. to both Teslas produced in the US and China. China is now treating Tesla like a domestic company for the purposes of this tax (which as a result, now isn't a tax for Tesla).\n\nI'm basing my understanding on the wording seen in this Bloomberg article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-30/tesla-gets-exemption-from-china-s-auto-purchase-tax-shares-gain](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-30/tesla-gets-exemption-from-china-s-auto-purchase-tax-shares-gain)\n\ntl;dr: China was charging a 10% tax at purchase time of a Tesla car because that's what they normally do for non-Chinese carmakers.
