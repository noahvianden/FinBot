{"title": "Argentina Stocks - Buy the Dip?", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThe recent primary in Argentina led to stocks crashing big time in Argentina. Looking at the prices over the last 5 years, a lot of these have crashed to their lowest in that time. Or very near to it. \n\nI always try to follow global politics and figure out interesting buying opportunities based on reactionary sell-offs, but I'll admit I don't know much about Argentina. I know inflation has been high and any of these stocks would obviously pose a risk. But seems like most of them would climb again. \n\n$EDN - Electric power company in Buenos Aires, down over 50%. From around $18 to under $8 now. Lowest its been in 5 years.\n\n$SUPV - holding company that does banking. Also down over 50%. From around $7 to under $3.50 now. Went public about 3 years ago and this is an all time low. \n\n$BBAR - Oldest private bank in Argentina. Down over 50%. Was hovering in the $11-$12 range. Now, sits below $5.50. Also, lowest price in 5 years.\n\nThere's obviously more as pretty much all their stocks were hit hard, but I'd love to hear some thoughts.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/08/12/argentina-election-macri-suffers-setback-as-analysts-warn-of-peso-depreciation.html\n\nEDIT: Added an article", "id": "cphd29", "created_utc": 1565638531.0, "score": 193, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "It is a bet on the stocks as well as the country over all.

When kirchner was president, a ton of soy was worth about 600usd because of the rapid growth China was having. So she taxed the soy producers and got tons of money to gift.

In some protests you could see policemen standing while people threw rocks at them. If a policeman responds with violence, he goes to jail because of \u201cexcessive authority\u201d.\n\nFinally, dont buy the idea of fernandez wanting to help the economy.
