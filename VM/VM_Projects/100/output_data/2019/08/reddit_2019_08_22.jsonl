They got their licenses for Gigafactory3 in Shanghai. I don\u2019t think investors fully appreciate how big of a deal this is. Getting these licenses, for a foreign invested company, typically take a few years to obtain. Tesla got them 3 days after the inspection.\n\nThe Walmart lawsuits won\u2019t affect Tesla too much as it\u2019s not linked to their car business and the damages they\u2019re suing for won\u2019t impact Tesla in any significant way.\n\nWhat gives?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">I really don\u2019t understand the downward pressure on this stock.\n\nMy hypothesis is that it is a combination of fear from humans and bot traders taking advantage of momentum.\n\nA few years ago, I watched a show on PBS about market bubbles, where psychologists ran experiments indicating that people feel fear of losing money about twice as much as they feel elation from gaining money.  This is why bubbles crash so rapidly.   Whether it is tulip bulbs or bitcoins, people in aggregate (the herd) run for the exits when they are scared of losing value on paper.\n\nThis is what appears to have happened to TSLA after the Q1 results.  People became scared.  The mainstream media runs fear-driven clickbait articles to get ad revenue.  More sellers than buyers drives the price down.  Bots pile on to take advantage of the momentum.\n\nIt's not just TSLA that suffers this.  NVDA (chipmaker nVidia Corp.) was trading at close to $290 last year.  A single bad quarter, combined with a mini-panic at the end of 2018, quickly drove NVDA down to $127, a loss of over 56% of market cap.  NVDA hasn't recovered.  It's still trading in the $160-$170 range.  AAPL was down nearly 40% in the same time span, although it has recovered more than NVDA.\n\nI believe that TSLA only recovers when uncertainty is lifted.  Primarily, this means stable manufacturing and sales operations of its automobiles from factories on 3 continents, consistent growth from existing and new markets, and balance sheets that the risk-averse finance types can't find much fault with.  More clarity in the capabilities of the Full Self Driving systems would also help.\n\nTSLA at around $220 today, down from the highs of $370-$380, reflects the risk and fear surrounding this company.  If you believe Tesla has a bright future, the time to buy is when others are fearful.  I expect that the drama will continue for at least another 2-3 years, and possibly 5-7 years.  This will be mentally punishing in the extreme for everyone who has any kind of position in this stock.  Most people should have nothing to do with TSLA at all.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I own NVDA, and this is a mischaracterization of the stock price drop.\n\nEPS massively dropped. Stock price is primarily driven by financials and valuation. In NVDAs case it was priced as a growth stock, and forward P/E also ballooned as future growth was guided downward by both analysts and NVDA. NVDAs inventory from the crypto bubble was only cleared this quarter. Investors don't like having literal extra billions of old inventory. In the case NVDA had real competition from Vega their margins would have been decimated and it would have been a possible inventory crisis/writedown. NVDA is not back to those SP levels because while margins have been kept above expectations, datacenter growth is alarming for their current valuation. The margins let investors feel safe to wait a few more quarters for ultra high margin datacenter parts to hit the balance sheet as promised.\n\nYour post has some fine high level ideas about crowd behavior, but no mention of the balance sheet. It should be 75 percent numbers from balance sheets and sector/macro trends if you want to fully characterize the non-random walk forces behind stock price.

I didn't tell him to buy calls or puts. I just told him CSCO was good for gambling on earnings.\n\nWith that out of the way. CRM crushed it. I would expect a pretty hefty dip at open as people take their profits, followed shortly by it trading back at 157 or 158 or better.. You can either join the profit-taking crew, or sit patiently and see if it runs back up while your contracts time-decay. You also have J powell to contend with at 10 AM and IDK if CRM's stock has any exposure to interest rates or not but it's a confounding factor.\n\nPersonally, I'd take my profits as soon as possible and be happy with them, but try not to panic-sell if it dumps right away. In the end it's up to you, and you should expect to lose quite a lot of money over the next few months while you figure it out. As fun as earnings are, they can be difficult to make money off of, even if you're *mostly* right.

Massive buying volume forming walls.", "selftext": "Last night there was a mega block of GE Stock traded at 15:10:00 with Price $8:16  equaling 6,297,443 shares bought. The total came out to $51,387,134.88 worth of GE, most likely by an institutional investor (possibly the hedge who was in on the short? That is not for certain.) Culp and his insider cronies have bought over $3M in stock since the Markopolis accusations, and banks associated with GE have also began purchasing which results in the current buy walls between 8.18 and 8.00.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/iK6MoBx.png](https://i.imgur.com/iK6MoBx.png)\n\nThe volume of puts that have been placed between now and Sept 1st are massive. However, the buying action has also resulted in call options being placed > $8.00, but at half the volume of the puts.

It would be much more difficult to control and recover price in midst of a crash and possible spiral, so they put up the Wall of the North that only a fucking zombie dragon or tens of millions in short/sale volume to break thru. Beautiful big dick move.\n\nGE will get hazed and pay for its crimes, I think that is inevitable. However, if you're holding on to 8/23 or 8/30 puts, you might wanna consider this behavior in volume because it seems that it may take longer than expected before GE takes a hard boner in the ass.
