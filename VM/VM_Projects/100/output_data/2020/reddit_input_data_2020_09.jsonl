{"title": "Walmart VS Amazon, the next big online retailer (Walmart DD). Why my money is on Walmart", "selftext": "**Walmart Due Dilligence**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n\\- Partnership with Instacart\n\nRecently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \\[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart\u2019s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.\n\n\\- Partnership with Shopify\n\nIn addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item\u2019s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart\u2019s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart\u2019s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.\n\n\\- Partnership with ThredUp\n\nWalmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable\u2019s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would\u2019ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.\n\n\\- Google\n\nWalmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.\n\n\\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)\n\nWalmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.\n\nSince the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n\\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO\u2019s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.\n\n\\- Jet.com\n\nThe first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce.\n\n\\- Flipkart\n\nEver heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart\u2019s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.\n\n\\- TikTok acquisition\n\nSome very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok\u2019s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart\u2019s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India\u2019s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.\n\n**Walmart PLUS**\n\nWord is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year\n\n**2 Hour Delivery**\n\nWalmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.\n\n**5000+ US stores.**\n\nThis is Walmart\u2019s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.\n\n**Some other interesting facts to consider.**\n\n\\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s expansion in Africa, India, China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nLet me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.\n\nWalmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.\n\nSources:\n\nInstacart:\n\n[https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry)\n\nShopify:\n\n[https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025)\n\nThredUp\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172)\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438\\_6272369\\_7404214](https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438_6272369_7404214)\n\nGoogle:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/)\n\nMicrosoft

{"title": "Beware not of a good product, be terrified by a good factory!", "selftext": "The main valid criticism to Tesla value is not around the product and its profitability but about the volume of production. \n\nFor any kind of product, there is always space for a niche version of it, where smaller volume, higher quality versions with higher return per unit are profitable enterprises. I would argue that this is a general axiom.\n\nThe legitimate question for an investor would be: is Tesla a niche enterprise or not. The answer to this question is key to my personal understanding of Tesla share values. There is clearly something that is astray with the production numbers and the capitalization. \n\nI fully understand the case that Tesla is not a car company, with my financial advisor framing it as an Energy and SW company. However their most visible line of products, besides battery packs, are automotive in nature.\n\nI am also looking at evaluation of other car companies and they are following a steady or downward trend. I have to believe that there are plenty of real analyst behind many ETF that look at these numbers and do not go for the media appearance, and have moved the stocks for what seems long term investment. Bubbles are always possible with heard dynamics, but what if there is another storyline? \n\nThe only one I can think is that analyst do not see anymore Tesla as a car maker but as a factory maker. This is a much bigger deal then having just a good car or an innovative technology. Let\u2019s explore the facts and the consequences.\n\n3 Gigafactories popping up in 18 months or less, all with the same basic design would  be Impressive by itself. The capability of completing these in accelerating record time is even more impressive. Factories bring immense political power, with jobs, paychecks and economic development that quickly outpace any tax break. \n\nSuddenly the earth is shifting under the feet of the incumbent manufacturers. The social strength of their position and even their status is no longer unquestionable. With an extreme simplification, They are no longer too big to fail, because a new factory can pop up by the time two board of directors convene to ponder the situation and realize it is too late.\n\nI now believe that the terrifying product of Tesla are factories. The machine that build the machines is here and Tesla is the now swinging a huge club smashing political and social structures in place for centuries. \n\nIf Tesla, next year, has 4 gigafactories producing cars, and start 2 or 3 new ones, it will be terrifying for the incumbents... by the next board of directors they will not have anybody to talk to. \n\nOf course, I am probably grossly wrong, my wife and kids will confirm this statement anytime.

The reason car manufacturers don't put out products quickly is they take their time. They spend years developing a car because their R&D is so much more rigorous. VW literally own an enormous test track (Nardo) and even Ferrari own a few racing circuits. Then there are smaller facilities like MIRA which can be used for extreme weather testing. I've seen cars at a couple of these facilities literally years before even being announced because the manufacturer wants to make them as good as they can possibly be.\n\nTesla chucks out the Y with some issues actually carried over from the 3 and for some reason is going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and redesign the Y for the European market. Land Rover took the Defender off sale and actually didn't bother with its replacement until a few years after because they were taking their time and being careful.\n\nOn the Porsche point, given that your average Porsche costs at least $100k you're going to have the fussiest of the fussy buyers because they're expensive and have a reputation of being *very* good cars. The Taycan pounds the S into the ground for quality and design.\n\nTesla on the other hand puts out cars of quality ranging from average to atrocious (leaky seals, really?), has service times in the weeks to months (despite car parts usually being same or next day) yet somehow manages the highest customer satisfaction? Something tells me that your average Tesla customer isn't as fussy as someone buying Stuttgart's finest.\n\nThe legacy manufacturers could chuck out something quickly if they wanted to, the VW Group makes most of its money off of the Golf platform after all, but they're taking their time because they can and do.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Taking their time is a quite stupid strategy.
