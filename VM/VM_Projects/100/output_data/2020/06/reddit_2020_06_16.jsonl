{"title": "Why Oil is Set to Skyrocket and So Are You", "selftext": "**So this is the cool thing about oil.** Demand has bottomed, and has shown only small green shoots of recovery. In fact, the climb from -$999999 WTI to +$37 can be accounted for **solely through the supply side, where producers are literally falling over themselves to cut supply.**\n\nPretty shitty right? Decreased demand, price increases only from supply, we're completely fucked! Well, not really.\n\nThe reality is that **supply continues to dwindle** as oil producers scramble to cut costs. Simultaneously, **demand has nowhere to go but up, it's basically at the lowest point it's ever going to be at ever.**\n\nSo what do you get when demand finally recovers? You get an **oil crunch**. Demand surpasses supply and the oil producers, traumatized from the recent negative oil vortex, have neither the will nor the ability to amp up supply quickly enough to meet it. Crude oil skyrockets, the energy companies are saved, and **you profit massively.**\n\n**You can play this one of two ways.** Either make long bets on U.S. energy companies that hit their profit sweet spot at around **$40-$45 WTI.** Or place calls on one of the many ravaged oil funds (USO, UCO, etc.) that, believe it or not, actually do catch increases in oil prices (after some shady reorganization, but that's a story for another day). Of course, if the world ends, we're all fucked, but in that case you've got bigger things to worry about (like buying puts on everything but Zoom Video, which is invincible and will survive the heat death of the universe).\n\n*(Calls one month out at least boys, I can't guarantee that your grandma will be driving as often in the very near future)*\n\n*(Oil is also a great inflation play if you're worried about JPOW printing us into oblivion. If the dollar is devalued, you need more of them to buy a barrel, no two ways about it*)\n\n*(Watch for volatility, it's going to be a wild ride to the top).*\n\nGood luck, fellow autists.", "id": "h9unyu", "created_utc": 1592274601.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "You\u2019re not wrong. \n\nNo matter which direction we go due to covid oil demand will only go up next 1-3 years. \n\n80% of my portfolio is in oil.

{"title": "Will we ever see the March lows again? FUNDAMENTAL DD INSIDE", "selftext": "From a fundamental perspective, there are 2 main ways to understand how a stock is valued. Here\u2019s my attempt to help you autists understand these concepts. If you don\u2019t understand it at the end of this, you can be confident in your Supreme autism, premium included.\n\n**I.** **Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCF)**\n\nFirst way, which I won\u2019t go into great detail about, is a DCF. A stock price is representative of the present value of all future cash flows (in the form of dividends to shareholders). This entire approach is based on the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Google is your friend to learn more. While a DCF is a very accurate way to value a company, the risks are the multiple assumptions you have to make to triangulate a target valuation. Pick a valuation, any valuation \u2013 bear, bull, kangaroo, whatever, and you can mess with the assumptions underlying a DCF to justify it. My view is that justifying most of the companies/stocks popular here using this approach will lead you to conclude that everything is overvalued. In the professional investing world, a DCF is usually the last valuation method performed, & the information you\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t necessarily to establish a target price for a specific stock, but to see what discount rate gets shaken out from your view on projected cash flows. This is a very deep concept, so I\u2019ll stop here; if you\u2019re interested maybe I\u2019ll write about this at a later date.\n\n**II.** **Forward Year EV/EBITDA**\n\nSecondly, and bigly, is 1-year forward *expected* cash flows/EBITDA/Revenue/Net Income, whatever, & an assigned multiple. Still with me? Story time:\n\nYou\u2019re an autistic little boy still living in your parent\u2019s basement and you want to raise money for your first Robinhood option YOLO, so you decide fuck it, I\u2019ll sell lemonade in front of my house for $1 a cup. At the end of your first year selling lemonade you make $100 in profit/EBITDA. Nice.\n\nWhile selling lemonades one day, some guy pulls up in a white van & offers to acquire your lemonade business from you. He shoots you an offer for $100 to buy the business off of you. Do you sell? Let\u2019s say you say no, and then he says \u2018ok little autist, I\u2019ll give you $400 for it, final offer\u2019. So combined with your profits last year, you have $500 to buy some SPY 50Ps & you think ok, I\u2019ll take it. He says wait here, let me run to the bank to get you the cash & leaves. The takeaway here is that let\u2019s say your autistic brain thinks next year, you\u2019re just going to make another $100 in profit/EBITDA, so essentially you\u2019ve sold your business at 4x ($400 / $100). 4x is a decent multiple, especially if you think your profit/EBITDA growth is going to be flat year over year. Great.\n\nSo you\u2019re still sitting there selling lemonades waiting for the pedo man to come back with the $400 & all of a sudden your cracked screen iPhone 7 vibrates with incoming breaking news. Because of global warming, all of the green scientists predict that next year will be Summer all year long. No other seasons. You realize that a bulk of your $100 in profit/EBITDA occurs during the Summer, but given the variations of the seasons, during the colder seasons your business does shittily, but now, with Summer weather for 365 days straight you revise your forward expected profit/EBITDA of $100 to $200, and you realize fuck, I\u2019m selling this business for too cheap. Why is it \u2018cheap\u2019? Because instead of 4x, you\u2019re getting 2x ($400 / $200) your profits at the $400 valuation. White van pedo man returns & you tell him you want 4x on your newly revised projected profits of $200, so $800 is the new price. He scoffs & goes fine, fine \u2013 I\u2019ll brb.\n\nSo this is the 2nd way stocks are valued, & the multiples whether it\u2019s EV/EBITDA (which I\u2019ve just demonstrated), EV/Revenue, the notoriously gamed P/E multiple or FCF yields, there are a ton of them, & it varies by industry.\n\n**Why the fuck does any of this matter whether we re-touch the March lows or not?**\n\nFirst \u2013 let\u2019s say the incoming \u2018shocking\u2019 news does not change from the time the white van leaves to get you your $800. There is no longer a catalyst that will force you to revise your future expected profits/EBITDA. So the $200 forward projection is something that you\u2019re confident in, & will not change in the time period it takes for the buyer of your business to go to the bank & back with your cash.\n\nThink of COVID & all of the news since March as becoming less & less \u2018shocking\u2019. We\u2019ve had 3 months since then, projections for companies have been revised, & even the \u2018scare\u2019 of a 2nd wave has been reacted to/debated ad nauseam since the initial onset of the global economic lockdowns. So long as the views on future profits/earnings/EBITDA at companies are still widely dispersed with folks at opposite spectrums, we\u2019ll have volatility; but the main feature to understand is that most have come to realize that we\u2019ve established a *range*. Essentially, barring some devastating breaking news such as a COVID mutation etc., a drastic revision to bottomed out projections is unlikely to change.\n\nSecond \u2013 where did the 4x multiple come from? Is it just a good feeling? What exactly is driving you to conclude that 4x is the appropriate number. **Enter Mr. J-Pow & currency, prices, & inflation**.\n\nYou see \u2013 everyone kind of understands loosely that stocks go up / down based on a Company\u2019s performance. Not many understand why TSLA or ZM is trading at >100x earnings, because they do not fully grasp the big green JPow shtick. Let\u2019s go back to the story about Autist Lemonade & Co.:\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re not as autistic as people think, & as the owner of a prestigious lemonade company, you have a good \u2018feel\u2019 for the markets. Your parents tell you all the time the rent they should be receiving for your space in the basement has gone up 2x, 3x over the last couple years, your parents are constantly refinancing their home at lower interest rates & taking out cash to spend on vacations from a home equity line of credit as their house increases in value. Mr. JPow letting the entire economy feel his clout. So is 4x still a valid multiple? What about 8x? 10x? 20x?\n\nThis is what most fundamental investors fail to completely understand. The entire monetary system is designed to let people see incrementally bigger numbers in their bank accounts / net worth. Mr. J-Pow\u2019s job is essentially to force this to happen over many years. Is it moral? Who knows, who fucking cares. All an autist needs to understand is that this is how *risk* is managed from the Mount Olympus money printer J-Pow sits on. If you\u2019re risk-averse & throw your cash in a mattress, over time that cash will becoming worth less & less. You\u2019re punished for being risk-averse in this environment. Is this because the dollar is getting weaker? Who knows, we can debate this over & over but all that matters is that the prices of food, gas, airplane tickets, cars stays relatively flat & that people ridden with debt have a plethora of opportunities to *inflate* away their debts & people with positive net worths see their portfolios rise over time without having to pay much attention.\n\n**No more stories, give me a fucking ticker!**\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m postulating, with some actual data. The impact of J-Pow on individual stocks is over the long run, in projected profits/EBITDA/Revenues as the increase in cash supply works its way through the economy & in the short run (1-year forward), reflected in its **trading multiple**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Marriott International, the parent company of some of the most recognized hotel brands in the world from 2006 to today & cap rates for commercial real estate.\n\n**I. Marriott International (NASDAQ: MAR)**\n\nThe most relevant multiple for the hoteliers is EV/EBITDA & FCF Yield (Free Cash Flow yield). I\u2019m going to focus on FCF yield, which can be thought of as this: all of the cash leftover to potentially return to equity investors in the form of dividends after all required debt interest, capital expenditures etc., has been paid. I took all of the actual/consensus estimated figures from 2006 to 2020, and for share price I\u2019m using the VWAP (Google if you don\u2019t know) over the course of each year. So FCF yield = Free Cash Flow per Share / VWAP (Share Price), & is typically represented as a percent. Simplified further, if a share is worth $100, and FCF is $10, then the *yield* you are expecting to receive given the Company returns all of its excess cash to you as an investor is 10%. If the FCF stays at $10 and the share price goes up to $200, the expected yield is no longer 10%, it goes to 5% ($10 / $200).\n\nGiven no J-Pow, little to no inflation, or any other fuckery in the markets, this \u2018multiple\u2019 should be flat, and the share price of a Company should go up based on Marriott\u2019s performance. Did that happen since \u201906? Lmfao.\n\nLet's look at the below analysis \\[1\\]:\n\n[Marriott FCF Yield Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/j555q2p649551.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef76f71b78b2360f46bce45d4076669c233ae58e)\n\nFrom \u201906 to \u201919, share price has grown at a +10% CAGR, while FCF yields have compressed by \\~4%. 40% of the share price gains from \u201906 have been attributed to ***multiple expansion***\\*.\\* Let\u2019s look at when QE first started to take its effect on the markets, 2009 to 2019. Share price has grown by +19.6% CAGR, and FCF yields have compressed at a 12.5% CAGR based on Actual reported figures & 8.5% CAGR for consensus estimates. So **up to 60% of share price gains since 2009 has been attributed solely to multiple expansion / money printer go brrrrrrrr**.\n\nInterestingly, if you look at the 2020E column, I put yesterday\u2019s share price close of $90.79 & based on current consensus estimates for free cash flow, the FCF yield has compressed by 10bps to 4.1% from 4.2% in 2019. Does this mean the stock is fairly valued? Undervalued? How accurate are the estimates? Historically the analyst estimates have been off from actuals by \\~3%, but the standard deviation is a whopping \\~12%. I\u2019ll let the Statistician autists figure this out further.\n\n**II. Commercial Real Estate Cap Rates**\n\nThe primary valuation method for real estate is implied cap rates. Think of it in the same logic as FCF yield for Marriott, except instead of free cash flow, it\u2019s rent minus real estate taxes, maintenance other required shit / real estate value. I looked at the cap rates from 1986 to May 2020 for all of the sectors \u2013 Apartments, Industrial, Malls, Office, Hotels \\[2\\].\n\nSo since the beginning of my dataset of 1986, cap rates have grown \\[3\\] at a +1.8% CAGR year over year, or a +85% increase overall. What does this fucking mean? If you had a house & collected just $100 of rent every year since 1986 without it changing whatsoever, the value of your property would still have appreciated by +85% over that time period. Asset inflation.\n\nSince 2009, it\u2019s more or less the same story. Cap rates have grown at a +4.3 CAGR year over year, or a +60% increase (lower than the \u201986 figures due to shorter time frame). What\u2019s interesting is the pick-up in the CAGR since 2009. Money printer god at work. And they say there\u2019s no \u2018inflation\u2019?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo long as there is no more \u2018shocking\u2019 news like the initial reaction to COVID that would cause forward expected profits/EBITDA/revenue to be drastically revised, we\u2019ve entered into a perpetual bull market where trading multiples will continue to expand & with this, it's safe to say the downside range has been fully established. Will a 2nd bigger wave fuck up your Calls? Yes, if the actual news inflow is much different than expected news inflows, but assuming it isn\u2019t, these multiples are here to stay & we should not touch the March lows again.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall best to invest in Calls, very, very selectively in Puts. Don\u2019t fight the Fed.

{"title": "Billionaire Leon Cooperman warns Robinhood retards", "selftext": "Billionaire Leon Cooperman on Monday said that the emergence of individual investors eagerly scooping up stocks that have been rocked amid the coronavirus-induced downturn will ultimately not end well for those individual investors.\n\nThe \u2018Robinhood markets are going to end in tears,\u201d said Cooperman during CNBC\u2019s show \u201cHalftime Report\u201d on Monday, referring to the popular online trading platform.\n\nCooperman referred to a Barron\u2019s article that noted that free trading app Robinhood has added more than three million accounts this year, and now has over 13 million, with a median age of 31.\n\nA number of recent reports attribute the market\u2019s rally since its March 23 low, and its subsequent choppy trading, to an era of zero-commission discount brokerage trades, ushered in by Charles Schwab SCHW+0.25% and platforms like Robinhood that cater to younger investors.\n\nCritics like Cooperman say that a dearth of diversions due to COVID-19 lockdowns and unemployment have created a perfect environment for newly minted day traders to wreak havoc on Wall Street.\n\nOn Monday, Cooperman pointed to purchases of bankrupt car-rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. HTZ-33.57% which has drawn feverish buying interest from bargain-hunting investors, even though the company\u2019s bankruptcy means that there is little if any equity value in the enterprise.\n\nThus far, mom-and-pop investors have outperformed pros like Cooperman and mutual funds, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs. It\u2019s unclear, however, how long that outperformance will last and to the degree by which individual investors are piling into risky investments with reckless abandonment.\n\n*angry billionaire noises*\n\n[Article](https://www.google.be/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/8DCB53DE-AF2E-11EA-885A-481D889F3439)", "id": "ha29yf", "created_utc": 1592307345.0, "score": 186, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "In other words another billionaire is pissed that he is losing to a bunch of us \"uneducated traders\". \n\nThey are probably worried that they'll lose customers who realize they can manage their own 401k or Roth.", "score": 318, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly I\u2019ve never seen so many anonymous billionaires come out of the woodwork to bash something like they are doing with retail investors, DDTG and RH. \n\nThey must be extremely unhappy", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "I think they are irate.

At the very least just throw your savings that you don\u2019t need for 5-10+ years into an index fund or ETF.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation", "gdp"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Nobody is going to be driving a gas car in 2030.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "tsla to a 100,000", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "good entry point for puts?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "420,690", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.011792249977588654}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2299657016992569}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Where is my 2020 Camry going to be in 10 years then?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Junkyard", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3213382363319397}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43749386072158813}, {"body": "Want to make a bet?
