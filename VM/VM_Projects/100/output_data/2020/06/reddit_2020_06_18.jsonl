{"title": "PRPL is the next meme stock", "selftext": "PRPL has had a couple great days coming off the Oppenheimer Conference where people with money who do math started buying this when they realized that it is underpriced.\n\n[I called the $19+ price point a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqpqa3/prpl_to_19_by_812_er_calling_it_again/), but it looks like it has come much sooner than expected.   The stock will continue to grow into the $20-$24 where it belongs due to the math money piling in.\n\nCouple this with the meme chasers coming to the realization that HTZ is about as worthless as tits on a nun and DKNG disappointing the last few weeks more than your wedding night.   Where is all the meme money going to turn?  PRPL.\n\nWhy?  It has already minted a few millionaires and ***the stock is still going to go up***.

It's got the same ingredients when fake wsbgod pushed TSLA, SPCE and whatever else, except this time there are real gains on display.\n\n# I'm calling this right now.   Again.\n\nPRPL is gonna meme right past the $20-$24 where it should be according to \"fundamentals\" and boom up into the mid-thirties range before it gets frothy and retracts down a bit.\n\nI guess hold on, hop in, or watch from the sidelines.   This is gonna be fun to watch!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/u/superpositivity:   you [better have held](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzyswg/prpl_nurple_are_my_tits_about_to_go_up/) man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr  PRPL is gonna meme up.   Want actual DD?   Read my post history or /u/dhsmatt2's post history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm long PRPLW.

The upswing the last few days is from exposure of the security at the Oppenheimer conference as institutionals buy in.\n\nThat doesn't change what I said, you're talking about a brief short squeeze and I'm talking about in general. Once the stock returns to normal average trading volumes it will be easy to push around, especially for anyone buying and selling large dollar amounts.\n\nI trade some small stocks with 10x the daily volume of this one and can easily inadvertently move the price with a 5-10k buy or sell. It doesn't take much to sell through the market depth.\n\nFor instance, right now on PRPL there are only 700 shares in bids spread across the closest 10 cents of market depth. That's maybe $10-20k to sell it down half a percent. If you're trying to sell off any serious volume you'd have to be incredibly gentle with that order book.\n\nAnd just now I saw a pullback where the bid dropped to 18.66 for about 30 seconds while the \"price\" was at 18.74.

With Abbott being reluctant to take any actions that could negatively affect the economy, I think it's safe to assume that the cases will only grow further in the near future. With this trend continuing, I can already picture the media heads shouting how the hospitals in TX, AZ, NC, and CA are running out of spaces. Trump also just signed a bill yesterday approving the sanction against China for its persecutions in the Xinjiang region. \n\nMy forecast for the coming weeks is, we might first see some growing followed by another dip with any of the issues that I just mentioned, which will be quickly countered by a cushioning action from either Fed or Trump. Then, I foresee another temporary bull market until it reaches a point that satisfies Powell and Powell stepping off from the QE pedal like he promised during the recent congressional hearings. \n\nWhether you gain or lose from this crazy market, remember that just by taking a part in it, you are first handedly witnessing potentially one of the most historic economic events in the U.S. history. \n\ntl;dr The sideway movements that we've seen in this week probably won't last long.

{"title": "Pfizer call will get your PP harder than viagra", "selftext": "TLDR - PFE 35c 7/17 for the r/investing crowd and PFE 38-39c 7/17 for the true WSB autist\n\nI know many of you have a bad taste in their mouth when they hear the name \u201cPfizer\u201d, but all of that is about to change.  You see, Pfizer will be releasing data on their coronavirus vaccine within the very near future, and as we all know, stocks with COVID treatments skyrocket on even the slightest hint of good news.  Look at GILD, MRNA and NVAX.  You might say that Pfizer is bigger than all three of them so will have less volatility and you would be correct, but GILD has a 93B market cap, so while PFE is twice as big at 187B, if inconclusive data on GILD can send it up 10% plus, think about what positive data on a coronavirus vaccine that will actually hit the public in September will do.  \n\nThe best part about this is that PFE options are pricing in extremely low volatility, so they aren\u2019t even expecting much of a move which is quite surprising given how the market has reacted to coronavirus treatment news in the past.  This means that instead of IV crush, there will be an IV spike if PFE takes off after the data is released.  So not only will you make money from the stock price increasing, you will also be making money from IV as well.  Money + money = TENDIES.  \n\nLooking from a technicals standpoint, the play becomes even better.  After a pretty poor performance over the last few weeks dropping PFE from over $38 on 5/29 to now $33.70 at the time of this post, the RSI has fallen quite a bit down to 35. Momentum now seems to be shifting upwards, and positive coronavirus data might be just the play to send it soaring as there is a ton of room to run before RSI gets even close to overbought.\n\nNow you may be thinking that this sounds nice and all, but what if the data is bad.  Well let me put your mind at ease. It won\u2019t be. They are testing four different vaccines in the largest vaccine trial to-date involving the 18-80 age group and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China).  Pfizer is so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates ahead of results.\n\nAnd no one should forget that the second data is released, Donny Pump will be all over this.  Tweets will say that a cure is almost here thanks to Pfizer, and boomers will pile into PFE stock for that juicy dividend and retail millennials will fomo into it because Pfizer will become the next hyped up corona play.\n\nTo add icing on this cake, did I mention that Pfizer\u2019s new diabetes drug was just discovered to make people lose over 17 pounds, improves blood sugar tremendously, and will be an oral agent to replace existing injectable options within the class? Every diabetic man, woman, and child is going to be asking to be on this weight-loss drug (typical diabetes drugs cause weight gain). They are about to announce this information today at 11:30 EST in a conference call with analysts to review data presentations at the American Diabetes Association held on June 12-16, 2020 on their oral small molecule GLP-1R agonist (PF-06882961).\n\nThe market has not reacted to this yet, as there have been no articles by any major news sources on the data, nor has the stock price reacted at all. Pfizer not only has the COVID vaccine going for them, but also extremely promising data for their diabetes drug. The momentum from these upcoming headlines should push PFE back to a normal valuation; it is currently selling at a discount lower than any price in 2019 and has recently been oversold from May valuations. \n\nPositions:  I have $38 and $39 PFE calls, as I believe at the current price they have huge potential to be at least a 10 bagger at minimum if not more and I picked 7/17 as the expiration date because of the liquidity and because of the IV spike that will accompany positive data next week.", "id": "hbe7qf", "created_utc": 1592485508.0, "score": 252, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 267, "comments": [{"body": "Nice! 07/17 38,39 calls are cheap af.
