{"title": "PRPL is the next meme stock", "selftext": "PRPL has had a couple great days coming off the Oppenheimer Conference where people with money who do math started buying this when they realized that it is underpriced.\n\n[I called the $19+ price point a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqpqa3/prpl_to_19_by_812_er_calling_it_again/), but it looks like it has come much sooner than expected.   The stock will continue to grow into the $20-$24 where it belongs due to the math money piling in.\n\nCouple this with the meme chasers coming to the realization that HTZ is about as worthless as tits on a nun and DKNG disappointing the last few weeks more than your wedding night.   Where is all the meme money going to turn?  PRPL.\n\nWhy?  It has already minted a few millionaires and ***the stock is still going to go up***.

It's got the same ingredients when fake wsbgod pushed TSLA, SPCE and whatever else, except this time there are real gains on display.\n\n# I'm calling this right now.   Again.\n\nPRPL is gonna meme right past the $20-$24 where it should be according to \"fundamentals\" and boom up into the mid-thirties range before it gets frothy and retracts down a bit.\n\nI guess hold on, hop in, or watch from the sidelines.   This is gonna be fun to watch!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/u/superpositivity:   you [better have held](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzyswg/prpl_nurple_are_my_tits_about_to_go_up/) man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr  PRPL is gonna meme up.   Want actual DD?   Read my post history or /u/dhsmatt2's post history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm long PRPLW.

The upswing the last few days is from exposure of the security at the Oppenheimer conference as institutionals buy in.\n\nThat doesn't change what I said, you're talking about a brief short squeeze and I'm talking about in general. Once the stock returns to normal average trading volumes it will be easy to push around, especially for anyone buying and selling large dollar amounts.\n\nI trade some small stocks with 10x the daily volume of this one and can easily inadvertently move the price with a 5-10k buy or sell. It doesn't take much to sell through the market depth.\n\nFor instance, right now on PRPL there are only 700 shares in bids spread across the closest 10 cents of market depth. That's maybe $10-20k to sell it down half a percent. If you're trying to sell off any serious volume you'd have to be incredibly gentle with that order book.\n\nAnd just now I saw a pullback where the bid dropped to 18.66 for about 30 seconds while the \"price\" was at 18.74.

With Abbott being reluctant to take any actions that could negatively affect the economy, I think it's safe to assume that the cases will only grow further in the near future. With this trend continuing, I can already picture the media heads shouting how the hospitals in TX, AZ, NC, and CA are running out of spaces. Trump also just signed a bill yesterday approving the sanction against China for its persecutions in the Xinjiang region. \n\nMy forecast for the coming weeks is, we might first see some growing followed by another dip with any of the issues that I just mentioned, which will be quickly countered by a cushioning action from either Fed or Trump. Then, I foresee another temporary bull market until it reaches a point that satisfies Powell and Powell stepping off from the QE pedal like he promised during the recent congressional hearings. \n\nWhether you gain or lose from this crazy market, remember that just by taking a part in it, you are first handedly witnessing potentially one of the most historic economic events in the U.S. history. \n\ntl;dr The sideway movements that we've seen in this week probably won't last long.
