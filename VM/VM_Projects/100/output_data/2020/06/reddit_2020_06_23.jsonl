The worst case scenario ran in 2019 is nothing compared to what has actually happened in 2020 so you can only imagine they will all fail. \n\nI am going to short JPM, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Left out Capital One because they mainly deal with Credit Cards and it seems like most people are paying them off.\n\nTLDR\nWhat's your opinion on this Thursdays bank stress test? After reading the 2019 test results, I think most will do horribly.\n\nBAC 7/2 22P,\nWFC 7/2 22P\nC 7/17 40P \n\nGoing to look for more plays tomorrow.\n\nEdit- I had flawed logic and will sell off the puts tomorrow. Forgot JPOW makes stonks go up, thanks for the reminder.\n\nEdit #2 - stonks went down today and I made teddies.\n\nEdit #3- sold the puts for profit, bought calls yesterday, sold most of the calls for profit today and only holding a few jpm calls.\n\nFUCK ALL OF YOU WHO SAID BANKS WOULD DO GOOD ON THE STRESS TESTS, TOLD YALL MO FOS!
