Well look no further cause my retarded ass is here to lay it all the fuck out for you.\n\nTLDR: if u buy calls tomorrow you're a fucking idiot and deserve to lose every dollar you have (looking at u davey day trader - ur gonna go broke) buy puts on fucking everything\n\nPositions- fucking loaded to the tits on VIX calls and too many fucking puts to count right now\n\nFirst and foremost. Not financial advice so if you go all in on this shit and lose your fucking money. dont blame me. we'll lose money together <3\n\nI'm sure 90% of you retards tossed money into calls today and guess what, you'll be very lucky if u make money tomorrow!! good job! now stop buying fucking calls you idiots.\n\n[GEX plummeted today](https://preview.redd.it/gcaef0dofd451.png?width=1907&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba31f2df9740fed083c885d18661c9266147c2d7)\n\nGEX and DIX is far above most of you retards to understand so i'll say this - Remember GEX is hedging OBLIGATIONS and acts as a brake on the DIX price. Why would MM\u2019s have drastically lower hedging obligations while DIX is still high? **Because the only volume left on the Dark Pools is retail by proxy of Market makers. Don't buy fucking calls**\n\nHere's a post i made on TV for the VIX on 6/6:\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VIX/BB2TACqA-VIX-pop-coming-soon/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VIX/BB2TACqA-VIX-pop-coming-soon/)\n\n[posted on 6\\/6 \\\\\"TA DOESNT WORK ON VIX HURRRRR DUH DURRRRRR\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/tmb094xogd451.png?width=1469&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ddf904597d7fc7ce2e627baf3facdd2cb881561)\n\n[after my fucking call - funny how it stayed within the magical fucking wedge huh? ](https://preview.redd.it/0tuszh3tgd451.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd9efa232f407c0ead73d304bdf3303f24653590)\n\nyea thats fucking right. called this shit and got [paid handsomely](https://imgur.com/a/rw22OMk) for it today. shoutout to u/dlkdev seems to be one of the few smart people on this fucking sub. Is it gonna stop today? Fuck no! on this drop, VIX of 60+ atleast and thatll line up with my initial targets below on SPX of \\~2800..... from there market is gonna make a decision and its gonna be fucking violent and whoever is on the wrong side of it is gonna get destroyed:\n\n[SPX](https://preview.redd.it/fq7xpxh2id451.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=1afdd613a5b305d4181cc181a28ba9b83ce805f6)\n\nPlotted out the key levels for you retards so you don't have to do any fucking work and you can trade off these. If that MACD crosses over sheeeeeeeesh watch the fuck out\n\nI'm expecting a drop in the next 1-2 weeks down to 2800 which will be decision time. Do we rally to 3200 again or do we tank to 2200. No fucking in between. It's going to be a violent fucking move either way. this shit aint gonna trade sideways, its gonna happen quick and u need to be prepped for this shit. VIX 60 in next two weeks, if market decides to go to 2200 then fucking vix 90+ prep your buttholes if this happens\n\nTomorrow will likely be green at open based on futurez right now  this isnt gonna be a fucking rally back to 3220, so just dont be a fuckin retard and buy calls. When bears get juiced up, they're relentless\n\nTake a look at the volume today, very telling of whats to come. Especially VX volume, was around 150k today if i remember correctly.\n\njust be smart retards - as much as i looooove seeing ur loss porn nows not the time to be a degenerate fucktard. If we are green in the morning, load up on fucking puts at open and keep fucking buying them, bloody monday inbound and may god have mercy on your souls if you hold calls over the weekend you beautiful retards\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit bottom comment i said 309 for top today, funny how that fuckin works eh. load up on puts ya fucks!!!\n\ni hope u didnt buy calls today retards! <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSunday nite update - reallllly hope u guyz bought puts friday at open like i said to\n\n[es futures update](https://preview.redd.it/tnwuyln1gz451.png?width=1203&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d1791e54bd31489a91f35cd3c2949e77eca8f65)\n\nMACD crossover = bearish.

This allows you to see what the \u201cmarket makers\u201d are doing. That isn\u2019t TA. That\u2019s really fucking valuable imo. You can literally see in the recent rally where the DIX dropped but SPY kept going up. That\u2019s when market makers sold and let retail hold the bag right before this drop.

Meaning, are dark pools buying more puts or calls? As GEX goes down it means there\u2019s less hedging which means the current price action will have less resistance. So if we are crashing now and GEX is low then it means market makers aren\u2019t buying calls rn. They are letting it crash.
