{"title": "[$NKLA], [06/22/20], \"Nikola is not the answer.\"", "selftext": "After Nikola went public earlier this month through a reverse merger with VectorIQ, the stock has skyrocketed, and Nikola is now worth $23.78 billion. With Nikola trading only $1 billion away from the current value of Ford and not expecting revenue until at least late 2021, I feel everyone can agree this company is overvalued.\n\nOne reason the stock has exploded in value is due to the potential \"$10 billion in sales\" coming from \"14,000 reservations.\" Nikola is not expecting the production of its trucks to begin until at least late 2021. This delay would be followed by full production capability being met sometime in the second half of 2022. Currently, there are only 39 hydrogen filling stations in the U.S. (35 in California). This number is tiny in comparison to the approximately 25,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. as of March 2020. It would be a considerable feat if Nikola were able to finish developing their truck, construct a manufacturing facility, and construct the hydrogen infrastructure around the country necessary for a fleet of hydrogen vehicles to operate all in just two years.\n\nHydrogen vehicles are also inherently less efficient than electric vehicles. A hydrogen vehicle requires that 1) electricity be used to produce and compress hydrogen (Nikola claims all its hydrogen stations will use this method with renewable energy), and 2) that stored hydrogen be used in a hydrogen vehicle to create electricity. So basically, electricity is used to make hydrogen, and that hydrogen is then used to produce electricity again. Fully electric cars do not have to convert electricity and are therefore more efficient. Currently, converting water to hydrogen is approximately 75% efficient and requires a massive amount of electricity. Nikola claims that they will use renewable energy to produce all the hydrogen at its stations, which will undoubtedly increase costs further.\n\nThe increased costs associated with hydrogen are why both Honda and Toyota have virtually abandoned their fuel cell vehicle development. In fact, Honda's fuel cell-powered Clarity had such low sales that Honda developed it to be a fully electric vehicle that runs on batteries.\n\nHydrogen is not the way to a more renewable future and is almost always going to be a more expensive and less efficient option when compared to electricity. While I am not arguing that Tesla specifically will be the winner, I do think it will be an electric semi-truck from some manufacturer. Volkswagen, Mercedes, Porsche, and many other vehicle manufacturers are investing heavily in electric vehicles because they know it is the best route to take.\n\nHydrogen vehicles are not the future.\n\nI am short NKLA.", "id": "hdm5hk", "created_utc": 1592804059.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m starting a Dyson Sphere company where we directly harness solar power from the sun as we move towards being a type 1 civilization. \n\nI\u2019ll be raising $500B in capital.
