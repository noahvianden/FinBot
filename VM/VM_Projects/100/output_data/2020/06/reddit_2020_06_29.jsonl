{"title": "JPow is gonna steal your tendies yet again", "selftext": "The Fed is in an inescapable dilemma. One of two outcomes is going to happen imminently.\n\n1) The Fed allows nominal yields to keep rising. This would crash equities and real estate by 90%--it would be worse than the Great Depression. When nominal yields got to only 3% in 2018, the stock market plummeted from 26,500 to 22,500. This was averted only by restarting Q. E. Nowadays, even 1% yields crash the market. We nearly got to 1% yields on Friday--0.90%. Yields could spike any day now. This is why Warren Buffet is staying out of the stock market and hoarding silver.\n\n[look at this graph, mofo!](https://www.reddit.com/user/JPowBrrrr/comments/hi7fgi/jpow_will_to_steal_your_tendies/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n2) The Fed puts a formal cap on yields, also known as YCC. This would be an admission that 5 trillion in Q. E. hasn't been enough to suppress yields, and that at least 20 trillion more is coming. This means hyperinflation, a crash in the bond market, and monetizing the debt. Stocks would soar in nominal terms, but crash against the price of gold, because hyperinflation would make the gains worthless, as they were in the Zimbabwe or Venezuelan stock-markets.\n\nIn other words, the stock market must crash soon. The only question is whether it will happen in nominal terms or real terms.\n\nI think we all know that the Fed will choose to crash it in real terms, because that is the only politically expedient option. The average Robinhood trader will be marvelling at his 500% gains, and the \"best\" stock market in human history, even though the U. S. dollar is on its way to being carried about in wheelbarrows.\n\nWhichever choice the Fed is going to make, the only way to profit from this crisis and protect yourself is to buy gold, gold miners, silver, and silver miners.\n\nTLDR: Long SLVR, RING, SGDM (and GDX if you're feelin' frisky)", "id": "hi7ly1", "created_utc": 1593461286.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "Every time Powell has started talking publicly, he always opens his statement with his opinion that the job of the Fed is to ensure consistent and stable prices for products for the American people.\n\nIf he is to be believed, then that means he would be more willing to crash the stock market than risk hyperinflation.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "If stocks crash it doesnt matter, except to asshole boomers.

If its customers are insolvent, FB immediately starts burning money because nobody buys advertising during a recession/depression.\n\nApple: Apple is a consumer marketing company. It has no penetration whatsoever into the enterprise, and its products are extremely expensive. Prolonged unemployment or a reduction in consumer confidence puts a serious strain on their business. Fortunately, they are sitting on a massive cash pile, but they are levered.\n\nAmazon: The primary driver of Amazon margins is Amazon Web Services. The retail line of business is not exceptionally profitable. As with Facebook, if Amazon's downstream customer's go bankrupt, things get ugly in a hurry.\n\nNetflix: Netflix is $20 billion in debt, and with new content production at a standstill for the foreseeable future, and competing streaming services threatening to take content off of the platform, this could be trouble. When it comes to recurring expenses in a personal budget, if Netflix needs to go, it will. Netflix is a great service, but it is a vitamin, not a painkiller.\n\nGoogle: Google is probably the only one of FAANG that is actually insulated. Google's advertising platform captures buying intent. That does not exist on Facebook. This is why FB only offers CPM advertising products.
