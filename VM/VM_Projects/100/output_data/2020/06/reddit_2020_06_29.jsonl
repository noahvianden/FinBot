{"title": "JPow is gonna steal your tendies yet again", "selftext": "The Fed is in an inescapable dilemma. One of two outcomes is going to happen imminently.\n\n1) The Fed allows nominal yields to keep rising. This would crash equities and real estate by 90%--it would be worse than the Great Depression. When nominal yields got to only 3% in 2018, the stock market plummeted from 26,500 to 22,500. This was averted only by restarting Q. E. Nowadays, even 1% yields crash the market. We nearly got to 1% yields on Friday--0.90%. Yields could spike any day now. This is why Warren Buffet is staying out of the stock market and hoarding silver.\n\n[look at this graph, mofo!](https://www.reddit.com/user/JPowBrrrr/comments/hi7fgi/jpow_will_to_steal_your_tendies/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n2) The Fed puts a formal cap on yields, also known as YCC. This would be an admission that 5 trillion in Q. E. hasn't been enough to suppress yields, and that at least 20 trillion more is coming. This means hyperinflation, a crash in the bond market, and monetizing the debt. Stocks would soar in nominal terms, but crash against the price of gold, because hyperinflation would make the gains worthless, as they were in the Zimbabwe or Venezuelan stock-markets.\n\nIn other words, the stock market must crash soon. The only question is whether it will happen in nominal terms or real terms.\n\nI think we all know that the Fed will choose to crash it in real terms, because that is the only politically expedient option. The average Robinhood trader will be marvelling at his 500% gains, and the \"best\" stock market in human history, even though the U. S. dollar is on its way to being carried about in wheelbarrows.\n\nWhichever choice the Fed is going to make, the only way to profit from this crisis and protect yourself is to buy gold, gold miners, silver, and silver miners.\n\nTLDR: Long SLVR, RING, SGDM (and GDX if you're feelin' frisky)", "id": "hi7ly1", "created_utc": 1593461286.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "Every time Powell has started talking publicly, he always opens his statement with his opinion that the job of the Fed is to ensure consistent and stable prices for products for the American people.\n\nIf he is to be believed, then that means he would be more willing to crash the stock market than risk hyperinflation.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "If stocks crash it doesnt matter, except to asshole boomers.

If its customers are insolvent, FB immediately starts burning money because nobody buys advertising during a recession/depression.\n\nApple: Apple is a consumer marketing company. It has no penetration whatsoever into the enterprise, and its products are extremely expensive. Prolonged unemployment or a reduction in consumer confidence puts a serious strain on their business. Fortunately, they are sitting on a massive cash pile, but they are levered.\n\nAmazon: The primary driver of Amazon margins is Amazon Web Services. The retail line of business is not exceptionally profitable. As with Facebook, if Amazon's downstream customer's go bankrupt, things get ugly in a hurry.\n\nNetflix: Netflix is $20 billion in debt, and with new content production at a standstill for the foreseeable future, and competing streaming services threatening to take content off of the platform, this could be trouble. When it comes to recurring expenses in a personal budget, if Netflix needs to go, it will. Netflix is a great service, but it is a vitamin, not a painkiller.\n\nGoogle: Google is probably the only one of FAANG that is actually insulated. Google's advertising platform captures buying intent. That does not exist on Facebook. This is why FB only offers CPM advertising products.

So yes, they do profit before the government does. They also maintain a nice cushy surplus account with their profit. \n\nBut where do all these \"profits\" come from?

It's easy to \"profit\" when you digitally make money to buy assets that then produce more money.

And they sometimes do I'm sure. And technically, as it may have come from printed money, eating that loss would essentially be a net of zero for the Fed (it's actually a loss according to their balance sheet), deflation in the economy, and a bankrupt company somewhere that couldn't pay its bond. With the treasury backing these bonds, it results in the fed getting reimbursed so an actual net of zero on their balance sheet, taxpayer dollars lost, and a company going bankrupt. So rather then take a loss, these higher risk bonds are being backed by the treasury so the Fed can profit or net zero in a worst-case. Even if they were to somehow lose money in a fiscal year, their surplus account will still payout their dividend. They are protected ('they' being bankers) while everyone else takes the fall, all because they have a huge amount of leverage.\n\nThe 12 regional banks are all similar in that their additional profits go to the government, but I don't know the rules and specifics of what gets cut out before this happens. Additionally, these banks also have their own stock in themselves they sell and pay dividends on, so everyone is taking their piece of the pie before the government is entitled to.

This has been really helpful honestly.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Anytime something defaults (bankruptcy, debt collection, loss of assets) money essentially \"vanishes\" from circulation. Money is constantly vanishing from the market through things like depreciation, outside economies, consumerism, and defaults. If I lend you 5 dollars that you default on, I can try and recoup it through taking your assets, but I'll likely get back much less than 5 dollars, so there's a net deflation in the economy (dollars lost that can never be spent again). If the fed buys a bond that gets defaulted on, then they've lost dollars that can never be spent again. It's a trivial amount of deflation in the scheme of things, but it's there nonetheless. The Fed, of course, prints money which can create inflation, but the 2 aren't necessarily linked, and it's more complex than saying a print dollar plus a default dollar = no net inflation/deflation. In any case, a default dollar would normally add to deflation, particularly at the level of money being printed. But if the government comes in and reimburses a default dollar, it's now once again a net gain of money in the economy, with the treasury having to ultimately utilize more deficit and issue more of their own bonds.\n\nIn summary: I print 5 dollars and lend them to you, you use them on something intangible I can't recoup 5 dollars on when you default, so I'm down 5 dollars. Keep in mind I have to annually print 5 dollars just to keep enough money in circulation (because money is constantly vanishing), so let's say if you hadn't defaulted, my 5 printed dollars would only have been enough to sustain 1-2% inflation. Now we have deflation because of the 5 vanished dollars, until the fed comes in and reimburses me, and then goes and sells another 5 dollar bond to cover their budget deficit, putting us back at 1-2% inflation.\n\nBig caveat: things are infinitely more complicated than this, and there's tons of ways this example breaks down in real life, or simply doesn't factor in to the economy anywhere near a significant amount. Economists theorize about these things on the reg, and  I advise you to always be open minded to other opinions and theories.
