All the major casinos, privately or publicly owned, are working together on keeping the city open, though, so I do have anecdotal evidence about how hard the city has been hit and while continue to be hit. \n\nNow, with that being said, I\u2019d say that MGM and Stations casinos are the most fucked. I don\u2019t know if Stations is public or not, but I do know that of MGM, Boyd, and Stations, all three companies have had to keep several locations closed despite being allowed to reopen simply because there isn\u2019t enough business to justify full reopening. \n\nThat\u2019s fucking insane to me. Casinos closing because they were mandated is crazy and it\u2019s one thing, but locations remaining closed because there isn\u2019t enough money to go around is another thing entirely and it\u2019s wild. \n\nFurthermore, while the Governor has been ramping up his rhetoric about how hard the state is being hit, the casinos ultimately answer to the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the NGCB has been steadily ramping up guidance to make restrictions more and more arduous for customers to maintain and for casinos to enforce. I\u2019m hearing that their next target will be customers who keep lifting up mandated face masks for the sake of smoking or drinking while gaming, which is a pretty big \u201cattack\u201d on the culture and feel of the timeless gaming that our customers get lost in for hours on end. \n\nAs far as alternative income methods, there aren\u2019t any that can completely replace what they\u2019re losing because of the pandemic.

{"title": "\"Livongo is the Amazon of Healthcare\" DD", "selftext": "Hello Autists,\n\nI bring to you a sleeper play that has been flying under the radar lately going from a stock in the $20s to a high of $79 last week. Everyone is talking about tech stocks like FSLY, DDOG, DOCU, or OKTA but I don't see enough posts about LVGO.  Why is Livongo set to rally for what I believe deserves to be a triple digit stock by the end of next year?\n\nWarning: An extensive read but well worth it.\n\n================================================\n\nu/ceud DD 5 months ago:\n\n**Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)**)**\n\n* A consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.\n* The platform analyzes data to build a picture of a person\u2019s patterns, while dietitians and physiologists give them real-time advice about diet, medication and exercise by apps or text message. If a patient\u2019s blood sugar is dangerously low or high, a coach will call to warn them within 60 seconds. Inspired by how big tech companies personalize services and nudge people into certain behaviors, Livongo \u2014 short for living-on-the-go \u2014 started by treating diabetes, before moving on to hypertension, weight loss and mental health.\n* It also just signed its [largest contract ever](https://www.businessinsider.com/livongo-lands-biggest-contract-yet-2019-10) for the US government, allowing it to provide its diabetes solution to 5.3M employees as part of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Platform starting in 2020. Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families \u2014 and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021. That's a significant lift given that Livongo brought in a total of\u00a0[$68 million](https://e.businessinsider.com/click/18262001.4/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE2MzkyMjUvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTE5MTg1MTU5L2Q3MzEyNDlkczEuaHRt/5d233c18f730436f2414784fB050eba75)\u00a0in revenue in 2018, it reported in its S-1 filing.\n* LVGO's clients include 20% of the Fortune 500 (Target, Pepsi, Microsoft, Merck, and Citigroup) and boast a high retention rate of \\~96%. They reported a 121% YoY growth in Q3 2019 and continue to grow exponentially.\n\nHere are excerpts I've taken from a recent video by Unrivaled Investing I found regarding LVGO:\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrYSCvjXICU&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrYSCvjXICU&feature=youtu.be)\n\n**What are they trying to solve?**\n\nOur Health care system currently is only designed for acute and emergent care and is not equipped to provide daily continuous feedback and guidance for patients. This leaves people with ineffective and non adherent care leading to less healthy outcomes that leads to more expenses for both the patient and insurance companies.\n\n**Adressable population:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvimdd80bq751.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=c99cf022695fc0ad2fc08adcb6f50c6a07976854\n\n================================================\n\n**People use Livongo because:**\n\n1. Livongo makes it easier for patients to monitor their members to manage their health and their supply logistics.\n2. They provide critical health \"nudges\" that are guardrails to prevent members from getting ill.\n3. Theres a community of health members available 24/7 to assist patients\n\n\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care\"\n\nA health nudge or a phone call can help a member who is diabetic who is trending towards hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia to avoid an expensive visit to the ER.\n\n**What Livongo offers employers:**\n\n1. Healthier and happier employees\n2. Lower health care costs for employees (over $1.9k in savings - 3x ROI in 3 Years)\n3. Healthier and happier employee means less sick time and Lower employee churn\n\n\\*This situation is a win-win-win for all sides = employers save money = employees save money and are healthier = Livongo grows In sales = company value increases and expands = happy stock holders\n\n\\*Client retention rate of 95%\n\n\\*Revenue growth of >110% in the past year\n\n\\*member growth rate increasing by the thousands in the past two years with last quarter being 100%\n\n**Expanding the moat:**  (all resources in one company for different health issues)\n\n1. Differentiated competitive offering\n2. One trusted counter party\n3. Cross selling = an even BIGGER addressable market the just diabetes and hypertension\n\nWhy this company is HOT:\n\n1. Offering a whole person perspective is a smart strategy\n2. They're building a proprietary health database with valuable insights that make it harder for new players to enter\n3. Livongo is building a strong value proposition and likely has years of strong revenue growth ahead of them\n\n================================================\n\nA Redditor's (u/friendless2) experience with LVGO I found 3 years ago from r/diabetes:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience\\_with\\_livongo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/5fxhzu/experience_with_livongo/)\n\nMy job has offered to pay for the monthly fee. Since it comes with **unlimited strips and lancets, it is saving me some of the costs of running a meter, and I can check anytime I feel like it instead of trying to limit myself to 5-6 times a day....**\n\nThe nice part about the Livongo, is **I don't waste strips when my backpack gets squished and the Accu-Check spits out a strip without my knowing..**.\n\nThere are limits that you can set, where if you are **below that limit then a nurse coach texts you on your registered phone.** They are nice, and are **willing to answer questions on diabetes (17 years experience answered them by now) or on the meter or web site (computer guy here, I can figure it out). I happen to have hit 38 twice this week, and both times I got pinged immediately. When I was at 48 the meter asked me if I want a coach to contact me. I said no....**\n\n**The website is where you can get graphs and reports. The meter has the same data, but not the averages. You can export the data or print it for your Endo appointments.** You can also **email reports directly to them. You can also have others notified if you are low or high via SMS**.\n\nIt is saving me **$1300 a year** so I am keeping it.\"\n\n================================================\n\n**Catalyst to buy now**:\n\n[https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CMS: Upcoming Medicare payment rule to include permanent telehealth expansions**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Patients initially used virtual care as a necessity during the pandemic but are now demanding it for convenience.**\n\n**\"The patient trust barrier has been broken. There is no going back,\" said Brady, who serves as chief of staff to the deputy secretary and senior adviser to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \"Telehealth is now the preferred method. People want this as the first site of care. We are seeing a demand from consumers.\"**\n\n**The surge in telehealth coincides with HHS' data-sharing regulations published in February that will give patients easier access to their medical records.**\n\n**\"It will be interesting to see how all this overlaps with interoperability,\" Brady said. \"When patients have access to data and you give them remote virtual care we will see how that combination will help people make better decisions to live healthier lives.\"**\n\n\\----------------\n\n[https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/](https://www.staffing.com/what-role-will-telemedicine-play-in-health-care-after-covid-19/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What Role Will Telemedicine Play in Health Care After COVID-19?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dr. Jonathan Wright**\n\n\"I think the vast majority of patients that we have worked with greatly appreciate it and prefer it. For a lot of people, especially if you're working, I take care of a lot of older patients that are retired, but for a working patient, you can just carve out 15 minutes to hop on your computer and do your visit. You don't have to drive into the doctor's office, you don't have to pay for parking and then wait in line to get in, or wait in the exam room. Then the doctor's running late and all those kinds of things. It's just, \"Hey, I just do my quick appointment and get it done and move on.\"\n\nThe other thing that has been wonderful is that, you know obviously, you can have more than one person on a telemedicine call, on a Zoom call, or a Team's call. So the patients' families, no matter where they are in the country, can join on the call as well. For someone that does cancer, and we're talking about different treatment options, it\u2019s so fantastic to be able to see the patient and then their three children in different spots on the call to participate. Then, we don't have the \u201clost in translation\u201d when the patient passes it on to their family, and everyone can as a group be more on board and help that person with the decision process.\n\n================================================\n\n**Excerpts from Livongo Health Inc (LVGO) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript:** [**https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth**](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-upcoming-medicare-payment-rule-to-include-proposals-to-expand-telehealth)\n\n**\"** We entered 2020 with significant momentum...we believe remote monitoring is **rapidly becoming the new standard in health and care.** Livongo's connected technology allows our members to track vital signs of interest in maintaining health. We expect that the **ability for both personalized care, as well as broad population surveillance will become critical going forward as an early warning and monitoring system for the healthcare system at large and a way to efficiently deliver care to those who need it most exactly when and where they need it**.\"\n\n\"this pandemic has **accelerated a more extensive virtual care delivery model**. Remote monitoring is here to stay, and we expect it to become the standard of care for the most vulnerable and expensive populations...Livongo is **key to keeping their people healthy, while also saving money. And Livongo is unique in that we have detailed studies to prove that Livongo improves care, saves money, and provides a great member experience**.\"\n\n\"Livongo has a **significant opportunity to continue growing our member base**. Because of our virtuous business model, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has **only reinforced the value of the service we provide our members and clients.** In the first quarter, we added a record 380 new clients, which takes us to 1,252 overall clients, which is up **approximately 44% quarter over quarter.** Member enrollment was ahead of expectations with over 328,000 Livongo for Diabetes members as of the end of the quarter.\"\n\n\"More importantly, we're being asked to **accelerate launches to deliver services to clients who wanted their most vulnerable populations protected sooner and taken steps to position Livongo well pass COVID-19**...This trend was already under way before COVID-19, but the **pandemic accelerates it. We expect that larger, multiproduct, well-capitalized organizations will have an increased advantage**. In March, we announced the Health Transformation Alliance, or HTA, and Welltok.\"\n\n\"Today, **Livongo is even more strongly positioned.** Increasingly, everyone is realizing that our remote monitoring solutions and our focus on the most critical, vulnerable populations are necessary to **support our members through this pandemic in the near term and longer term as the market continues to shift to a virtual care model.\"**\n\n================================================\n\nPrice target raised from $52 to $85\n\n[https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5818984/livongo-health-nasdaqlvgo-pt-raised-to-85-00-at-keycorp.html](https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5818984/livongo-health-nasdaqlvgo-pt-raised-to-85-00-at-keycorp.html)\n\n================================================\n\nMy opinion:\n\nI'm in the medical field and my family line currently has 15 doctors. From my perspective, our society is transitioning everything into the digital realm including medicine. Medicine is expanding to place more emphasis on home health, individualized medicine, and preventative care. The most important aspect of medicine is prevention. This is really great for Livongo since their target population comprises the vast majority of Americans and they're expanding internationally as well. In addition, they will be able to save insurance companies thousands of dollars in medical bills. The fact that we're incorporating Cloud + Medicine is just really hard to deny that this is the stepping stone for the future our health care in general. Teladoc utilizes the concept of remote care as well and their growth has been exponential besides the fact that they're not profitable yet just like Livongo. (Livongo said they will begin to be highly profitable by 2021). My family members use Telahealth every day and it is incredible how we're able to provide our medical expertise remotely. This makes it convenient for both healthcare providers and patients. I am slowing adding on to my position, right now I only currently own calls. The current stock price is $74 and I recommend looking deep into this company if it interests you as it did for me. I only see this company growing exponentially with their stock reaching triple digits by the end of next year.\n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE:\n\nTo put into perspective of where they stand right now, they currently have 328,000 members (increased new member count by 100% in last quarter as mentioned earlier). The total amount of people with diabetes in the US is 35 million people with +500k new cases per year. They only tapped into 1% of people so FAR. They also have the addressable market of people with hypertension (108 million) and behavior health (46.6 million). So yes, **growth is only going to be exponential f**rom here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: **Livongo Health (**[$LVGO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=lvgo&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)**)**  A consumer digital health company with a vision to empower people with chronic conditions to live better through the combined power of technology, real-time personalized information, and support from their chosen care team.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position currently: 12 $85 C 8/21", "id": "hhp7ou", "created_utc": 1593388286.0, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "I kept scrolling to get to the comments but it never ended.", "score": 250, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR it\u2019s a novel about why you should totally buy the top of a 300% pump", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "Top comment", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25077155232429504}, {"body": "Yup, it's right up there with DDOG and OKTA, great companies that lose money and trade at 30x+ sales.
