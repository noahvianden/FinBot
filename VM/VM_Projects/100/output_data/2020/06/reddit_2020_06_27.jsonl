{"title": "Don't get shaken out", "selftext": "I'm fucking jacked to the tits in JPM calls (cut a lot of the position at a slight profit and got into energy and SPY 210 calls expiring in a month (some later). I have some concern about the timing of the bank bounce back. Might need LEAPS here. What you guys fail to realize is a lot of this is generated panic is to get the big boys back in the game. Now we care about Corona again? We get tired of BLM? What is on the table in 2 weeks. We are way overdue for vaccine or stimulus pumps. The stress tests went decent and with Volcker out the banks will be able to put up even more treasury collateral (and even significantly worse actually toxic collateral like worthless CLOs and FREQUENT FLYER MILES LOL) up for overnight and especially import term repo where they can swing their dicks, manipulate equities and kill it on derivatives like options and swaps. They are scaring retail into selling them their stocks right now.\n\nThe only real existential risk to banks is negative rates (not defaults) because a majority of their money comes from the interest on their excess reserves sitting in fed accounts (which is already down to .1% from 2% -which was 60% of their revenue at the beginning of the year- and therefore has bank stocks 50% off). Federal funds rate is supposed to be pinned at .1-.25$ for years with negative real yields on long term treasuries for years as well. This is why I ditched money market & high yield savings and went deep in Vanguard VCSH 1-3 year corporate bond etf. If there was risk of S&P 500 companies defaulting these things would not be flying right now trading way above NAV. Not a ton of duration risk either so you wont get wrecked if the FED decide to raise rates a few basis points (unlike holding TLT - if u have TLT when rates go up you are fucked) Apparently the FED is offering no real insolvency risk to US companies (unless you are hertz - which is a joke but if your debt was IG grade to Covid-19 the FED truly does have you covered with a blank check), and VCSH beats inflation so why not? Some shitty BA loans in there but that is they only real timebomb. I even caught a solid .5-1% pump on the shares the other day way Jay said hed buy individual corporates. If we go much further the traditional banking model becomes truly unprofitable (especially with the constant accumulation of leveraged existential risk which makes is unprofitable to make loans).\n\nWe end up with European zombie state run banks since they know longer have any real mechanisms to make money to a degree that outweighs operating costs. If the USA is forced into this route then the world economy is basically fucked anyways in any sense of it's traditional \"free trade / free enterprise\" existence - charade as it is or not.\n\nI think the Fed and the Treasury prevent all of this while they can due to USD strenth. They will continue to backstop everything and provide liquidity/guarantees to banks at very favorable rates in exchange for them acting as a financial conduit from the monetary side to the fiscal side.\n\nAs far as Corona, the only place that really matters is NY: and corona is fucking done there. What this means is that while we are seeing a peak play out in the later hit areas (and they earlier locked down areas like CA). We are near the peak. \n\nI live in the Bay, there was actual traffic yesterday. People are out and just wearing masks. Sure small business is fucked but the S&P 500 and especially the core of it are NOT small businesses (although many are somewhat reliant on them so we may see some fundamental price regression if regular market forces seem to matter again - which i suspect as some point they will, but not yet and they wont cause circuit breakers.\n\nDon't get shaken out. Maybe hold a few late dated tail hedges for the elections when the Vix dips a bit (hopefully we get a chance under 25 again but i doubt it). This is mostly about just selling you guys overpriced options and letting banks/funds stack some ammo at still reasonably reduced prices. Plus the absurd retail pumps might be over so we are looking for equilibrium prices and i'm not sure exacly where those are. However they should be pretty high given the returns on bonds and the amount of liquidity in the asset sphere.\n\nWe don't visit anywhere near the March lows without extraordinary news. \n\nI personally think we flash dip over 300 and start to recover Monday. Watch how the news media trys to influence things to get an idea. \n\nRemember. The treasury is still selling trillions in treasuries to primary dealers forcing cash to the banks and foreign nationals. All these treasuries are then uses for repo to generate more cash. If this devalues the dollar eventually stocks go up AND your TIPS hedges (or I-Bond) hedges go up. This also maintains the historically low yields which prop up asset prices and since the have guaranteed solvency for most s&p500 companies, where is the risk? how does it tank? \n\nCPI deflation doesn't really matter; Asset inflation is largely uncorrelated and going to continue to happen.", "id": "hh1j7k", "created_utc": 1593292048.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 236, "replies": [{"body": "just a reminder: JPM supported wirecard by approving a prospectus for them.", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": ["jpm"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "JPow has a retirement portfolio too and he's worth like $50m.

The fact that the market is pricing in a vaccine at the end of 2020/2021 or the fact that a new virus exists with the only known treatments being give steroids to reduce mortality rates and lay the patient on their stomachs so they don't drown in their own fluids?\n\n\nMy perspective is that the risk/reward ratio is currently under pricing the possible downside whereas the upside will be very clear very quickly.

In fact they're so similar that some even more distantly related coronaviruses can cause cross-reactivity in protein-based CV19 tests.\n\nIn particular, we know about the mutation rate from these viruses, and SARS-2 can be determined at this point just by sequencing the hundreds of thousands of samples that have been collected.\n\nMoreover, if you compare two fundamentally very different groups of viruses like the influenza virus and coronavirus, it's easy to draw up differences. For one thing, SARS-like coronavirus genomes are >2x as large as the flu genome. This requires them to have a lower per-site mutation rate, because the cumulative per-genome lethal mutation rate scales positively with genome size. The more opportunities for things to go wrong, the more QC you need to have. \n\nSARS-like CVs achieve this in part via error correction machinery influenza doesn't have, and in part via a higher-fidelity RdRP.\n\nAnd finally we know SARS-COV-2 isn't segmented and this is a major major difference between them that isn't going to change because it would require many many many many changes to every part of the virus's biology and structure.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "You obviously know a lot more about this than I do.

The problem is that right now forward earnings for the entire S&P is so unknown, that analyst estimates are a random stab in the dark. Nike has been one of the first major reporters to show that 2020 forward estimates for all companies are probably too rosy right now. Combine that with the fact as we already trading at above average forward PE multiple on the S&P and this gets real scary, real fast. Because while maybe institutional investors say: the S&P trading at 25x 2020 earnings is probably aggressive and not long-term maintainable, we have lot of support from the Fed. But if analyst expectations for the S&P earnings per share is on avg. 30% too high, then instead of trading at 25x forward price-to-earnings, we may be closer to 40x forward earning - if money managers start to believe this is the case, I think they will start selling their gains at where we are (basically back even with the beginning of 2020). \n\nRemember, analysts on avg expected Nike to report 7 cents positive earnings per share, but they reported a lost of 51 cents per share (!).

{"title": "Tech is Not a Overvalued", "selftext": "I see a ton of you guys posting about waiting for the tech bubble to pop and I want to help you guys stop losing money by clearing up some common misconceptions I see in the daily threads. Here goes:\n\n**1) Tech is not a single industry, it is the combination of multiple different industries in various stages of their life-cycles**, all of which's business model are impacted differently by Covid 19. Yes, there are consumer products, social media, online retail and advertising, but there is also security, infrastructure, enterprise management software, database management, content delivery networks, gaming, financial services, communications, etc. All of these have different revenue models, customer types and growth trajectories independent of each other. By labeling them all tech and not understanding why they may or may not be thriving, you're going to miss out on big runs or talk yourself into costly contrarian puts during runs.\n\nWith the understanding that tech is not a monolith, but many industries, think about how covid actually impacts these individual industries. In many cases, covid has accelerated digital transformation and sped up adoption of these companies. Web services are more important than before (MSFT, AMZN), security is critical (CRWD, OKTA, ZS), more people are viewing content from the internet (NET, FSLY, AKAM) and main street retail is closed (SHOP, AMZN, ETSY), etc. etc. ***Most of these companies are non-discretionary or infrastructure spend*** \\- nobody is cancelling an important enterprise management system (VEEV, EVBG, CRM, NOW) because of covid - they'll fire headcount first. \n\n**2) If your analysis is that the company is not profitable and so its overvalued, you're doing it wrong.** *Know the difference between Gross Margins and Operating Profit.* If the company's core business is very profitable and they're spending a fuckload on product development, hiring sales and building corporate infrastructure, it doesn't matter if their operating profit is negative if their sales are growing 35%. The revenues will catch up. Quickly.\n\n**3) The Subscription Based Revenue Model (SaaS) is the greatest things to happen to these companies and investors in 20 years.** Having smooth, recurring, reliable revenue streams, impacted only by churn and growth allows helps eliminate big negative surprises during earnings and compounds growth quickly for the businesses. \n\nTake MSFT for example - for us boomers (I'm 40), they used to release a new Windows updates every 2-3 years and inevitably you'd have to purchase it, adapt to it, and sometimes you'd skip an update. Their earnings were based on how popular the updates were and how much people bought them. In 2015, they switched from that model to SaaS (software as a service). Now, I pay an annual subscription to MSFT for their applications. I never think about it - its just subtracted from my account - and will pay it as long as I have a computer. They dont have to worry about coming up with big new updates.\n\nCompare this to some other industries. Life Sciences - you invest millions in research and the drug has to show efficacy and get approved by FDA, which is major boom or bust. Automotive - design a great car and hope you find a market for it, but then your sales are massively impacted macro trends. Nobody is fucking cancelling MSFT subscriptions during a recession.\n\n**4) Tech's operating model makes its potential for exponential growth unmatched.** For a company like Fastly or Okta, think about what you would actually have to do to provide the infrastructure for 40% annual growth - you spend on product development, hiring customer success/support and sales people. You beef up HR, operating systems and infrastructure. *But your biggest expense by far is hiring people, who can work from home and be quickly removed.* \n\nCompare that to some other industries. For a car company to grow 40%, beyond the people cost, they need massive capex investments to improve their production infrastructure and they'll have to be sure their supply chain of small manufacturers can keep up, not to mention the impact of fluctuations in raw material costs (read, tarriffs), marketing and inventory storage. Thats a lot of moving parts. These implications apply to most manufacturing industries. For a life sciences company to grow 40%, they have to discover a massive blockbuster medicine, because users of current non-generic medications don't spike 40% a year. Put simply, it is much easier/cheaper/faster to just hire people and acquire technology than having to have physical infrastructure, supply chains, warehousing etc. This makes techs growth potential vastly superior than other industries.\n\n**5) Finally, and most importantly, this is not 2001. I will repeat this for the real boomers here who were burned before, this is not 2001.** In 2001 the companies did not have real growth, revenue, consumer adoption. Today they do. Take a look at Redpoints look at 2020 Q1 earnings for public SaaS companies ( [https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/a-look-back-at-q1-public-saas-earnings-e392a7f6f4f8](https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/a-look-back-at-q1-public-saas-earnings-e392a7f6f4f8) ). The median company of the 54 public companies followed had 31% YoY growth, 74% gross margin and 117% customer retention. Thats insane.\n\nTLDR; tech is not overvalued - these cloud companies are growing exponentially and in many cases, their business models and adoption/use of their services are enhanced by Covid. \n\nPOSITIONS - FSLY 50C, 60C 9/18, SPOT 230C 7/17, DDOG 90C 8/21, NET 36C 8/21, SE 106C 7/17, ENPH 50C 8/2, TWLO 210C 8/21\n\nMy qualifications - I spent many years as strategic consultant with a fancy mba that focused on business growth and have worked in literally every industry", "id": "hgypxy", "created_utc": 1593282594.0, "score": 300, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 350, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|30|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Shit is not gonna pop.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2081446349620819}, {"body": "DD straight from 99", "score": 188, "replies": [{"body": "Vintage", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21895314753055573}, {"body": "As if PE ever mattered !!! \n/s", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05921149626374245}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10534779727458954}, {"body": "you talk about why these businesses are strong and will grow well - i totally agree. these are great companies.\n\nthat said, they can still be close to value or slightly overvalued now.\n\nthere's still a difference between valuation and business performance. the high prices of these stocks does reflect the growth and demand to own these companies. i'd argue entry right now is not a slam dunk, especially after some of their post earnings run ups - the boat has probably been missed on some of these.\n\ni'd give you more cred if you were a banker than a consultant lol - there's a reason why HFs and PE firms dont really hire than many consultants. thinking about valuation is different than just talking about the merits of a business", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "Fair point about banker vs consultant.

Carbon Black was down somewhere between 20-30%, I got impatient and got out, lost like 7-9K. My OKTA shares are up 282%, more than 70K.

Podcasting isn't just hype - SPOT pays 53% of its revenues to music labels. With podcasting, it doesn't have that expense. Yes the acquisition costs of the Joe Rogan, Kim K, DC Comics and Ringer deals are all high, but their relatively pocket change when you consider that it costs literally nothing to actually produce and publish a podcast that will drive subscriptions and that you can sell advertising on.

They're run by very smart people and I think you're underestimating the value of these podcasts. The podcasting business is growing exponentially (albeit slowing down during covid) and the gross margins of a successful podcast are insane. The Ringer was doing north of 20M in podcasting advertising revenue. Now you put spotify's ad sales team and targeting technology on top of that, and they're going to grow them significantly - and that's all just a bonus to growth in subscriptions they get from access to this new customer segment. And they're doing that with Joe Rogan, Kim K and DC comics (scripted superman and wonderwoman podcasts)\n\nSo essentially, your diversifying from a business where you pay 53% of sales to labels as royalties to a business where you're earning ad money from streams you own that you do not have to pay a blanket 53% for.

Keep in mind, The Ringer and Joe Rogan are the absolute top of the game in podcasts but most podcasts aren't going to be anywhere near that expensive. Plus, with the way they feature podcasts on the home screen, they can build their own properties by featuring them.\n\nPut this in perspective - The Crown on Netflix cost $130M per 10 episode season. The Irishman costs $140M. Each Chappelle special costs 20M. For Spotify, they paid 100M for Joe Rogan and they get 5 podcasts a week for a number of years. The Ringer runs what, 25 different weekly podcasts?

This tension is the core issue at play for SPOT when it comes to profitability.\n\nIn any case, Rogan and Kim K's deal probably tells something about the economics - Rogan is apparently $100M and Kim K I couldn't find anything. I doubt either of them would let them get bullied into a bad deal, so the deal size is honestly kind of small given the explosive valuation change.\n\nThe SPOT play here does seem to be \"be dominant podcast platform and build properties\" ala NFLX => but at this price level, I think it's pretty expensive to believe in it, especially when you consider you can find it hard to believe NFLX can sustain its valuation.\n\nAgain, you talk all things growth and business, but not much on the actual price paid and valuation.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Are Rogan or any of these guys going to have to start paying to get quality guests on podcasts (or is the already happening)?

Do I think that there\u2019s plays in the NASDAQ? Sure, there\u2019s some companies that are posed to do well in a recession.

Yes. Eventually fundamentals will catch up.

Having smooth, recurring, reliable revenue streams, impacted only by churn and growth allows helps eliminate big negative surprises during earnings and compounds growth quickly for the businesses. \n\nWhat happens if the customer can no longer operate or needs to cut costs in order stay afloat? \n\nAnswer: The customer cuts their SaaS subscriptions leading to a loss in revenue for tech. People like you act like there is no way SaaS revenue can be lost for tech companies and makes them immune to recessions, but it does not. A loss in B2B sales is exactly what makes tech vulnerable to recessions.
