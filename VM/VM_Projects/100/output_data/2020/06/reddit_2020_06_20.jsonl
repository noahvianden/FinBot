{"title": "NIKOLA is the 2020-2021 THERANOS - Elizabeth Smart = Trevor Milton", "selftext": "Note I don\u2019t own any options or stock in the company. I\u2019ve left out details that would identify the friend.  \n\n\nI have a good engineering friend who I went to uni with, who got hired got hired on to the company not to long ago. NDA\u2019s and all.. Increasingly his job was more research and development then he thought it would ever be. Lots of closed doors inside the company for many people except for a few key figures. \n\nIn the past 2\u20134 months things got increasingly more suspicious there and he started asking questions.. just wondering how far along this truck capabilities were. No mid level engineers have ever seen any of this hydrogen trucks processes in person and management only ever spoke about it. \n\nVast majority of employees are research and development. Company culture is only focus on the scope of ur assignment for the day/ week / month. Any question that charters or walks the line of \n\nCan we see the internals of a truck, demos, \n\nPublic is saying this xyz \n\nIs automatically classified as confidential company status which only 1-2 people in the main office allegedly have clearance for.  \n\nThey have coaching sessions on how to respond to family members or friends about certain aspects of the company outside of hype questions.  \n\nThe only thing my friends ever seen is completed frames of the next dune buggy NZT I believe he said .. Painted frame,. windows with wheels on the bottom. Wouldn\u2019t  start though as they had a shipping delay on the battery for this first model that was ready for employees to see. Had a stupid meeting for apparently and made everyone clap like it was a morning Walmart cheer every time a senior manager spoke. \n\nApparently no ones ever met anyone who\u2019s been on the original dev team.  My friend has suggested that they are using deposits and stock sale cash to come up with a car. Even if they one day did come up with a car don\u2019t expect to ever see anything on the timelines provided. Friend also suggested this isn\u2019t a repeat of Elon just being late by a few months or a year all the time with estimates, seems like a con so great that Madoff seem kind of ethical in comparison. Perhaps we haven\u2019t been duped in a while.  \n\nWell needless to say a couple employees have been let go for new hires \u2014 hires \ud83c\udfa3 that won\u2019t ask questions. A small pack of employees who had asked questions to senior management or who were to smart for the good of whatever is happening behind the scenes were let go. \n\nConsider this a PSA, Elizabeth Holmes fooled many \u201csmart ppl\u201d for a while till the whole thing fell apart. \n\nWe have a better chance of seeing the billons of dollars of gold in ft Knox before we see what under the hood at Nikola.\n\nShare repost link it to ur friends.

It's much easier to swindle investors that way. It would be foolishly bold to go public if the company was a complete scam. I'm highly skeptical of the company and its ability to deliver on its promises, but all of the tech that they use is commercially available so it's quite possible that they have a working prototype.\n\nThe real questions in my mind are 1) is the prototype close to production-ready (they haven't shown off the actual tech), 2) can it scale (the trucks are supposedly made by hand), 3) can they successfully install all of the hydrogen fueling stations on schedule, and 4) can they bring hydrogen fuel cost down to the $2/kg price target that they claim. All while not doing any of it in-house.\n\nIn the Nikola's Analyst Day YouTube video @ 13:20ish, the CEO calls Dale Prows 'one of \\[their\\] hydrogen experts'. Here's his LinkedIn profile:\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/dale-prows-b21646b](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dale-prows-b21646b)\n\nWhat's interesting to me is this is a business development and management guy. Bachelor's in finance and \"performed post graduate work\" (assume he didn't graduate) at the University of Pittsburgh. This is their hydrogen expert? Not a scientist. Not an engineer. The dude was literally working at a golf course before Nikola Motor. Hmm.\n\nWho is the lead engineer at Nikola? Why isn't s/he showing off the goods?

{"title": "I watch the press conference so you don't have to: Why Florida will not be shutting down", "selftext": "There is an imbecile in another post on WSB who's struggles to put his diaper on in the morning who's attempting to give shit investment advice about how Florida will need to shut down. In an effort to justify his mom's hard fought public school education that he got he attempted to use big nickel words and graphs to show Arizona and Florida are in a doomsday pact with their residents and they're all going to need to lockdown again, or everyone is going to die. As the title suggests I watched the press conference yesterday by Gov Destanis so you don't have to, and am here to give the corrected information about what's going on in the nations best run state. \n\nFirst, one thing to understand about Florida is due to the constant hurricane issues and the large old people population they have had the most detailed data and fastest reporting data in the nation. The governor does not get up on stage with a crap PowerPoint every day and have no actual color to add to everything, instead they have very granular data which cuts through the polical nonsense.  All data referenced in this post will be in the imgur link at the end. \n\nSecond all their elder care facilities are still on high alert and locked down. These have not reported and travel into and out of them are still very limited and carefully monitored.  All PPD is directed towards the elder care facilities, with hospitals getting the over run. \n\nOkay now onto the data. Yesterday Gov Destatis had a 1 hour+ press conference were he said where the state was at and where it was heading too. I doubt anyone from this sub watched it as it started about 10 minutes after apple decided to tank the market by announcing they were closing 8 stores. \n \nIn this press conference he first discussed why the number of infected was increasing. (Chart 1) he showed that all the new cases are from people who are under the age of 40. Which for 99.6% of all people will not result in death but at worse will be a bad flu. Further he went on to state that nation wide the only 2 people have died under the age of 30 who didn't have huge co-morbidities before they got Covid. Basically if you are healthy today and catch it you will be fine. \n\nHe breaks the new infection numbers down even further in chart 4 if you wanted to look at age split.\n\nHe backs his claim about younger people not being at risk with Chart 2 showing how the death rate is doing a nose dive. If they were actually at risk of death and were dying we would see it.  Additionally, he said they aren't going into hospitals either, as there are more available beds now in June than there were at any point between now and March 1st.\n\nSo this is a crap investment group so I should post on what this means for the market. Here's the brass tax, young people getting infected is a really good thing. The world has seen at least 6 major Covid related massive illnesses that they've attempted to develop a vaccine for. Do you want to know how many were successful? ZERO. There will not be a vaccine for covid-19 either as it mutates too fast. There is only one way out of this, herd immunity. The faster young heathy people get infected and become immune the faster we can attempt to go back to normal.  Any doctor on TV telling you anything else is lying to you. Also remember, our grandparents lived through a great depression 3 pandemics and 2 world wars and kept on trucking. We can make it through this.\n\nLong story short, invest in America buy quality long positions and enjoy the ride. Also fuck idiots telling you the world is going to end. \n\nFlorida data: Florida data https://imgur.com/a/JfoZM1o", "id": "hclbrj", "created_utc": 1592655214.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Yes but GRanUlAr dAta", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09359849244356155}, {"body": "I love it.\n\nYOU GUYZ!

I said we would go to 3090 b4 a violent reversal & that is what happened. also said we would kiss 3080 on monday but I'm sure many of u didnt listen & lost more $ but dont u worry cuz my retarded ass has decided to let u kno what the fuck is up again\n\nFirst and foremost. Not financial advice so if you go all in on this shit and lose your fucking money. dont blame me. we'll lose money together <3\n\nthere is 1 chart & 1 chart only u need to look at & it reveals everything- here it is zoomed out\n\n[\\/es daily](https://preview.redd.it/9qly1nj3t3651.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=caf2ff71a8784d2874c73654078378e3870dd1a6)\n\n[zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/3du6ux67t3651.png?width=1579&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d266f50feb7364d9ee5f419c7ad26b9d36e9e3c)\n\ndont u worry- here to explain what this shows us. if u look back, /es has respected that trendline datin back to fuckin 2017 - whether it acted as support or resistance it always is respected. so lets fuckin look at friday session - what happend?\n\nwell in my part 1 post i said look for bull trap goin into close and that is exactly wtf happend. i dont find it to b a coincidence that we got a massiv fuckin rejection at the intersection of all 3 trendlines. that was a fuckin flush afterhours, well coordinated bulltrap goin into what will b a bloody week.\n\nwhat else happened yesterday? /ES lost the 5 EMA which has acted as support last few sessions. we have masive negative divergence buildin in rsi, slo stoch curling, all settin up for a bloody week.\n\nso in my 1st post called 4 target of 2800-2850 in next few weeks, knew last week would b borin as fuck but was great opportunity to load up with vix crush so im well positioned for a flush this week.\n\ni think we kiss 2800 this week then as i stated b4, market gonna make a decision and many of u are gonna b on the wrong side and get absolutely fucked.\n\n[GEX again massive plummet](https://preview.redd.it/pr6oqkahr3651.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=86f6538f02310e391ae831744fa996c07ad10578)\n\nDIX is high as fuck while GEX plummet lower fri - what does this tell us? same fuckin thing as last week so im literally gonna copy pasta what i wrote last post re: GEX/DIX -\n\n*GEX and DIX is far above most of you retards to understand so i'll say this - Remember GEX is hedging OBLIGATIONS and acts as a brake on the DIX price. Why would MM\u2019s have drastically lower hedging obligations while DIX is still high?* ***Because the only volume left on the Dark Pools is retail by proxy of Market makers. Don't buy fucking calls***\n\n[spx daily](https://preview.redd.it/oe2wxq0xs3651.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=d656b379fdd335160d1556ad6896f89cef6315e5)\n\n1st test next week gonna b 3025 which also lines up right around the 200/150 MAs, break thru that & we see 2922, break thru that we get my target 2800 - then market gonna pick do we drop down to 2600ish or see big reversal back above 3000? i think it would set up reversal play higher (yea im not a fuckin permabear believe it or not, i do go long u fucks) but that remains 2 b seen\n\npositions since u retards gonna spam it in the comments -\n\njuly monthly exp - SPX 2800/2850 puts, vix 50/55/60/80 calls, xlf puts (banks r fuked)\n\naug monthly exp - vix 50/80/100 calls\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Monday - 1:33est**Out of my /ES longs from last night, hit 3100 target, loaded up short here. leaving a little room on this one, stop set at 3115\n\n**9:25pm est**\n\noh fake fukin trade deal is no longer happening, would u imagine that. we'll see where we end up in the am but i wouldnt b shocked if the pj traders just buy the fukin dip lmao. Mayb though this was the long awaited catalyst we bears needed :-D\n\n**Wednesday**\n\nFlood gates look like they are close to opening.... a little upside if bulls reclaim 3070 but that isn't lookin good for them..... imo we break 3025 ish and we will hit my target 2800-2850 very very very soon. tomorrow and friday could get ugly with quarter end rebalancing and massive selling.\n\n**Thursday - 12:29am est - yes a late night update**\n\nSo today was interesting - we got to our level 3025 in RTH and it bounced heavy.. it actually broke this pre market but ECB pumped and our plan was halted at the hand of the fed. Then  they saved it and pumped stimulus and then pumped bank stress test which turned out to be not so great (buy rumor sell news) - so here's a detailed update from what im seein on my end cuz yea today's tape fuckin sucked to be real with you. all this is referencing /ES chart as info:\n\n1. I am still very bearish on this market. This seemed like a fake pump that really didnt even break any key levels that i had, the biggest bein 3077 ish level.\n2. this was a fed induced pump today make no mistake of that. when bank stress test was released, it revealed that we are fucked if second wave comes (which we are seeing) and the bank losses could be 08 level or worse. Hence, bank stonks tanked after close. Pump the pigs up all day on rumors then sell the news, classsssssic. Banking index showing a MASSIVE head and shoulders pattern so not very bullish there\n3. This fake BS rally didnt take out any levels that bulls need to reclaim. 3077 is massive 1st level bulls need to take out to make this rally convincing. OK lets say they take this out in futures tonite which looks like it could be plausible, bulls have to break a few levels to make this convincing 4 me. 5EMA is sittin at 3084, 8MA sittin at 3100, 20MA sittin at 3108. Bulls have defended the 200 MA HARD. You can see it bounced off of the 200 MA this morning and even re-tested it which led to the bounce and fed induced pump. So for me, I remain bearish, I remain short until these levels are broken.\n\n[\\/es daily](https://preview.redd.it/2tqoayey97751.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=8447005e147e7bf93175111c4516df5273f44986)\n\nAs u can see - this shit is gettin tight. Tomorrow and next week will reveal a lot.... I wouldn't b surprised if tomorrow is flat and next week we flush to hit my target to set up a long opp. MACD still bearish, we still have a huge negative divergence.\n\n[QQQ daily](https://preview.redd.it/1py7dlnu97751.png?width=1585&format=png&auto=webp&s=b03934a24fed8ad7dba98a1edcbd6330b77854e7)\n\nHere's a look at Nasdaq. Why would u ever go long here? These trendlines date back 10+ years. u can see we get a nice rejection off the trendline and guess what.... for the most part, this has always touched the trendline or got close.. this time will be no different - RISK down to $180 on QQQ, with this fed induced market, maybe down to $200 ish on the drop before a bounce but make no mistake, tech is long due for correction.\n\n[spx daily](https://preview.redd.it/rsgi1nkn97751.png?width=1585&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b0c80ef83eab96e270955c44bd9bddb42fb00c8)\n\nbounce right off my levels for now.....\n\nSo I guess in summary, remain bearish until we hit those key levels i listed above, everything in my soul screams today was yet another fake fed induced rally and until we break all those key levels, i remain bearish.", "id": "hcqnvr", "created_utc": 1592675816.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "pretty sure you just wanted to type dicks over and over and wound up with dix", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "I luv dix", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Wait...doesn\u2019t everyone on WSB?", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13448193669319153}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47993552684783936}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2238253951072693}, {"body": "You did all that DD only to reveal you\u2019re a volatility slut who sucks dick for VXX call money huh?
