To be able to achieve their goal Tesla will need raw material supply, a high speed production process (announced at battery day with DBE process needing some kinks to be ironed out), a high number of competent workers and funding.\n\nOf these, most investors seem to focus on cost of scaling and Elon quite rightly highlights that funding isn\u2019t the bottle neck. Securing work force takes time but is also actually fairly straight forward. However, with the average time to get a mine online being 5-7 years, securing enough material supply to make 3TWh in 2030 is order of magnitudes more difficult in my opinion. That represents an 8x increase in current world lithium supply.\n\nThe reason why the material processing announcements at battery day are so important is because Tesla needs the material supply chain industry to be able to achieve their goal. Tesla will not achieve this goal if the material supply chain does not ramp hard and fast with them - Tesla needs to drag them along with them. This means the lithium supply industry (as well as Nickel and Manganese) needs massive funding, and they need it right now. Remember it takes 5-7 years to get a mine online. \n\nTesla\u2019s announcement at battery day regarding lithium and table salt sounded very simple on the surface but would represent a process that has been tried and tested in the past but has not been commercially adopted. I\u2019ve read about much scepticism within the lithium material supply world about this announcement because what Tesla announced sounded like a \u2018magic solution\u2019 but \u2018industry experts\u2019 are highly sceptical this will play out in reality. They view the announcement as not helping the lithium supply industry as it does not highlight the vital need for investment in the sector straight away, if Tesla are going to have enough materials to deliver on their stated 3TWh goal.\n\nI consider myself a massive Tesla bull, but Tesla\u2019s share price will be contingent on their ability to grow and ramp up production over the next 10 years.

The retail consumer needs the fast swap a few times per year, and likely isn't willing to pay a lot more for that if a high range and high charging speed can get them close enough that it's not a major headache. When you look at the cells as part of the vehicle structure as unveiled at battery day, it really is the death knell for the swap concept.\n\nHowever Semi's are a different ball game - the long-haul use case has the same vehicles travelling the same route weekly and potentially needing to swap or charge multiple times in a trip. In semi's there is also a very clear \"time is money\" return on cutting out charging time. When FSD-assisted semi \"trains\" become common, it could easily be 3-5 vehicles at a time that pull into a station needing a full charge, and all of them have very high capacity MWh battery packs. The grid issues with ramping charging up and down start to become an issue (charging stations already run into issues where costs are driven more by capacity charges than energy charges if utilization is not high enough). Justifying the battery-swap infrastructure is easy if you have customers that you know will be running certain routes at certain volumes, and the battery swap model can help reduce charge rates and max % charge to prolong pack life. If you have a swap station that is charging several dozen semi packs with some idea of when they're needed you can also start to unlock value from the VPP / autobidder side (charge at minimum cost noon-time solar and night-time off-peak baseload, and sell the demand certainty).\n\nSo I think there is a case to be made that swap will come back for Semis, but I also think the Tesla team has very smart people working on this and they will reveal it when they're ready (not likely until they've started shipping semis to customers using them for the short haul market).", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "agree.

The station can charge the swapped batteries at a reasonable rate with solar when the sun is up and/or when grid power is cheap.

{"title": "The REAL Greatest Short Burn of the Century Pt 2: The Two Towers ($GME)", "selftext": "\"Another $GME post?\" Sounds like you've made up your mind. Just downvote me and buy puts. Cya later.\n\nAs for the rest of the open-minded. Let me be clear: **IT HAS BEGUN**.\n\nAs always, not financial advice. Just entertainment and bragging rights. Here goes:\n\nDid you pay attention [last time](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/)? If so, I hope you traded without emotion and made money. \n\nOr did you ignore that wall of text and think you missed the $GME train? Fear not. The best is yet to come. \n\nThey say the original is always better than the sequel, but *not* in the case of $GME. This second leg is going to go better I than expected. And I didn't take any adderall today, so this post will be short and sweet.\n\n**To recap**:\n\n* $GME has a massive short float - It actually **increased** from 55M shares short before earnings to OVER 73M AS OF 10/10/2020. **THIS IS A WHAT THE F- MOMENT**. Mr Market is handing you the deal of a lifetime on a silver platter. Don't pass it up or worse, fumble the ball (no life savings on FDs please).\n* $GME is massively undervalued because their books are strong (net cash anyone?).\n* $GME is in the midst of a turnaround story (RyanCohen+ReggieFilsAime).\n* Due to TINA (there is no alternative), ZIRP (zero interest rate policy), Robinhood, and WSB, meme stonks and retail are not a joke and should be seriously considered.\n\nOne thing to clarify from my previous post: Turns out Kenny G (Citadel) isn't going to work with us right now. Unfortunate, but not a big deal. They will join us in part 3.\n\nReason: Although the MM delta hedging math is correct, short % of float is NOT A TRIGGER NUMBER. There is no significance to the 100%+ short float. It just means it is high. Shorts are willing to pay insane borrowing fees to continue to short $GME on the thesis that they'll go bankrupt. So WSB monkey YOLO FD strategy will NOT cause a short squeeze. This much is obvious now. \n\n**Current day**:\n\nOk we're done with the flashbacks. We'll cover 3 main topics very quickly. Short float, trendline, and news.\n\n**1) Short float:** \n\nIt's always hard to get this data. But as discussed on the @TheRoaringKitty stream, ORTEX is quoting **73M SHARES SHORT** of $GME. ShortSqueeze is quoting 68M, but their data always lags and isn't very accurate. Either way, SHORTS ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON THEIR POSITION. \n\nThis puts longs in a better position because of the inherent pent-up demand w/ regard to the short covering in the future. However, this reeks of $TSLA bankwupcy news cycles pre-Q3'19 earnings. So expect a lot of hate coming our way from many news outlets. Don't lose your conviction. We'll be here to reassure you. For example, CNBC just put out a massive 12 minute hit piece on GME. Expect much more of this to come. This is the mother of all HODLs. Being contrarian is never popular, but it is lucrative.\n\nStand strong against the Two Towers (BlackRock and Fidelity).\n\n**2) Trendlines:**\n\nLook at this [console cycle graph here](http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_240233258.jpg).\n\nI believe there is credence to this trendline. But expect it to be rocky. Buy every dip. And if you're unemployed and want to watch markets all day, sell every spike.\n\nIf you're a mid-term gambler/investor like myself, buy and hold shares and Jan'21 $30Cs. I would not recommend you set limit orders if you have a fascist broker like Fidelity (which caps at +50%). $GME can easily pop 50% in a day. Also, according to S3 research, who I support, shorts and brokers are proven to be [manufacturing synthetic shares](https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/) in order to short more, meaning our limit sells does nothing except limit our own potential gains.\n\n**3) News:**\n\nTo go on the record: the MSFT partnership is a nothing-burger. Even if you include the implied revenue-sharing agreement, the news content is very lukewarm. HOWEVER, the fact that this stupid piece of news moved $GME 50% in one day shows how primed for launch this stonk is. Imagine a real partnership with Sony and Nintendo (Reggie Fils Aime with the lay-up). Or imagine $GME launches a digital gaming platform (Steam competitor). Kaboom.\n\nThere will be a massive battle of bulls and bears on the news cycle. Ignore everything except for SEC filings from GME and tweets from @GameStop itself. Everything else is a shill for a position (I suppose even this post).\n\nWatch especially close for Ryan Cohen news. My spidey senses say he will be the final match to light up the shorts (tender offer, board position, executive position, or outright purchase).\n\n**TL;DR - $GME is just about to go parabolic. If you get on now, your diamond hands could turn to diamond rings.**\n\nPositions:  $GME shares and Jan'21 $30C.  If there is a -10%+ dip and cheap OTM weeklies, I'll buy those as well. $100 can easily turn to $10K as seen on Thursday.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or dispute any fact. I love talking $GME and will do my best to answer your question.\n\n*Edit (10/17/2020): DOMO Capital spoke with $GME IR and has confirmed a revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft.

This is only meant to be political insomuch as it has a direct connection to market behavior.\u00a0 Please don't have a political debate in the comments and get me banned lol. I'd send polling numbers and shit, but don't have time to look it all up before I start work.\u00a0 The info is out there, though.*\n\nIf you're like me, you were confused last week as DT tweeted for and against the Stimulus, and volatility didn't move with it.\u00a0 We also saw a ton of COVID cases hit the administration, which caused overnight futures depression, but didn't have the staying power to move SPY during trading hours.\u00a0 The DOW is coming off one of it's only good monthly runs of the year, and volatility is at absurd lows heading into an election.\u00a0 What gives?\n\nIn the daily threads I see a lot of people attribute the stubborn upward movement to Stimulus hopes, and this is true.\u00a0 Importantly, however, is that this is not hope Stimmy will get done before election--it is abundantly clear that won't happen.\u00a0 It's also not market hopes that DT wins and makes good on his promise to deliver checks--the market follows pundits, and smart money, and all those have on a Mango loss (I'm not picking a side; I'm saying this is the information that is out there).\u00a0 Lastly, it definitely ain't hope that Trump's tweet about a \"bigger Stimulus than Democrats or Republicans want\" will lead to a larger amount--Senate Republicans who are not McConnell have made it clear they won't sign off on a large package, potentially not even the 1.8 trillion that the WH floated last week.\n\n**The market is preparing for a probable \"Blue Wave\"--Dem control of the WH, Senate, and House--and the massive stimulus that would pass as a result.**\n\nThe initial HEROES Act the Dem House wanted to pass was over 3 trillion, which was brought down to 2.2 trillion in recent negotiations to make it at least seem like a good starting point for GOP discussions.\u00a0 IF--and i do mean IF--pundits are correct in their predictions of a Dem sweep, then the House and Senate would have complete control over the amount and dispersion of funding for the next Stimulus.\u00a0 The initial 3.4 trillion the Democrats wanted to pass could easily rise to a spiteful 4 trillion with zero obstacles from another party.\u00a0 This explains a few obvious market trends recently, like SPY's continued rise, but also less obvious ones like:\n\n-The continued rise in tech even as valuations reach new heights and lockdowns ease: Dem wins would mean more stringent protocols, which benefits big tech (obviously) as stay-at--home stocks could have prolonged relevance.\u00a0 Couple that with the upcoming earnings season, and you got a nice tech stew going.\n\n-Absurdly depressed volatility: A \"blue wave\" would mean financial policy consistency and shared vision, meaning that whatever happens in congressional decision-making would be without a certain level of conflict and therefore, increased expedience.\n\n-Solar and weed stocks mooning: this one is pretty obvious.\n\nI'm not saying any candidate--or congress--is better than the other.\u00a0 I'm saying that the bulk of predictions are on Dem wins across the board, and MMs are acting accordingly, riding the wave up before *we* get there with surprised Pikachu face when a Joe win doesn't tank the market.\u00a0 We saw how wrong polls can get it in 2016, but the numbers right now are pretty scathing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n**Plays:** In the event of a sweep, I wouldn't expect Dems to move slow, since winning across the board would be considered a \"mandate\", and the Supreme Court nominating process will have them clamoring to clap back.\u00a0 I'm looking at calls slightly OTM, one to three months out, for the stimulus winners on dips this week:\n\n**Recovery retail:** Small business closures, more stringent protocols and having had another quarter to integrate online systems will be good for:\n**WMT** 11/27 155c\n**TGT** 11/27 170c\n**M** 1/15 9c\n**LOW** 11/27 185c\n\nRUN is my solar play, they've taken a little bit of a beating but are in takeover mode via smart acquisitions and should head back up:\n**RUN** 11/20 75c\n**RUN** 12/28 80c\n\n**Airlines:** JETS leaps for January, and SAVE 22c 3/19.  I really like SAVE cause its focus is domestic travel, so even as business and international travel die with the larger changing trends, SAVE is in position to profit off of people getting Stimmy money to go visit their parents, etc.\n \nAuto: had a big run during COVID, likely due in part to UI backpay giving folks a down payment ability who didn't have it.\u00a0 Obviously KMX and CVNA, but I am very bullish on auto insurance because they haven't gotten a lot of attention.\u00a0 I believe PGR is going to knock earnings out the park and I have (these are up 50%-70% since I bought this morning but that's also partially IV)\n**PGR** 10/16 100c\n**PGR** 10/16 105c\n**PGR** 11/20 110c\n\nAgain, I really am not trying to say one candidate or party is better than the other, it's just a logical explanation of what could be happening on a macro level, and I've worked in political fundraising for many years.  Do your own research, because I bought UVXY calls last week.  So, ya know.\n\n**TLDR: Market doesn\u2019t care about the daily stimulus hopes game, its banking on a Democratic sweep which would mean a larger and fairly quick stimmy getting passed.
