Introduction\n\n[Proof that I'm lucky](https://preview.redd.it/aissk31uiir51.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b40b7364962c3383a1dbb4010c5f5cfd41ffb54f)\n\nThe way I am going to structure this post isn\u2019t with **elliot waves** or **reverse chicken-leg hambone formations** and things that nobody understands, although if anybody smarter than me wants to talk **crayons** in the comments, you are more than welcome.\n\nI\u2019m going to start by explaining why Nike popped, not *exclusively* because I want to **jerk myself off** for being **smart** and predicting it, but because we are going to see how the two stocks display a similar pattern. While I can\u2019t **guarantee that CROX will pop 10% in AH** like NKE did after earnings, I can say with reasonable surety that CROX is going to have an outrageous quarter.\n\nFinally, and I cannot stress this enough, saying Company X will outperform because it is like Company Y, in and of itself, is **TERRIBLE** DD. I am **RETARDED** and you **WILL** lose all of your money, but the meme potential here is so strong I cannot keep this one to myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Nike\u2019s 1st Quarter Earnings\n\nSo Nike reported first quarter earnings on September 22, blew every analyst\u2019s expectations out of the water, and made the true believers rich. It was an absolutely perfect storm, and I\u2019m going to explain why:\n\n1. **Motherfuckers sleeping on the GOAT**: I don\u2019t sell shoes really but I am designing software to help secondhand sellers on GOAT, StockX, etc. As a consequence of this, I became very familiar with certain aspects of the sneaker industry. Nike had a terrible June report, lost like 800 million dollars, had to withdraw products from stores, and was generally a disaster. But during the summer, I was paying close attention, and two narratives were simultaneously playing out. The first is that delivery times were getting much better, which implied that they had figured out their COVID logistical issues, and the second is that the emphasis on online sales was wildly successful.\n2. **Ubiquity:** Nearly every non-general release shoe would sell out in seconds, and we are talking about production runs of a few thousand to 100k. It did not matter; everything was selling out. And then it would appear on StockX and other resale sites and start selling there for well above MSRP; this pattern was so reliable that StockX itself posted record sales in the BILLIONS of dollars in 2020, buttressed mostly by Nikes. The more I paid attention to releases, the more I saw Nikes everywhere. And I\u2019m not talking about regular general release Air Monarchs from Costco, I would see very specific spring and summer releases all over feet in NYC. Quarantine be damned, by the time summer rolled around, consumer spending on dumb shit was back in a big way, and new, limited Nikes were hitting pavement everywhere.\n3. **Price patterns**: I was autistic enough to follow NKE basically every few minutes every day in August and September. It climbed with the market, and started getting really frothy in September, hitting record highs over and over again both before and after the Great Crash of September. As a component of the S&P, its price was strongly correlated to SPY, but its lows were higher and highs were much higher. There was a reliable gravity established around 115, and any time it swung below, I bought.\n4. **Analyst sentiment:** The analysts didn't really know how well Nike was doing obviously, because they were measuring it against the broader retail market, which was meh. Meanwhile, being autistic, I was measuring it against other outperforming high-end sports equipment stocks like LULU and PTON. While frothy, sure, it never really had any sort of breakout. And so the perfect storm was created, where analysts were asleep at the wheel (only \\~60% expected a beat at all!), prices were constantly hitting and then dipping below ATH, and a strong center of gravity near the peak. And then earnings came out and everything was great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Crocs Third Quarter Earnings (Scheduled for 10/27 premarket)\n\nLet\u2019s compare:\n\n1. **Motherfuckers sleeping again:** Crocs is having a renaissance moment. Crocs is also recovering after a terrible midyear, but the stock price has only barely made it back above even. That same exact StockX resale momentum that carried NKE is now picking up for Crocs. Crocs, like Jordans, are now a commodity. All of their recent crossovers, such as Bad Bunny, Grateful Dead, KFC, etc are **selling out** IMMEDIATELY and they are selling out **ONLINE**, only to reappear on StockX. Not only that but their supply chains are tightening up and deliveries are getting quicker. These retail analysts aren\u2019t trying to queue up for Crocs or timing deliveries because who the fuck on Wall Street wears Crocs? Which brings me to part two, ubiquity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[For every dollar you could have put into these Crocs, you would have gotten 3 back. Better returns than TSLA for the same period.](https://preview.redd.it/z8qi4fdyiir51.jpg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3da45758b7c076cb81e4dc6fca1ba6cdca717bb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Ubiquity:** Yes, you read that first part right. KFC Crocs were one of the most **fire** drops of Summer 2020, and I was devastated that I was not able to secure a pair during the drop. But these retarded things are still going for way over MSRP on StockX. People love these crossovers! And with each sold-out release, it only builds hype for the next one. While I don\u2019t personally see as many Crocs on feet as Nikes (no shit), their ubiquity in the medical field cannot be downplayed. I know tons of folks in the NYC, NJ, and PA hospital systems and nearly all of them own Crocs. Not only that, but there have been thousands of donated shipments of Crocs, which fucking somebody has been paying for somewhere. More hardworking doctors dealing with **Covid = more Crocs on feet**. Not only that, but Crocs retail stores are opening back up aggressively and general releases are still doing great.\n2. **Price patterns:** CROX in late September/early October is behaving the exact same way NKE was behaving in late August/ early September. Getting reeeeaaaaal **frothy** around ATH, spiking up and back down, finding gravity somewhere in the 40-45 range (although it appears to be settling even higher). Compared to the broader market, the lows are higher and the highs much higher. HOWEVER analysts are clearly making up for missing NKE and as such, it\u2019s unlikely it will be as mispriced ahead of earnings.\n3. **Analyst sentiment:** This is the biggest divergence. Analysts are upping their targets because they know they fucked up last time. Not only that, but CROX is making unusual headlines lately with share prices surging, especially regarding the Justin Bieber collab rumors (yep, this is a real sentence). This means that while there is still an earnings beat in the works, it\u2019s more likely to be **pRiCeD iN** unless it\u2019s absolutely bonkers nuts, which it still can be, especially if we get some more **retarded** collabs before the end of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Look at these LINES. I don't even know what stock this is. Are you still reading this?](https://preview.redd.it/rl3wyy50jir51.jpg?width=948&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b9276c6d176561c6a6a2294af792cf50ce56d5e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Conclusion\n\n**Strategy**\n\nAlright boys, the position is simple. Earnings is late October. Options play is November 20th, which as of writing is all that\u2019s available nearest to that date. I\u2019m going to snatch up 50c in batches of $5k on any day it closes below 45, and as it starts to find gravity in the 45-50 range, adjust up and start grabbing 55c.\n\n*Current position:*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Read it and weep nerds. If I spent 1 dollar a day, it would take me AN ENTIRE YEAR to spend these profits.](https://preview.redd.it/yuec4692jir51.jpg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99cc6ed32a1e3cb996908a0cbe1e1353a494f7a5)\n\n**Words of warning**\n\nGiant beats and price pops only work when nobody is expecting it, and price action here suggests that analysts are anticipating positive movement. It is **UNLIKELY** that CROX will be as mispriced as NKE going into earnings, but there is still a lot of room for a **hella runup**. It nonetheless bears repeating **PAST RESULTS IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.**\n\nWith that in mind, it may be a better move to let anticipation bake into the price and then sell off before the earnings. That really only depends on the next \\~month of macro, so I will probably be posting updates as I move along.\n\nAnd as always, I feel like it\u2019s pretty obvious at this point but please keep in mind that I am **A+ retarded**.\n\nBut hey, don\u2019t take my word for it. Here is a [real testimonial](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j62ihd/daily_discussion_thread_for_october_06_2020/g7wrapy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a satisfied customer.\n\n**In summation**\n\n1.

StockX was selling out because almost every Nike release this summer was Jordan or high value (off white, diors, etc - something that has theoretically infinite value on resale bc of limited release). Jordan brand was buoyed heavily by the documentary, and I mean saying they had a resurgence is an understatement with sports on hold at that moment. That doc was the only sports related thing for months. No other shoe brand had that going for them. Adidas was the closest and was just spamming Yeezys to match the Jordan releases.\n\nThe rest of their success is actually marketing trend related, but analysts don\u2019t understand that. Example of that being the \u201cMoat\u201d theory, which isn\u2019t even a theory because it\u2019s a basic marketing principle that was around for a long time before Buffett made it popular.
