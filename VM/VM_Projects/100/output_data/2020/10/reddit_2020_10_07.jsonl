Even if COVID is somehow fixed next year, their film franchise pipeline has a big air gap in it now. \n\nBut my harshest criticism is for their Disney Plus strategy of giving away the farm for $3/month.  They're giving people everything they have for nothing.  They could have charged more or given less, or both.  Giving their entire content away for nothing has just trained everyone that the content is worth about 0.3 cents per title.\n\nAnd high subscriber signups is pointless when you're losing huge money on every single one. They could have priced it a lot higher, for break even at least, and taken a more sustainable and profitable road to building up the subscribers.  And if they would have done that, COVID would have played out to be a massive windfall profit, instead of a charity handout.  And the problem with streaming services is it's easy to sell when you're charging nothing, but once you raise the price at all, there will be backlash.\n\nLoeb's idea of using the dividend money to burn in the furnace that is Disney Plus doesn't make sense.  It's just burning up money.  And besides, if they need cash, you can borrow for free these days, so there's no real need to raid the dividend account.  \n\nThey need to figure out a way to recast Disney Plus into something that can at least break even.  And that's going to mean customers paying more and getting less.  Like they used to.  The Disney way.\n\n My strategy would be to split up their approximately 6 or 8 content mountains (things like Marvel, ESPN, Disney Cartoons, Star Wars, The Simpsons, etc) and get people used to paying $3 for EACH of the content piles, or some bundle that includes multiple content groups.  Yes, it's cable 2.0. But guess what? That's the path to profit.  Just pipe video data to each subscribers probably costs them more than double what they as a fee.

They just pushed their planned releases out another 2 years. There\u2019s a few more out there. None of them made the impact Tesla is making. \n\nWhy? They\u2019re boomer companies. They just don\u2019t get it. They launch a car and move onto the next car design. Tesla launches a car and continuously sends updates to make it faster, longer range, better AI. Toyota is the only respectable one among them and even they\u2019re struggling to make EV\u2019s. \n\nWhich bring me back to- why? They\u2019re (GM and Ford and whatever) using existing infrastructure. Tesla has put BILLIONS into building from the ground up 100% electric vehicles and electric vehicle manufacturing plants. Tesla is like a specialist heart surgeon while Ford and others are general family doctors. \n\nThey won\u2019t be able to compete with Tesla until they go all in on EV\u2019s. From the ground up. Entire new factories that ONLY specialize in EV\u2019s. Teams of engineers that ONLY design EV\u2019s. None of this half baked bullshit. Tesla just reinvented the battery. What does any other car manufacturer have on that?\n\nAnother reason why- Tesla is a software company as well as a car munufacturer. The boomer car companies suck at software. I\u2019ve seen burnt out taillights that throw \u201ccheck engine\u201d lights. They really, really suck at software and electronics. \n\nI\u2019d much rather have a car from the company that continuously improves and fixed car software and add features throughout the life of the vehicle. \n\nEven Porsche\u2019s latest record selling EV is double the price of most Tesla\u2019s, much less range (192 miles compared to 400 for a model S), and almost exactly the same performances of 0-60 in 2.3ish seconds. The new Tesla Plaid versions are even faster. \n\nSo the newest, best, most cutting edge that Porsche is able to come up with doesn\u2019t beat Tesla in ANY category and it doesn\u2019t have any form of self-driving AI or access to the supercharger network and it costs $85,000 more than a performance model S Tesla. \n\nTesla has a big moat.
