The future is not priced in. That's the problem and why this keeps moving the way people don't want it to; when Apple diluted a lot of investors simply got turned off; having 5 $100 shares really isn't as attractive as having 1 especially when dealing with issues of liquidity and such.

I know this just sounds like the same stuff but the timeline is now wrapping up when these things will happen more than ever. So just a heads up, expect volatility.\n\nMy take/plan for Apple, is that the price will continue to hover today waiting on news of stimulus.  I personally don\u2019t think it will go through before election. I have November / December PUTS that I think the stock will continue to drop on Apple.  There will be a slight run up going into next week\u2019s earnings prob wed and thurs, but then I seriously think it could drop to $100 or even less a share the week before the election.  My plan is to buy more Apple once it drops to that level and also buy long term CALLS for like spring of 2021 because the price will likely sky rocket after Christmas because of a Apple 12 sales.  \n\nAll that being said... who the heck knows.\n117 P 11/20   110 P 12/4", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I like this analysis, honestly at this point I just need this run up to, at the very least break even, then I\u2019ll probably dump it in some long term calls prob after the election.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "For folks who are long-term buy-and-hold people this stuff doesn\u2019t really matter, Apple will still be profitable in the next few years Boomer stock or not.
