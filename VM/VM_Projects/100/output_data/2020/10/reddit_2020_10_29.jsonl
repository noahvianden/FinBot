Furthermore, as the environments autopilot handles exceeds highways and such, and it starts doing far more complex maneuvers as we're now seeing with the beta, I think the wheel torque system is going to be a pretty poor solution to measure driver engagement.\n\nMy guess is that all cars will get camera based driver monitoring (as has been rumored) which should at least allow for a better experience in the daytime. At night, considering the interior camera is rgb, you'll probably still need to do the wheel torque thing, but even getting rid of it during the day would be great.

What I've seen with the fsd beta is extremely impressive in many ways, some I wasn't expecting, and it makes me more bullish on the future.

We provide a huge amount of quality data to Tesla every time we take over for autopilot, because a good chunk of the time it's due to autopilot not behaving as a human would in a given situation. That means driver monitoring is not just a safety feature, from a Tesla investor perspective it also represents an enormous moat for the company. Nobody else has hundreds of thousands of humans using and correcting for (annotating) their system in the real world, every day.\n\nGiven that, I would argue that the current driver monitoring system isn't optimal for drivers, especially as their software advances, and it also isn't optimal for them.
