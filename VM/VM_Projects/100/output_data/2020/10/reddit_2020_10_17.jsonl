Wynn has been consolidating on and off of the .382 fib level after completing the 4th wave of a 5 wave sequence. It is now also having high pressure due to the red bubble on the Squeeze indicator, which essentially measures how tight it is consolidating. This could cause a move to, or beyond the .618 level @ 85. OCT 23 $85 calls are going for .06, and if they become in the money would be worth over 1.5.

A similar setup to that of WYNN with strong pressure for a break to the upside. PLAY has been consolidating in a tight range, in the 4th wave of a mini 5 wave sequence, which is within a larger sequence.

However, DCF also takes into account a # of variables that are assumed and can lead to a value that is very different from the actual valuation. Thus, valuation by itself is worthless. That is the reason why people are willing to pay $550 to buy Zoom and $1000 to buy Shopify because they do not care about valuation. Rather, people care about a) total addressable market (TAM), and b) leadership acumen. If a company has a superb leadership team and super huge TAM, people are willing to pay any price because long term, the value of stock will only increase until a) another player comes in to compete or b) the TAM is saturated. In Shopify's case, there was no competition. Therefore, people were willing to pay any money for owning the stock of a company run by superb leadership and a huge TAM.\n\nAMD falls in that category as well. The market for AMD is huge and leadership is exemplary. The question then becomes, do investors see AMD outgrowing Intel and eating their market share? The answer is-yes! If investors saw value in Intel, it won't be sitting at $53. The other thing that matters to investors is this--do they think Bob Swan can underpromise and overdeliver? I guess time will tell but the gut feeling is that he is not a capable leader and a complete house sweep  is necessary to overhaul Intel. One way retail investors like myself gauge Intel's success is by talking to colleagues who work there and gauging how do they like working there.
