Wynn has been consolidating on and off of the .382 fib level after completing the 4th wave of a 5 wave sequence. It is now also having high pressure due to the red bubble on the Squeeze indicator, which essentially measures how tight it is consolidating. This could cause a move to, or beyond the .618 level @ 85. OCT 23 $85 calls are going for .06, and if they become in the money would be worth over 1.5.

A similar setup to that of WYNN with strong pressure for a break to the upside. PLAY has been consolidating in a tight range, in the 4th wave of a mini 5 wave sequence, which is within a larger sequence.
