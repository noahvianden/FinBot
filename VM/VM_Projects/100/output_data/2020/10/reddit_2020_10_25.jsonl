I already said GME as it is/was is a shit company that will die out if it doesn\u2019t change. My argument for the former founder and CEO of Chewy who made a billion dollar household name e-commerce company around dog food should be noted.

This stock is shorted over 100% and has a 55million float. In the past it has always reached 50 dollars on console releases with a float of 100 million shares. If this does squeeze you can potentially be looking at $70-$100. I\u2019m holding this latest till December.\n\nThere is almost no more shares to borrow for this to be shorted and on multiple time these past few weeks there 0shares to borrow to short. That\u2019s how crazy this thing is shorted. But you have so many people pushing the stock up that even on down days this won\u2019t get shorted and will maintain its SP. there is too much hype on this for it to go down on no news even on one or two market dumps (different from major market crash). The only thing that will crash this is from major national news or the company throws some bs news where multiple recent investors drop out. \n\nThis is almost free money for the next month and a half and you\u2019d be ignorant to think it will crash in the next few months", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Look so far you are about the most reasonable person that commented on this post about this so I thank you for that.
