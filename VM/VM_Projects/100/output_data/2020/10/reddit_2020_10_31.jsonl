{"title": "If you like money, invest in Oil Majors. This is why:", "selftext": "What should you buy?\n\nIdeally, RDSA or other oil major Calls 6-12 months out. You can go for short term calls, but you have to deal with the short term volatility in the market. Either way, this shit is going up.   \n\n\nWhat happened and why are Oil majors so low:    \n\n\nOil majors got hit very hard this year and lost a lot of value due to a combination of momentum, COVID, and short dicks.     \n\n* Oil obviously got a huge hit by COVID, mostly because it's the most obvious thing to short when traveling stops. \n\n* Oil is very unpopular due to the trend in green investing, this moved institutions to unload their bags in the last years. [example](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=https://nos.nl/l/2354349&prev=search&pto=aue)\n\n* Oil was considered boomer stuff by the new influx of retard investors who mostly invested in tech.\n\n* Oil got hit harder because Saudi's with short penises who wanted to go measure dicks with Putin and US shale. [Source](https://sex-with-sander.blogspot.com/2013/05/average-penis-size-per-country-world.html)\n\nToday, all this shit is priced in fundamentally and Oil majors are oversold by almost all TA. The market was kind of pricing in one of the majors to go down. They won't tho, oil is our drugs and we need our hits. \nThis is one of these moments you look back at in a year and it will be so obvious in retrospect.\n\n\nGood for Oil Majors:\n\n\n**COVID Recovery**\n\nCOVID will end and we will be in a worldwide race to recovery. Oil is the most important input for this process and demand will be too big. Price can seriously accelerate to the upside:\n    \n* Demand will rise due to worldwide recovery\n* Production will be lower due to cuts in many big projects with relatively high costs per barrel earlier this year.  \n* Production will be much lower if Biden will stop US fracking.\n* Overpopulation and the rising energy usage will just make us more addicted. India currently uses 2.5 bbl per day per 1000 people. China 6. Western countries use 40-60 bbl/day. Imagine yourself how these numbers will develop in the next 10 years. [source](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=91000)\n\n**Price war ending**\n\nSaudi Arabia is realizing that they did a very stupid thing and are now feeling the consequences, they are in the biggest financial trouble of the big oil countries and they pissed everybody off. The lack of foreign interest in the Aramco IPO was already a sign, but they also fucked up that and promised way too high dividends in order not to lose face. They need some kind of solution and higher oil prices are exactly that.\n\n**Shift in Holders**\n\nPrices are so low now that it will appeal to retards like us, you will see more people here talk about oil in the next months. It's one of the obvious sector rotations once we start looking forward. \n\nInstitutions like pension funds made bad decisions by dumping at low prices due to social/green pressure but this was mostly a luxury hobby which they can't afford past COVID and with the low ratios they are facing. \n\n**And most importantly:**\n\nWe are addicted to oil, we continue to increase the average usage per person, and the world population keeps growing. [Source](https://www.worldometers.info/oil/#:~:text=World%20Oil%20Consumption&text=Global%20oil%20consumption%20per%20capita,gallons%20per%20capita%20per%20day.)\n\nEV's and green energy are cool, but governments won't have money to pay for these luxuries for a long time past COVID and we need a lot of cheap energy to recover.
