{"title": "If you like money, invest in Oil Majors. This is why:", "selftext": "What should you buy?\n\nIdeally, RDSA or other oil major Calls 6-12 months out. You can go for short term calls, but you have to deal with the short term volatility in the market. Either way, this shit is going up.   \n\n\nWhat happened and why are Oil majors so low:    \n\n\nOil majors got hit very hard this year and lost a lot of value due to a combination of momentum, COVID, and short dicks.     \n\n* Oil obviously got a huge hit by COVID, mostly because it's the most obvious thing to short when traveling stops. \n\n* Oil is very unpopular due to the trend in green investing, this moved institutions to unload their bags in the last years. [example](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=https://nos.nl/l/2354349&prev=search&pto=aue)\n\n* Oil was considered boomer stuff by the new influx of retard investors who mostly invested in tech.\n\n* Oil got hit harder because Saudi's with short penises who wanted to go measure dicks with Putin and US shale. [Source](https://sex-with-sander.blogspot.com/2013/05/average-penis-size-per-country-world.html)\n\nToday, all this shit is priced in fundamentally and Oil majors are oversold by almost all TA. The market was kind of pricing in one of the majors to go down. They won't tho, oil is our drugs and we need our hits. \nThis is one of these moments you look back at in a year and it will be so obvious in retrospect.\n\n\nGood for Oil Majors:\n\n\n**COVID Recovery**\n\nCOVID will end and we will be in a worldwide race to recovery. Oil is the most important input for this process and demand will be too big. Price can seriously accelerate to the upside:\n    \n* Demand will rise due to worldwide recovery\n* Production will be lower due to cuts in many big projects with relatively high costs per barrel earlier this year.  \n* Production will be much lower if Biden will stop US fracking.\n* Overpopulation and the rising energy usage will just make us more addicted. India currently uses 2.5 bbl per day per 1000 people. China 6. Western countries use 40-60 bbl/day. Imagine yourself how these numbers will develop in the next 10 years. [source](https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=91000)\n\n**Price war ending**\n\nSaudi Arabia is realizing that they did a very stupid thing and are now feeling the consequences, they are in the biggest financial trouble of the big oil countries and they pissed everybody off. The lack of foreign interest in the Aramco IPO was already a sign, but they also fucked up that and promised way too high dividends in order not to lose face. They need some kind of solution and higher oil prices are exactly that.\n\n**Shift in Holders**\n\nPrices are so low now that it will appeal to retards like us, you will see more people here talk about oil in the next months.

The extra $2 an hour sounds nice, but if it hurts your soul so much that all you want to do is go home and not come back, the extra $2 doesn't accumulate to shit. \n\nEspecially in these turbulent times, find ways to make your everyday happy, and everyone's job satisfaction is HUGE to everyone's daily habits and happiness, whether we like to admit it or not.\n\n-\n\nDont underestimate the power of smiles and self satisfaction.\n\nI earn less per hour, but I'm proud of my decision and my outcome. I'm now genuinely happy, meaning I end up earning much more per month, cause I'm happy to be at work..\n\nSorry for the essay, just good food for thought?\n\n\nEdit: to make it more relevant to stocks. Just cause I had a bad experience as an employee, doesn't mean I don't think this dip is a good buying opportunity. I still believe in the company dominace and growth long term, even if Bezos isn't my favourite human, cannot deny his success, intelligence and determination.

However in my short time, I still met many people who either complained about this or left like me because of it. \n\nYou know when they said Bezos is obsessed with numbers and analytics? To the core. \nThe warehouse is impressive with all the robots and systems, sure, however you are expected to be just a robot along with the other robots. \n\nJust one example. Even though a 12 hour shift from 6pm until 6.30 am can be tough enough on the body, you do have a 30 min break where at least you can have a breath and some food. Sweet. - But thats it. You do have 2 15min breaks also, however the warehouse is so big it took my whole group about 6 mins to get to the break room. On either of those 15 mins break, I would get outside, rush rolling a cig, rush smoke it, and go straight back in so I could be at my post on time. If you signed on a couple mins late after break, they would come to you and question you on why, regardless of performance. Made you want to just stay at your post and not bother with breaks at all. \n\nThe task you have to perform is then tracked on every level you can think of. Even waiting time for the robots, which stresses you out cause you can't make the robots go any quicker, but if your waiting time is too high, you'll get spoken to. If all the robots are full and the items you need to pack can't go in safely, your numbers drop and you get flagged again for not performing. \n\nI love pushing limits and making great numbers. And I was getting stressed out because my performance numbers look low, when I'm trying to do the best possible job they've asked me to do, when other packers are getting better numbers because they cram all the items together damaging the items themselves. They know it won't get back to them so they don't give a fuck. I try and take care of the items for amazon and their clients sake, and then get stressed cause my numbers are dropping. \n\nIts a really shit circle.\n\nHis analytics make sense on some levels, and I don't mean to big myself up, but for someone who actually gives a shit about their job, about trying to go above and beyond, who has thoughts and feelings and emotions, you are expected to be just another amazon robot. There was no music, no laughter, no personality, it was like working in a dark cave, and if you have any drive or ambition, any long term hope, that cave sucks it out of you, puts a barcode on you and makes you want to quit life. Honest.\n\nI know they are strong words, but I'm very self aware, very happy, I honestly love my life even though it may not be the nicest or the flashiest. So happy to be here. 4 weeks in that place and I hand on heart couldn't bare the thought of going back, it affected me so much emotionally, I just didn't. Thats coming from someone who spent 6 years as a chef in TGI Fridays even though I don't like being a chef. I worked hard and could take pride in my work, so still stayed for 6 years.

On the other hand, the corporate warehouses I've worked for, and even the large scale production facilities (automotive parts) i've worked for are all exactly how you describe Amazon.  I wouldn't blame Bezos as much as that is what the paradigm became a long time ago.  \n\nIn 2009 I worked for a major grocer, picking orders from 3pm - 11pm every night.  We didn't get a lunch, we got 2 22 minute breaks (5 spent walking from your parked pallet machine to get outside, 5 spent walking back in, 5-10 spent bolting to the nearest fast food place because the cafeteria really was only built to accommodate office staff)  You were tracked down to every single item you picked.  Some items were alloted a fraction of a second for you to pick them (because they often were shipped in bulk quantities, pickers before you would grab stacks at a time and set the standard high). More experienced pickers knew that disconnecting their battery would abort their current order, and would take advantage of that to \"skip\" on orders that were irregular sizes or quantities.  The pay was min wage but with performance incentives.  You'd get an extra 100 bucks a week if you railed cocaine for your whole shift and picked boxes like a madman (you had to, because other people did it - it set the standard high).  People would do unsafe/illegal things to pick orders faster, driving the standard even further down - making it impossible for you to hit your numbers unless you also broke rules and cut corners.  One of those rules was, your pallet machine does not move unless you're driving it (meaning you're not supposed to walk along side it and truck it along, picking orders as you keep moving).  Alas, you HAVE to, else you underperform and get disciplined.  I did this one day, trying to meet numbers, and ended up crushing my foot between the pallet machine and a support beam.  That was uhh... 10+ years ago, my foot is still fucked - I can't walk more than an hour without being in excrutiating pain, I can't run, my balance is shit - I strain to lift heavy things...

If you tell them to invest and it happens to go down, they will blame you. If you want to boil this rule down to its core maybe just this you don't need to tell anyone how large of a position you have in TSLA and doing so might create more problems than its worth.\n\n**2) ~~You don't talk about $TSLA~~, sorry habit**\n\nFight Club Reference, for the lulz\n\n**3) Be careful with covered calls against $TSLA, don't chase premium**\n\nThe few times I've written covered calls even when I thought they were \"safe\" or \"who cares I can just buy back in on Monday\", They have failed me, shares ripped from my hands and growth so large that I couldn't afford to get back in. Also, if your calls are ITM at expiration you might have to deal with tax implications because you were not really planning on having the shares sold you just wanted that sweet premium. This rule also covers naked calls, but I would think that is a no brainer.\n\n**4) Be wary of FOMO buying and panic selling**\n\nJust beware of FOMO in general, the stock afterhours on August 31st ago was 540, people were FOMOing hard and as of now it\u2019s down, those people could have just waited a little bit for a pullback instead of piling in at the top last Monday the stock went up 70 points during trading hours (350) presplit that is unheard of, most people should have assumed there would be a slight pull back if nothing else just some consolidation. Panic selling is also a problem with this stock, if you are a shareholder and not using margin you don't need to worry the stock will recover from these little dips.\n\n**5) Do the opposite of whatever the mainstream media declares about $TSLA**\n\nThis rule is a little old, It comes from a time when everyone was bashing on TSLA, but basically the news exists to sell advertising, and when they aren't doing that they have an agenda. Back then, the powers that be were making tons of FUD about TSLA, so it was imperative that you ignore what they were saying and in that case invert what they were telling you, They say sell probably a good time to buy. This rule may become more useful in the coming days as I feel the FUD is ramping up again.\n\n**6) Don't compare $TSLA to bitcoin**\n\nBitcoin is worth whatever people think it is worth it does not provide any value. Tesla produces a lot and will produce much more in the future, and the stock reflects that. People might be paying more than fundamentally worth but as long as the future continues to pan out as it is looking to then the shares should continue to appreciate.\n\n**7) Buy low, Don't sell, well ok if you have to, sell high (stock price)**\n\nPretty straight forward, if you need to sell to deleverage, buy a house, etc. that\u2019s fine, but are you selling because you think the stock price is high, it \"was a bubble at 800 bubble at 1500, bubble at 2000, bubble at 2500\", just because you think its high it can always go higher, besides what are you going to invest in if not TSLA, GLD?\n\n\n**8) If someone claims to be a bull, but their posts don't align, you know whats up**\n\nMany people would post in the subreddit and they always looked the same. \"I'm Elon's biggest fan, [insert FUD]\". \"I'm the biggest bull on TSLA, [Insert FUD]\" basically it is a warning that if a person has a disclaimer, they might not be genuine.\n\n**9) After-hours on TSLA is for chumps, pay no mind to after-hours (Only applies to down-movement)**\n\nExtended hours trading trades on low volume, options market is not available. The real action is during standard trading day.\n\n**10) If this is your first post on TIC, you have to buy stock**\n\nAnother fight club joke, but probably good advice, you need some skin in the game to have a real opinion IMO.\n\n**11) Don't use a stop loss on $TSLA**\n\nWhen you enter a stop loss its registered in the system the brokerages can see where its placed, and TSLA is very volatile, so there have been historically swings that can shoot the stock down trigger stop losses and then extreme buying pressure comes in and blows out the stock. Now you are out of stock, sold low, and will have trouble getting in. Also, many people putting in stop loses exacerbates sell offs creating avalanches on the tiniest little downtick.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "The problem with rule #1 is: by talking to F&F (as long as they are good at debating), you can learn more info about Tesla.
