You've probably heard of FANG (or FANGMAN), which are the stocks making up over 30% of the market in Facebook, Apple, NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix. There's talks of them breaking up some of the groups to have a \"one-vision\" business and not be able to use their monopoly-like hold to branch into things like AI, healthcare, safer food processing/delivery...you know, things that would help the pandemic but are hurting the other billionaire's buddies in the Senate or House that have/invest in smaller business that are hurt by that. They aren't going anywhere, although they are volatile, all have grown, and grown, and grown. It's an aggressive approach , but that's where you want to diversify. Have some tech, some healthcare, some entertainment, and consumer type stocks that have solid backgrounds, and either good value or growth.\n\nIn fact, think about the state the world will be in for the next couple years. Healthcare, energy, and food will never go away, so look at solid stocks in those markets (what type of energy might change depending on the election, so I'd hold off on that). Invest in some healthcare stocks for the vaccine (can't really go wrong with Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson as they make a lot more than just a hopefully available soon vaccine), Zoom (ZM) has changed the way we do business and companies have seen how much it saves time/money/effort in the marketplace, so anything that makes remote access for people easier will do well.\n\nI'm gonna provide two link that'll keep you busy for days/weeks and you'll come out with every question you have answered for the most part.\n\n[https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/overview](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/overview) \\- teaches you literally everything about the market.\n\n[https://finviz.com/](https://finviz.com/) \\- a great site, especially the maps section, gives you an idea about how stocks/ETFs have done over the past day-year, with filters able to be set to see relative volume to % gain, etc.\n\nGood luck!

So even bad days on the market can be buying opportunities. Also, historically, tomorrow is the best day in the S&P 500 of the year, and the 8 days leading up to the election HISTORICALLY have been great, usually because we know who's going to win, this year, not so much with that plus COVID.\n\nAgain, good luck and may you get rich or die trying (except the die part)!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would put some in AMD since they just had a big merger and will beat earnings and you'll have a little dip to buy.
