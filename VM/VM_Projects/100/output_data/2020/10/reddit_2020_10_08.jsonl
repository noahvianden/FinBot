The parent comment was saying he has an option contract to have the right to buy AMD shares at $90 each, no later than tomorrow (10/9).  If the market price of AMD goes above 90, that options contract has inherent value since it can be used to buy shares for below market cost.\n\nBut since AMD stock dropped after the announcement, it doesn't look like it's going to hit 90 today or tomorrow and therefore this guy's contract will probably expire worthless, meaning he'll be out the money he spent on the contract itself.  He'd be in a better position if he bought a $90 contract expiring 10/16, since the contract would still have time on it for the stock rising over the next week, but that would have cost him more money up front.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Do you have a good place to read up on that further?
