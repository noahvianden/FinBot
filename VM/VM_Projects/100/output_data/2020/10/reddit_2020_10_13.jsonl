{"title": "Why I'm Ridiculously Bullish on Palantir ($PLTR)", "selftext": "As somebody who works in an organization that does work incredibly similarly to Palantir (data science, analytics, and management for organizations), I'd like to share my perspective on why I think PLTR is a future 10-bagger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What does Palantir do?\n\nIn a nutshell, what Palantir does is data science, management, and analytics in big data. They started off working with government agencies, while recently expanding to non-governing entities. As a technology, this is invaluable to both organizations and private/public companies. Most every organization collects data (obviously, right?)\n\nOne of the many types of organizations that I've personally worked on are correctional facilities (e.g. - a prison). Prisons collect **fuck loads** of *your information*. For example:\n\n*Demographics & characteristics*: height, eye color, race, age, number of family members, married vs. non married, education level, aliases (names you go by), mental illnesses, current and past places of residences, who you work for, how long you've worked for them, etc.\n\n*Criminal History:*  current and past offenses, where the offense was committed, against whom the offense was committed (and the same above information for the victim), the sentencing judge, how long you were sentenced for, when you are to be released, etc.\n\n*Prison Behavior:*  did you get in trouble in prison, how was it handled, by which CO handled the situation, did you lose credit for good time, take college courses/classes in prison, how much money do you have in the commisary? what do you spend it on?\n\n*Other stuff:*  weather, recent institutional policy/procedure changes, changes in legislation/law, and other random shit that seems unrelated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above examples are only a fraction of the data that say, a prison were to collect from you. Like i said, they collect **fuck loads of data.** They also store fuck loads of data over large periods of time.\n\n# Everyone collects tons of data. So what?\n\nWhile yes, most if not all organizations collect crap loads of data, a lot of times are just for record keeping purposes. A lot of organizations analyse their data, but use sub-standard and less advanced methods across few areas of data because of the limitations of the data: data linkages, definition of a case, unstandard formatting, etc.\n\nMost organizations that collect their data also do a **garbage** job doing it. Sometimes, using conventional techniques on garbage data gets you zero inferential value (i.e. what decisions should be made from the data). I can't tell you how many times i've worked with data that looks like it was done by a boomer who never took a class on BASIC excel. you would think most orgs/companies know how to collect/work with data, but many don't!\n\nMost organizations also dont LINK their data across different areas or within themselves. Different data are usually seperate and independent from each other, and within like data they don't keep track of what record belong together. While it would be helpful to keep all this data in the same place, for organization purposes they keep things seperate - except this also makes it harder to piece them together if they wanted to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Here's where PLTR comes in.\n\nPLTR essentially wants to interconnect **all** the data sources that were collected by an organization, and use big data analytics, machine learning, and algorithms to help drive decisions. By using machine learning and algorithms, you can link together data to >99% accuracy levels.\n\nNow that you've linked data sources and streamlined them across and within each other, you can explore with greater accuracy/clarity/statistical power, questions such as: how has global warming over time affected purchasing behaviors for automobiles.\n\nHowever, with more pieces information across databases, as well as information over time, you now can link different (maybe unrelated, maybe not) pieces of information to that question to account for any spurious (unrelated) correlations (such as, for instance, the majority political party at the time), to be able to say whether or not a correlation is ***causative***\\*.\\* Causative means that we can say, with confidence, one thing affects the outcome of another thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What does this mean?\n\nNow that a company/organization has all of their data sources being constantly linked together (presently and over time), is standardized, an is being programatically driven by machine learning, PLTR's software can say with certainty: \"we know we need to do X thing to produce more tendies,\" or \"we know we need to do X thing to arrest more people,\" or \"we need to do x thing to save more tendies.\"\n\nHaving a resource that simplifies what decisions around profit, efficency, is bullish AF for any company that would choose to use it, and in turn is bullish AF for Palantir. PLTR is going to tap into an un-tapped market that isn't doing this with their data already (so i'm not talking about AAPL, GOOGLE), but the medium sized and smaller sized corporations in the country that are **absolutely not doing this with their data.**\n\nIt also can tap into the tens of thousands of government agencies (state, county, local) that are in my professional experience, are **not doing this with their data.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe market for the technology is huge and are the implications. I'm all in on PLTR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 1/2022 10C\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: yikes, a lot of hate on this threat. we get it, you have puts.", "id": "ja2ocr", "created_utc": 1602547614.0, "score": 196, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "Selling covered calls has done me pretty damn well so far.

As a Software Engineer myself, I've never seen such an initiative succeeding, even between departments in one existing company. Therefore, I believe that it's difficult to achieve either in one single client or even more difficult between different clients. However, if the software has defined input APIs and runs in a \"consulting\" model at start, this would enable the consultants to develop middleware that captures the right data and integrates them into the system.
