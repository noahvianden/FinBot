It's now sitting at 59% up from its 2012 price\n\n**Bank of America (BAC)** \\- It grew quite a bit for a while but it hasn't fully recovered from COVID yet.

It is now up 900% the value it was in 2012\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** \\- It took a few years but eventually had a run-up over 3400%. AMD, everyone.

The tech bubble stock holder may or may not turn into a bag holder, but he/she is counting on a very simple formula that assumes future growth to support their future-looking buy-and-hold mentality. Because of the way the country is being run, that growth might not arrive. \n\n[This is a really good article out today that explains what's going on with the Republican-owned senate when it ignores the need for a large and comprehensive stimulus package](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-14/trump-s-grip-on-senate-republicans-slipping-with-stimulus-ploy?srnd=premium&sref=GOn3bpWn), whicih the fed & other economists have been publicly explaining is essential. Their behavior over the stimulus package, which is to basically stonewall it for months now, signals their planned strategy going forward as being fiscal obstructionists in the same way they were during Obama's presidency. They only react to criticism about that when the stock market starts to tank too badly.\n\nThe GOP senate has been writing off Donald Trump and have turned their backs on him and are bracing themselves for being an obstructive and no-saying obstacle to Joe Biden. This has been so obvious in their stonewalling of an essential relief package for months now. They have already started repositioning themselves as the Party of No, and, after all the wild tax cuts for rich people and giveaways to red state business stakeholders in the last 4 years, will be claiming they're 100% behind low spending and not running up the federal deficit.\n\nIf the GOP senate has already entered the mentality of the Party of No that will approve no stimulus and starve a Democratic president of the ability to move any legislation, approve supreme court judges and create any benefits during their presidency, in the same way that they obstructed Barak Obama for 6 years after taking the senate in 2010, we are looking at very hard times ahead as investors.\n\nIn other words, we can't expect growth, but a return to a starving economy and increasing inequality as the GOP plays the long game and intends to starve the country to shut down a democratic led White House. Read the article, because that's how they operate. While it's wildly successful politically at keeping high discontent levels vs. democrats in the WH since Bill Clinton's day, that strategy also implies we can expect little or no stimulus and all kinds of other growth-choking antics from the GOP senate. Unfortunately, with the current coronavirus economy problems, that kind of fiscal management will likely put is unto a long austerity-created pandemic recession that is oddly coupled with propping up investment assets from the fed and treasury firehosing money at investors and banks.\n\nThe stock market and economy is about to change significantly into something like Japan's lost decades dominated by zombie companies and possibly even actual decline. \n\nThe only way to expect the kind of generic growth your story relies upon, if something changes the path our government is on. The pandemic has exposed how incapable the US is of managing its business because it's become too gripped by paralyzing infighting between political parties and insiders. The GOP was only using Donald Trump as a head-fake into a pretense that they want to change how things are done, and they are moving ahead with plans to go forward without him, and they have stopped listening to him whether or not he wins the election.\n\nBecause we happen to be very dependent on fiscal leadership for economic recovery at this time, and have gotten to the point where central bank policy can't do any more, the only way this dynamic will change is if the GOP senate is trounced in the election and the Democrats win a majority. That will change the course our economy is on *whether or not Trump wins the election*, because the GOP senate is running things now and barely acknowledging him. \n\nThe real contest, for investors who want actual economic growth and not just wealth for the wealthy, and people and businesses whose survival depends on good fiscal leadership in the next 2 years, is whether or not the GOP maintains is grip on the senate after the election. \n\nLook at Warren Buffet's current portfolio.

A lot of people who still had their jobs do pretty well in the previous crashes.\n\nI don't know what their motives are. I only know they're saying that there's been enough relief and they have raised some arguments against the bill because they think the hardest hit regions are big cities where Democrats have their bases and blue coastal states where the population density is high and they feel they would be giving money to Democrats' base voters and they don't want to spend money on that. And they want cities to stay open and not go back into lockdowns because they want the economy open and businesses making money. If government provide stimulus, it might make it easier for more lockdowns to happen this Winter.\n\nThey have also been against more unemployment assistance as they say that it's making it easy for people to avoid going back to work.\n\n> Republicans have been wary of Democrats' desire to keep $600 of weekly unemployment assistance in the next package, arguing it disincentivizes people from returning to work. Some Republicans want to scrap the federal unemployment assistance altogether, while others want a smaller sum that would ensure that people would not be making more in unemployment than they did in their previous wages, which was widespread when the job market cratered.\n\n> Then there's the \"blue state bailout\" argument, championed by McConnell and Trump, who are hesitant to aid state and local governments suffering budget shortfalls because the pandemic depleted sales tax revenue and other sources quite hard. Prominent Democratic governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York have made the point that states like his actually offer more in federal tax revenue than they receive.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/why-republicans-havent-passed-a-new-covid-19-stimulus-bill-2020-10\n\nI think their arguments have some merit, in that those things are true.

Only difference is that we're not going to brag about it because it's not something you brag about.\n\nPersonally, I made loads of money on Southern Co, Leggett and Platt, Herman Miller, Abbvie, and Blackstone (yes it's possible to make alot on \"boring\" stocks) as well as Netflix and Amazon. But just because I more than doubled my money on Amazon does not mean I go recommending it to people - that would be downright stupid at a >$3000 entry point.

He wants to buy today and sell by this weekend for short gains.  I\u2019m not just recommending Tesla because I\u2019ve gotten ridiculous gains from it, I\u2019m recommending it because it fits his specific needs.  It has a specific short-term catalyst which I am confident based on its history will propel the stock upwards through the end of the week and into next week.  I also recommended selling no later than the 20th because the stock is inherently volatile and likely will come back down after the 20th.  It was good, sound advice tailored to the OP\u2019s specific needs.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need to worry about dividends, PE ratios, or market caps when he just wants to hold for four days and cash out.  The stock won\u2019t put him in debt for years just because he bought and held for four days during a week leading up into what\u2019s expected to be a very strong quarterly report.  If he\u2019d asked for a long term hold I\u2019d probably would have suggested something else.\n\nNow, we have a red day but my Tesla is still up over 3%, and over $450 for the first time since before the split.  The only stock in my portfolio doing (surprisingly) better is Hyliion, which I wouldn\u2019t recommend to my dog for short-term gains.\n\nI think I gave a well-thought and well-reasoned suggestion tailored to the OP\u2019s request, absolutely appropriate for the topic at hand.  All you\u2019ve done is trash Tesla and my trading abilities (which you know nothing about).  YOU are the reason this forum is going downhill, not me.

Let's imagine we are generating 40% clean energy and the rest is fossil fuels (I don't know the actual number, but just an example) at the moment and it would be enough to charge all our EVs. That would mean an EV would be charged 40% renewably. Now let's say we adopt hydrogen instead of EVs, suddenly we need 2,5x the energy to charge these vehicles. The only way to scale up energy production immediately is by burning more fossil fuels, so 3/5th of the energy required to charge hydrogen will be done solely with fossil fuels, while 60% of the other 2/5th will be charged by fossil fuels. That means hydrogen would be fueled 84% by fossil fuels where EVs would be only at 60%.\n\nObviously the actual numbers would differ, but you can see how big a difference it would make and how much it would delay our transition to 100% renewable energy.\n\n> Also lets not pretend that EVs are 100% clean if we have 100% renewable energy. Batteries are made out of finite materials. Mining those materials devastates the environment. We are both going to exhaust natural materials while devastate the environment from mining the same way we do with coal.\n\nThis is simply not true. It is possible to mine battery materials sustainably and Tesla is pushing hard to get this done. On top of that, unlike with things like plastic, it's cheaper to recycle batteries than to mine for new ones, so in due time new batteries can largely be made from existing batteries as Tesla demonstrated at Battery Day. Long term EV batteries can have close to no impact on the environment.\n\n> Even in the 1920s electric cars were more efficient than gasoline cars. Again, a certain company had so much influence that it swayed the entire industry.\n\nThat's entirely besides the point. We didn't have an issue like climate change to solve at the time, so no matter how hard influential companies may push for hydrogen, if EVs are more effective at combating climate change, at least for the next few decades - which they are - people and governments will demand EVs.\n\n> The reason why you think you're right is predicated on biases.\n\nActually it's the reverse. Yes I'm following Tesla and have a few shares, but it's a result of me investigating EVs, HFC and renewable energy in general, not the other way around.\n\n> This means you have a vested interest in them succeeding so when Musk said he doesn't rate HFC, his supporters follow suit. Nothing wrong with that, just realize that it's a factor.\n\nAgain I would argue the reverse, as an investor I have a vested interest in finding out reasons why the company might not succeed to prevent myself from losing money. Also, I didn't know Musk disapproves of HFC, but I have been against it since I researched it back in July 2018 (which I know because it started with me watching a video about it on YouTube).\n\n> As for me, this is a long game. I realize that the world only has a finite resources. But water is everywhere and the waste produced by HFC is water. That's renewable.\n\nThis I do agree with, which is why I do think outside of some practical aspects (refuelling is annoying, given sufficient infrastructure it's much easier to just have a fully charged EV infront of your house every morning, and maintenance and performance of EVs are better/more comfortable) hydrogen is the most sustainable solution available. Perhaps we will transition to it by the time we can generate 100% of our energy sustainably and in an ideal world we would've started transitioning to it 50 years ago when we weren't at the point yet where we needed to stop CO2 emissions as fast as possible, and could've skipped over EVs entirely.\n\n> Once you toss a lithium ion battery or any other kind of batteries, that's that.\n\nIf you toss a lithium ion battery you're a fool. This doesn't happen in any real world situation.\n\n> Even when you do recycle them, it is incredibly energy intensive.\n\nThat's relative, it's still only a fraction of the energy required to charge the cars over their life cycle so it doesn't nearly come close to the added energy required for hydrogen cars. On top of that it's cheaper than mining for new batteries like I said, so it drives the cost of the cars down.\n\n> In Asia there's a push for HFC. There are plans for solar powered electrolysis plants which would make HFC carbon neutral.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is great if we can do it alongside moving towards EVs. It just shouldn't be done at the cost of moving to EVs, which is usually the case. That money probably would've been better spend promoting EVs.\n\n> P.S. I love Tesla but that doesn't mean their strategy is the only solution to our problems.

If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated in my mom's basement. I will continue to shit and cum until you improve your conduct.
