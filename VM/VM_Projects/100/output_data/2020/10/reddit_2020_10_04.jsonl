Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.\n\nMake no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, \"Who killed the electric car?\" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).\n\nNow, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "j50qqy", "created_utc": 1601825314.0, "score": 655, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 175, "replies": [{"body": ">because they have to so they can look like they care,\n\nI doubt that.

My Tesla can take me clear across the country if I wanted to.  \"Range\" is not an issue.  Are you talking about on a single charge?  That's not really as important as you think.  Range on a full charge or full tank of gas is somewhat arbitrary after a certain point (usually defined by the size of the passenger's bladder).\n\nThe important metric is total trip time, or if you prefer, refueling overhead (if any), and this will vary from person to person based on their driving style and endurance.  And I will make the argument that for many people (although not all), even a 300 mile Tesla imparts no additional total travel time than a gas vehicle.  My in-laws live 800 miles away and we do the return trip in one day.  It's 12.5 hours of active driving.  With stops, it usually takes us 14 to 15 hours altogether (whether gas or electric).  What we've found is that since getting a Tesla, our total trip time has FALLEN!  (part of this may be pandemic-related) and the car itself only needed 58 minutes of charging time altogether on our last trip.  So for us, there is zero impact to the fact that our Tesla has a \"range\" of 100 miles less than a typical gas car.  I'm sure there are those that will insist that they ever ONLY stop for 5 minutes at a time every 5-6 hours while on a road trip.  Fine...for them they can ignore all the other benefits of an EV year-round and save themselves 30-45 minutes on an all day road trip once or twice a year.

What I **am** saying, is that rather than focusing just on pure range, the more important metric is should be impact to travel time (or just total travel time).  Range alone is meaningless if you have to stop more frequently than your car needs to anyway.  For those that can travel longer distances between stops and take shorter stops when they do, ultimately it's the total impact to travel time that's important, not the actual range.  If you hypothetically had an EV that could charge in 2 minutes (or maybe do a battery swap) but the range was only 250 miles, it's still going to take the same amount of time to get from NY to LA as it would in a gas car that had 500 mile of range by took 4 minutes to fill up, or an EV that had a 500 mile range and took 4 minutes to charge.\n\nYes, it's a fair criticism of EVs to say that recharge times are longer (certainly there is no such thing as a 2 minute recharge!) and that is more the reason why they may not work for everyone today.  But it's not the range itself.\n\nThe **one** case where range is important is a trip just barely outside the range of a typical EV, but within the range of a gas car.  But these tend to be highly contrived scenarios, and not only that, because of the fact that most EV trips start out with the battery at 100% and gas cars start out a trip with less than a full tank, the EV sometimes even has an advantage.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, infrastructure is just another element to the ultimate metric, which again, ends up being total travel time.

Range of the vehicle, convenience of the refueling/recharging stops, length of the refueling/recharging stops, etc...none of that really matters any more than the bottom line, which is how long did it take to complete the trip, including ALL stops that someone may make.\n\nI openly acknowledge that there are travelers out there for whom an EV is going to be an inferior mode of transport.  I don't pretend that available charging stations are plentiful, convenient, or that charging times are sufficiently short for everyone, or that the range of EVs is up to par with how far you can drive on a tank of gas.\n\nWhat I AM saying is that none of that matters one iota if your personal travel pattern means you are going to be stopping every 3 hours anyway and the length of your stop to pee, check your phone, and grab a bite to eat allows you to get sufficient charge to make it to your next stop, thus making your total trip time the same as it would be in a gas car.  If your personal travel pattern means that you end up having to stop more frequently than you would have otherwise, and/or for longer amounts of time, then the combination of range, recharge speed, and convenience of charging stations DOES matter.

You even said it yourself... they were \u201cplaying with electric cars.\u201d They were just tech demos and ways to help meet legislative requirements. For example, Chevy never even sold the EV1. They leased a VERY small number of them in only a few select cities, and after a few years, they killed the program. Without Tesla, I think EVs would still become mainstream eventually (although it\u2019s not a given), but it would probably take 20 or 30 years longer than it will now that Tesla has lit a fire under everyone. EVs were progressing at an absolute snail\u2019s pace before Tesla. For the first 7 years after Nissan released the Leaf, it had under 100 miles of range and there were hardly any improvements to it. They didn\u2019t start improving it and upping the range until a few years ago when Tesla came out with the Model 3, and even the current model Leaf is still well behind the Model 3 in range.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I never said playing with electric cars, so I'm confused why you're quoting me that I did. \n\nRegardless, we are discussing what op said.
