The point is that with a normal big TV antenna you have to mechanically point it towards your target to receive a signal. You can see in the gif that the direction of the signal changes depending on how the phase between the smaller antennas are offset. \n\nThis phase offset you can easily do electronically so it can be changed hundred or millions of times per second to point the antenna exactly where you want it without having any actual mechanical movement. \n\nThe reason you need this is because regular TV satellites are up in geostationary orbit and don't move relative to the Earth, they're always in the exact same spot on the sky. You just point your antenna exactly at it, and bom you're done. Starlink satellites will be flying in a 300 km orbit and zooming around Earth every 90-ish minutes. There's also going to be like 42,000 of them.

He called our attention to Logitech, and he got completely flamed for it with people saying all of their growth was priced-in. After looking at the chart for 30 seconds, you can see that it has done well, but it wasn\u2019t an insane run-up given the need for home offices to get set-up, people gaming more with better equipment, etc.\n\nWhen I see an idea like this and I don\u2019t have much time, I set a reasonable position size and go in. I put about 8%-10% of my one account in figuring a good beat would be a boost, and a loss/IV crush would not be devastating. This thing has been bouncing around, but one strike for me was up over 600% at open. See below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uyffz9e6au51.png?width=215&format=png&auto=webp&s=542d92bd6e86707b57b7eb783daf87ce3f232944\n\nI have had a couple of huge beats like this, and they are not the same crazy popular tickers that everyone is talking about. MLHR was another 5-6 bagger for me (thank you to u/jippiidan who WSB also torched and called a pumper). My best trade was a 27 bagger and that was\u2026TSLA\u2026 but I digress. To go back to the Scott Galloway quote at the beginning of the post, yes, there is a lot of money to be made going into these hyper popular tech tickers that are already flying, but you should also look at the DD\u2019s about companies that are so mind-numbingly boring and ask yourself if there is an opportunity there. In this market, there just might be one.\n\n**One note of caution:** A lot of the boring ones are low liquidity. So, don\u2019t buy something crazy OTM, and make sure there is some OI. You are buying a strike that you believe you will break end up above. These are relatively cheaper though because of lower IV usually.\n\n**TLDR:** Buy into boring tickers that you think can surprise everyone.\n\nBoring Positions:\n\n**LOGI** Nov Calls 500-600% up. Holding 2/3 of them in case shorts cover.\n\n**TCS** Nov 10C up over 30% (This one is boring and I am holding through earnings, but it started flying as I was typing it. I think it may beat in a way that isn\u2019t priced in, but I would put less than 5% of my account in to hold through if I was entering now.)\n\n**CROX** Nov 55C up close to 40% today.\n\nI also have Tesla, Baba, and other tickers that make us cry both tears of joy and sadness before anyone thinks I\u2019m a total whacko.\n\n**What boring tickers do you think will run and why?**", "id": "jetnak", "created_utc": 1603213203.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "Good post.
