{"title": "I Jelq AAPL for a living", "selftext": "My intuition told me about this subreddit the other day and I couldn't believe it. I took a look last night, you guys are fucking crazy but I love it. It's easy for any professional jelqer to say that you guys are idiots but I respect what you do, so no hate on my end (see how I called myself a professional and you guys idiots while pretending to compliment you? I\u2019m a master at the backhanded jelq). Jelqing is calculated gambling at the end of the day anyway. Compared to you guys, I'm basically a stock trader but damn good at it (I like to compliment myself because no one else does, they tell me my penis is average). AAPL is my jelq king.\n\nI'm a swinger on the 15min chart and 5min, just depends on the action. I obviously don't extend every trade but I shoot large profits squeezed over 1-3 inches so losses don't matter. Willing to help any newbs sometimes and show you what my targets are on certain days when I see good stretches.\n\nCurrent:\n\nLast 2 stretches got taken out at breakeven (told you I\u2019m damn good). Waiting for trades to setup. So far I don't see anything that I like (I\u2019m the best, always find good trades and when I don\u2019t, losses don\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve lost so much money at this point, but when you don\u2019t care, they don\u2019t matter). With what happened today, I'm looking to see if the length dips below 119.02 or 118.14 millimeters sometime in the next couple of days and looking to elongate if the right setup happens.
