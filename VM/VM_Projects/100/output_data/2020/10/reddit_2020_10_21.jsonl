That\u2019s called \u201cCard Services\u201d, and they work with consumers to issue them cards. When they get a request from a card network to approve a charge made on a Chase issued credit card, they look at your account and then do so.\n\nA **completely separate **division at Chase handles merchant services. One of the products they offer to merchants is as a credit card processor. Many, many, many companies use that division at Chase to handle their credit card swipes. This is for ALL cards, no matter the issuing bank. This software does not shortcut the MC/VISA/Discover/AmEX networks even if it\u2019s a Chase issued-card. They treat those cards the same as any other and pass the information on to the proper card network.\n\nSquare made a deal with Chase to white label their merchant card services. They provide a \u201cSquare\u201d branded product, but it uses Chase\u2019s merchant services credit card processing system on the backend.

I am a bit confused by merchant card processor company term. Who are these companies and how to they make money?\n\nI use my Chase Visa Credit card most of the time.

Then Chase Merchant Services sends the money from all the transactions back to Square and Square distributes the funds to its merchants. Square is technically the merchant or record with Chase Merchant Services. \nChase in the past really only wanted to deal with very large merchants, so Square aggregated thousands of other merchants to basically become one very large one in Chase's view.

When a VISA swipes, you know that it travels on VISA\u2019s network to the customer\u2019s bank and asks for approval of the purchase. \n\nBut how do you as a popcorn seller actually get a credit card swipe onto VISA\u2019s network and not accidentally onto AMEX\u2019s network? And once the purchase is approved, how do you actually get your money? I mean, who actually pays you, every single bank that every customer uses? What if the customer does a chargeback or disputes the charge? How will you handle refunds?\n\nThat\u2019s what a merchant card processor is for. They build the hardware to read the cards. They write the software behind that hardware to handle the card swipe, the software that talks to VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and AMEX\u2019s networks. They handle chargebacks. Their software handles recurring payments. Most importantly, at the end of each month they write you a check for all the charges you made (these days it\u2019s just a bank deposit, but you get the drift)\n\nSquare built their own hardware, the first big company to make card swipes accessible on every smart phone so any merchant could easily charge credit cards. They wrote smartphone software. They gave millions of free Square hardware out so everyone would use them. But what about the rest of the things a \u201cmerchant acquirer\u201d needs to do? Did they want to try and write software to connect to all the various card networks? Did they want to have to handle all the money and talk to every bank on the planet? There was no time to build all that massive infrastructure, so for backend banking portion of things they made a deal with Chase\n\nEdit - the other comment someone made, explaining how Square aggregates small companies and makes it worth it for a big bank like Chase to work with a million tiny 1-person companies is 100% spot-on", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great explanation.

{"title": "What are the plays if Biden/Trump win in Nov?", "selftext": "Seems to me if Biden wins market will experience a short term correction due to the market pricing in upcoming corporate tax increases, regulations, etc, etc. Also Biden admin will be bad for big tech because Democrats in Congress are more aggressive towards anti-trust/regulating big tech than Republicans.\n\nAlso this is based more on a conditional, but if Biden wins how will Trump react/could cause some sort of legal battle that will go to the SC and will make the market uncomfortable. Also this may cause the stimulus to be pushed back even further if everyone is too busy arguing over who won the election.\n\nIf Trump wins however I suspect market will go up. Even though DOJ is suing Google over anti-trust under Trump (I suspect the DOJ would stick to this even if Biden were to become President and new Attorney General), the Republican Congress is not as aggressive towards regulating big tech (they only seem to care about perceived anti conservative bias in the algorithms and mods) and don't seem to be in favor of breaking up big tech.\n\nSome leftists/young people will get mad and protest/maybe some riots here and there for a little bit. However the Congress can acknowledge Trump will be President for another 4 years and pass the stimulus.\n\nTLDR: If Trump wins -> Good for SPY in the short term, good for big tech short term and long term\n\nIf Biden wins -> Bad for SPY in the short term (in the long term however Biden admin could be good since stocks did well under Obama), bad for big tech both short term and long term, good for solar/wind companies.

{"title": "$TSLA Pre-Earnings Prayer Session. Free DD inside.", "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nAs many of you fine gentlemen know, Tesla is releasing Q3 earnings report after hours today at 2:30 PM PST / 5:30 PM EST. It is going to be a bloodbath. Some say Tesla is heading past the moon and skyrocketing to uranus, which is very familiar territory. Others say its already gone parabolic and will drop harder than when your dad dropped you as a child. Whether Tesla flies or dies, I do not know. I am not a prophet.\n\nHowever, I do know this. Last month, I spent my life savings on Tesla calls for Battery day. Battery day shit the bed and I ended up sucking dick behind the Wendy\u2019s dumpster. Now I\u2019m back with a vengeance and a bit of dried cum on my face.\n\nAfter having balls on my chin, I see life from a different perspective. It\u2019s time I go gay for pay. Tesla puts all the way. I scraped together some cash from my extratesticular activities and purchased TSLA 420p 10/30. Time to pray.\n\nI pray for your options and mine. May we both enter the promised land of Wendy\u2019s as customers and not employees. May we one day get our dicks sucked and not be sucking dick all our days. Blessed be thy tendies, may they be as soft as the ballsacks resting on my chin.
