It's also odd in that you compare three funds, and end up recommending that people should look at a fund (PBD) you didn't describe.\n\nAs a counterpoint to those YOLO-ing into clean energy ETFs, be careful here. I invest in clean energy myself because I believe it's the future of energy, but I only set aside an extremely small (less than 1%) of my portfolio to it.\n\nYou're buying small, non-diversified funds that have extreme exposure to sector risk. For clean energy that includes things like:\n\n* Tariffs on solar and other electronics\n* Government subsidies and tax credits\n* Municipal and government investments\n* Politics at all levels (government, state, local)\n* Access to materials (such as rare earths)\n* Weather/climate\n\nMany, if not most, renewable development ultimately comes from the government (state and federal), and much of development is driven by clean energy standards. It goes way beyond people installing solar panels on their roofs.\n\nMost of the growth from these ETFs have come in the last year. These ETFs have period boom and bust years. Here's the last 10 years of ICLN:\n\n| Year | Return  |\n| ---- | ------- |\n| 2010 | -27.48% |\n| 2011 | -43.96% |\n| 2012 | -12.82% |\n| 2013 | 49.10%  |\n| 2014 | -4.78%  |\n| 2015 | 3.82%   |\n| 2016 | -16.91% |\n| 2017 | 21.48%  |\n| 2018 | -9.02%  |\n| 2019 | 44.35%  |\n\nRecency bias is investing in something because of recent outperformance. Would you have bought ICLN at its lowest in 2012? In 2016?\n\nWhat makes me bullish about renewable energy is that we'll require a huge build-out and conversion to renewable energy at all levels of society, and that as long as this process is happening, these companies will do well. But we may also face a cliff where renewable becomes more commoditized, and no longer a growth industry, as \"renewable energy\" just becomes \"energy\". In most countries, we're nowhere near this point, however.\n\nFinal thought: We could also do with a better-diversified clean energy ETF. These current ETFs are too small and arguably too expensive.\n\nAlso, for those unsure of whether to go in on clean energy in their portfolio, remember that total stock market funds (such as VTI for US equity and VXUS for international) also give you some exposure to clean energy.", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, this opens my eyes when looking at past data in regards of law of large numbers that \"yes, in 2019 it was incredibly successful, but looking at that previous year..\" \n\nI believe that's what has been driving clean energy sector in last month (after short pullback in early September) when Biden-Harris outlook is more outperforming than one in WH as well as Senate/House. \n\nThis politics is something we wont be able to know until the election date, so I have small position on clean energy sector, but I am putting more in when Biden-Harris win for sure.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "If you're worried about the election outcome, you can use a [trailing stop sell order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingstop.asp) to lock in gains and avoid losses.

The fund managers don't manually decide what goes in. The fund follows the S&P Global Clean Energy Index, which tracks the top 30 or so clean energy companies weighted by market cap. You can read about the index methodology [here](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-thematic-indices.pdf?force_download=true). In short, a committee screens stocks from the global index (actually, just developed markets) by whether they can be classified as clean energy, then applies some screening filters. Each weight is capped to 4.5%. Since this is partly based on absolute criteria but also partly by committee, the index isn't passively constructed, but it is also not manually managed like the S&P 500.\n\nNow, if something goes south with one company, what will happen is that the stock will first drop in value, which reduces the value of the whole fund. The next time the index reconstitutes, the weight of that stock will be reduced to match its new market cap. If the stock no longer meets the criteria (e.g. the minimum of $300m in total market cap), then it likely will drop out of the index and then out of the fund. Meanwhile, a different stock that qualifies to be included may be slotted in to replace the other stock.\n\nWhat could happen is that the solar market as a whole drops. It's happened at several points in the life of ICLN. The whole fund may collapse, in fact.
