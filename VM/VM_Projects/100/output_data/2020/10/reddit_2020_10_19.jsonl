Valuations on reopening stocks like the ones you listed (also airlines, cruise lines, Six Flags/Cedar Point, oil stocks, many REITs, even some financials and insurance - all of which are my personal take, not specified in the article) are rock bottom right now and not likely to suffer as much in the even of such a correction. \n\nAs someone who jumped into retail investing to buy the dip, and watched my portfolio spike by 45% the first week of June (more than $75K), only to lose all those gains the following week, I feel like my take is fairly solid: \n\n**Pros**: the value is there, and there are certainly significant gains to be had. I watched the proof of concept in my own portfolio. \n\n**Cons**: What kind of gains, and what kind of timeline, are anyone's guess. Without getting political, I'll consider it safe to say the national COVID response will be more coherent if current polling plays out, but what exactly that means for stocks, the post-COVID economy, and the extent to which the gains return are very much up in the air as a wild card. I lost some good money waiting on OXY and a couple smaller-cap longshots to come around, but IVZ and RWT have paid off for me throughout the pandemic and are likely poised to benefit disproportionately whenever reopening finally gets into full swing. \n\n**Remember time value of money**: time your money spends waiting on the reopening to come to fruition is time it's spending not invested in something that grows in the meantime. Tech will likely also take a hit once the world feels comfortable crowding into public spaces again, so it's by no means a magic carpet ride in the meantime. \n\n**Other options to consider**: If you go with the reopening plays, consider diversifying with something that you think will grow regardless of COVID status. Clean energy has done well recently and certainly has a future. Certain materials and industrials will remain regardless of the pandemic. The FAANG+ plays are not likely to outpace the market in the next six months the same way they did in the last six months, so do some diligence and see where else you think you may want to branch out, but consider allocating part of your portfolio away from the reopening plays for the balance. \n\nOr, you know, scared money doesn't make money, go big or go home, etc. Only you know your risk tolerance.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[Here's a thread from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jdrihy/investing_in_clean_energy_index_funds/) about clean energy ETFs.

First, this opens the idea that people can't cooperate and that investing and all profiteering is a zero-sum game which just isn't true. Let's say I buy a stock at 1 and sell to you at 2 because my goal, that is right, my GOAL, was to double my money, I won, but you bought at 2 and rode it to 4 and also doubled, and guess what? I'm not mad. I don't think you're an idiot or a loser nor are my gains your losses or you gains my losses. We both got what we wanted. That is the real goal of trading.\n\nThe cutthroat, hardcore, buy at the bottom, sell at the top, mindless greed game is silly and unrealistic. No one does that. We all win when we all win; those of use sell the options for instance get the premium while those who buy may be either selling them on to an end user who ultimately just gets the peace of mind who is using it as insurance.

It just isn't true.

I've tried the other way, doing the math, staring at figures, analyzing things until my eyes bled, and all it won me was sleepless nights, frivolous anxiety, and wondering if my brilliant plan to get rich was going to work. But then I thought about the money and what I wanted and I bought what I wanted: Time. I work because I want to. If I lost my job tomorrow and the world shut down for a year or two I'd be fine. I replaced my income with dividends and trade on the excess as I just grow it according to my plan. Okay, it's true, that isn't glamorous but the fact of the matter is we are (were) in the market for different things. I wanted my life back. You want some tendies.

I just know that it is part of the process. But I also do other things a little more professionally so I scale into things slowly and test them to death over and over again before releasing them into \"production\" meaning that while most of WSB just heard of options and instantly started playing them I didn't play options for almost 3 years testing them over multiple strategies very slowly and with great attention to detail in writing in a trading journal.

I feel like a meme of an old samurai who has killed a lot of people and now sits and cuts bonsai or something; it's not that there is no skill and such and that it isn't grueling and terrifying but you kind of grow out of that phase when you look at the bigger picture and realize that when I sell something to someone it isn't because I think they are stupid, it's because I don't want it anymore and when they buy it from me they probably aren't thinking, \"GOD THIS GUY IS A FUCKING MORON TENDIES TO THE MOOOOOON!\" at all, but instead, just trying to make their own plans come to fruition. \n\n>Thanks for the enlightening discussion nonetheless, maybe there's still hope for me someday ;)\n\nI promise you this: If you ever make enough money to not worry about money you will probably not die with the mindset you have now.

I can sell an OTM call for a price I am willing to accept for the trade and if assigned am fine with letting it go. I think when people use the term in this case they're referring to a binary game (two outcomes where you either strike or miss) and honestly for the buyer, not the seller, it is indeed a binary game even if it isn't a binary option. \n\nI recommend you look into Zero-Sum Bias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking) where basically people see zero-sum games where they don't exist.\n\nI do understand what you're saying and where you are coming from but no one would buy a contract they didn't want. So for the people who buy OTM 50% contracts and the people who sell them the individuals buying are shooting for really rare events occurring and the people who are selling them are just looking to get tragically low premiums likely over several thousands of dollars of investment. \n\nIt's a weird relationship, I'll say that.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36759158968925476}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4218345582485199}, {"body": "!emojify", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Trading \ud83d\udca6 and investing \ud83d\udcc8 may \ud83d\uddd3 have different \u2049 time \ud83d\udd50 horizons \ud83c\udfd6, but \ud83c\udf51 there are winners \ud83c\udfc6 and losers \ud83c\udff3 in every \u261d transaction \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude16.   \n  \nI \ud83d\udc65 love \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18 when \u23f0 I \ud83d\udc41 hear \ud83d\udc42 this statement \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 because it makes \ud83d\udee0\ud83d\udcb0 no \ud83d\udeab sense \ud83d\udcb0.

Short interest was 99% of float back in April when it first started getting some attention. As of 9/30 short interest is at 160% of float (although I suspect that many shorts covered and exited their position 2 weeks ago based on volume traded that Friday). There are still potentially more shares sold short than available to trade, which is what the entire GME thesis is built on. The more margin pressure applied to the short positions the more likely it is that they will be rushing to cover or have their positions force liquidated with shares that are not even available. The first post by DeepFuckingValue was about a year ago, so I would hardly call this a pump and dump. The fact that it is now a meme stock helps contribute to the short squeeze and now that they are entering the next console cycle which has always increased their market cap seasonally adds fuel to the fire. Your analysis appreciated but adding \u201cmuh short squeeze\u201d makes it seem like you have not researched the mechanics behind this one. Just because it is a meme stock does not mean it is a pump and dump. Why not include TSLA in that case, which is the most pumped stock on WSB? Because it is not a pump and dump scheme, just like GME IMO. It is a position that takes advantage of the insane short interest, cash on hand and upcoming console cycle - all three of which work together to facilitate the short squeeze.
