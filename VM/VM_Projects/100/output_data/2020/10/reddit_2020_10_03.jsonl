The EV competition is fierce, and there are many EVs in Europe with the same range as Teslas but with much lower purchase price (e.g. VW ID.3, VW ID.4, Hyundai Kona, Kia E-niro). Tesla is a very valuable company but I think an index fund will pay better the next 5 years. Short term (next 5 years) I think the share will trade horizontal or down towards around 250 dollars. Just want people to be careful with their investments and not only watch the super bullish Youtube-channels that often do not even mention the EVs from the competition.
