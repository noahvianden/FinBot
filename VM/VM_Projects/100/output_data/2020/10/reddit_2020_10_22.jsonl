Only to corporations. This will result in extended furloughs, layoffs, and unemployment draws until a vaccine is available and the economy returns to normal (not even *starts to* return...  Everything has to be be back to normal).  With no eviction protections we\u2019ll find a spike in homelessness and a glut of foreclosed homes saturating the market.  High inventories and low demand will drive real estate prices down hard.  Around summer I\u2019d say we\u2019ll end up seeing echoes of the 2008 housing market collapse starting and it will cause a similar effect on the economy at large over the ensuing year.  I couldn\u2019t guess how Trump and the Republicans would handle that crisis since Obama wrote the playbook on the last housing crisis and I doubt they\u2019d follow it.\n\nDemocrat win:  There will be massive stimulus going to everybody and lots of individual, consumer, and worker protections put in place.  The markets will flourish and housing will not collapse (right away...  There would either need to be programs to help people behind on their rent/mortgage or a more severe housing crash would occur much later in the game than in the Republican win scenario).  However this will result in massive debt.  Massive debt will result in massive borrowing, massive borrowing will result in massive inflation.  Inflation will help pay loans, but people will be earning less so they\u2019ll have less disposable income, which means less economic activity.  Meanwhile the government will raise taxes on corporations and the rich which will reduce their productivity and raise prices.  This should all add up to a recession occurring a few years after Covid ends as we try to dig ourselves out of this pit.  Maybe not as sudden or severe as a housing crash, but it will probably happen a lot more slowly and take a lot longer to recover from.\n\nShort term (one year), I think Biden is better, long term (1-4 years ahead) I think Trump could pull us out of the slump quicker and more strongly than Biden provided he reacts to the housing crisis well.

Apparently they have other agreements in place as indicated by previous earnings calls (SA article with transcript snippets). It didn't say with who, so I'm skeptical on whether its major, but its still a positive. They also are getting more than their share of Nintendo switch consoles, which indicates a stronger relationship with Nintendo. Could be because of their new board member, but either way thats a favorable relationship they have.\n\nAnd finally, Cohen. If he gets involved as he has indicated he wants to, I could see this going massive, long term.

To sum it up (for IV Crush), if a stock has a higher chance of going up and down, like TSLA, it had a high Implied Volatility (IV). Now, that IV rises when earnings are near, because there\u2019s a higher chance for it to go up or down. Because it has more IV, calls and puts will cost more. But after earnings, the reason for the high volatility is gone, because there is no anticipation. For Theta, just think of a call like a bet. People always want more time for a bet to be right! So, if you have two days before your FDs expire, there\u2019s a higher chance you\u2019ll get to your strike price. But, if another day passes and it hasn\u2019t gotten significantly closer to your strike, then you only have 1 day left for a huge move, and it\u2019s way less likely. Because it\u2019s less likely, your position is worth less. That\u2019s why these FDs didn\u2019t work, because even though the price rose, it didn\u2019t go anywhere near your strike price, and the IV was gone, so it \u201ccrushed\u201d both calls and puts. \n\n\nTLDR: Theta means time; the less time you have to be right the less a contract will cost. IV Crush means Implied Volatility Crush; if people don\u2019t believe there are catalysts like earnings that could moon or drill the stock, then the price of contracts will go down.

If that's what you mean by IV crush then that's it \n\nThis has nothing to do with theta.\n\nRemember that standard option pricing models are wrong in a few different ways; in particular they assume that volatility is constant over time.  But that's obviously not true -- the stock is a lot more likely to move as soon as earning are announced than at any other time.  So the automatically-calculated numbers (like a Theta and IV) are kind of meaningless when you're looking across a high-volatility event like earnings.  You're seeling what's basically an average across the length of the contract, but really almost all the volatility is concentrated around one event.\n\nRemember that IV is \"implied volatility\".  They look at the option premium and figure out what value of actual volatility would cause BS or whatever model they are using to spit out that price, and that's what they call IV.
