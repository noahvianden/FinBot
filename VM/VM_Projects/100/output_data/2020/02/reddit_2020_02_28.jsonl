One month of straight down, and one month straight back, once the market has decided it won't be Armageddon.\n\n\nThe pattern plays out for swine flu, bird flu,,monkey pox, etc.  All health scares that are scary at first but turn out to not be apocalyptic.  \n\nThis does seem a bit different since we don't actually know if this is pandemic or not.

Entire industries like travel and leisure are wounded. \n\nI'd extrapolate from this that this will be at least as bad as those, and probably worse.  That means a month of selling at least.

{"title": "Why $GILD is Ready to Break Out \ud83d\udcb9\ud83d\udcc8\u2197", "selftext": "**$GILD** is set to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. Ride the Coronavirus fear\n\nYesterday,  [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) made a post arguing to buy $GILD for 2/27 Market Open. I made the argument that $GILD was overbought and was likely to crash soon, and our time to buy would be within the next 2 weeks as the market calmed down from Coronavirus fears.\n\nI think that time is Friday 2/28 **AT THE DIP** Edit: bolded it for you illiterate fucks LMAO stop messaging about buying at open\n\nIMPORTANT DEETS:\n\n1. $GILD leading coronavirus treatment progress overall. (Remdesivir) [https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html)**\"There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's remdesivir,\"** Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said at a press conference in Beijing.\n2. $GILD has been testing the vaccine/treatment in China and are on PHASE 3 already. They've been hyped over Phase 1 trial news in the US so far. Every Phase they pass will be a huge $$$ boost[https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19)\n3. \\*\\*\\*\\*Most other overhyped companies are just starting PHASE 1, and they havent even passed it yet.\n\nNow check the graph below. Top to bottom we have 3 indicators for the last 5 days. For those in need of a refresher, we're looking at Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index, and the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63o7zzjsjkj41.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=811e6ec95bca9e3faa1693a3c73d8c53edf9e16e\n\nTogether, this confirms some previous beliefs, and establishes the basis for several more conclusions.\n\n1. Prior to market open on 2/27, we see from the RSI that the security is likely to be overbought with an RSI \\~70, indicating that we should prepare for a return to \\~RSI 50 (our equilibrium).\n2. At 2/27 Market Open, Investors scramble to buy $GILD and the price skyrockets, bringing us to the next indicator we will analyze, being the Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands show the 2 standard deviations above 2 below the SMA. We see that the Bollinger Band breakthrough causes Wall St Algorithmic Trading bots to instantly sell, driving price down and further triggering private trading bots to instantly sell and secure % gains. Thus, the hype finally crashes due to OVERhype and botting reaction to it. (70% of trading in US is algorithmic, you are not just playing with people, but also machines)\n3. WSB users still autistic and bought high and going to sell low on 2/27.\n\n\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\n\nHOWEVER, this provides us with the opportunity now to buy in on 2/28 to prepare for the weekend as the evidence below will show.\n\n1. Look at the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator. We see over the last 5 days, there has been a gradual increase of people BUYING $GILD. The indicator is as it sounds. It's cumulative, meaning that a rise means more people are buying, and a fall means more people are selling.\n2. This overall uptrend of the Accum/Dist Indicator gives us the confidence to BUY IN. But we need to get the timing right to avoid the Autistic \u2122  fall of those following [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) yesterday (probably seeing a 30% fall in ~~put~~  Call premiums after they purchased at market open AKA losing 1/3 their money in 10 minutes).\n3. Now follow the RSI line and note how it falls to \\~40. This in combination with the Bollinger Bands beginning to tighten and the $GILD price evening out indicates to us that a short squeeze may be imminent (with prices shooting up likely Monday or Tuesday).\n\nPREDICTIONS:\n\n1. FRIDAY 2/28 $GILD goes up from Market Open and if you buy Calls, you'll be winning right out the gates.\n2. If $GILD goes down after Market Open but you bought Calls already, you'll temporarily be losing money. HOWEVER, after the weekend, with the buildup of coronavirus news, California potential OUTBREAK, and DJIA going down, $GILD will be set to skyrocket anyways and you'll be rolling in the tendies \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n3. Goes down at open. BTFD\n\nTLDR;\n\nBuy $GILD $80-$90 Calls for 3/20 - 4/17. If you're rich, or just \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08 then buy them out further at higher premium.\n\n**$GILD $85 Call 3/20 or 4/17** to the \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "fang8n", "created_utc": 1582856432.0, "score": 131, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 138, "comments": [{"body": "Hi Bloomberg Reporter!

{"title": "I turned $96.90 into ~$18.7k in the last 6 trading days after learning the way of the FD.", "selftext": "Been seeing some pretty weak % gains on the front page of the sub lately, even with all the volatility over the past few days,  so I thought it was time that I finally show off mine after unlocking a higher tier of autism. \n\nFirst, the current one week view of my Robinhood Account: https://imgur.com/a/OdLoKcb\n\nAnd the one week view from last Tuesday (2/25/2020): https://imgur.com/3uutSI3\n\nMy trades over the past few days:\n\nSPY Trades: https://imgur.com/a/xU4odvt\n\nOthers: https://imgur.com/a/XGYW3YG\n\nAnd positions from earlier today: https://imgur.com/gBcrbOt\n\nNow, you're probably asking yourself, how did this autist manage to get a 19,192% return in the last few days? And why didn't they put in more money to become even richer or is OP just that poor?\n\nTo answer all those questions, first, you must look into WSB's past. Many of you know the legends of the $NVDA puts guy, the $ROKU puts guy, or u/__Fog__ All of them had one thing in common, weapons grade autism and making small fortunes using FDs. I sought to recreate their success over the last few months by undergoing similar conditions, i.e. very little money and a terrible brokerage like Robinhood. \n\nNow why did I subject myself to this?\n\nAs u/ipa-warrior much more eloquently puts an observation I made several months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa08kj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_27_2020/fiwgmow/\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt;I cracked the code on something over the past few months. I noticed that whenever I throw say, 25%+ of my account into one dumb trade, I tend to lose my ass. Comparatively, when I make a relatively small trade, 5%-10% of my portfolio, I'll often close up 50-300%. I would then scream at the monitor as to why I didn't make a \"big play\" when I win.  \n\nAnd they are absolutely right. Hypothetically, I could have YOLO'd everything and be a multi-millionaire right now, but realistically and truthfully, there is no way I could have done the same thing with everything I have. My emotions would become a very restricting factor. I might panic sell seeing my account lose tens of thousands of dollars in minutes, I might sell too early, or I might just straight up ruin my life clinging to a position. With much smaller amounts that really are nothing to me, I could rid myself of these negative factors and potentially achieve peak WSB autism. \n\nThus leads to my current theory and why I achieved such bigly % gains: \n\nThe more inconsequential your deposit amount is, the more restrictive your positions are, and the shittier the brokerage you're using (Robinhood violated Regulation T, got fined for front running customers, and can't even get a 1099 right), the more likely you can FD your way to some bigly gains. \n\nExhibit A- My 1-year graph RH graph to display my observation period losing money to FDs attempting to recreate that success: https://imgur.com/Ruf45UU\n\nFirst spike: Tesla puts April to May 2019 (Didn't go far enough OTM)\n\nSecond spike: Roku puts, September 2019 (Didn't reinvest my bigly gains into more ROKU puts, which would have outdone the legendary ROKU puts guy). \n\nDecline between second spike and now: FDs on a multiple stocks. No hits. Kept depositing less and less money even though I was trying to mirror my positions in TD. This did not work since I was trying to mirror an account that is much larger and can easily absorb losses, which fell into the gambler\u2019s fallacy.\n\nThird spike (now): Looking for the frothiest stock valuations to buy OTM puts on for quick profits, especially valuation bubbles which will be the biggest winners imo\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talks. \n\nTLDR; Autism + FD = More Tendies\n\nEdit: Knowing big players are blantly lurking the sub, I'm not going to post my current positions in case others in the sub follow me and fuck with by vibe.\n\nEdit 2: Apparently my imgur links were fucked.
