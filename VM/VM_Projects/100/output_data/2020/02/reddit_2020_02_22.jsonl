They burn trash to generate electricity and heating, reducing the landfill volume needed for disposal.  They sign long term contracts to provide these services insuring consistent revenue and dividend.  Sounds good so why are they down?\n\nOne way they make their services price competitive is through commodity recovery.  They sift through the ashes and recover the metals.  Commodity prices are down cutting into their income.  But this is a temporary issue and commodities should eventually rise and their long term contracts should hold them over and maintain the dividend.  Also they are investing in improving the efficiency of the commodity recovery process. \n\nGPP is an MLP that manages infrastructure related to ethanol production and transport.  Ethanol production from corn is essentially farmer welfare.  A way for the government to increase demand for corn.  The environmental benefit of this one is debatable but ethanol is unlikely to go away due to the importance of agriculture.  Right now there is some uncertainty in the sector due to the trade war and whether more farm bailouts are coming and that appears to be depressing the stock price.

Despite this, I do have Energy revenue growing at 30-45% YOY until 2030 and I believe that this is pretty realistic. I'm excited for Battery Day to see any breakthroughs in cell production.\n\nnice Damodaran mention. i have previously considered making a full bullish sheet including every single thing Tesla and Musk have claimed to be able to do, and everything I think they'll be able to do, however I am already astounded by a predicted SP of $20k and think that anything above that currently just sounds ridiculous haha\n\nnot sure if that was the size of response you were expecting but I did want to address all of your points:) thanks for reading", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the nice response.\n\nIt's interesting what you say about the numbers coming out so big they are hard to believe. I made a [batteries model](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvQmnIzg403pwncI5K-65K_PR1QG?e=jSTDG4) which looked at what would happen if they scale to 2 terawatt hours of batteries by 2035 and it would make them the biggest company in the world by a margin. I guess that is the problem of trying to follow Elon's thinking when he thinks on a planetary scale.\n\nI guess that's the big thing around gross margin and AMaaS rev share, it's how much competition there is. So from that Ark article\n\n>Wright\u2019s Law suggests that it would be able to manufacture the Model A today for \\~$1,500. The original Model A had 8 horsepower (hp) and a top speed of 28 mph. While Ford no longer sells an 8 hp car, the Tata Nano and Mahindra\u2019s rickshaw \u2013 both at 8-37 hp and a weight similar to that of the Model A \u2013 cost \\~$2,100. If auto buyers still were willing to pay $23,000 for an 8 hp car in the US today, then Ford\u2019s gross margins would approach 90%+.\n\nSo yeah I agree totally with the Wright's law analysis (I think Ark should probably rename themselves Wright's Investments ha ha) and I guess those efficiency gains are shared between price cuts due to competition and improving margins. So a monopoly would be able to keep all those gains for themselves but if there is competition with other manufacturers they have to keep reducing prices to get sales, which is why Ford's ICE cars don't have 90% margin today.\n\nI guess with the Tesla Network it's really hard to work out how much of a cut they can take. I think that's a big unknown. Your points are interesting.\n\nRe the energy division I think one thing with it is it doesn't need to grow organically. For example if they just sold battery packs they would need to wait for income to grow the company so they could get new money for capex to expand. However as they also have the vehicle division and a large cash pile I don't see particularly why Elon couldn't expand it by 4-5x over a couple of years just by building new lines / factories. They have a lot of capital now I think.\n\nAs you say very interesting to wait for battery day. If it blows Elon's mind it's going to be worth hearing :)\n\nAnyway thanks a lot for posting the model, it's been very interesting to look at :)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great points.

{"title": "First post - epic opportunity in USD/JPY calls", "selftext": "What's up people, this is my first post on Wall Street Bets. I've been trading futures and FX in my PA for about 10 yrs, and when I heard about WSB on podcasts and Financial Times I figured I'd come here to check out what all the fuss is about. I started my PA with $50k USD, started making big and ballzy bets like you all, and managed to survive and multiply my capital hundreds of times over. The vibe in here reminds me of my earlier years when I was gunning it on every trade, learning from stupid mistakes, and making a few brilliant ones here and there. I'll start posting some of my better ideas here and see what happens. \n\n**Anyway, on to the trade. Usd/jpy FX is breaking out to the upside, and it's time to get on board this rocket ship:** \n\n[Daily candle chart](https://preview.redd.it/1xi045p39fi41.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=2846961d2eb81862a61bfc20e83fb1232c0b6252)\n\nWhen you look at this move in the context of the last 5 years, the technicals are even more compelling:  \n\n[This chart has been coiling for 5 years and is finally busting out](https://preview.redd.it/rzt5jq1uqfi41.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d71ca757102a578200fb53921aa210cbeb69d5)\n\nWhat's going on here? Normally the Japanese Yen trades like a safe haven and trades inversely with US yields, so why is usd/jpy breaking higher when yields are going down? \n\n[When nobody knows WTF is driving an asset to move the way it's moving, this is called a regime change, and there is a lot of money to be made if you spot it early. ](https://preview.redd.it/uj2fi2zdbfi41.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f7ad312e7253654e9c32db29087af4a92fd313)\n\n**Reason #1**: Japanese institutions are selling the hell out of their own currency and seeking safety in foreign bonds, with Treasuries being the #1 destination\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93sps2wdefi41.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=a794609d9f79bb151d2caecc3908051f677e6f7c\n\n**Reason #2**: Japan is crashing into a recession. The weakness started in Q4 and is likely to continue this quarter due to the impact of Covid19 in Asia. \n\n[There is nothing pretty about this picture](https://preview.redd.it/msovbzlcffi41.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c4cc9abbb630cd12ce2faec172adda5da6381ad)\n\n**Reason #3**: The Bank of Japan has been the global leader of stimulative monetary policy because of Japan's long history of anemic growth and deflation. They were the first major central bank to reach 0% interest rates, and also the first to do quantitative easing. However, it's clearly not helping the economy right now, so what is Japan to do? The only answer is to increase fiscal spending by issuing more debt, and let the central bank buy the additional debt! There are several names for this - modern monetary theory, monetizing government debt, quantitative easing etc...but they all mean one thing - debasing the Japanese yen. No wonder institutional money is getting out the fuck out of their local currency like rats trying to escape a sinking ship! \n\n**You say: \"Ok, I'm convinced that usd/jpy is going up, but so is a lot of other shit that I'm trading at. So what?\"**\n\n**Wait, there's more!**\n\nImplied volatility is near historical rock bottom lows. When I put this trade on a few days ago, 1 mth vol was even lower at 5. It's perking up but nowhere close to where it could be heading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf75308aifi41.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=003aa0691e2176cfda84e7647ec64c2fb8c24cd4\n\nNot only that, but options skew still favors puts over calls, which means the market is still more worried about usd/jpy going down than up! Silly options traders...\n\n[Difference between 1mth 25 delta puts and 25 delta calls. You can see that back in 2012 when Japan embarked on its big quantitative easing campaign, this was \\>0](https://preview.redd.it/b2iq206sifi41.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ace5fce8b916fb016b63e7cbf9a7a8e7e98903)\n\nBecause the market is so off sides on this trade and hasn't completely gotten its head around the idea of JPY losing its safe haven status, there is potential for an explosive move both in usdjpy upside AND usdjpy implied vol. How explosive? Think 114.00 in 2-4 weeks, 118 within 3 months (were are at 111.55 today). This trade is best expressed by buying usdjpy calls with strikes 114-118 and expiries 1-3 months out. \n\n**How do I put this trade on?**\n\nIf you have a futures trading account like Interactive Brokers, you can trade JPY futures listed options. The code in IB is JPY, then select Futures Options. Unfortunately the contract trades at an inverse price to how FX is conventionally quoted, so the current price of 111.55 = 0.008964. Pain in the ass, but that's what a calculator is for. Since the Mar contract is close to expiry, your underlying would be the Jun contract, which closed at 0.009014 on Friday. Each tick of 0.000001 is worth $12.5 per contract, and the value of 1 contract is 12.5m JPY worth, or 112k USD. The equivalent of usd/jpy calls are actually JPY contract puts on IB. \n\nI put these trades on three days ago, so they are already in the money as price and implied vol have moved quickly in my favor, but there is a LOT more room for this trade to go. I ended up going with 0.008900 JPY puts expiring Apr 3 and 0.008750 JPY puts expiring May 8. \n\n[What it looks like in IB](https://preview.redd.it/4nfr7z3knfi41.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=167201f63f1baa529b35aa6ddd6d7257a81640a3)\n\n[Another account where I have $80m USD of a 111.50 Mar 19 call and $150m USD of a 114.00 Apr 17 call. These are OTC options and not listed futures options, therefore quoted in conventional terms.](https://preview.redd.it/lxs8vcmdpfi41.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb365d8e2aab6da6c023529cc8504b49fdab2a62)\n\n\"**Oh, what's that position that's up $614k?\"** \n\nI bought gold calls (GC in IB) two Thursdays ago when it was at 1577 and it's at 1645 today, so that option has gone up 4.5x. Gold has been going up batshit crazy for the past 6 months because the market sees the writing on the wall - that central banks will react to weak growth and inflation by pursuing stimulative and reflationary policies that will debase fiat currency in favor of hard currencies like gold. Gold is a great addition to your portfolio as it is the one of the few safe havens left in the global macro world right now. Having a long gold position allows me to size up my usd/jpy position by a factor of 2-3x because when usdjpy sells off like it did Friday, gold goes up a lot. I'll leave discussion on gold for another post in the future.", "id": "f7pwvq", "created_utc": 1582360277.0, "score": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "God I wish I understood this", "score": 144, "replies": [{"body": "I'm just a simple retard who only yolos with no market research.
