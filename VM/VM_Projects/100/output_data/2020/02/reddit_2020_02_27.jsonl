Being a smart investor is about knowing when to cut loses on investments. My readings have all said new investors should cap at .5%-1%.. 20% is insanely high to hold through. \n\n> Btw I\u2019m not saying the market isn\u2019t gonna drop further; in fact I think it\u2019s more likely than not that it will. But to sell and then aim to buy again at the dip requires a lot of time and energy, and I think more often than not it\u2019s just not worth the hassle. Moreover, he\u2019s got a solid portfolio (almost all tech, but still reputable blue chip companies), I think we can all agree that they will eventually go back up. \n\nIts really doesnt take a lot of time and energy. this is a multi-week swing downwards of the market. He can just check the market and some new sources once a day to see if the corona virus spread has mitigated, and just buy back in then... at worst he'd be looking at missing one day of the bounce back of a market that has fallen for weeks. If anything, it is more effort to check the market every day and panic about losing more and more money.. espcially for a new investor", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8809130191802979}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7473827004432678}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.9126819372177124}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7869492769241333}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "half of this thread is people saying to buy now (IE catching a falling knife). my advice is your are better of selling today and catching the falling knife tomorrow than you would be holding the whole time.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.011201134882867336}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.002010628115385771}, {"body": "More to be gained by holding...

Getting called a gay bear is better than getting margin called.\nEdit: futures now: dow-355, Nasdaq -118, SP -45\nLast edit since gotta go: futures looking pretty fucked right now. No need to post the numbers anymore. Expect -1.25-2% across board at end of futures session.\nLate night edit: huge pump bringing it back up @starting after 1 am. Futures be crazy tonight! Current:Dow -150, sp -19, Nasdaq -45. Nice pump bulls, very impressive! Will update one more time in like an hr before I gotta sleep.\nOK LAST EDIT OF NIGHT: Bears fighting back with a vengeance like thic bois. A real war going on in futures play tonight. Both sides fought valiantly, but as of now bears are holding the upper hand. This of course could change by morning. DOW -230, SP -27, NASDAQ -80. THIS IS ROUGHLY -0.8% across the board.

{"title": "Formal discussion of where the market is headed.", "selftext": "*Please keep things civil and let's try to assess how this market is moving for the good of all.*\n\nGoing to be long, don't want to read: **The rebound you saw this morning is the market's way of taking one last deep breath before scuba diving in the Mariana Trench.**\n\nIn the past week, it's fair to say this market has been very bipolar with SPY/Techs adding an average of 3% one day, to losing 3% the next. For a lot of people, I am seeing mixed reactions from a few that profited largely to those that are always on the opposite side of the market.\n\nHere is my assessment of the market and the implication of the coronavirus in the short-medium term:\n\nCOVID-19 from a medical perspective is concerning. It has surpassed the SARS outbreak of 2002 by incidence and in a shorter amount of time. What is a common misconception and commonly referenced in this sub is comparing the coronavirus to the flu. The two are entirely different for one reason: COVID-19 is an **airborne** transmittable condition, whereas the flu is not. Airborne diseases are particularly concerning from a physicians standpoint (credits to a friend of mine in pediatrics/general care) because they travel significantly faster, have a much larger reach, and can infect masses in a short amount of time. COVID-19, though having significantly less death counts compared to the seasonable flu, poses a greater threat to humans at this point because there are currently no viable drugs for treatment and vaccines for preventative care. Moderna and Gilead at the forefront of this treatment are still far from a vaccine which is the most important thing for the outlook of this disease. Moreover, treatments are currently in late-stage development (albeit probably expedited for approval) and has not been tested on large samples of humans. I anticipate a viable treatment potentially in April and May, and a vaccine 3-4 months further down the line. That is if COVID-19 isn't beginning to mutate.\n\nThe implications of this virus is clear in the tech sector. The argument that I hear is that companies do not lose value simply because of delays in production, and once production is back in full force, these companies will appreciate. The issue with this conjecture is that factory delays do in fact depreciate the valuation of a company because it demonstrates 1) an inability for these companies to mitigate from natural disasters, 2) an over-dependence of out-sourced labor in a country that we are having tariff wars with, and 3) the lack of a diversified geography in overseas production. For tech, delays as such as be worrisome for short term value investors (day/swing traders) and call option traders. Take TSLA for example. The stock sat at around $900 5 trading days prior with no immediate signs of a pull back. In light of the 92% reduction of car sales report in China for Jan vs February, the car industry as a whole took a steep drop. TSLA in particular is already back in production, but they are currently seeing 42% loss in registration from December vs January, and I suspect the numbers are going to recede with February.  I am particularly interested in TSLA as it had such a tremendous last quarter, but the difference between the first/second quarter should help investors better understand the current valuation as being over-extended. I would even imagine $500 puts for April as reasonable. Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple are all likely to suffer extended losses with outlook revisions guiding downwards. Both apple and microsoft revising guidance and anticipating misses in revenue is also worthwhile to look into.\n\nMoving into the analysis of the movement. Stocks having daily value ranges that stretch, 8% of it's value. These fluxes can be seen in today's early trading hours when SPY reached $300 and all tickers were deep in red. If you line up 30 of the most popular large/mega cap tickers, you will notice that they are head north at the same time. This is a good indicator of algo trading as opposed to optimism in traders. It would be reasonable to believe that traders are buying the dip if these tickers were driven up in separate pace, but you will find a clear indication that many tickers experienced heavy volumes at the exact same time. I use Starbucks as a good support. For Starbucks, it's very clear where their next earnings are headed with the closing of 90% of their stores in China and this being their second largest market after the U.S. Their reopening of 3000 stores will not likely have a recovering effect with the virus still posing a significant threat all across China. However, this ticker moved from -3.80% lows to nearly positive when everything began to move north simultaneously.\n\nTLDR: Let's talk about your thoughts on the trajectory of the market in the short term. I anticipate further bleed in the weeks to come. SPY will likely visit sub $300 in the coming weeks. Over-extended techs will bleed out. Algo trading rebounded many large/mega caps today, but I suspect a quick selloff  out of the blue.", "id": "fahqdx", "created_utc": 1582832982.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Imagine thinking all of us retards can be civil.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12092866748571396}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01623651012778282}, {"body": "Stonks go up, stonks go down.\n\nOptions go to zero.", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Stonks also go GUH", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5031226873397827}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1110808327794075}, {"body": "Sir, this is a MacDonald.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "A moron's thesis on the market impact of COVID-19 and why you might want to come out of the bear closet you're hiding in", "selftext": "Edit: TLDR this shit is about to escalate.  Buy puts.\n\nEdit 3: I'm just a dude on the internet people, not a fucking swami or professional.  I have no clue what you should do with your positions.\n\nI've seen too fucking much speculation lately on just how bad this COVID-19 shit is.  Some say its the sniffles.  Other say its the start to World War Z.  More specifically I've seen this referenced as the next big \"Black Swan\" event because this sub is a bunch of fucking amateurs (myself included) and they just regurgitate whatever bullshit movie or book they read and used to self-proclaim themselves the next Michael Burry (see what I just did there?  I'm speaking your language).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read my fair share of shit too assholes.  The Big Short, Liars Poker, Flash Boys, Chaos Monkeys, Zero To One, the new /r/WallStreetBets book (which doesn't come in a fucking hardcover and looks like a fucking disgrace in my library).  What I have come to realize is there is no fucking science to stocks.  \\[Yes there is, you claim.  Stonks only go up.  Science duh\\].\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever there is science to a virus works and how a pandemic spreads.  So I've thrown together some half-assed research that you can disregard at your pleasure.  This includes charts that we are all so fond of reading.  Full disclosure, I am not a biologist, doctor, or any expert in the field of virology.  I just did some internet readings and used that data to apply my own logic.  Undoubtedly there are errors in what lies ahead.  Let's begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCOVID-19 Coronavirus is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a incestuous relative of our old friend SARS (we'll get to him shorty).  Depending on what you believe this has been caused by some starving Chinese peasants seasoning their soup with bats or the result of a Chinese bioweapon escaping its lab.  Long story short its the flu that really fucks you up.\n\nThis isn't the first virus we've seen rapidly rise to fame.  We've got a few historical examples we can look to for comparison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) 1918 H1N1 aka Spanish Flu\n\nThe big bad granddaddy of them all, this is the shit doomsdayers point to when they want to really incite some fear.  Firs appearing in January of 1918, this fucker infected almost 500 million and killed anywhere between 40 million to 100 million.  \\~28% of the United States was infected with a 2%-3% case-fatality ratio.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) 1956-1958 H2N2 Influenza A aka Asian Flu\n\nA bad nickname since most of these could be called Asian Flu.  This gets the crown since it was first.  Originating in our dear friend China, this spread to Singapore by February of 1957, Hong Kong by April, and the US by June.  69800 deaths in the US with 1-4 million worldwide (WHO estimates 2 million).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) 1968-1969 H3N2 Influenza A aka Hong Kong Flu\n\nArriving on the scene July 13th, 1968, this hit Vietnam and Singapore by the end of July and was widespread in the US by December of 1968.  Case-fatality ratio of 0.5%, it killed 33800 people in the US alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) 2002-2003 SARS\n\nProbably the last real panic over an Asian virus, this was declared in November 27th of 2002.  There apparently still is no cure.  That said, only 8098 cases with 774 deaths occurred (however that is a fatality rate of 9.6%).  There were only 27 US cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) 2009 H1N1/09 variation aka Swine Flu\n\nWhat looked to be the sequel to SARS but really was just a lame prequel, this had a case-fatality of 0.01%-0.08%.  WHO statistics as of July 2010 attributed 18000 deaths to the virus, but later revisions estimate somewhere around 284,500 deaths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of these have led to COVID-19 and speculation is rampant as to it's impact on the globe.  More specifically for the retards here, it's impact on their portfolios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately we don't have a ton of good data on how any of these affected markets.  For starters, the stock market today is quite different from 20 years ago, and the global economy is much more entangled.  News travels faster, and we have a way of sensationalizing everything.  We can look at the markets during each of the aforementioned virus' (minus the 1918 Spanish Flu.  If this happens there won't be a stock market).\n\nThe most recent two virus', H1N1/09 and SARS, both have unusable market data.  Why?  Because when both virus' struck, we had just popped two of the largest bubbles in history.  H1N1/09 struck in March of 2009, right in the midst of the Great Recession.  The market had already bottomed, the Feds were writing blank checks, and the economy was already in triage.  SARS came to fruition in November of 2002, one month after the NASDAQ hit bottom from the DotCom bubble.  What impact these virus' had on the world market is tainted by the preexisting financial landslides.\n\nIn January of 1957 the S&P 500 was valued around \\~418 (inflation adjusted).  When the virus hit the US in June, the S&P 500 was actual up to \\~434.86.  By December of 1957 the index value was 363.23 points.\n\nI feel however, that the 1968 Hong Kong Flu is our best comparison to COVID-19 and any impact the virus could have on the overall market.  Just look at these numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS&P 500 (inflation adjusted)\n\nJuly 1968           722.49 (virus reaches Singapore and Vietnam)\n\nDecember 1968       754.75 (widespread in the United States)\n\nFebruary 1969       707.12\n\nAugust 1969         665.90\n\nJune 1970           483.52\n\n&#x200B;\n\nH3N2 struck a year before the Recession of 1969-1970, a recession that ended the third longest period of economic expansion in US History.  According to Wikipedia:\n\n\"At the end of the expansion inflation was rising, possibly a result of increased deficit spending during a period of full employment. This relatively mild recession coincided with an attempt to start closing the budget deficits of the Vietnam War (fiscal tightening) and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates (monetary tightening).\\[2\\]  During this relatively mild recession, the Gross Domestic Product of the United States fell 0.6 percent. Though the recession ended in November 1970, the unemployment rate did not peak until the next month. In December 1970, the rate reached its height for the cycle of 6.1 percent.\"\n\nHowever I would once again argue this is a poor example, as the market didn't seem to rock much during the actual outbreak, and some of the surrounding factors of the recession were different than those of today.\n\nSo what does this mean?  In my opinion we are facing a somewhat unknown scenario.  Markets don't like unknowns.  And there is a lot of fear being tossed around regarding this virus.  Markets don't like fear either.  So is this unknown fear worth panicking about?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's look a pair of charts.  Some really unhappy charts.\n\nThis first one graphs all the cases of COVID-19 since its inception on December 31st, 2019, the day China contacted WHO and let them know shit was about to get fucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sd9u8lu40gj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b0923a47fb0c2c19336440d8e86486c1c45341\n\nFor the first month of that chart, you don't really see much.  Then you see one really big fucking line go parabolic in a hurry, and more recently a bunch of little tiny lines that don't seem to be doing anything.  That first line is the number of total COVID-19 cases, dominated by primarily China (>95%).  China has had a runaway explosion of cases that \\*tentatively\\* seems to be slowing down.  Already the panic from this has caused our recent markets to approach/enter correction territory in the matter of a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow lets go zoom in on those tiny lines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09ubl9360gj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7529cf1eaedf0c4a4019c3e19da0515ce5fe9f97\n\nHoly shit, they are fucking going parabolic too.  After a rough incubation period of about a month, we start seeing an explosion of cases in infected countries.  South Korea has especially been taking it through the teeth.  These are fucking exponential jumps.  If these were stocks, they'd be memed to death already.  If you were investing in virus outbreaks in countries, you can bet your fucking ass most of this sub would be buying calls on every fucking one of these nations with new cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo lets see, we have an economy that is nonsensical, in a trade war with a nation who is ground zero for a sweeping health crisis.  We have recession indicators blowing up everywhere, fucking Twitch streamers jumping into stocks, markets getting spooked to death over this virus, global supply chains being interrupted, the Feds pumping the markets desperately, and now this virus has decided to start going apeshit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHO declared this an international health emergency on January 22nd.  WHO has YET to declare this a pandemic.  We overtook the SARS death toll on February 9th, three weeks ago.  People went nuts about SARS.  According to Wikipedia in regards to Swine Flu, \"Critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading \"fear and confusion\" rather than \"immediate information\". The WHO began an investigation to determine whether it had \"frightened people unnecessarily\"'.  So if WHO took flak for overselling Swine Flu in 2009, I would wager they are underselling COVID-19 now.  \n\nDid you watch that speech last night people?  What about any of this is inspiring confidence?  I don't want to imagine what the presser would be if the number of US cases went parabolic.  Hell it might already have done so.  This wouldn't be the first time the current administration has fudged numbers.\n\nIn just the last week:\n\nDenmark, Estonia, Greece, North Macedonia, Georgia, Norway, Pakistan, Romania, Croatia, Austria, Brazil, Switzerland, Algeria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Israel all reported their FIRST cases.\n\nIran and Italy have gone parabolic.  South Korea looks like its gonna hit China numbers from a month ago soon.\n\nWe have outpaced almost every historical example of a major pandemic BESIDES the 1918 Spanish Flu.  Also this virus is matching the %2-%3 case-fatality ratio.\n\nI'm buying puts out the ass across the next two months.  Could this thing fizzle out and blow over in two months?  Yes of course.  Could this entire post be full of shit and age incredibly poorly by next week?  Absolutely.  But this sub isn't about investing its about white collar gambling.  You have to take the odds when they are in your favor.  An overextended market gets hit by an unprecedented external force?  The odds have titled.  It's time to lay down some fat fucking bets while it exists.   Or keep throwing money stupidly at meme stocks and hoping SPCE moves 2 fucking points.\n\nEdit 2: In the mere hours since I posted this gibberish, Kuwait, Switzerland, Iran, the UK, South Korea, Iraq, Finland, and Lebanon have reported more cases and deaths.  Australia says pandemic inevitable, the US has \nits first case of unknown origin who wasn't tested for days, and Saudis Arabia just cancelled the fucking pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.   After a few hours sleep I feel even more confident in this assessment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources: \n\n[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-a-timeline-of-how-the-deadly-outbreak-evolved/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-a-timeline-of-how-the-deadly-outbreak-evolved/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession\\_of\\_1969%E2%80%9370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession_of_1969%E2%80%9370)\n\n[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/study-72000-covid-19-patients-finds-23-death-rate](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/study-72000-covid-19-patients-finds-23-death-rate)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus\\_disease\\_2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/inflation-adjusted-s-p-500](https://www.multpl.com/inflation-adjusted-s-p-500)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe\\_acute\\_respiratory\\_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009\\_flu\\_pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\\_flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu)\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza\\_A\\_virus\\_subtype\\_H2N2#Asian\\_flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H2N2#Asian_flu)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968\\_flu\\_pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_flu_pandemic)", "id": "faa4zz", "created_utc": 1582799257.0, "score": 1192, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 324, "comments": [{"body": "What you assholes are not realizing, when comparing to the spread of other viruses, is the modern day transportation.

Let's say 0.8% is the \"real\" number that's still damn high and while maybe not a percent wise strong killer like spanish flu or black death, the total number killed is just shitty to think about.\n\nEven if it's not much worse than the flu markets are still going down, SPY ~280 in March and that's if the world can prevent a global spread... which I think is impossible.
