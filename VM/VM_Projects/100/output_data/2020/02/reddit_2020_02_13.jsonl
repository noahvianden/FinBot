What has Papa Trump been doing his entire presidency? Packing the courts with his judges and throwing legal precedents out the window. If you consider the extrapolated mathematics and we use the formula of X + Y = T, where X is Microsoft and Y is the courts and T is of course, tendies, you will find that after doing the math, this only means one thing. Trump will ensure Microsoft gets the contract, Microsoft will boom even bigger than before, and tendies will rain from the sky in glorious rapture. The false Amazon prophets will try and lead us astray in these three days the contract is delayed, and all we have to do is double down on our positions and buy even more calls on the dip.

At this point, the contract is still a loss since it\u2019s a $45 call, and SPCE is only $40, right? Incorrect! If you were willing to pay $35 for that contract before when SPCE was all the way down at $20, imagine how much that contract could be worth now.

Not to mention, this is a 10 year deal with openings to new government cloud deals.\n\n***Why is this a big deal?***\n\nFrom my personal experience in the cloud business, I've worked directly with one of Amazon's subsidiaries on large cloud deals (over 7-figures) in Asia & South America for streaming services that needed low-latency that AWS could not provide due to their datacenter locations. It took our company over 7 months through litigation, red-lines, etc to finalize a contract. One the contract was finished and approved, getting new business can be done in the same day, i.e., once Microsoft is awarded, they can continue growing their government deals as needed, in the same day.\n\nThus, tomorrow's ruling is a big win (if it happens) for Microsoft.\n\nUpdate: [the author just posted a new article](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/as-key-jedi-court-decision-looms-pentagon-warns-of-national-security-concerns/)\n\nA few key takeaways:\n\n1. \"...the government argued not only that Amazon lacks the necessarily legal basis to get the temporary stop-work order, issuing one would cause **concrete harm to national security**.\"\n\n*Favors MSFT*\n\n2) \"...To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it\u2019s likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government\u2019s would if the JEDI buildout was paused.\"\n\n*Favors MSFT*\n\n3) \u201cWhile still lacking several key features of the JEDI Cloud\u2026\\[DoD\\] anticipates a\u00a0 financial\u00a0 harm of between $5 and $7 million dollars every month that performance of the JEDI contract is delayed.\u201d\n\n*Nail in the coffin.

USA 1:19-cv-01796-PEC.* Clarification: the case will not be dismissed tomorrow unless the court dismisses it sua sponte or AWS voluntarily dismisses it.\n\nAmazon simply filed a Rule 65 motion (temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction) and supporting memo to prevent MSFT from beginning work yada yada. The court will grant Amazon's request or not.\n\nNote: US filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss (sealed), and MSFT, an intervenor in the case, filed a partial 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. I glanced through it. I do not see any response from AWS on the docket yet regarding these motions.\n\nThe AWS injunction motion and supporting materials are 87 pages, terse and verbose. I glanced through them. The standard for AWS to prevail on a Rule 65 motion is being able to demonstrate:\n\n1. the likelihood of their eventual success on the merits;\n2. that they will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief;\n3. the balance of hardships favors the them; and\n4. the public interest.\n\nMy opinion is that AWS can easily prevail on point 2. On point 1, I am not sure, and no one could tell you because the complaint and memos are so redacted. Personally, I doubt they can prevail on point 1.\n\nOn points 3 and 4, I read AWS' arguments. I could see the government prevailing by arguing that any significant delay, during which AWS would conduct excruciatingly long discovery, would be deleterious to matters of national security, thereby harming public interest and tipping the scales of 4 (and 3) to the US government.\n\n**TLDR:** If AWS cannot prevail on any of those four points, then the court should deny the AWS Rule 65 motion, and MSFT can then go forward with work on Friday. But, any lawyer will tell you. Nothing is ever in the bag.\n\n**edit: like I said, nothing is ever in the bag with these things. The opinion and order was filed under seal.

TROs have an extremely high burden that cuts against issuance of a TRO except in the most extreme cases, and so AMZN are going to have to rebut a very strong presumption that cuts against them. I just don't see anywhere that, if awarded the contract, that AMZN or any other contractor couldn't scrap all work done by MSFT to date and start from square 1 according to new contractor's plan.\n\nall of this is to say that, most people asking for a TRO - ever - are generally not entitled to one, and i would be very surprised, because it's so unlikely that a TRO is ever granted, if this probability is not already priced in.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting viewpoint. Thanks for sharing that. Yes, there is implied presumption against the TRO, and AWS would have to prevail on the balance of hardship tests. They argue basically that delaying work for a limited period would not impair the government or national security in the case.

I can imagine the US prevailing on the balance of hardships, but the truth is that very few know how time-sensitive the work is, too much redacted.\n\nI especially agree with your point that parties filing for TROs, especially, ex parte TROs, are not entitled to them from a strict legal standard standpoint.

The case is unlikely to be dismissed today based on personal knowledge and experience in Government procurement.  The chance of a stop-work-order is likely and higher than most of you autists are anticipating.

It's beyond my personal risk tolerance.  If I had the stones, I would sell 2/14 and 2/21 naked calls today.  Or wait until next week after the drop to buy near the money 3/20 calls. \n\nDisclaimer: I hold zero position in MSFT or AMZN within the last 12-months.", "score": -8, "replies": [{"body": "eat shit tranny", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14206503331661224}], "tickers": ["msft", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["msft", "msft", "amzn", "msft"]}
