What has Papa Trump been doing his entire presidency? Packing the courts with his judges and throwing legal precedents out the window. If you consider the extrapolated mathematics and we use the formula of X + Y = T, where X is Microsoft and Y is the courts and T is of course, tendies, you will find that after doing the math, this only means one thing. Trump will ensure Microsoft gets the contract, Microsoft will boom even bigger than before, and tendies will rain from the sky in glorious rapture. The false Amazon prophets will try and lead us astray in these three days the contract is delayed, and all we have to do is double down on our positions and buy even more calls on the dip.

At this point, the contract is still a loss since it\u2019s a $45 call, and SPCE is only $40, right? Incorrect! If you were willing to pay $35 for that contract before when SPCE was all the way down at $20, imagine how much that contract could be worth now.

The volatility of the option contract price drops because there is no longer uncertainty about earnings. Option prices are calculated using derivatives, however volatility is what we typically call \"premium\". When people say you're paying too much premium it means you're paying too much for an option contract due to volatility being high. The lower the volatility, the lower the premium, the lower the price. This is what VIX measures, the volatility. \n\nIf your have options expiring tomorrow, you would have noticed that their volatility was high before earnings and that same option, the volatility will be low right after the earnings.
