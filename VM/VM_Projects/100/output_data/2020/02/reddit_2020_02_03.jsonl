The Porsche 911 appeals to enthusiasts almost universally: that doesn't mean they can all afford the car.\n\nBut the point is more so that Porsche didn't really design the car to fight for the same buyers as Tesla did with their Model 3 or S. Not only is the car priced higher, but it's designed/marketed as a track performer despite being an EV.\n\nWhat lots of folks were waiting for were impressions and reviews to see if Porsche managed to maintain the similar trademark Porsche driving experience with their first stab at an electric vehicle. By most, if not all, measures, Porsche succeeded at doing so.\n\nIn comparison, the Model S handles like a heavy boat around corners, and the Model 3 - while nimbler than the S - still suffers from understeer when pushed and somewhat uncommunicative steering. Both obviously accelerate fast, but neither were quite satisfying the hopes from enthusiasts that EV's could match the driving experiences of ICE sports cars (especially given the sheer curb weight differences due to the massive batteries).\n\nNot that any of this will matter to the mainstream buyer. My only point is that Porsche launched the first EV that's aimed to capture the same high performance benchmark as ICE sports cars do - evidenced by their focus on battery cooling technology to allow for repeated track runs and the addition of a second gear for efficiency at higher speeds.
