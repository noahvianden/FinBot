The Porsche 911 appeals to enthusiasts almost universally: that doesn't mean they can all afford the car.\n\nBut the point is more so that Porsche didn't really design the car to fight for the same buyers as Tesla did with their Model 3 or S. Not only is the car priced higher, but it's designed/marketed as a track performer despite being an EV.\n\nWhat lots of folks were waiting for were impressions and reviews to see if Porsche managed to maintain the similar trademark Porsche driving experience with their first stab at an electric vehicle. By most, if not all, measures, Porsche succeeded at doing so.\n\nIn comparison, the Model S handles like a heavy boat around corners, and the Model 3 - while nimbler than the S - still suffers from understeer when pushed and somewhat uncommunicative steering. Both obviously accelerate fast, but neither were quite satisfying the hopes from enthusiasts that EV's could match the driving experiences of ICE sports cars (especially given the sheer curb weight differences due to the massive batteries).\n\nNot that any of this will matter to the mainstream buyer. My only point is that Porsche launched the first EV that's aimed to capture the same high performance benchmark as ICE sports cars do - evidenced by their focus on battery cooling technology to allow for repeated track runs and the addition of a second gear for efficiency at higher speeds.

I am mainly asking about those two aspects of the business, for FSD I don't see a serious third player, and regardless it is not something I can truly understand well enough to decide who has the edge other than in surface (TSLA has the driving data and GOOGL has the AI crown thus far, I have no way of comparing their algos). For the sake of the argument, let's pretend individually owned cars are not going away any time soon. As a side note, I do not mean to start a debate of diversification vs concentration, at the end of the day that's a personal decision, similarly to not being all-in SPY and actually picking your holdings. There will be a redistribution of market shares among the players, that much is inevitable IMO and I don't think Tesla will be the only stock to benefit or grow from it once the dust settles. And while dividends will take a hit out of the transition, I think whoever comes out of it alive will be a good holding to have, both for appreciation and as dividend plays since at some point they'll shift back to it rather than pursuing a dozen green ventures like Tesla will (I think/hope they will at least). Also to note, I have not delved into the financials or technological advantages of the other OEMs so I'm mostly brainstorming (with myself if anything, it helps to put one's ideas into writing) and sticking to the story-level discussion.\n\nFor cars it seems that the most serious OEMs in regards to shifting their resource allocation (albeit slowly) would be VW and Daimler. The latter being more of an upper-class car OEM, I do not see them as being able to really increase their market share as the sector shifts, if anything I see them as being really threatened by Tesla's whole car lineup, moreso than \"affordable\" cars OEMs. While some people find them more luxurious to Teslas, I'm sure the car quality of our horse will only be trending upwards. I see Porsche in a similar light. I like VW's stance, the CEO seems to recognize the necessity of shifting and they're willing invest accordingly. My doubts tho is that they basically haven't really done anything yet, there's the e-Golf but I don't even think I've seen any on the road. But then German engineering and STEM is recognized AFAIK, the pivot will be costly but I see them making it out to the other side. The third main one I see is Nissan, they are the go-to EV with the Leaf for people who can't afford the 3 or don't want to overspend (regardless of the 3's ability to maintain it's price second hand, I know a LOT more people with Leafs than 3s, I do not live in SF). Thus far they are I believe the second best seller in the space globally (I do not count GM's Volt as it's hybrid, even tho I actually think it's a good option for single people we're rapidly shifting away from hybrid as charging networks expand and mileage increases). I am not sure how profitable they are with it, they are the first non-Tesla company serious about EVs and I can see them increase their market share, especially until Tesla does not make an entry-level EV which I do not expect until S3XY is fully supplied, which is a few years out, tho my stance is that \"Cybercars\" are the future and I've been advocating for it every since the CT reveal night, once they learn the manufacturing quirks from the CT I think that could be the true ICE killer if Munro (and my layman's intuition) is right regarding manufacturing efficiency. Do you have any thoughts on a brand I am missing as a serious contender? And who can we count out of the race?

Do you have any opinions if lithium miners are worth digging into? It is clear that demand will only trend upwards, massively so, but the issue is that Li is actually quite abundant and there's no telling that the offer won't be able to follow and keep the prices flat. There's also cobalt plays but those are even more of a crapshoot given battery R&D and innovation. Battery day might be enlightening on what the future holds, hopefully.

So, it's safe to say in the short term they have enough cash for their current liabilities each quarter (otherwise they'd be bleeding cash).\n\nSo, I assume you're talking about their mid and long term debt, like bonds? I keep seeing people bring up the bonds they have due and \"how will they make their payments\", except a lot of people don't seem to realize that a significant amount of their upcoming bonds are convertible, at prices that are in-the-money, meaning at this point they're far more like equity than like debt (reducing the leverage) and Tesla won't even need to use cash to settle them (though they will dilute the shares a bit, of course).\n\n[A list of Tesla bonds](http://cbonds.com/organisations/emitent/36905):\n\n* Tesla 1.25% Mar 2021 convertibles $1.38 billiion in volume\n* Tesla 2.375% Mar 2022 convertibles $0.850 billion in volume\n* Tesla 2% May 2024 convertibles $1.6 billion in volume\n* Tesla 5.3% Aug 2025 [not convertible] $1.8 billion in volume\n\nSo, of that $5.63 billion in that list, $3.83 billion of it will likely convert to equity, and the rest isn't due until mid-2025.
