He makes a great case for $427 (which is why he sold on its first rocket to $640) but has rewritten his valuation so that you can add up the parts and see what you come up with yourself.\n\nRather than be a crazy bull or bear, give us your thoughts on these projections and where you think they are too optimistic or to pessimistic.
