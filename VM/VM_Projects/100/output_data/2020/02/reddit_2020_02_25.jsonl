{"title": "Quick analysis on the $SPCE bubble", "selftext": "So everyone here probably knows that Virgin Galactic has their earnings coming out today, and I believe that their stock will take a huge hit from the news.\n\nFirst thing first, Virgin Galactic has almost no future with competition squeezing them from both sides. While Blue Origin is slowly making progress with their rocket, starting in 2021 SpaceX will be offering week-long space flights to paying passengers.\n\nThat is a huge problem for VG, why would anyone pay for a 5 minute trip that doesn't even take you to orbit when they could spend almost a week in space, and get a limited edition model x with that too.\n\nNext, there is the risk. VG currently only has one spacecraft, which is their second one total. Their first spacecraft was lost due to pilot error, killing one of the pilots and seriously injuring the other. Of anything happens to that one spacecraft VG will be out of business for a while and will lose customers to safer companies.\n\nFinally I come to the profitability. When passengers pay 250k per flight, using the maximum capacity of the spaceship their yearly revenue will only be 700 million, but that's only if the other costs didn't exist. VG has to pay money for fuel, maintenance, airport access, training, pilots, insurance, rnd, and many more operational costs. This leads me to believe that VG will never become a profitable company. There is too much competition closing in, and the small launch market is already cornered by Rocket Lab.\n\nVG has no special technology that no other company can replicate, their spaceship is basically just a plane with a rocket motor attached, and their lack of innovation will probably be the end of them.\n\nIn conclusion I believe that unless they have a change in plans VG can never become a profitable company, and that their market will be stolen by the likes of SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n\n\n\nHey guys,\nThanks for reading! I'd love to hear your opinion about VG, and if it will be able to hold its current $7 billion valuation or if it will come crashing back to earth.\n\n\nUpdates:\nEstimated revenue is 0.75 million\nEstimated loss of -0.21 c per share\n(Their valuation is 7 billion)\nFixed autocorrect spelling", "id": "f9e7gu", "created_utc": 1582653493.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "You\u2019re right, but does that mean it will go down tomorrow?
