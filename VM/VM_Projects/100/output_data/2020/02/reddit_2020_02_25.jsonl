{"title": "Quick analysis on the $SPCE bubble", "selftext": "So everyone here probably knows that Virgin Galactic has their earnings coming out today, and I believe that their stock will take a huge hit from the news.\n\nFirst thing first, Virgin Galactic has almost no future with competition squeezing them from both sides. While Blue Origin is slowly making progress with their rocket, starting in 2021 SpaceX will be offering week-long space flights to paying passengers.\n\nThat is a huge problem for VG, why would anyone pay for a 5 minute trip that doesn't even take you to orbit when they could spend almost a week in space, and get a limited edition model x with that too.\n\nNext, there is the risk. VG currently only has one spacecraft, which is their second one total. Their first spacecraft was lost due to pilot error, killing one of the pilots and seriously injuring the other. Of anything happens to that one spacecraft VG will be out of business for a while and will lose customers to safer companies.\n\nFinally I come to the profitability. When passengers pay 250k per flight, using the maximum capacity of the spaceship their yearly revenue will only be 700 million, but that's only if the other costs didn't exist. VG has to pay money for fuel, maintenance, airport access, training, pilots, insurance, rnd, and many more operational costs. This leads me to believe that VG will never become a profitable company. There is too much competition closing in, and the small launch market is already cornered by Rocket Lab.\n\nVG has no special technology that no other company can replicate, their spaceship is basically just a plane with a rocket motor attached, and their lack of innovation will probably be the end of them.\n\nIn conclusion I believe that unless they have a change in plans VG can never become a profitable company, and that their market will be stolen by the likes of SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n\n\n\nHey guys,\nThanks for reading! I'd love to hear your opinion about VG, and if it will be able to hold its current $7 billion valuation or if it will come crashing back to earth.\n\n\nUpdates:\nEstimated revenue is 0.75 million\nEstimated loss of -0.21 c per share\n(Their valuation is 7 billion)\nFixed autocorrect spelling", "id": "f9e7gu", "created_utc": 1582653493.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "You\u2019re right, but does that mean it will go down tomorrow?

Once those few thousand or maybe 10 thousand go, are they going to want to go again? It's not even really \"space tourism\" or whatever tf they're calling it. It's a plane that goes really high up to the edge of space, you aren't visiting other planets or some shit.

They are a distant 3rd compared to SpaceX and Blue Origin.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Can you elaborate on why?\n\nBlue Origin is way behind SpaceX.  I don't believe they have even gotten an orbital launch yet. SpaceX is more focused on government contracts, but sure, they have said they will take people to space. That puts them in the same boat as VG. Except SX is tiring to send people for a week, and they are going to have strict physical requirements. Not just anyone can take off in a vertical lift platform and then stay a week in space.  SpaceShipTwo is not as physically demanding and the entire VG experience is designed to be less straining on the body and more enjoyable. Thats a big reason why they are suborbital.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "A 5 minute skim of the upper atmosphere is not a big draw, when Spacex will be giving you a full lap in orbit, blue origin has the same capability but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve announced the exact plan. out of the 3, virgin galactic seems the least commercially viable, especially when considering larger payload contracts.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It depends on what the price points are. I think VG is going to look like a discount compared to the pricing for SX. BO says they will be closer. But look at their reentry. They come down in a capsule with a parachute which makes for a rougher landing. Not very high class for the type of people that want to do this stuff. Not saying there isn\u2019t a market for it, but I think that is a separate group of people than what VG is catering towards. Also, VG\u2019s platform is more easily incorporated into traditional runways meaning the infrastructure for takeoff and landing is already in place all around the world.\n\nI completely see where you\u2019re coming from but I wouldn\u2019t look at what these companies are offering as being the same product. They are variations to the concept of going to space. It\u2019s more realistic and will allow for a bigger customer base when you have limited physical requirements, greater areas to be serviced, and a more enjoyable, luxurious experience. \n\nThanks for clarifying your thoughts", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I thought about it a bit, I think the market for space tourists will be small, for awhile. Wealthy space tourist ticket buyers will skew toward adventurous/high risk type individuals. The company that proves it can land safely, often, and provides the most impressive experience overall will take the lion share of the profits regardless of cost and \u201ccomfortable landing\u201d experience, at least for the first 5 years. \n\nPhysical earthly requirements don\u2019t impress me. Honestly that came off as a negative in the recent quarterly call. If a ticket to space is $250k, what\u2019s another 1-3k first class plane ticket. A luxurious terrestrial flight would just be included if that became a factor. \n\nThat early accident will hurt SPCE sales for sure. Even if they have it all figured out now, demand will be cautious. Especially vs spacex if they execute plans to start shuttling humans to ISS this year. \n\nBlue origin is still a wildcard.
