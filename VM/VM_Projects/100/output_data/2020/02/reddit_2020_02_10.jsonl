{"title": "The GOAT Hedge Fund: Renaissance Technologies", "selftext": "Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.\n\nFounded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average annual gross return of 66.1% since 1988.\n\nWith an average annual net return of 39.1% after fees.\n\nThe Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.\n\nSince, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.\n\nNow, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).\n\nMedallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.\n\nNotice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.\n\nIn 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%\n\n**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.\n\nThat certainly beats inflation...\n\nSo, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?\n\n**PART 1: The Early Stages**\n\nEarly on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.\n\nRemember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,\u201d Simons said. \u201cA pure system without humans interfering.\u201d\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus\u2019 was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator\u2019s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman\u2019s calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**", "id": "f1o73u", "created_utc": 1581328649.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Rentech is around the block from me, but you would never know it unless you were looking for them.

From the partial differential equation in the model, known as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, one can deduce the Black\u2013Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the option has a unique price regardless of the risk of the security and its expected return (instead replacing the security's expected return with the risk-neutral rate). The formula led to a boom in options trading and provided mathematical legitimacy to the activities of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and other options markets around the world. It is widely used, although often with some adjustments, by options market participants.Based on works previously developed by market researchers and practitioners, such as Louis Bachelier, Sheen Kassouf and Ed Thorp among others, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes demonstrated in the late 1960s that a dynamic revision of a portfolio removes the expected return of the security, thus inventing the risk neutral argument.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Or are you saying you don't know that you need to calculate the, and good grief there isn't a word for it, but \"volatility and rational equvilance of price based on volume\" is about as close as i can get.", "score": -6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35003456473350525}, {"body": "Sure.

Big returns for a small investment is the Grail. But options as an instrument can be used for a few things, and one of those things is to capitalize on movement without using the capital for the underlying asset. \n\nYou should really look up some explanations of the Greeks (https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/ is one) but what we're looking at today is Delta. What the Delta value tells you is how much your option price will change when the asset price increases by $1.00. For calls this value ranges from 0 to 100, for puts -100 to 0. \n\nThe further in the money an option is, the closer to parity (Delta 100, 1:1 increase) with the underlying it is. So, if you want to get x100 leverage without buying 100 of the asset, what you do is buy deep ITM calls and pay a fraction for the leverage. Little risk of losing your premium because it's very unlikely to expire out of the money.\n\nBut wait! Why buy short-dated calls if you just have to be in the money? Well, I'm glad you asked. That's where the other Greeks have a hand in it. Theta, time decay, does two things: the biggest piece is that it eats away your premium's *extrinsic value* (uncertain value, value that can't really be calculated) every day. You could say it's an uncertainty tax. The longer dated your option, the more time you have for movement, so you're punished less for holding. As you approach expiration, theta increases and your premium gets chunked into oblivion. But the other function of theta is to bring Delta into line as less of a curve and more of a binary cliff, 0 for OTM and 100 for ITM. Where two months out a $50 call for a stock trading at $51 might have a Delta of .68, a day or two before expiry it might have a Delta of .98 or .99. This is related to Theta because with two months left, a change of $1.00 makes less difference than the same change with a day left. \n\nSo! Putting it all together, why to buy a short dated in-the-money call? Maybe you want to speculate on an event upcoming like a court ruling or earnings call, or some other event that can't be predicted but you're *very sure* of the outcome. You want maximum exposure to movement, the highest Delta possible, but you don't want to lose money to Theta while you wait. So you pick up the option when as much extrinsic value has been eaten away as possible and you're trading on *intrinsic,* or measurable value. These are not meant to be held. \n\nHope this helps some! Delta and Theta are most of what you have to worry about, but Vega is important too, just not so much for this situation. Seriously, take half an hour and give a couple articles a look to make sure you understand what the Greeks have to do with your plays, if you do that you're already doing better than half of the traders out there. Somebody is left holding every option at expiry, and if you know why then it's less likely to be you. \n\nBesides that article I already linked, check out this one: https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You are awesome.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03647227585315704}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06154612451791763}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14583134651184082}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24891772866249084}], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06435206532478333}, {"body": "Up 84% on 7/17 $200C.

At 4pm, the market closed and your order was never filled. You might still want the order to be filled whenever it can the next day (in which case you'd want \"Good Till Cancelled\"), but maybe not - maybe by the time your order is able to fill the next day, the whole reason you wanted to buy would no longer be valid (say, MSFT is back down to 185, but now that it peaked and came back down, you're nervous).

Motherfuckin' Jim stayed on until August of 2018 and then peace'd the fuck out to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor. You know what AMD's stock price was in August of 2018? Twenty-Five-Fucking Dollars. Homeboy literally worked for three goddamn years and 10x'd on AMD.  \n\n\nSo August of 2018 he goes to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor when their stock price is around $7.50 and sneaky Jimbo goes and delivers a terrible earnings, tanks the price all the way down to $5 bucks so he can accumulate shares like the sly multi-millionaire fucker he is.
