To me, the exit strategy also counts a little towards deciding on investing more in a company.\n\nSo here goes: get yourself an exit strategy for Tesla, and include in it what conditions you'd  need to meet in order to invest even more into Tesla. If you believe Tesla can hit $15k per share in the next 5 years, or any number of years for that matter, that's a gain of more than 18x. Do you feel like you'd go long enough to see that kind of return? Your exit strategy could help answer this.\n\nFor me, I'm already at the limit of my savings, hanging onto emergency and vacation funds and that's about it. Any lower and I'm gonna earn too many more gray hairs for my liking. So I'm going to put a certain amount per paycheck into getting more shares.\n\nWhat I am trying to decide on now is should I invest now, or wait to see if Tesla dips for Q1 earnings - I don't want Tesla to be at a loss for Q1 but I think it is possible and I love how fickle some investors out there are. I wouldn't bet against Tesla, here I debate betting against the investors sentiment towards Tesla. Honestly though I feel there won't be that big of a difference even if it does dip due to Q1 results as I can't get my hands on that many more shares anyways.
