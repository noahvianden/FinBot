{"title": "$TMUS, $S, $SPCE and on and on gains for the day", "selftext": "A bunch of people have been messaging me about my gains from the $S and $TMUS merger I had posted about so I am making this post lazily to show.  Don't really feel like summarizing it all perfectly accurately so i'll post general summary and screenshots and y'all can see.  All-in-all was up $81k end of day max intraday was around $94k in the morning.  Not my best day ever but not going to complain either.\n\nIt is kind of hard to give all the exact numbers because I don't sell things all at once... but i will break down the summary for the day below.\n\nBest gain was as much as 12,500% on the option i screen shotted below.  I sold most between 11,600-12,000% and only one contract at 12,500% :(\n\nI messed up as I had $5,500 in calls that I had sold the day before on accident right at market close and couldn't correct it which would have netted around $12,000 extra profit.\n\n* **$TMUS -** $280 --> $16-17k\n* **$S** \\- $5,500 --> $68,000+-\n\nI have a lot of positions and make a lot of trades so it is hard to indicate the rest of the day, lol but needless to say I am not upset with where I landed.  Sold most of the $S and $TMUS - opened some shorts on $S even though prob not a good idea, etc.  Opened a bunch of new hedges and explored some new potential positions with some initial calls. Blah blah blah who cares.\n\nI always expect some loss throughout day as I am hedging various positions and do not go all in and YOLO like y'all love.  However, through a bit more modest gains held down by my hedges I have protected myself from losing everything and instead come out on top on multiple occasions.\n\nPosting my daily/weekly/monthly below as well.  Needless to say, it has been a decent 2020.  Started essentially trading using RH full time around Nov/December.\n\n# Previous Posts For Reference:\n\n* **$S/$TMUS Approval Thread -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1z8di/sprinttmobile\\_merger\\_expected\\_to\\_be\\_approved/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1z8di/sprinttmobile_merger_expected_to_be_approved/)\n* **$TMUS/$S Merger Tip / Discussion Thread -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezmvjf/tmus\\_tmobile\\_tendiezzzzzz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezmvjf/tmus_tmobile_tendiezzzzzz/)\n* **$BIIB gains post** \\-- nope I didn't tip on this one but it was my first post here since many months ago and first time on the site since then :-\\\\  - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezgprc/biib\\_tendies\\_goodness\\_and\\_love/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezgprc/biib_tendies_goodness_and_love/)\n\nOk I am sick of writing this, i'll edit and cleanup more later maybe... or maybe i wont... i dunno.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drsdw3a4deg41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=a04aa8d7b3918325de9e5b17723650f739281b8f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First jump was $BIIB patent decision \\($75k\\) second $S\\/$TMUS\\/today \\($81k\\)](https://preview.redd.it/76fnfxideeg41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b1de80e5744dfebe6e37d486a8533dab916d78)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First jump is $SPCE and a bunch of other stuff, then $BIIB, then $S\\/$TMUS](https://preview.redd.it/50skcfbheeg41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=77f7d5e9948c099980b30418b9e441ffad3b3ca0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[It is funny how in 3M the little tiny bumps on the left-hand used to be  significant gains...](https://preview.redd.it/xm3seniyeeg41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebede2b7d20dec257069f678aa9b3601711b4e8a)\n\n[This wasn't max but sold about 80&#37; of the $S at or around here.
