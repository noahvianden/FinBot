{"title": "SPCE - A Thorough Bearish Analysis", "selftext": " \n\nSPCE had a failed mission 5 years ago and blamed the pilot for the crash. \n\nCEO has said for the last 5 years that their SS2 aircrafts were set to launch each year, and of course, they always blamed contractors for not reaching \u201cmilestones\u201d to get it all going. \n\nHere\u2019s a summary of why it won\u2019t succeed and further analysis on the speculative market size that bulls argue:\n\nThey have 600 pre-orders. Why go for such a small number if they have the potential to capture a much large speculated market that the bulls are contending? If they are front runners in this race, they have early bird advantage to take in much more and backlog them if they need to. But why 600 with revenues of only 150M?\n\nMarket cap is currently 5B, which is 42x revenue. And what do the bulls say about this? \u201cStop looking at current revenue, they have a much larger market\u201d. Of who? Multi millionaires and billionaires? \u201cThen they have hypersonic travel for 2 hour travel to London.\u201d Who actually needs to get to London or any other country in 2 hours just to pay a gigantic premium when they can get a private jet and have a personalized/comfortable ride. Last I check, most execs, consultants, etc get to their destination days in advanced anyway.\n\nThen it comes to market cap. I can\u2019t tell if this is a joke, but I hear bull gang compare SPCE market size to Tesla, Spotify, IBM, Microsoft, Uber, Lyft, etc. I\u2019m not going to even have to explain this. The statement in itself has a high enough autistic frequency for even the lowest spectrum of autism to understand how retarded it is. Yes, buying an electric vehicle that will last for years, purchasing a music subscription, buying laptops and software, and getting a daily ride to work is equivalent to going to space for 250k.\n\nNow, when I say 250k, bulls says \"but they will reduce cost when they increase efficiency and have a fleet of 500 planes flying daily.\u201d Firstly, if they reduce cost, it won\u2019t be by significant margins. Why? Because space travel will not be cheap no matter how you put it. Cost of production won\u2019t change unless they can do it with cheap labor in China. Efficiency will be the same unless they hire a herd of engineers working 24/7. R&D will continue to cost more as they try to scale this with large carriers. Ffs, they took years just to get 2 damn planes right. You guys are out here talking about 500 planes. As for scalability. By the time they scale, if they even can, BlueOrigins and SpaceX would have listed and would be flying herds of middle class enthusiasts to space.\n\nNow on to the preorders and future orders. 600 pre-orders are not going to fly this year. They will be backlogged. Why? Because they don\u2019t own airspace. They can barely get their contractors in line with the schedule and you\u2019re expecting them to make 100 flights to the edge of space all in half a year? They expect Branson to be their first passenger on his birthday in July. Do the math. That would be nearly flying every two days from August-December. They have 2 aircrafts right now. Do you really think they are going to expose those two newly made (and still technically under progress) aircrafts under that much fly time? And do you have any idea how risky something like this would be? They aren\u2019t flying planes. Planes can fly all day every day with turbine engines and at low altitudes. We are talking about rocket fuel to the edge of space. And who's the grantee that none of these 100 flights will end in disaster. They blamed the one test flights on pilot error - what makes you think swarms of people would be confident with a company that blamed the crash on the pilot and not a lack of security protocols? Stop with this talk about how they are going to get all these pre-orders done and then add a huge list to the log. My guess, they might fulfill those 600 clients in the next two years. And have a backlog of irked clients that paid such a large deposit to sit around and wait like a saving account that returns -2% per year.\n\nAnd then the talk about hypersonic travel. You guys are talking about it like they have done it. That\u2019s a vision, not a reality. They can\u2019t even commercialize sub-hypersonic travel and they are talking about hypersonic travel at the forefront of this project as if it\u2019s reality. You\u2019re hearing an upbeat CEO trying to raise more capital. The reality is that they haven\u2019t even flown a crew to space yet. They haven't even had a full 6 passengers fly yet.\n\nAs for the newly released sec filing for the warrants. 31M shares. Bull gang is thinking, ah this is regulatory stuff, it won\u2019t get exercised. Literally two funds just filed for 11M on the same day. This is not a coincidence? They are listed for $11.50 per share. Institutions aren\u2019t going to be buying in at market price at this time. Those funds are buying at the warrant price and that\u2019s probably why it happened on the same day. It the share price holds above $18 for 7 more days, these warrants can be exercised. Dilution will almost certainly lead to a dump in this pumped stock. CEO needs money and it's pretty clear at this point why they proposed these 31M shares.

They issued those shares with a strike price of $11.50. The way warrants work is that they are like options, except, when exercised by the holder, the company issues new shares. The other difference is that the issuer can force their exercise. This is governed by the warrant agreement which is attached as exhibit 4 to their initial offering documents.\n\nThey are now forcing the exercise of the warrants they issued during the IPO. They are doing this on a cashless basis as discussed in section 3 and 6 of the Warrant Agreement. That means, instead of paying $11.50 to convert warrants to shares, holders will have their warrants converted to shares. \n\nThat is what the 31M shares are for-- SPCE wants to get rid of the outstanding warrants. This is not about raising money. It is about getting these warrants exercised now. They are using them to cover their obligation.\n\nAsk yourself, why would a company force the exercise of a warrant, especially one that does not expire until 2024?\n\nThe reason is pretty simple. Because you believe that the stock price is going to go up. Probably a lot. And you want to clear these things from the books as fast as you can.\n\nWhether this dilutes the stock actually depends on how much that dilution has already been priced in to the base stock. In this case, the existence of these warrants is known by all institutional investors and by most retail investors that follow the stock (the stock warrants have been discussed here already).\n\nAs to your other points-- this post is overly long already, but given some of the positions I have seen them hiring on their careers page, I think that their business model is shifting faster than previously anticipated.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I respect your opinion and analysis of the warrants, however, you should also think about why the warrants are being filed not instead of Feb 3rd when they reached the $18 milestone.

Filing when the stock is already at $30 makes no sense other than them seeing this as an opportunity to increase the outstanding float to milk this fomo.\nAlso, to the point of raising cash. It's pretty clear the company is going to need cash. They have been in R&D and production for 5 years and contractors are not cheap. They have failed to meet milestones year after year. I can't see this as anything other than dilution to raise cash. They took the deposit from the pre-orders and probably reinvested all of it by now. They need capital. At 196M outstanding float, the company does not have a lot of cash at all considering the max IPO price that tutes paid as seed money. You think this company can manage to only burn 1.4-1.5B in 5 years of developing a space tourism company and have an expensive staff of engineers, analysts, managers, etc? No way.\nAlso, many company's tend to have career pages with shill positions. It's not illegal but an open invitation to talent.

If the stock price each day is a completely random distribution with a standard deviation of $100 and a mean of $800 then buying everything on one day you will probably end up paying between $700 - $900 for the stock. If you paid $900 and it dips to $700 you got pretty screwed. On the other hand, if you purchase the stock over 10 (ideally) independent times then you will sometimes buy at $700, some at $900. The math works out that the standard deviation over all 10 trades is, std/sqrt(n) or $100/sqrt(10) so $31. Doing it this way you would likely end up paying between $770 to $830 for the stock, which is way closer to the \"true\" value of $800 and limits your exposure to the short term wildness. \n\nOn the other hand, doing 10 purchases takes time. If the true value is constantly going up, then even if you end up paying $900 all at once that may be cheaper than spreading out purchases.

{"title": "Why don't more people just risk MORE capital and buy long term call options with the closest strike price from the current price?", "selftext": "For example, why not just buy a long-term call option (an actual good legitimate proven company that\u2019s clearly poised for more growth such as MSFT or VISA) that expires January 2021 with the closest strike price from the current share price? Yes, the option price is going to be expensive but assuming you have somewhat of a significant capital to play with (let\u2019s say at least 30 grand or beyond), wouldn\u2019t it be relatively easy to rack in $1000+ profits once your strike price hits or it goes above? Why don\u2019t more people do this as there\u2019s very very minimal risk to it?\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say I buy a MSFT call option that expires January 15th 2021 with the price per option being roughly $13.43 and I buy 22 contracts (x 100), which would equate to about $29,540. I can bet my fingers, toes, and testicles that MSFT will reach $195 SOMETIME before January 15th 2021 (They say only death and taxes are guaranteed, but come on, let\u2019s be real, this is a guarantee). Fine, worst case scenario, let\u2019s say it takes another 1-2 months for MSFT to reach $195 \u2013 still, if I wait 1-2 months and it\u2019s at $198, I\u2019ll still make over $9K, which I\u2019ll be very happy with. Is this not a viable strategy if you have the capital? Why don\u2019t more people just risk more capital on long term call options with the closest strike price from the current price? Am I missing something here? If I understand correctly, you can hold your position for as long as you can before the expiration date and sell whenever you want once MSFT reaches $195+.", "id": "f5c9na", "created_utc": 1581960867.0, "score": 106, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "For that you need a brain.

{"title": "Some basic tools for your toolkit so you stop losing money on expired options", "selftext": "Since it's a holiday and we're all bored anyway I'm going to give you some *very* basic things to think about before you open a position. Who am I? I'm just a random dude with some business and finance education. I have had limited success and failures (over the past two years I've been up 90% and down 60%), but the key is that I *haven't cashed out of the game yet*. So, if you're looking for ways to justify your gambling addiction, read on. If you want to be the one retard who learns something today and not the 9 retards posting stupid shit in the comments, read on.\n\nToday I've picked a nice mix of glaring WSB faults and interesting things:\n\n1. Risk and reward expectations\n2. Stock and Options packages (ETFs and multilegs)\n3. Research aka Due diligence (DD)\n\nLet's dive in friendos!\n\n**Risk and reward expectations** \\- Generally investment managers, financiers, and traders gauge their performance for a quarter or year based on how they did **relative to the market**. So if the S&P 500 only grows 6% in a year, a trader is successful if they made 9% gain that year. If the S%P 500 grows 20% like in 2019, you could literally just park your money in stocks and sell a year later for 20% gain, no skill involved. **Historically, the market has grown 10%** ***a year.*** I mention this in bold because most newcomers here really need to have their risk/reward expectations reframed. Usually the rewards are directly related to the risk that you lose everything. Doubling your money with a yolo call position is *incredibly risky and you are likely to lose all of your money*. This isn't a bear/bull thing (which is fucking stupid anyway. Imagine gambling/investing based on a fucking animal mascot). Pouring your money into shares of an S&P 500 index is much more safe and likely to preserve your money. I think there is a big contingent of big brained smarties on this board who want much more risk and reward than buying shares, but don't want to fuck in the dark on WSB meme options. If you are ok making 5-10% a week instead of 5-10% a year, read on.\n\n**Stock and options packages** \\- Stocks get packaged up by companies and resold to you in two ways: mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are pretty much the same thing - a bundle of stocks that you buy into - except ETFs are... exchange-traded aka sold as shares. Why do companies do this? To hedge against the risk we talked about before!\n\nWe need to digress for a second into different kinds of risk. If you had 0 toleration for risk, if you wanted a virtual guarantee of not losing money, how can you invest? You can buy **US Treasury bonds.** The rate of return on US treasury bonds is literally called *the risk-free rate* in finance and is about 1.6%/year or something right now. Pitiful. In our desire to see bigger returns *we must take on bigger risks.* There is **firm specific risk** related to the operations and financing of a specific firm ($BABA, $MSFT, $ADI). Let's say we didn't want to deal with this risk. We just want to take advantage of their growth of an industry, sector, or the market as a whole, without getting burned by the mistakes of any one individual firm. Then we can *diversify away* *firm-specific risk* and deal only with **market risk** by purchasing shares of every company in an industry, sector, or market. So State Street Global Advisors purchases a weighted average of the S&P 500 and sells that package to you as $SPY. Any one success or failure in the S&P 500 doesn't make SPY move much; it moves the way the market moves in general.\n\nOk, so, there are indexes/ETFs for everything. Whole market, biotech, manufacturing, industrial power, you name it. These are incredibly successful products - $SPY, $TQQQ, $PEY - because they are less risky and move slower than the individual stocks in the funds. What's the deal with options packages? **Options packages hedge risk in exchange for lower returns and are available on Robinhood (but never take the pre-built offered packages)**. Take a second at this point to go to investopedia and get a handle on spreads - you'll see things like Bull/Bear Put/Call credit/debit spread.\n\nWith these risk hedges, **Options spreads on index ETFs are the right risk and return for me**.\n\nLets do an example with a single stock share:\n\nSo let's say you have a belief that $MSFT is going up, but you don't want to *risk* everything on straight calls that could expire worthless in a week. You have some *options* (pun intended). You can reduce your risk by changing the rules - open a *bull put (credit) spread* so that you don't need $MSFT to go up, you just need it to not go down. Or you can lower the cost of your calls (and the reward) by opening a *bull call (debit) spread.* What I love about these is that the only cost/collateral RH requires is that difference between strikes in a spread. For instance, I have a SPY bull put spread right now with strikes at 330 and 329 - RH required $100 in collateral and gave me 12 dollars credit when I opened it (the difference between selling to open the 330 put and buying to open the 329 put), and I think I can close it out this week for a cost of 5 dollars, netting me 7$ on my 100. That doesn't sound flashy except that *7% a week is literally rich people insaneo gains on a relatively safe bet.* If you've read this far, my secret volatility play this week is opening a condor tomorrow on $ADI and closing it after earnings. EPS is estimated to be pretty low, but the firm's operating cycle is absolutely solid, so I think it'll move sideways on the news and we're going to make money on the IV crush. $1 spreads on the low and high ends, with strikes roughly 6% out of the money. Open it for 30 bucks credit tomorrow, close it for 15 bucks debit on Thursday.\n\n**Due Diligence** \\- DD is more art than science, and it's going to look different for stocks than for options, but in either case often the only difference between sweating nervously for a week while you look for a way to not lose so much, and relaxing confidently in your purchase, is 15 minutes of research. **The price of a share is related to the performance of the firm, even in 2020.** If you're trying to do DD on a specific firm as an amatuer, you want to look at 3 things - Quarterly/annual reports of earnings, analyst opinions, and the sector as a whole. Let's take $MSFT for example: Big revenue growth each year for the past decade, analysts say that Azure and Teams are solid products, and the tech sector is growing, so there's room for $MSFT to go up without having to take market share from competitors. That info took me 5 minutes to find, and with it I'm very confident that purchasing shares of $MSFT is a good idea. You can usually go to a company's website to find their financial information in a government tax filing form called a 10-k, but that can be pretty dense. You're looking for a page called the Balance Sheet.\n\nAnyway, hope you had a good read and learned something.

I wonder if we are having some communication difficulty - \"short/long iron condor\" doesn't quite make sense to me. An iron condor has both \"short\" and \"long\" positions in a single condor. For **options**, the word \"short\" is essentially synonymous with \"Sell to open\" and \"long\" is synonymous with \"Buy to open\". \"Open\" means to create or enter into a position, where \"close\" means just that, to exit a position. So in a condor where the underlying stock has a price right now of say $335, you're selling to open a put at a strike of say $331, and buying to open a put at a strike of say $330, to create a *put credit spread.* AND you're selling to open a call at say $339 and buying to open a call at say $340 to create a *call credit spread.* This position is great because you get both spreads for the same collateral. Think about it - you can't have the underlying share price move both *below* the put spread and *above* the call spread.\n\nThe inverse of an iron condor would either be a *straddle*, where you buy a call and a put with the same strike price, or a *strangle* where you create both a *put debit spread*  below the price of a share, and a *call debit spread* above the price of a share.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just found out today (I\u2019m literally like a week into learning about options) the buy to open and sell to open, as well as your other points in paragraph one. \n\nTo clarify short iron condor versus long iron condor, here\u2019s what my research, that I referenced above, showed:\n\n**SPY Short Iron Condor**:     \nThinkorswim (TOS) what it looks like:    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/VBDbaOJ    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/nVmZ5w6\n\nBuy (aka long) Put 329.   \nSell (aka short) Put 330\n\nSell (aka short) Call 343.   \nBuy (aka long) Call 344 \n\n* Max profit made when stock price stays in-between the short put and short call:    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/opGwzsO\n\n* Max loss when stock price is higher than long call or lower than long put \n* Useful when don\u2019t think stock is volatile; think stock will stay within a certain price. \n* Useful for limiting losses (lowering risk) with a non-volatile stock \n\nFurther explanations with examples: \n* https://www.projectoption.com/short-iron-condor/\n* https://www.projectoption.com/iron-condor-options-strategy/\n\n\n**SPY Long Iron Condor**:    \nTOS what it looks like:     \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/4weYIXi    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/P32Lzs4\n\nSell (aka short) Put 329.   \nBuy (aka long) Put 330 \n\nBuy (aka long) Call 343.   \nSell (aka short) Call 344\n\n* Max profit made when stock price moves higher than short call or when price moves lower than short put:    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/3a7OVDR\n\n* Max loss made when stock price stays in-between long put and long call \n* Useful when high volatility in stock but don\u2019t know which direction \n* Useful for limiting losses (lowering risk) with a volatile stock price \n\nFurther explanations with examples: \n* https://www.projectoption.com/long-iron-condor\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n**these examples do not include risk of assignment, dividend, or commission cost", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7776844501495361}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5665468573570251}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5177847743034363}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.686988890171051}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3457965850830078}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34933608770370483}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23388569056987762}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1962851881980896}, {"body": "It's not that interesting to even post a position.

My understanding - from what I\u2019ve read - is that this filing requires that warrant holders for 30M shares of SPCE will need to exercise their warrants (which will turn them into shares of common stock) by  next week or they will be recalled. Assuming that this is correct, my concern is that this influx of shares into the float will result in significant share dilution.

Read that again because it was a confusing sentence to type, let alone read. I'm not going to explain what a standard deviation means, it's a general statistics concept that you can research. The important thing is that the historic volatility can be calculated from historical prices.
