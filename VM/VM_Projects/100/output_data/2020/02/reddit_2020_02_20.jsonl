Do you dump right after  or continue to hold?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">How do options behave on acquisition news\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n\"In the case of a buyout offer, where a set amount is offered per share, this effectively limits how high the shares will go, assuming that no other offers come in and the offer is likely to be accepted. So, if the offer price is below the strike price of the call option, the option can easily lose most of its value. On the other hand, options with a strike price below this offer price will see a jump in value.\n\nFor example, on Dec.\u00a04, 2006, Station Casinos received a buyout offer from its management for $82 per share. Looking at the change in the value of the options that day gives a clear indication that some call option holders made out well while others were hit hard. On that day, the Jan 09 options with a strike price of $70, which was well below the offer price of $82, rose from $11.40 to $17.30\u2014a 52% increase. On the other hand, Jan 09 options with a strike price of $90, which is above the $82 offer price, fell from $3.40 to $1\u2014a 71% loss.\"\n\nThe thing I'm wondering about is the $S and $TMUS merger - I think this is an outlier case due to having to get the deal pushed through by the Government? And this is why $S continues to go up beyond the offered and accepted buyout price. I'd love more of an explanation on it though, because I don't fully understand it (clearly).", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6637789011001587}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.004052482545375824}, {"body": "Dope news!
