Waymo's first fully self-driving trip on a public road was in 2015.  They're currently working on things like nonverbal communication with opposing cyclists while making unprotected lefts, and the consumer angle of \"where exactly do people want to be picked up in a busy downtown supermarket parking lot?\"  They're incredibly risk averse.

I would love it to suddenly be fully autonomous.\n\nAnd none of this is relevant at all to this thread.  I watched autonomy day.  I enjoyed the presentation immensely.

Not wanting to rehash this discussion, is not a sign of weakness of mind.\n\nEDIT: I can't keep myself from responding.\n\n> Also the presentation explained why simulation data was nowhere near as valuable.\n\nWhat happens when you show a 5 year old who has never seen a squirrel, a squirrel?  One particular 5 year old responded \"haha funny kitty\".  Their parent responded \"no, honey, that's a squirrel\".  The kid responds \"Oh WOW\".  Now the kid knows what a squirrel is.\n\nThis type of learning from a single example is something AGI will be able to do.  If I were to make this argument on an ML forum, people would respond with how \"it's not a meaningful distinction because we can permute input data via simulation and train the AI on every angle of what a squirrel looks like, until it understands\".  This is why simulation is critical.  Tesla also does simulation.  The argument against simulation is arguing that you need super high fidelity, real-world data, to base the simulation on.  It's not an argument against simulation.\n\nNow, I recognize that Tesla has a lot more data, but it's also much lower fidelity (no LiDAR).  And Waymo has a lot more purposeful data.  They know where they are weak, and they purposely put the car in those situations.  Whereas as a Tesla driver, I tend to disengage autopilot when the car can't handle it.\n\nIt's a different approach.  **My disagreement with you on the quality of the difference, does not imply that I don't understand.**  This is the only point I'm making, in this edit.\n\nEDIT2: To be clear, the thing I'm tired about is Waymo dragging their feet.
