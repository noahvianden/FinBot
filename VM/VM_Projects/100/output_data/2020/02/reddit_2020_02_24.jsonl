I'm currently writing a video and I have try to explain where this $4T come from and if it's plausible. My conclusion was that even if that happen T$LA should worth $3T, not 4. I let you with my reasoning. ( Sorry in advance for my bad english and for the text that is \\*normally\\* made for a video and not for Reddit)\n\n>Even for a very successful Auto and Robotaxi Company, $4T seems very high. Let's start to see how much the Auto Business could worth. If we imagine that Investor think that Tesla could have a 50% market share in Europe & North America with a 30% gross margin. Of course this will not happen in 2024 but investor are betting in future capabilities. ( so here is my calculation, all north America and Europa public auto company are worth $1T dollar. The average gross profit is 15%, so if Tesla can do twice this, they could worth $1T) However this doesn't count the sales drop due to the robotaxi  \nNow let's evaluate the FSD Business. Waymo, which is in good track to achieve, is currently worth \\~ 200 Billion. If we say that tesla robotaxi will be 10X better ( not just for the service) we obtain that this part of the business will worth 2 Trillion Dollars. In a other document from ARK they said that the company that operate a Robotaxi Network with a 60% fee and that the miles stay flat ( this probably be the case with Tesla because the service will be in a few regions only)would worth $2T in 2030. So we obtain that Tesla would worth 3 trillion, not 4. We also have exclude the energy business just like ARK did.\n\nIf you could say whether I am Wrong or Ark Is .

Living in Europe and not being rich I wish the Cybertruck reveal had been the Model 2 reveal, because that's the car I can actually afford.

Eventually tech in the car will be rolled out. \n\nElon has one true dream. Colony in Mars. Every single one of his companies was developed to further that dream.

The check is being pushed to the Tesla customers, in return they get a cool freaking truck.\n\nLowering price of rockets will lower price of payload, lower cost of sending payload will lower the cost of making starlink a reality.

Obviously we can only speculate, but my thoughts is that the logical (IMO) gameplan is to use the CT to learn about this method of production and reduce opex and capex for a truly mass produced model 2/cybercar on that DNA. Going straight to a Cybercar wouldn't make sense, it *will*(/would) cannibalize the model the 3 and the Y, just announcing it could wreck the sales. When they unveil it, they need to be able to massproduce it (7 figures) freshly out of the gate. The CT is a perfect practice ground, it lends itself well to the odd design (looks badass and tough) and has a relatively premium pricetag. This way they can figure out the quirks of the work methods, get *it* thru production hell (it will be though) and with that knowledge be able to iterate on it properly plan a compact car with this design. We know from Munro's insights that the estimated capex is 10x lower than body-on-frame, that is the next car generation which'll put Tesla on price parity with basic ICE (combined with some battery improvements) and achieve proper car volume without requiring the company to go into $200B debt to produce 7-8 figures of cars. But it's also very hard per Musk, so they need that training ground first.\n\nRegarding Mars, IMO Musk's goal with Tesla is to maximizing his net worth and cash out to fund Mars.

Unless the goal is to idle for years while waiting for FSD to happen, in which case I'll regret my investment, CT is the first step towards Tesla rapidly increasing volume.
