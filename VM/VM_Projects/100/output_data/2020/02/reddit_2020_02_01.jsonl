The only caveat to that is the risk of holding them past the earnings announcement at the end of April.

It is really up to Tesla if they want to do some magic with regulatory credits and fsd feature complete recognition of profits to help prop up the margins. Model y capital spend is still not nearly complete.  Elon  Musk said that fsd feature complete would occur in two months, so I would bet against any additional recognition of profits from that in the first quarter.  Prior to the quarterly profit, I was holding 700 feb 21 2020 calls and sold them for $13 prior to close on January 29. They only went up to $14 on Thursday and I rebought them at $11 on Friday morning. \nI also made the mistake of buying 710 jan 31 2020 calls for 3.50 and holding them over the weekend prior to earnings. They lost more than half their value over the weekend and I ended up selling them for 1.50 or less.  I will not do that again. (At least 2 weeks or more out from earnings or very close to the money if it\u2019s a weekly call. Also, look at the volume on the calls. Don\u2019t pick one with very little volume.

It only gives you the current bid and ask, but not day high and low. Once you buy it, it gives you those stats. So you might want to spread your buys over several orders.

For example if I wanted 18k of tsla exposure I could just buy 1 of those calls instead of 18k worth. \n3. Options have something called intrinsic value. Essentially the bet.
