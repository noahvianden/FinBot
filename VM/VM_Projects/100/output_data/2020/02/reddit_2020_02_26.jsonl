{"title": "Volatility for Autists", "selftext": "I know most of you autists haven't been trading for long enough to know a 6% drawdown from a true market crash, so the market conditions the past couple days might be new to you. But some of us have been around the block before, and if you're going to trade options and not get absolutely destroyed, you need to know about *volatility*.\n\n**I'm a dumbass who's been trading options without knowing anything about them. What's volatility?**\n\nVolatility, or vol for short, is a measure of how much a stock price (or anything) moves around. If you want to get technical about it, it's the standard deviation of log returns, but that won't be on the test.\n\nTraders divide vol into two types: *realized vol*, or how much the stock has moved around in the recent past, and which can be calculated exactly; and *implied vol*, how much the stock is expected to move around in the future, which is unknown.\n\nAssuming you're trading options, implied vol, or IV for short, is the kind you need to know about, because it deeply affects the price of an option.\n\n**Oh yeah, I've heard of implied vol before.**\n\nYep, if you hold an options position on Robinhood, it'll tell you what the IV is. You also can, and should, look at what the IV is based on the quoted bid-ask before you buy or sell options. If you have a Bloomberg terminal or a big boy brokerage account, you might even be able to visualize the \"vol surface,\" which plots IV for a stock across a variety of strikes and expirations.\n\nThe important thing is that, assuming the price of the underlying stock stays the same (and ignoring theta), the price of an option *only increases* as IV increases, and *only decreases* as IV decreases. It's a \"monotonic function,\" which is another math term that will not be on the test. The point is that you can think of IV as a re-scaled version of the price of an option. \n\nYou might also have heard of the VIX.\n\n**Yeah, some people shorted it and blew up hilariously.**\n\nRight. The VIX is a single number meant to represent the implied volatility of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. It was invented after the '87 crash and is calculated using the prices of options on the index. About 15 years ago people started trading VIX *futures*, or making bets on volatility. Nowadays you can trade ETFs that hold long or short VIX futures, although I wouldn't really recommend it.\n\nAnyway, VIX isn't perfect -- it doesn't do a great job of predicting actual volatility, and some people think it's being manipulated. But it's the best single number that represents **how much people are willing to pay to be long vol.**\n\nAnyway, the VIX closed 2019 at 13.46. It closed Friday at 17.08, Monday at 25.03, and today at 27.85.\n\n**What does this mean for me?**\n\nSince option prices are tightly related to IV, any time you buy an option, you're going long vol, and any time you sell one you're going short vol. (How much the price of your option moves around with volatility is measured by a number called *vega*, and if you're a real nerd, another number called *vomma*. Not on the test.) So if you bought options last week, congratulations! Your long bet on volatility has paid off! Don't you feel like a winner?\n\nWell, no, probably not, if you're not a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. (If you are, then my sincere congratulations, now fuck off.) But you might if your options expire longer than a few weeks out, and the market recovers. If you're tempted to buy options *right now*, you should keep in mind that you're paying twice as much for the volatility as you were a couple months ago. And if selling options seemed like a good idea last month, it should seem like an even better idea now -- assuming you can handle getting assigned, at least.\n\nGood luck out there, autists.

The VIX almost always follows a drop because everyone has such a mega hardon for the bull market that \"up\" is seen as the default state of stonks and is therefore \"not volatile\", while \"down\" = the end times. So if you are selling options (to close or open) after the market drops, volatility will almost certainly be higher and that is a good time to be selling. You want to buy options before the market drops when vol is still low.\n\nSide note about \"up = totally not volatile\": if you were paying attention last week you might have noticed that we were in a bit of a silly melt-up but VIX was still around $14 not even up 7% from the beginning of the year, before the beer virus started memeing on everyone.

Look at the founder of /wsb himself, sitting there in his suit and tie on his Amazon.com profile picture, mouth agape, hasn't showered in days, you're not sure which eye to make contact with.

We have people on here who went to the top Ivy league schools basically bending over and slapping each other in the balls as though they went to State School, like me.  There's no holy magic credentials that help you predict the future here in life.
