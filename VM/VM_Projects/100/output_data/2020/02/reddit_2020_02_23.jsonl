If you were scared a week ago, then fine. I would understand that. Let me show you autists some numbers to show you what I am talking about here.\n\nAt the beginning of february, the average amount of new confirmed cases was around \\~3000 per day. This was also at a time where we did not really know the recovery rates yet, and the KD ratio of Coronavirus was 3 recovered, 1 died. The recovery rate was at about 200 per day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo at the beginning of february we have 3k per day getting sick, and 200 per day getting healthy, with a KDA of 3 to 1. And you autists are out there wearing your party hats and doing cocaine off of strippers bootycheeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that was 20 days ago so let's look at what has been happening with the coronavirus now! \n\nThe KDA of Coronavirus has dropped down to 21,2k recovered vs 2,3k deaths, which would make the coronavirus kicked out of any halo lobby. The daily increase of sick people has been sinking from a high of 2k to a low of 400, orbiting around an average of \\~700. The amount of recoveries are at this time outpacing the amount of newly infected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats why I say, if you were worried about this virus one or two weeks ago, I would totally understand BUT what is actually happening is that this virus is turning out to be not so bad after all (just like all the viruses end up, basically)..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease give me your autistic viewpoint of this if you are a market trader who is alpha like me.

So far before last week, the virus is mostly contained in China. Last week the spread into South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran worsened a lot.\n2. The impact to economy, before last week, is contained in China as well, which would show up in the Q2 reports. A lot of people like me believed the bad news won't hit until April so the stock market is relatively steady for now. However Apple cuts their Q2 estimates very early and Wall Street annalist are cutting their estimates across the board. News comes earlier than expected and caught a lot of people off guard.\n3. Previously we knew Africa is fucked but it doesn't matter because other viruses kills millions of people over there annually no matter what.\n4. Japan and SK are the major concerns because evidences show they are repeating the Wuhan city's earlier pattern. The only difference is, their government lacks the execution of the Chinese to take the extreme measures to control the spread so as it progresses it will be considerably worse than the current China, unless more effective cure or vaccine is invented in time, which doesn't look promising at the moment. \n5. Moreover, SK and Japan's central banks lack the capacity to bail out economy as the China central bank is current doing.\n6. Sadly, US central bank isn't 100% confident, either.\n7. You see things are getting better because China is doing better and virus is only China's problem so far. But China would make the earliest exit of it and the rest of the world is just starting to burn.\n8. IMO the best case is, Japan and SK panics first so that money rushes to US and keeps the US market afloat. Worst case, everyone is down together.\n9. Either way Q2 is ugly and I really don't think the market can get away with it by itself.
