{"title": "Buy Hasbro Today", "selftext": "Hasbro Earnings are next week.\n\nFor the virgins without tiny demons living in your household, this is your reminder that they have recently taken Magic the Gathering to a digital F2P release that has been wildly successful over the last year, and last quarter's set seems to have been the product of some back-room collaborations with Disney, featuring a [Star Destroyer, Pride Rock, and the fucking Disney Castle](http://epicstream.com/news/JakeVyper/5-Magic-The-Gathering-Extended-Art-Versions-of-5-Throne-of-Eldraine-Rare-Lands). The entire set is \"fairy-tale\" themed, and they're heavily investing in this digital product, including a [spiffy trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzBrfW7Ipzg), an [RPG](https://www.pcgamer.com/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-story-driven-rpg-studio-led-by-ex-bioware-vets/), rumors of a Netflix series, and greater [whale-monetization strategies](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/secret-lair-recap-2019-11-25). Looks like Brian Goldner has finally decided it's time to put you autists to work, and your efforts are going to lead to a top-line boon to revenues. You might think Mark Rosewater is your friend, but simmering just below his friendly smile and unadulterated love for the game is a deep-seated desire to take your money at any cost. Haven't you noticed all the \"gold\" and \"treasure\" tokens lately? You're ripe for the picking, and it's harvest time at Hasbro, baby.\n\nFor the Chads and Stacies that have managed to overcome their autism for long enough to procreate, these guys not only make all the toys for the Marvel universe, but they're doing all the Frozen toys too. \n\nI'd say \"enough said\" but I am still blown away by how ridiculous Frozen was for revenues last time around, so I'll recap it here. \n\n2013 Q4: Frozen releases November 27, 2013. Originally, Frozen toys weren't made by Hasbro, but they kept selling out, so Disney partnered with HAS to help get the gravy train flowing. \n\n2014 Q4: In the quarterly conference call (FEB9, 2015), Deb Thomas says\n\n>Full-year product development expense increased to 5.2% of\nrevenues. Investment in our brands and in innovation is ongoing and\nstrategically important for Hasbro. As we previously communicated,\nwe began development of the Disney Princess and Frozen properties\nin the fourth quarter, ahead of revenues which do not commence until\n2016. As a result, as anticipated, 2014 product development expense\nwas above the high end of our typical product development range of\n4.5% to 5.0%.\n\n>In 2015, we anticipate product development as a percent of sales to be\nin the range of 5.0% to 5.5%. This expense should return to our more\nnormalized range in future years as we begin to recognize revenues\nassociated with the Disney Princess and Frozen properties. \n\n2015 Q4: Feb 8 2016, in the Q4/year-end results Brian Goldner says they've started shipping on schedule:\n\n>In 2016, Hasbro\u2019s line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY\u2019S FROZEN\nfashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are\nalready on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally. We shipped\na very small amount of product in the fourth quarter given the timing of\nretailer plans. Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer\nindications are positive. Great partnership with Disney and our global \nretailers is resulting in a smooth transition, with product on shelf\nbeginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to\nensure this continues in 2016, as revenues grow and we build greater\nefficiency and profitability into this new business. \n\nDeb Thomas in agreement:\n\n>To fully execute our strategy, investments in innovation are paramount\nto our long-term success. Product development totaled 5.5% of\nrevenues. This includes the investment in our DISNEY PRINCESS\nand DISNEY\u2019S FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in\nJanuary in a more meaningful way. \n\nIn the financials, Q4 Girls Revenue is 312.4 M, down 10% from the previous year, Fiscal Year 2014 Girls revenue is 1022.6 M, up 2% over the previous year.\n\nLess notable: Magic is lackluster this year.\n\n2016 Q1: \"Girls category revenues increased 41% to $165.4 million. The first quarter marked the on shelf date for Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN fashion and small dolls. The addition of these brands along with DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS and growth in BABY ALIVE delivered strong quarterly revenue growth for the category. The Girls category increased 48% absent the impact of foreign exchange.\" Yes, 165.4 for girls is \"up 41%\" over Q1 2015's 117.1, not over Q4's 312.4, but it's still 41%.\n\n2016 Q2: \"Girls category revenues increased 35% to $172.3 million. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN fashion and small dolls along with revenue growth in BABY ALIVE led the increase in the quarter.\" This time over Q2 2015's 127.5.  The other categories hover around 5% growth over previous year, which means that Hasbro would still be a good company without Disney.\n\n2016 Q4/year-end: \"**Girls category revenues in 2016 grew 50% to a record $1.19 billion.** The category benefited from shipments of Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN fashion and small dolls, the successful launch of DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and significant growth from BABY ALIVE. Additional revenue growth came from Hasbro brands including FURREAL FRIENDS and EASY-BAKE OVEN products.\" The percentage is fuzzy, since these lying pieces of shit said that Q4 2015 girls category revenue was 258.8, not the 312.4 reported back then, and full year was 798.2, not 1022.6, but even using the old numbers it's up 26% comparing just the quarters, and 16% for the full year.\n\nSo, knowing what Frozen toys did for Hasbro, when they came to the party a year late... how will they fare when they're in it from the beginning?\n\nAlso, Nerf has been doing better than it was last year (some Fortnight related shit, idk, I'm not 12), and they've got preorders of Mandalorian toys. Someone fucked up with the [Baby Yoda](https://www.space.com/baby-yoda-hasbro-toys-coming-2020.html) toy supply chain, so I assume heads will roll over the lost profits, but better late than never. They've also bought Entertainment One, which is some movie making thing, so I guess it's time for the MTG movie or another Dungeons and Dragons movie.\n\nAlso, Hasbro has invested in mobile phone shovelware if that matters to you. Also, fucking Power Rangers are back, and that [shit rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=468GDmRsUQY). \n\nSo how does it all go wrong?\n\nWell, maybe this Corona Virus bullshit is going to fuck up the supply chain and that will be reflected in the forward looking statements. There's also trade war BULLSHIT that fucked up earnings earlier. Was Star Wars bad enough to ruin both Marvel and Frozen? Doubt it.\n\n#TL;DR buy calls for next week's earnings.

I'll try to go into more detail than most here.\n\n**Self Driving Cars**\n\nWhile some are still skeptical that we'll ever get it to work, I think we will have them in the next few years, certainly in the next 5 years at most.\n\nWhen that does happen, below are my list of predictions related to self driving cars, in no particular order:\n\n* Uber will fail to ever get a self driving car to work. Uber will probably go bankrupt (or maybe bought out) when others beat them to the market, and their robo-taxi's under price them.\n\n* While their approach for achieving self driving is considered controversial among experts, TSLA will eventually succeed at it, and will have the advantage of cheaper hardware than their competitors thanks to not needing LiDAR.\n\n* The taxi market will either 1) become so flooded with robotaxi's that no one is making any money (because everyone believes robotaxi's are literal money printing machines, and ignores that more taxi supply doesn't mean more taxi demand). Or 2) the government will step in and reintroduce/start enforcing the taxi medallion system to artificially limit competition again for the benefit of the taxi companies. Both these things may happen, but in different regions.\n\n* Contrary to what Silicon Valley thinks, Americans **will not** abandon car ownership and just robo-taxi everywhere. The economics still work out to it being cheaper to own a car long term than take a robotaxi everywhere. Having a fleet of robotaxi's available won't make people want to just ditch their car, lots of Americans love owning their car or truck. At most some people in urban areas may decide to just ditch their car, but not anyone in other parts of the country.\n\n* Auto makers who can make cheaper self driving cars for the consumer will be the big winners in the future. Consumers will love the idea of owning their own personal self driving car, but most of them **won't** be sending it out to work as a robo-taxi for random strangers.\n\n* Waymo will fail to become the #1 company in the self driving car market. Too many automakers have sunk costs working on their own self driving car tech. They won't want to abandon that just to use Waymo's tech. Some will, but not that many considering how many auto companies there are. Someone else like Tesla or Cruise will be making more money from self driving cars than Waymo. Waymo simply took too long to make self driving cars, and Google made the mistake of not putting the trusted Google brand on Waymo cars & robo-taxi's. I'd much rather ride in a Google robo-taxi than a Waymo robo-taxi, I see that as a big problem for Waymo in the future, many don't realize they're owned by Google.\n\n**Crypto-Currency**\n\nDespite all the hype there's been about Crypto currency up till now, and hope for it's future, I don't think it'll go anywhere in the next decade.\n\nBitCoin and other crypto's are simply too unstable to ever be more than a speculative bet that sometimes soars really high, and sometimes tanks really hard. No serious business in their right minds would ever accept Crypto currency as legal tender, let alone a large enough number of businesses for consumers to seriously consider crypto a 'true' currency rather than a speculative investment.\n\n**Electric Vehicles**\n\nThe shift to BEV's will be in full swing over the next 10 years. Barely any new ICE vehicles will be manufactured by 2030. Consumers in many countries will be worried about not being able to find gasoline in the future with many countries having year 20XX dates where all new cars have to be EV's. This 'range anxiety' will cause them to stay away from new ICE vehicles. Used ICE vehicles will still be a thing for a while though.\n\nNumerous auto companies who have been too slow to adapt to the shift to EV's will either go bankrupt, or need bailed out by their government at some point. My top candidates for this include:\n\n* Subaru (they're a smaller auto-maker, and they've been dragging their feet much worse than most. Subaru plans to wait until mid-2030 to sell only EV's, I think that's WAY too late, especially since their transition numbers consider gasoline based 'hybrids' to be EV's).\n\n* Ford (They may be making an EV that seems great on paper for now, but Ford has been falling apart for years, their stock price reflects that. I seriously think they might not survive the next recession if they aren't bailed out)\n\n* BMW (it's hard to find an auto company who hasn't been harmed worse by Tesla than BMW. BMW tried to make EV's, but failed miserably with their i3. Today's youth don't aspire to own a BMW, they aspire to own a Tesla, that's very bad news for BMW in the long term. EV's are already cheaper to own for the full life of the car than ICE vehicles in the $40,000+ car market, so BMW needs to adapt NOW to that shift. But they seem to content to drag their feet and wait a while to fully transition to EV's)\n\nIf you told me I'm right about only 2 of these 3 auto makers, I'd pick BMW as the one who might survive on their own without a bailout, simply because of their brand strength.\n\n**Streaming Wars**\n\nVarious opinions about this in no particular order:\n\n* I'll probably be proven wrong for this one, but I have little hope for Netflix in the long term. I'm NOT saying they're going bankrupt, I'm saying they're going to take a big hit to their stock price/market cap. The way things are going it's only a matter of time till most of Netflix's content is Netflix created, while shows like Friends, etc. that drove people to Netflix in the past are on competitor's streaming services, driving their users to their competitors.\n\n* Youtube and Disney+ will be the twin kings of streaming in the future.\n\n**Miscellaneous Predictions in no particular order**\n\n* Several once major oil companies will go bankrupt due to the shift away from fossil fuels & ICE vehicles that consume over half the world's oil.\n\n* Of the big FAANG tech companies, if I had to pick 2 of them to fall apart in the next decade I'd say Netflix (already explained why) and Apple (Too over-reliant on a single product).\n\n* Disaster will strike Boeing's stock when a 737 MAX crashes again, resulting in governments grounding the plane again. The market won't be so forgiving this time around, nor will the public.\n\n* TSLA will be worth over 1 trillion dollars.\n\n* MSFT will probably be the most valuable company in the world in 2030.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Out of curiosity, how is AAPL over reliant on a single product?\n\niPhone has been shrinking for years, Mac has steadily been increasing, and services have been exploding", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Services and ventures into the medical field prove that what he said was recognized by executives 5 years ago.

This will usher a new age of scavenger electronics: parts can\u2019t be manufactured any more, but we have billions of parts lying around. Those who can manage to create new designs from those parts with low-tech tools will be very powerful. Among these scavenged parts are microcontrollers, which are especially powerful but need complex tools (often computers) to program them. Computers, after a couple of decades, will break down beyond repair and we won\u2019t be able to program microcontrollers any more. To avoid this fate, we need to have a system that can be designed from scavenged parts and program microcontrollers.
