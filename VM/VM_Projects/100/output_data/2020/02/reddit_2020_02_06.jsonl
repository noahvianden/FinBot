{"title": "Buy Hasbro Today", "selftext": "Hasbro Earnings are next week.\n\nFor the virgins without tiny demons living in your household, this is your reminder that they have recently taken Magic the Gathering to a digital F2P release that has been wildly successful over the last year, and last quarter's set seems to have been the product of some back-room collaborations with Disney, featuring a [Star Destroyer, Pride Rock, and the fucking Disney Castle](http://epicstream.com/news/JakeVyper/5-Magic-The-Gathering-Extended-Art-Versions-of-5-Throne-of-Eldraine-Rare-Lands). The entire set is \"fairy-tale\" themed, and they're heavily investing in this digital product, including a [spiffy trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzBrfW7Ipzg), an [RPG](https://www.pcgamer.com/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-story-driven-rpg-studio-led-by-ex-bioware-vets/), rumors of a Netflix series, and greater [whale-monetization strategies](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/secret-lair-recap-2019-11-25). Looks like Brian Goldner has finally decided it's time to put you autists to work, and your efforts are going to lead to a top-line boon to revenues. You might think Mark Rosewater is your friend, but simmering just below his friendly smile and unadulterated love for the game is a deep-seated desire to take your money at any cost. Haven't you noticed all the \"gold\" and \"treasure\" tokens lately? You're ripe for the picking, and it's harvest time at Hasbro, baby.\n\nFor the Chads and Stacies that have managed to overcome their autism for long enough to procreate, these guys not only make all the toys for the Marvel universe, but they're doing all the Frozen toys too. \n\nI'd say \"enough said\" but I am still blown away by how ridiculous Frozen was for revenues last time around, so I'll recap it here. \n\n2013 Q4: Frozen releases November 27, 2013. Originally, Frozen toys weren't made by Hasbro, but they kept selling out, so Disney partnered with HAS to help get the gravy train flowing. \n\n2014 Q4: In the quarterly conference call (FEB9, 2015), Deb Thomas says\n\n>Full-year product development expense increased to 5.2% of\nrevenues. Investment in our brands and in innovation is ongoing and\nstrategically important for Hasbro. As we previously communicated,\nwe began development of the Disney Princess and Frozen properties\nin the fourth quarter, ahead of revenues which do not commence until\n2016. As a result, as anticipated, 2014 product development expense\nwas above the high end of our typical product development range of\n4.5% to 5.0%.\n\n>In 2015, we anticipate product development as a percent of sales to be\nin the range of 5.0% to 5.5%. This expense should return to our more\nnormalized range in future years as we begin to recognize revenues\nassociated with the Disney Princess and Frozen properties. \n\n2015 Q4: Feb 8 2016, in the Q4/year-end results Brian Goldner says they've started shipping on schedule:\n\n>In 2016, Hasbro\u2019s line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY\u2019S FROZEN\nfashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are\nalready on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally. We shipped\na very small amount of product in the fourth quarter given the timing of\nretailer plans. Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer\nindications are positive. Great partnership with Disney and our global \nretailers is resulting in a smooth transition, with product on shelf\nbeginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to\nensure this continues in 2016, as revenues grow and we build greater\nefficiency and profitability into this new business. \n\nDeb Thomas in agreement:\n\n>To fully execute our strategy, investments in innovation are paramount\nto our long-term success. Product development totaled 5.5% of\nrevenues. This includes the investment in our DISNEY PRINCESS\nand DISNEY\u2019S FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in\nJanuary in a more meaningful way. \n\nIn the financials, Q4 Girls Revenue is 312.4 M, down 10% from the previous year, Fiscal Year 2014 Girls revenue is 1022.6 M, up 2% over the previous year.\n\nLess notable: Magic is lackluster this year.\n\n2016 Q1: \"Girls category revenues increased 41% to $165.4 million. The first quarter marked the on shelf date for Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN fashion and small dolls. The addition of these brands along with DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS and growth in BABY ALIVE delivered strong quarterly revenue growth for the category. The Girls category increased 48% absent the impact of foreign exchange.\" Yes, 165.4 for girls is \"up 41%\" over Q1 2015's 117.1, not over Q4's 312.4, but it's still 41%.\n\n2016 Q2: \"Girls category revenues increased 35% to $172.3 million. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN fashion and small dolls along with revenue growth in BABY ALIVE led the increase in the quarter.\" This time over Q2 2015's 127.5.  The other categories hover around 5% growth over previous year, which means that Hasbro would still be a good company without Disney.\n\n2016 Q4/year-end: \"**Girls category revenues in 2016 grew 50% to a record $1.19 billion.** The category benefited from shipments of Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN fashion and small dolls, the successful launch of DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and significant growth from BABY ALIVE. Additional revenue growth came from Hasbro brands including FURREAL FRIENDS and EASY-BAKE OVEN products.\" The percentage is fuzzy, since these lying pieces of shit said that Q4 2015 girls category revenue was 258.8, not the 312.4 reported back then, and full year was 798.2, not 1022.6, but even using the old numbers it's up 26% comparing just the quarters, and 16% for the full year.\n\nSo, knowing what Frozen toys did for Hasbro, when they came to the party a year late... how will they fare when they're in it from the beginning?\n\nAlso, Nerf has been doing better than it was last year (some Fortnight related shit, idk, I'm not 12), and they've got preorders of Mandalorian toys. Someone fucked up with the [Baby Yoda](https://www.space.com/baby-yoda-hasbro-toys-coming-2020.html) toy supply chain, so I assume heads will roll over the lost profits, but better late than never. They've also bought Entertainment One, which is some movie making thing, so I guess it's time for the MTG movie or another Dungeons and Dragons movie.\n\nAlso, Hasbro has invested in mobile phone shovelware if that matters to you. Also, fucking Power Rangers are back, and that [shit rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=468GDmRsUQY). \n\nSo how does it all go wrong?\n\nWell, maybe this Corona Virus bullshit is going to fuck up the supply chain and that will be reflected in the forward looking statements. There's also trade war BULLSHIT that fucked up earnings earlier. Was Star Wars bad enough to ruin both Marvel and Frozen? Doubt it.\n\n#TL;DR buy calls for next week's earnings.
