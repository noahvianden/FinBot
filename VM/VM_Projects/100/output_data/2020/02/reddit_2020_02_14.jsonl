For those that have short-term calls, sorry for your lost tendies. For those that are holding past March, stay strong -- tendies will be crispy. \n\nHere's my rational from past ER:\n\n* Microsoft's commercial cloud growth up 39% \n* Office 365 commercial rev growth up 27%\n* Windows OEM revenue up 18%. \n* MSFT Divided date: 02/19/20\n\nThey are diversified and vaccinated from the gay-ass coronavirus with strong passive inflow from Nasdaq 100, SPY and over 277 ETFs have MSFT in their top 15 holdings.\n\nToday, [Evercore ISI](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-can-keep-rising-for-5-reasons-analyst-says-51581617083?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo) **raised PT to $212** from $190. I expect Heather Bellini, analyst at Goldman Sachs, to raise PT for Microsoft very soon. Here's [her take on FastMoney yesterday](https://youtu.be/YxhlZ0EQANU?t=72) stating she's not only bullish short-term, but long-term as well. Goldman Sachs [also listed Microsoft in their 16 recommended](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/it-isnt-1999the-partys-not-over-for-tech-stocks-yet-goldman-says-2020-02-10?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo) software and service companies today: \"Goldman team prefers companies in the subcategory of software and services, and offers 16 names within that category that it says offer \u201chigh and stable sales growth, high \\[return on equity\\], and trade at reasonable valuations.\u201d\n\nLast, but not least, (sighs) the JEDI contract is **still awarded** to Microsoft (fuck you Jeff).\n\nNext steps:\n\n1) *\"Amazon must submit a plan for offering the money to the court by next Thursday, and it must agree to redactions to the judge\u2019s order no later than Feb. 27 so that it can be made public.\"*\n\n2) *\"On Thursday, Judge Campbell-Smith also required that Amazon pay a $42 million deposit that the court will hold in case it later determines that the injunction was wrongfully issued and that Microsoft is owed damages\"*\n\nSource: [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/technology/amazon-jedi-pentagon-contract-microsoft.html)\n\nThe next few weeks might be fake and gay, excluding dividends on 02/19, but Microsoft will summon sweet fat tendies.

A resistance point is basically a ceiling the stock hits and bounces off of, because there are more than enough sellers to cover all buyers at that price, but not enough buyers interested in going above that price (yet), so the stock reaches that point but then comes back down. A support point is the opposite - the stock drops to a point where buyers are so attracted, the stock has trouble falling beneath that point, and eventually comes back up.\n\nThey can also flip - if the momentum of a stock sends it beyond a previous resistance points, it can become a new support point, which is what happened here with Microsoft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey're entirely descriptive events, you don't know they exist for sure until they happen, but after they happen, you can use them to predict things like where a stock might fall if it dips, among other things.

Keep your eyes out for these black swan opportunities. \n\nHuge moat - 10 yr dev, IP, billions in r&d\nNew industry - commercial space\nNew market - space tourism, hypersonic travel. \nNew tech - reusable shuttles\nHuge backers - Virgin, Branson\nSmart money - Chamath\n\nI\u2019m up 3m on the position, 750k+ today, as of a few min ago on an initial buy in of 480k. I started building my position Dec 02 through like mid Jan. Ie. when $SPCE was between 7 and 12 ish. As you can see, all leaps. As I\u2019ve said in other posts my DD is that this stock sees 50 this year, 100 next caveat no crashes, no dead people. It entirely has to do with market cap. Had this stock gone through tradition ipo investment banker, underwriter route these gains would have been realized by those people. The stock would have ipo\u2019d north of 20. \n\nThis play was not an overnight thing. I\u2019ve been following the markets for more than 20yrs. Was watching CNBC the morning of 9/11. RIP Mark Haines, CNBC. I had a humble childhood and we didn\u2019t have a lot of money. Never had big capital to put on the line. About 5 years ago I switched jobs and was able to roll over about 250k in 401k retirement funds. That allowed me to directly manage the capital and invest in whatever I wanted. Passive investment is a scam for the sheeple. Yes it works, but you\u2019re on the escalator in the slow lane. I only trade options. Stocks do not adequately  fulfill my personal risk tolerance. I got up to about 3m+ from bets on BYND (up and down), TSLA (missed the recent move), DIS (in before nov earning and sub announcement but held too long and gave a ton back. Eat shit mouse). X (at one point had over 1m delta). FB, NFLX, AAPL, ROKU, MSFT, BA and a whole bunch of other moves too many to recount. \n\nI\u2019m posting this for all you poors out there who are struggling. Keep fighting. Keep learning. Go deep on your own DD. I did it. You can do it. It might happen quick like Tesla. It might not. But the key is to realize that when a Tesla or VG come along, be ready and positioned with a plan to make it happen. \n\nGd bless. Feeling grateful and thankful. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LSTUCOM\n\nps. For those of you who think this is paper. It\u2019s not. I already spoke with one of the mods.\n\nUPDATE: \nEnded the day up 961k. Here\u2019s the dd. A 20% move is squeeze territory. This will squeeze further Tuesday and drop Wednesday. (Monday closed.) I might have to sell some Tuesday to buy short term puts while maintaining the rest of my long. Will evaluate on Tuesday. Seen this pattern many times. Beyond in June 2019 and most recently Tesla. Squeeze is usually a two day run followed by giving it back. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AsFwbRV", "id": "f3vq4a", "created_utc": 1581702253.0, "score": 402, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "I'd tip my hat to you if that was Robinhood and I knew what I was looking at.", "score": 195, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Not right now holding MSFT calls.
