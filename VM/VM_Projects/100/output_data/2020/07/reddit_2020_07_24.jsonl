There was often some light due diligence, key news which would impact the markets/a particular stock, and some intelligent discussion on equities.\n\nOver the past couple of months though, since the market rebound, the quality of content here, in my opinion, has massively declined.\n\n90% of the posts here now are something along the lines of \u201copinions on TSLA?!\u201d or \u201cAMD is holding up my portfolio\u201d or \u201cis now a good time to buy NIO?\u201d. To my interpretation, this is allowed in the rules but this is really what the pinned Daily Discussion should be used for. There should be a rule enforcing this, and mods should be removing posts which break this rule.\n\nThe other 10% of posts at the moment, especially in the last week which has been red, have been along the lines of \u201cstay strong, don\u2019t sell today, take some time out\u201d or \u201cwhat happened, I left the house, came back an hour later and TSLA is down 1%?!\u201d. Personally after coming through several -7%+ days in March, I just find these irritating. r/stocks always seemed to be about returning long term gains, not worrying about day fluctuations.\n\nI understand that at the moment this sub has a large number of new investors learning the ropes, but there needs to be more structure in my opinion. Arguably the chaos which is going on is likely not helping these new investors to be successful.\n\nEDIT: r/stocks not r/investing", "id": "hx6v21", "created_utc": 1595614315.0, "score": 405, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "Don't forget the \"i am 18 and have $5000.

But I would say mostly age 50 to 70. Deaths have dropped a lot each week since this began as our docs learn what meds work best, what pathways work best for each patient (like maybe choice of vent/no vent for example), but elderly patients still don't fare well (80+). But yea I've been surprised but how many 40 and 50 year olds end up in extremely critical condition with it. From what I've seen the 20-40 year olds who get it bad enough to need to come in don't usually escalate to critical care. They feel like dog shit and they look like it too, but after a few days of it they're good to go. The first few weeks were the scariest by far, I had two ladies in early forties who were otherwise fairly healthy die from it. So people need to realize, yes your chances of survival are very high if you are under like 70, but that doesn't mean it can't happen to you. It had me and still has me very worried for my mother who is older than both of them and works in the school system. That's another thing I can speak to, as I work in cardiology: kids going back to school in America right now is an awful idea. The extremely small percentage of kids who are dying from COVID are dying because of an issue with dilation of their coronary arteries, which is something that doesn't cause many symptoms and to my knowledge you would need an echo to truly know or not. Kids could be developing that for several days and you not even know it. Schools are gonna be breeding grounds for COVID. I hope that enough people have had it that we slowly form herd immunity, but the truth is no one really knows.\n\nThe other thing people need to consider. This virus is less than a year old, we don't have any earthly clue what all things it causes. It could be no other new things, it could be dozens. When HIV/AIDS first hit no one knew how it was spread, what all it caused and we didn't know for several years. Again in cardiology, I would use the example of rheumatic fever. Which back when it was a big thing, it just caused kind of a flu like issue. Years later it's found that for several people it causes deterioration of the mitral valve leaflets, which can be life threatening if went unknown and untreated over the years, which it often was. Many of them need valve replacements which is often equals a lifelong change in quality of life when blood thinners are needed. \n\nThis is complicated, because as a whole you can't just shut down and never do business until a vaccine is widely administered, but you also CANT HAVE YOUR POPULATION SPREADING MISINFORMATION, REFUSING TO WEAR MASKS OR OTHER THINGS TO SLOW SPREAD AND ACTING LIKE IT'S NOT A DEAL AT ALL.

Which is fine, mind you, not everyone should know everything about everything. But don't act like you know what the fuck you're talking about.\n\nI can't speak for all countries, but in America COVID hit the hardest in early March. This wasn't true for every state at first, but it was true for my hospital in Indiana. We had a sudden influx of COVID patients, a lot of whom were in critical condition and escalating quickly. I remember the first week the plan was to dedicate around 60 beds of a unit for covid only patients, that lasted only the first week. Then we dedicated another 40, few days later another area, then a week or so later another unit. We were up to like 200 covid only beds in a hospital that's only around 4-500 beds total. Around May we started to see a slow steady decrease in the number of new covids, and a decrease in how severe their condition got. The latter being likely a result of staff now knowing what medicines and pathways to treat these patients after having experience with it for a few weeks. We've had far less covid patients dying percentage wise.\n\nAnyway, throughout that March to like early June period, our hospital and from what I hear most hospitals in USA, closed 99% of outpatient testing down. Outpatient testing is a huge part of business. For example I'll give you a perspective from my world of cardiology. A patient comes into our adjoined outpatient building for an echocardiogram, which in and of itself is a small charge. If everything looked great then that's a small profit made there. If patient had an issue with a valve, they would typically then come in for outpatient TEE to evaluate true severity and need for surgical intervention, another profit there. If surgery is needed then they come in as outpatient for several weeks to do the actual surgery, then a couple days of intensive care during that immediate healing stage, then a week or so of impatient cardiac rehab, more testing to make sure everything looks good before discharge. So much staff is involved in that patients process: echo techs, reading cardiologist, surgeons and their nurses and techs, ICU nurses, x-ray techs, CT techs sometimes, rehab techs, cleaning staff, any docs who need to see that patient while they are there who aren't directly related to the valve replacement, like maybe a diabetes doctor or kidney doctor. All of that staff is now not doing these jobs, because we don't get to see that patient come in for the outpatient echo to begin with and get that process started. The hospital is losing money every day, by having to not allow outpatients and by having to limit how much care inpatients are getting in an interest to slow the spread and protect workers.\n\n The only staff who are busier or as busy as they were pre covid, are the staff directly involved in covid patient care. Not every doc has the credentials and skills to care for them, same for nurses. Those staff are often forced to use PTO, some cases file for unemployment, etc. If you were that cardiac rehab tech aforementioned, your patient workload went to like ten percent of what it was. A manager doesn't need six rehab techs right now, they need two. Then the staff who can work with intensive covid patients are overworked and mentally exhausted. Having to be paid overtime by the hospital, more money lost for hospital.\n\nSo as you can see from this one small example, of which there are dozens I can make from many different affected staff and fields: business is overly busy on the covid side, but because of need to reserve resources for potential covid patients, the hospital is losing money on almost everything non covid related. Budget cuts will have to be made, many have had furloughs as you said. But you're missing the point. The furloughs are happening to people who can no longer do their job and theyre happening because the hospital has to limit losses right now. \n\nSo doctors furloughed doesn't not equal covid is gone. In fact as you can see, the severity of covid caused the need for those furloughs.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You seem to know quite a bit so explain why hospitals are putting people on ventilators that don't need to be and then subsequently dying because of it. Is it because they are receiving (and not disclosing mind you) $39,000 per patient that they place on a ventilator? \n\nThe data doesn't coincide with what you are saying. COVID has less than a 1% death rate for anybody below the age of 50. I'm sure it is even less when you factor out those without any pre-existing conditions (i.e. obesity) or those who were labeled \"COVID\" deaths, but died of other causes while testing positive from COVID (i.e. getting shot in the head) or \"coughing\" while in hospice and then dying WITHOUT testing positive.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Im not a respiratory or ICU doc, nor an RT, so I can only give you my understanding of it. For the first few weeks resp docs were throwing a lot of people on vents pretty quick, but from what I've seen that has decreased significantly since then. I can think of several reasons for that. The biggest being that vents can kind of be thought of as a safety switch you can flip when you're worried a patient is at the point of dying from related issues. It's a move you make to sacrifice some other things in order to just keep the human alive long enough to figure out how best to treat them. So in early March docs were unexperienced with best way to treat the average ICU COVID pt and were also suddenly flooded with more any more of those patients. The easiest thing to do in interest of keeping people alive was to put them on vent if even remotely needed. So you can see why and how that could happen where at first vents were used and needed like crazy. Now with that said, for some diseases and disease processes, vents can do more harm than good for a lot of patients and their long term prognosis and COVID has looked like one of those diseases. Here I've seen a dramatic decrease in the number of COVID patients on vents. Again the reason why is multi faceted. We know what drugs work best for different stages of the disease which keeps some COVIDs  from progressing as far, we have cross trained some capable nurses/PAs/NPs to be able to help out a bit on patient load letting docs spend more time on the more critical COVIDs, we know that with COVID the longer a patient is on the vent the more likely they are to crash coming off the vent which leads us to not leave them on a second longer than needed. \n\nBtw, this whole getting shot in the head but being counted as a COVID death seems nothing more than political minded talking head bull shit and when I talk to people in the actual know, they tell me it is as well. I'm more likely to take the word of the people actually responsible for reporting these things than a Facebook post or a talking head on Fox News. So do with that what you will.\n\nIt is very easy in life, especially nowadays, to assume the worst of someone when presented with an issue. To assume that everyone must be out to make a buck somehow, that everyone must be faking numbers for X reason, so on and so forth. The people caring for these patients and reporting numbers and so on are normal Joe schmo's like you and me. It is true that hospitals are reimbursed an amount per covid patient, or at least it was for a time, I'm not sure if it still is. But as we discussed earlier, hospitals are losing money hand over fist right now, there's a reason they're being paid that money. Could that lead a hospital to claim more cases than they truly have? I'm sure some hospital somewhere has done so, sure. Does than mean all of them or even a handful are doing that? No. \n\nAlso, who gives a flying fuck whether the person dying from COVID has diabetes or other comorbidities. They are humans, who are dying, what's hard to grasp about that?

People can be fifty pounds overweight and turn their life around, you see it everyday here on subreddits like OMAD, intermittent fasting, fitness, LoseIt, etc. My wife who had been a normal weight her entire life had our child, had post partum depression and developed an eating disorder.

My wife would be the first one to tell you that. We need a change in the overall public shift of eating, counting calories, exercise and not praising those who are overweight.

{"title": "USD is dead", "selftext": "Everyone should have seen this coming months ago, the US Dollar is tanking. Money printing leads to inflation, excess supply and decreased demand leads to a devalued currency. The fed is dramatically over estimating how much of its money is exchanging hands globally. \n\nUUP is a dollar index. Dollar indexes like this are created by measuring the dollar's value against other commonly bought currencies and averaging it out (I think, but I'm on this board so I'm probably just retarded and made that up.)\n\nUDN is another dollar index however this one is \"bearish\" and measures negative momentum against the dollar I assume by inverting the way the UUP works.\n\nLook at 6 month, 5 year and 1 month charts on UUP, every single one of them is extremely bearish. Look at the same charts on UDN you'll see the same thing reversed. \n\nEdit: I should note that this trend is accelerating even though equities seem to be losing steam. Typically when equities go down the USD goes up. You can see this on the charts, however that's not longer happening. \n\nUDN calls or UUP puts. UUP premiums are higher for whatever reason, maybe volume? Volume on UDN calls is generally nonexistent, except for the Dec 20 21c and 22c. \n\nThe 22c are a little over $1 otm and have a small bid ask spread between 0.15-0.20. The 21c are about 20 cents otm and have a small bid ask spread of 0.35-0.40. \n\nThe cost of these premiums in relationship to their closeness to being itm is an absolute no brainer. The charts are telling us the USD is headed to the lowest levels we've seen in a decade and you could be holding call options that are $3-4 in the money by December that you paid 15 cents for. \n\nFull disclosure I own 100 contracts at 0.17, expiring Dec 20th 2020. I will roll these contracts to March depending on the outlook between now and then.\n\nI am not a financial expert this is not financial advise I am a retard. Thank you for reading.\n\nUpdate 7/27: I opened a position of 300 contracts on UUP 25p for 8/21 that I purchased for 15 cents and I am down 13% on that position. My UDN 22c are up 42% at market close. Current premium 25 cents I entered at 17. Unfortunately my entry points on both were a bit higher than they should have been but I expect returns in the 200-400% percentile range so it's no big deal if you get in a bit high. UUP 3y chart looks extremely bearish and UDN conversely looks bullish.\n\nEdit: 7/29 after a rally in the USD and some growing pains, UUP is dumping and UDN is climbing again. DXY looks primed to break under its 2 year low and today UDN showed up on an unusual options activity scanner with a call volume increase of 350%.", "id": "hx3ilj", "created_utc": 1595603589.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Calls on single loaves of bread.", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Ticker please", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I tried to think of a smartass reply but I\u2019m not good at thinking.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "$BRD", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "$RYE", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Better", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$BUNS?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "$D'OH", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$LOAF you loafs", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$DED", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3542388379573822}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33908623456954956}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30227962136268616}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18718072772026062}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15914495289325714}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3149784505367279}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13080395758152008}, {"body": "You\u2019re in the right place then.\n\nHeres your reply also \u201c$weet\u201d", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1662130355834961}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07510162889957428}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07111199200153351}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06997222453355789}, {"body": "> Everyone should have seen this coming months ago\n\nWe did. \n\n$DXY has steadily dropped. \n\nEquities have gone up in return. \n\nWe put money in stocks or calls.\n\nWhere have you been??", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Yet nobody is playing this angle.", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "\nbecause its fucking stupid\n\nyou're telling people to buy options on stock with less than 100K volume\n\nthe options you mentioned as \"higher volume\" are still less than 200\n\nwhy would i play this shit when i could just trade SPY? or trade currencies? or $DXY? or various futures like vix or es?", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Because the premiums are so low relative to the returns?
