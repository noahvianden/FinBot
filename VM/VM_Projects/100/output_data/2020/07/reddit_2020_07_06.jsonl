The difference is that VIX index options are priced to the corresponding /VX futures contract, and not the VIX index number.

Teardowns of their vehicles have indicated solid profit margins, and they've been working to make it better. The Model Y is a fair bit cheaper to make than the Model X was, due to improvements on cable runs and chassis stamping, and that was likely a 30% margin per unit. The Cybertruck may be cheaper still to make. Every battery improvement they make improves that margin. I think you're missing the mark on that one.\n\nThey do make some money off carbon credits, but they also make a good chunk of cash from combining their fleet with Fiat-Chrysler in the EU, which lets them average down their CO2 emissions.\n\nEmissions regulations are only going to get more stringent as global warming kicks in, and that's going to be a big challenge for ICE.
