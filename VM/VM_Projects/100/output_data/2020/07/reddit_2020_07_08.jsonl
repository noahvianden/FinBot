Balance sheets can be quite different depending on several things, including management style.

They need to work through the EPA (maybe?... actually interesting thought given the current EPA lapses), the fed, and the state government. They need to hire people. They need to bring equipment. You are right... they can't just decide to ramp up production, but are they going to try to make hay when the hay is there or are they going to operate in the same business environment that they were running in when the price of gold is 40% lower? \n\nOr... shit.. companies that leverage out on some of the companies because the time is right and it can be easy to justify funneling money to other entities under the guise of 'doing whats best for the company'\n\nTo be clear, I am not a gold expert, but to look at the price of any product and presume that the company is going to be profitable based on the market price of the product is straight-up silly. \n\n> False for all modern mines except fraudulent ones\n\nMaybe. The entire pipeline of gold mining is going to fill as prices increase... from the big dogs to the small ones. The best of class producers are more likely to be prepared for this and also able to prepare for the inevitable drop in future price, as well. \n\nIf I remember right, there was some considerable consolidation on the last go around.\n\nThere are going to be other mine-related companies that will offer prospects of better futures, but aren't going to have the deep pockets of the best in class miners.
