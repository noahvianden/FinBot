VIX is still > 2x as high as during less uncertain times\n2. VIX is not a measure of uncertainty instead it tracks implied volatility  derived from SPX options.\n\nThe implied volatility is a measure of how much the underlying (in the case of the VIX this is the SPX) is expected to move. It is given in annual terms but in the case of VIX calculated from options with a mean time to expiration of 30 days. So the options that expire in ~ 30 days expect the SPX to move ~ 2.2 % (= 26% vol / 12 months) in the next 30 days. If the SPX moves more - up or down - option buyers on average will make a profit, if it moves less option sellers on average will make a profit.\n\nSo why is the VIX falling when uncertainty is still high (upcoming elections, increasing COVID numbers in the US, etc.)? One way to look at it is to assume this uncertainty is already \"priced in\" -> the VIX is still high. Another way to look at it is that demand for options on SPX is falling. Fewer option buyers are willing to buy very expensive options, so option sellers are reducing their prices which in turn is reflected by a lower VIX.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I think this is the answer I was looking for.

In sars, that was mostly related to lots of binding to the N protein or other proteins and NOT the spike protein (especially receptor binding domain).

In fact, they are beating the virus.

They also showed that you can dilute serum 650+x and still retain neutralization at day 59.  Both of those are suggestive of no ADE. And.. they have cd4+ activation.

I\u2019m fairly confident it\u2019ll bounce up pretty much when news of a vaccine comes and probably also rally a few times before that happens as virus numbers get better. \n\nMy question is, has anyone else here invested in apparel retail/ apparel retail department stores and what is your timeline like? Thanks \ud83d\ude4f\n\nEDIT: A few comments to everyone saying I\u2019ve made a very bad decision: \n\nFirst of all, I bought at $16. For the past three months it hasn\u2019t been below $15 except for one time very briefly and that\u2019s despite countless bad news. \n\nI\u2019m not waiting for JWN to get back to $40, at least not necessarily- I\u2019ll see how it goes. I\u2019m mostly waiting for it to get a big, green day and touch on $20+. I\u2019ll let it simmer for a while there and see if it continues to go up to around $25 and if it does I will probably sell. \n\nNordstrom\u2019s stores are primarily Nordstrom Racks and off price retail has been doing quite well in recent years. Take a look at ROSS. Nordstrom also operates Hautelook which is another off price business.\n\nNordstrom has been very aware of the challenges ahead for years. Amazon wasn\u2019t created yesterday. Because of this, it\u2019s been directing its resources and adjusting toward new consumer habits. Its digital sales has increased and it now operates internationally. The pandemic sped up the need for this process of adjusting crucially - but it was a process already underway hence Nordstrom was better prepared than many others which is why I\u2019m confident they won\u2019t go bankrupt. \n\nNordstrom is a very well recognized brand. It\u2019s an appearance in the new Last of Us 2 game for crying out loud. They talk about it in Judd Apatow\u2019s new movie King of Staten Island. I know this doesn\u2019t exactly get a company through a crisis but it\u2019s just to say that they know how to market themselves quite well. \n\nShopping for clothes is different than shopping books, games or DVD\u2019s. Sure, we all miss that nostalgic feeling of going to a Blockbuster to get movies but it\u2019s nothing like the millions of people out there that are passionate about shopping for clothes. It\u2019s like a sport for some, a family trip or something to do as a tourist on holiday. \n\nE-commerce is destroying B&M retail primarily due to convenience and typically cheaper prices. While prices is going to be a challenge for full line Nordstrom stores, I feel that it\u2019s off price business will help them. As for convenience, it will forever and ever be a hassle to get the size right when purchasing clothes online. In 2019, for Zalando (huge online apparel store in Europe) 50 % of ALL purchases was returned. Once again this isn\u2019t an issue with books or video games; you know what you get. Shirts or pants don\u2019t always fit and you need to return them, wait for another size to arrive and maybe that one isn\u2019t right either. Sure, delivery speed is getting faster increasingly but it will always be an inherited problem for e-commerce, especially when it comes to clothing.\n\nWhile most people don\u2019t worry about getting their money back for returns, there\u2019s always going to be people that want to feel, try and look at clothes before they pay for them. Those people will never shop clothes on Amazon. \n\nDuring the pandemic, many have shopped clothes online. Many haven\u2019t shopped clothes at all. Post pandemic, there is going to be a lot of wardrobes around that needs new stuff. A lot of people will need to go out and get clothes and like I said, many don\u2019t buy clothes online. \n\nPeople enjoy spending money. People that don\u2019t shop online haven\u2019t been able to for some time now.
