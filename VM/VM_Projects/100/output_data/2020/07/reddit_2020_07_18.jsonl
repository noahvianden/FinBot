VIX is still > 2x as high as during less uncertain times\n2. VIX is not a measure of uncertainty instead it tracks implied volatility  derived from SPX options.\n\nThe implied volatility is a measure of how much the underlying (in the case of the VIX this is the SPX) is expected to move. It is given in annual terms but in the case of VIX calculated from options with a mean time to expiration of 30 days. So the options that expire in ~ 30 days expect the SPX to move ~ 2.2 % (= 26% vol / 12 months) in the next 30 days. If the SPX moves more - up or down - option buyers on average will make a profit, if it moves less option sellers on average will make a profit.\n\nSo why is the VIX falling when uncertainty is still high (upcoming elections, increasing COVID numbers in the US, etc.)? One way to look at it is to assume this uncertainty is already \"priced in\" -> the VIX is still high. Another way to look at it is that demand for options on SPX is falling. Fewer option buyers are willing to buy very expensive options, so option sellers are reducing their prices which in turn is reflected by a lower VIX.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I think this is the answer I was looking for.

In sars, that was mostly related to lots of binding to the N protein or other proteins and NOT the spike protein (especially receptor binding domain).

In fact, they are beating the virus.

They also showed that you can dilute serum 650+x and still retain neutralization at day 59.  Both of those are suggestive of no ADE. And.. they have cd4+ activation.

I\u2019m fairly confident it\u2019ll bounce up pretty much when news of a vaccine comes and probably also rally a few times before that happens as virus numbers get better. \n\nMy question is, has anyone else here invested in apparel retail/ apparel retail department stores and what is your timeline like? Thanks \ud83d\ude4f\n\nEDIT: A few comments to everyone saying I\u2019ve made a very bad decision: \n\nFirst of all, I bought at $16. For the past three months it hasn\u2019t been below $15 except for one time very briefly and that\u2019s despite countless bad news. \n\nI\u2019m not waiting for JWN to get back to $40, at least not necessarily- I\u2019ll see how it goes. I\u2019m mostly waiting for it to get a big, green day and touch on $20+. I\u2019ll let it simmer for a while there and see if it continues to go up to around $25 and if it does I will probably sell. \n\nNordstrom\u2019s stores are primarily Nordstrom Racks and off price retail has been doing quite well in recent years. Take a look at ROSS. Nordstrom also operates Hautelook which is another off price business.\n\nNordstrom has been very aware of the challenges ahead for years. Amazon wasn\u2019t created yesterday. Because of this, it\u2019s been directing its resources and adjusting toward new consumer habits. Its digital sales has increased and it now operates internationally. The pandemic sped up the need for this process of adjusting crucially - but it was a process already underway hence Nordstrom was better prepared than many others which is why I\u2019m confident they won\u2019t go bankrupt. \n\nNordstrom is a very well recognized brand. It\u2019s an appearance in the new Last of Us 2 game for crying out loud. They talk about it in Judd Apatow\u2019s new movie King of Staten Island. I know this doesn\u2019t exactly get a company through a crisis but it\u2019s just to say that they know how to market themselves quite well. \n\nShopping for clothes is different than shopping books, games or DVD\u2019s.

It\u2019s like a sport for some, a family trip or something to do as a tourist on holiday. \n\nE-commerce is destroying B&M retail primarily due to convenience and typically cheaper prices. While prices is going to be a challenge for full line Nordstrom stores, I feel that it\u2019s off price business will help them. As for convenience, it will forever and ever be a hassle to get the size right when purchasing clothes online. In 2019, for Zalando (huge online apparel store in Europe) 50 % of ALL purchases was returned. Once again this isn\u2019t an issue with books or video games; you know what you get. Shirts or pants don\u2019t always fit and you need to return them, wait for another size to arrive and maybe that one isn\u2019t right either. Sure, delivery speed is getting faster increasingly but it will always be an inherited problem for e-commerce, especially when it comes to clothing.\n\nWhile most people don\u2019t worry about getting their money back for returns, there\u2019s always going to be people that want to feel, try and look at clothes before they pay for them. Those people will never shop clothes on Amazon. \n\nDuring the pandemic, many have shopped clothes online. Many haven\u2019t shopped clothes at all. Post pandemic, there is going to be a lot of wardrobes around that needs new stuff. A lot of people will need to go out and get clothes and like I said, many don\u2019t buy clothes online. \n\nPeople enjoy spending money. People that don\u2019t shop online haven\u2019t been able to for some time now.

Math is hard, could be off. \n\nQ2 was close to 50% of Fremont's capability. They may not have been down exactly half the quarter, but they also had a slow ramp up time. Also, some carryover from Q1. \n\nTo answer question, 90k deliveries brings in 4.5 billion (assume 10k\\*90k avg for S/X and 80k\\*45k avg for 3/Y). Solar is unknown, batteries for houses grid, unknown. FSD add on for deliveries (25% get it so 22.5k\\*7000) roughly 157 million. Unknown existing owner FSD upgrade. So, up to 4.6 billion income for q2. This is rather low compared to Q1 (source is Q1 earnings pdf), at 5.1 billion. Total revenue tends to be roughly 1 billion more looking at the 4 quarters in the pdf. Some blind assumptions: Tesla had 3% more deliveries in Q2 so boosting Q1 by 3% is 5.2 billion. \n\nSo, assume Tesla did somewhere between 4.6 billion (bear, because bad ignorant math) and 5.3 billion (bull, because 3% better than Q1) in automotive revenue and 5.6 billion (bear) and 6.6 billion (bull) with... (incoming bad math) 550 million operating expenses (because Q1 was 951 million... and not quite half that). So net income 5.1 billion (bear) to 6.1 billion (bull). \n\nNo clue how to go from here, I'll conclude my terrible math by increasing the Q1 $16 million profit by 3% so about 16.5 million profit for Q2.\n\nNow Tesla growth at 50% per year. My brain hurts, math continues still bad. But, Tesla is currently on target for 500k deliveries. The math I did for Q2 tacked on the 50% they were shutdown for. China was 15k, Fremont was 75k then. So 75k\\*2=150k+15k=165k. 165k for 4 quarters is 660k. My math shows a 23% improvement, my brain thinks that is Tesla's growth but it's not. In '19 Tesla delivered 367,500 vehicles. This year, Tesla aims to do 500k... (367,500\\*1.5=551, 250)...yet that 660k number is higher soooo... What percentage would Tesla have increased if that were realistic? 660,000/367,500 = 80%\n\nAssumption is Tesla doesn't grow from Q2 non covid capabilities. But they kinda are and do. So, this could theoretically be the first year Tesla could have grown over 50%. Any sort of accuracy here would demonstrate Tesla is doing better than expected with factory efforts.

{"title": "DD: Your Tendie Stimulus (VXX, QQQ, and SPY during upcoming negotiations)", "selftext": "**UPDATE 7/24 Open: https://twitter.com/miltdavis/status/1286663167901196288?s=21**\n\n** UPDATE 7/23 AM: people keep asking in the comments. I purchased VXX 7/24 30c before close yesterday **\n\n\nNext week congress is back in full swing, woop woop!  The well dries up on extended Unemployment Insurance benefits (aka the extra $600 a week you hear about people getting) on the 31st, and it\u2019s time for some actual decisions to be made.  Here\u2019s how shit looks;\n\n*Primer for the unread autist:*\n\nOn May 25th the House (Democratic) passed the HEROES Act as a starting point for second round of stimulus talks (for those who don\u2019t know how it works, the House passes draft legislation, which then must be approved by the Republican Senate).  This will be the first time the Senate get\u2019s a chance to truly debate it\u2019s merits in session, but McConnell and other Republicans have already given statements letting folks know there is no way it passes as stands.  *What does the HEROES Act include?*  I put the ones that are important to you, the young tendie farmer, in bold\n\n* **a second stimulus check**\n* debt relief\n* student loan forgiveness\n* hazard pay\n* **six more months of COVID-19 unemployment**\n* housing and food assistance\n* nearly $1 trillion in aid for state and local governments so they can pay \u201cvital workers like first responders, health workers, and teachers\u201d who are at risk of losing their jobs due to budget shortfalls\n\nThe HEROES Act would give individuals earning up to $75,000 annually a one-time, non-taxable check for $1,200. However, whereas the first round of payments included an extra $500 per family for every child aged 16 or under, this additional credit would now rise to $1,200 each for a maximum of three dependents, allowing households to claim up to $6,000 each.\n\nSound nice?  It\u2019s not happening.  Both McConnell (Senate Majority Leader) and Mnuchin (if you don\u2019t know who he is stop trading right now) have been given stringent opposition to both those factors by saying 1) the $75,000 cap will be lower.  How much lower?  McConnell has floated $40,000 as the Senate starting point, representing a nearly 50% difference and 2) Mnuchin and McConnell have been both been firm in not extending the $600 weekly UI benefit, calling it a disincentive for people to return to work.\n\nA copy of McConnell\u2019s counter-proposal was leaked to the Associated Press and in addition to the $40,000 cap, it also suggested moving the enhanced Unemployment Benefits from $600 a week to a few hundred dollars a month, and bridging the gap by providing a yet-to-be-determined \u2018back to work bonus\u2019.\n\n*So, what?*\n\nPolitics aside, if you\u2019re a bull you probably want as many benefits as possible to keep consumer sentiment high and help retail rebound.  It also helps with travel, etc.  Given that a few of the largest economies in the world (CA, FL, and TX) are halting reopening and--if they\u2019re not overtly saying it--trending toward shutdown, a \u201cback to work bonus\u201d may be a harder sell than the Senate realizes in practicality, and the UI benefit extension could definitely end up being more than a few hundred dollars a month to offset the that naturally occurring loss in work.\n\n*So, when does this happen?*\n\n*Monday- July 20th*: US Senate returns to session\n\n\"as soon as the Senate gets back, we're going to sit down on a partisan basis with the Republicans and the Democrats and it will be our priority to make sure between the 20th and the end of the month that we pass the next legislation.\"\n\nThis will be the first opportunity to get some daily swings based on headlines.\n\n*July 31st-*\\-the house begins a scheduled summer recess until labor day that Pelosi has said she is willing to delay.  This could lead to tactics of brinksmanship similar to those seen with previous budget shutdowns.  But\u2026\n\n*August 7th-* that's when the senate goes on recess and McConnell has been clear that he will not be delaying it or cancelling it.\n\n***In other words, whatever is done will be done by August 7th.***  \n\n*Will Jerome speak on it??*\n\nI don\u2019t see many scheduled FED hearings (or any) on the matter coming up, so this will not be like the hearings popping in June that allowed for massive daily swings.  But we will get lots of sound bites for the news to run with, and sound bites back from the Republican Senate.\n\n**Of note though, on Thursday, July 23rd, there is a House Committee meeting on the Heroes Act.  This should produce some aggravated soundbites from Republicans in the news.**\n\n***How I\u2019m going to play it***\n\nNothing is stopping this vaccine pump from Monday the 21st until Tuesday open, but I\u2019ll be looking to capitalize on moments of weakness for VIX/VXX pops.\n\n**If we are green Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday I\u2019ll be buying:** \n\nVXX 7/24 32c\n\nVXX 7/31 34c\n\nAnd hold them until Republican senate responses come out to what is said during the House Committee meeting on Thursday.\n\n**On afternoons and evenings where Mango/McConnell thrash the Democrats as unreasonable:**\n\nVXX calls on those afternoons slightly OTM or ATM at open the next morning and hold until the next day.\n\n**Given that the vaccine high will likely wear off, case/death numbers are rising, and the news around this stuff will be turbulent, I\u2019ll be moving into good ol\u2019 tech next week with some:**\n\nQQQ 7/31 262c\n\nQQQ 8/7 270c\n\n**On the week of 7/24, in anticipation of a deal getting done:** \n\nSPY 8/7 330c\n\nSPY 8/14 335c\n\n***TLDR:***\n\nHEROES ACT negotiations are going to be a bumpy ride.  Senate Republicans hate the extra poor people benefits but will capitulate on their current hard stance--at least slightly--to keep the market lubed up particularly in light of businesses shutting down in our largest states.\n\nVXX will be good for overnight pops as bad news breaks in negotiations, while QQQ will be a safer play than SPY while negotiations are happening and COVID is raging.  Will move all-in on SPY calls about a week out from Senate recess on August 7th, which is the unofficial--but official--deadline for a plan to be passed.\n\n*I will update with the evolving calendar and pertinent news on the negotiations sometimes here,sometimes my Twitter same name.*\n\n**EDIT: Note 6 PM PST 7/18-- I am not advocating hold VXX long term or saying SPY won't trend upward on those plays--I am referring to those overnight guerilla warfare, get in and get out when you're up plays.  Next leg down ain't coming anytime soon, but there is still money to be made in bouts of volatility.**\n\n***FURTHER READING UPDATED DAILY BELOW***\n\n**UPDATE: (link) 7/18 9:37 PST: So it begins..**. https://www.wsj.com/articles/depleted-trump-economic-team-faces-major-test-over-extending-coronavirus-relief-efforts-11595073600\n\n**UPDATE: (link) 7/18 ** deeper reading on the Unemployment Insurance/ \u2018Back to Work\u2019 Bonus debate: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-600-boost-in-unemployment-benefits-expires-soon-what-comes-next-200832084.html\n\n**UPDATE: (link) 7/19**  WSJ article examining pros and cons of extended benefits through ind. stories: https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-600-a-week-jobless-aid-nears-end-congress-faces-a-quandary-11595151000?st=l5leqtixuee8ynz&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n\n**UPDATE: (News/Moves) 7/20**Right digging in hard on ending extended UI bonus ($600) and want biz/schools protected from COVID suits.
