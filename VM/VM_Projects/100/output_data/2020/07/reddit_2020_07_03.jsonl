{"title": "DD on $NIO", "selftext": "TLDR: Any Call strike in 2021 or 2022\n\n**Detailed DD:**\n\nAlmost a penny stock till last month.\n\nIt has seen major movement in the last few weeks.\n\nThe key catalysts being:\n\n1. Getting $1B semi-govt funding and raising $485m by issuing equity: which takes away the bankruptcy fears which have been driving it down in the recent months. Enough liquidity now till 2022\n2. The actual car delivery numbers have sky rocketed in the last 3 months m-o-m and y-o-y\n\nCommon misconceptions:\n\n1. Owned by the chinese govt: No it is not owned by the Govt, the investment was by Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding. Think of it similar to the usual tax-breaks and other incentives offered by local county/state govts here, but instead of just giving free money, they are instead taking 24.1% of equity in the new entity created, and in return the province gets a premium car maker to set base and generate employment\n2. Nio like all Chinese cars is shit quality: No, based on anecdotal feedback all the Nio models are very premium with great interiors at par with Lexus. Infact in terms of premium feel of interiors and experience, Nio is heads and shoulders above Tesla's low cost plastic feel\n3. Battery swap is a deal breaker: Actually Nio cars can be charged using both a Supercharger as well as battery swap.\n\nSome strengths of Nio:\n\n1. Battery swap: It takes away the biggest risk of owning a EV vehicle. Also, the 4 minute battery swap also includes a full diagnostics run in parallel for the car. It can also upgrade systems during the swap. If there is a better generation of batteries in production the car can be upgraded to a better battery with longer miles\n2. Supercharger + Battery Swap + Call-anywhere-anytime-support-guarantee where they send a charging vehicle if stranded anywhere\n3. Premium positioning: They are positioned at the top end of luxury/premium vehicle space, and the interiors and experience is top-notch\n4. Pricing: It is high enough to provide a path to profitability, also only premium segment vehicle to qualify for govt subsidies. Tesla had to reduce its pricing in China to qualify for its base models.\n5. Technology: Self driving, AI, voice assistant hardware, 0-60 acceleration and the whole bag of tricks. Battery range and features are almost nearing Tesla\n6. Nerd Positioning: Till date NIO's cars hold the world record for fastest EV vehicles, which are not just prototypes, but real cars.\n7. Exclusive Community: The car owners don't just buy a car, they get a premium luxury community experience exclusive to NIO owners in multiple cities. Current count: 22 NIO Houses and 55 NIO Spaces in 57 cities in China\n8. Low overheads in terms of not owning huge debts and running a production site.

New ES8 model launch pretty successful and more exciting models coming soon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForward outlook:\n\n1. Currently gross margins are negative, projected to reach unit profitability within this year.\n2. It may or may not become a $100 Billion company, but certainly enough juice to stay in the race and go upwards\n\nRisk issues:\n\n1. Accounting frauds or shady stuff unearthed in the future at some time or the other. After Luckin Coffee etc, one can never be sure.\n2. Falling out with the manufacturing partner\n3. Not being able to scale beyond 4k-5k cars a month\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:   any call strike in 2021 or 2022.
