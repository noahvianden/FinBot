Either way a lump sum investment in the next 2-4 weeks is probably not a good idea. \n\nHowever, for most investors (myself included) timing the market is generally a bad idea and the best way to make money is by continuingly investing periodically every month when you are paid for years and years. The investments should be mostly in ETFs spread over the world so you aren't exposed to one economy. You should also mix in a small amount of cash, gold (we're talking 5%, if you want to bet on crypto then a small amount of BTC or another metal may be a good idea if your young but this is polarising and should be left to your discretion), bonds (less bonds when younger, more when reaching retirement). The younger you are the more of your portfolio you can dedicate to hail Marys or more specialized ETFs (ie NASDAQ, single companies or 'picked' stocks). In short, the low variance way to get rich over many years is to constantly invest broadly in a boring portfolio taking into account your age, risk tolerance, job security etc. \n\nOne thought I might add to all of this is that half the people here are part of the genuine DCA crowd, they've done it for years and will continue to do it through the ups and downs. There is another group of 'investors'that have emerged that use the same language as the DCA crowd but are using the same talking points to justify their FOMO. The same thing happened during the BTC bubble where people were saying buy now why does it matter what happens in the short term if you believe the price will be higher in 10 years? Now obviously crypto is different but the psychology is the same. If you go all in on tech today and there is a downturn (which is completely possible) are you willing to buy more as you watch your portfolio drop? A lot of the people who are buying the top can't handle the dips and this is why markets always capitulate at extremes, every time. \n\nAnyway this turned out to be a ramble but I'm just trying to give a little more of a response than either 'wait for the crash' or 'Cant time the market!

Generally, viruses tend to become more contagious and less lethal over time.  This applies moreso to really lethal viruses (if a virus kills so fast that it has a narrow window to spread to another person, it ain't a very good virus) than to one like ours today.  A mutation that lets the virus bind to our cells easier (which has already happened at least once) could make it more contagious, but such a mutation could also make it more lethal if it replicates faster in your body and disrupts cell function. Viral evolution is complicated, it's not as simple as ItS gOiNG tO Be MOrE DeaDlY or ConTaGiOUs. Herd immunity adds selective pressure for the virus to evade antibodies, for example. \n\nOn the topic of fewer deaths:\nDeaths always lag behind cases on any epidemiological curve.

Less than 10% of the US population has been tested. If you cannot understand why data points in a comprehensive understanding of anything about the virus cannot be made with that much information I would also like to recommend you take a statistics class and some rudimentary mathematics courses.\nThe reason why people who have worked in the field dealing with viral or bacterial contagions are so worried is because of a few reasons. number one, the infection rate is so high, regardless of the fatality rate something that can spread this easy can pose severe problems when and how it mutates as well as other contagions running through the human population.\n\nsince people cannot patiently wait for data and act as responsible adults we're having information thrown at us from multiple sources. This paired with broad scientific illiteracy we have a very big problem. no one can predict when or how it will mutate. and unfortunately because we're not testing effectively we can't even track it if it did mutate. We're 10 steps behind. \n\nthere is a shit ton of things that a lot of people in the country and the world really need to understand about this, and they don't and it's fucking sad. \n\nthe number one thing that my colleagues and I are terrified of, is that a different viral or bacterial contagion will somehow begin it's outbreak somewhere, and because the coronavirus compromised immune systems, respiratory systems, and certain organs - the potential lethality of something that wasn't an issue a few years ago becomes a global health crisis and kills many people. \n\nThis is a big deal and you and everybody else need to take this seriously.\n\nTL;DR: JPOW needs to whip his dick out and helicopter around to save the market.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "That wasnt short.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.012555953115224838}, {"body": "Word", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.004991431720554829}, {"body": "Makes sense to me", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03637560084462166}, {"body": "Take it seriously how thought?

{"title": "Q2 Update from the Desk of Jerome Powell", "selftext": "Dear WSB,\n\n# TL;DR: I told you so, we\u2019re going up more, then down - here is how to play it.\n\nIts me JPOW again, maybe you missed [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzlv03/an_open_letter_to_wsb_from_the_desk_of_jerome/) \\- or maybe it was too long for the average autist. If you would have made these trades, and rolled like I said, you wouldn\u2019t be broke. Get it?\n\nEverything I said in my previous post, came to pass economically, but I must admit I was wrong about Trump. He chopped and screwed it up bigly, but all good, we can pivot right quick.\n\nThe left is going to make sure we keep these wheels turning - it doesn\u2019t make a difference who is in the White House.\n\n# WE'RE GOING UP\n\n**Second Wave.** I don\u2019t care about waves, I control the tide. Remember how everyone was scared about the first wave? Notice how they aren\u2019t about the second?\n\n**Uncertainty.** Not knowing \u201cwhat will happen with COVID\u201d is so much worse for equities than not knowing. The market hates uncertainty. We have already seen what COVID can do economically - countries have made their plans and accepted their fate. Will more COVID damage the economy? Yes, but the uncertainty of how and how much have been drastically reduced.\n\n**Trump is Done.** You should be able to see it on his face, but the guy is honestly pretty stupid and is a bit tired. It was fine to be stupid and confident, but now he is stupid and weak - and America can smell it. Remember in 2016 when a bunch of people said they were voting for Hillary but obviously switched to Trump when they were in the booth? Watch the opposite happen this time with Trump supporters who can\u2019t admit publicly they turned on him - but will vote for Biden in the booth. He ded.\n\n**Biden is Whatever.** Don\u2019t think Biden is going to slow this train down at all. Biden is just the manifestation of the moderate left establishment - Biden is a Clinton/Obama mashup that is more than willing to play ball. Biden poses no economic threat and I don\u2019t think he has the balls to try and replace me.\n\n**Pelosi Will Chill.** Biden and Pelosi will finally start being able to execute on what I have been saying - keep printing. Congress did their thing, but if we are going to keep going up they need to do more. Pelosi has been fighting the conservatives to keep the stimulus out of corporate hands - once she can print the way she wants the working class will get what they need for perpetuity.\n\n**Printer Prints.** Remember how Obama/Biden pushed the FED to print? Then Trump pushed the FED to print? You better believe Biden, Pelosi and I will make it rain. The economy is fucked, but we can roll out socialism and prop up asset prices at the same time - easy peasy.\n\n**The Dollar is Changing**. I printed a lot - more than usual. It is going to take some time to work through, but buying power of the dollar is going down. We are pretty front loaded on fresh dollars, and I am down to print more, but eventually this dilutes those dollars in all the middle/lower class people\u2019s savings accounts. I just can\u2019t print too much more than other countries - if the US prints an outsized proportion of currency the dollar will fall bigly.\n\n**More Cases = More Printing**. Haven\u2019t you guys noticed how everything has been a bit backwards since the March lows? That is when bad news became good news and good news became bad news - remember? Record unemployment and stocks go up right? That is because when bad shit happens, I can act unilaterally to just print it away. Guess what happens if more bad shit happens?\n\n**Wealth Transfer.** Every time this happens, the retail investor, the 401k, and uninformed invest at the last minute. We need all that money on the sidelines to come in first, before the collapse in asset values happens. If they don\u2019t get their money in, we can\u2019t transfer the wealth. If we can\u2019t transfer the wealth, what are we doing here? Wait for a greater retail wave of \u201creinvestment\u201d before thinking the crash is here.\n\n**No Defaults.** Defaults are only going to happen when people can\u2019t service those debts. As long as people pay, the wheels keep turning. Congress gave the poor people money to pay the rich people, I cut debt costs for the rich people, we should be good for a while (notice, for a while).\n\n**Take From the Bottom.** The lower and middle class can take it. We just need to roll this out at the expense of the lower classes. Remember, as long as we keep them working a W2 and paying their mortgage they stay the \u201cworking class\u201d and we get to stay the \u201cinvesting class.\u201d The government will keep stealing from the working class future, to prop up the investing class\u2019s present wealth.\n\n**Market Collapse Delayed**. We have corrections, recessions, depressions when there is a \u201cde-everaging.\u201d This means, debts are forgiven, restructured, losses are realized. That won\u2019t happen for a bit because we are going to keep dripping dollars and relief to the middle class and poor to keep the wheels turning.\n\n**TINA.** *There Is No Alternative* to US Equities. Underpinning this whole landscape is the fact that all other economies, and their respective currencies, and their central governments, are all equally fucked. So if everyone is fucked, were the least fucked and our debt and equities are still \u201csafe havens\u201d\n\n**Imports/Exports.** The future decline in the dollar is going to help companies which export and hurt those which import. Don\u2019t sleep on this concept - it will impact the next 3-4 years.\n\n**More Debt the Better.** Everyone gets scared of being over leveraged, but I will just buy it out. Take on the debt, and lets juice earnings. Don\u2019t forget that even if sales go down because of a recession, profits can go up if I single handedly cut debt service of every company in the US.\n\n**Companies:** Look for individual companies well positioned for a world of remote work, AI, robotics, internet of things, space, e-commerce, domestic manufacturing. Avoid importers, healthcare, travel, banking. When boomers die, their heirs will divest from boomer companies. Invest in the future.\n\n**We\u2019re Fine.** America will be fine, but things will be permanently different. I just printed bigly, and will likely print more. Someone has to pay for it (old shit companies, young people, middle class, the future) but there are going to be major short term winners.\n\n**Melt Up**. Every big economic contraction is preceded by exuberance. Are we feeling exuberant yet? Not really, people are still scared. Stock prices are back up, but no one is confident. We need to get confident first, then start melting up. There are not enough pigs in the market yet, the slaughter can not yet start.\n\nSPY $375-$400 November.\n\n\u2014\n\n# WE'RE GOING DOWN\n\n**Market Collapse Realized**. Take note, the market collapse is coming when the medical solution is realized. This will signal new monetary policy, decrease in stimulus and an expectation that we \u201cActually get back to work and fix the economy.\u201d As soon as this process starts, consumer spending will go down, borrowing will go down, people will sell financial assets to cover debt obligations, investors will rotate into bonds as rates eventually get increased.\n\n**Vaccine = Party is Over.** This is a big one guys, when \u201cthe real solution\u201d to COVID is medically available my financial solution is going to \u201cpeak.\u201d I might be able to do a little more, but when the vaccine is available I have to ratchet this shit back slowly but surely. I can\u2019t drive this thing off the cliff, just need to steal from the poor and future generations as needed to make sure today is still good to go.\n\n**The Crash:** Yes, it is coming, but we need to melt up bigly first, then crash slowly from there. The FED has the markets propped up, but the American consumer and global economy won\u2019t be able to support it at these levels - there simply won\u2019t be enough money transacting and GDP will decline.\n\n**Stocks Will Go Down When:**\n\n* Things go back to normal. Thats when we have to start paying for this damage.\n* Stimulus ends. We will go straight down.\n* Me saying anything other than \u201cfull speed ahead\u201d at press conferences.\n* Tech stocks showing weakness.\n* If I let a medium company go bankrupt. This means some capitalism rules apply.\n* The investing class stops investing. Unemployment isn\u2019t a big deal, be worried when executives start getting pinched.\n* Corporate taxes are increased.\n* Capital gains taxes are increased.\n\n**The Big Short:** I would wait, but I think this one is pretty obvious guys. There are a ton of growth stocks, mainly in tech, with impossible valuations - these will get hit the hardest. Look for this charts that go straight up starting March 23rd. Take your pick:\n\nBuy puts after q2 earnings are released:\n\n* PDD\n* TSLA\n* SFIX\n* XP\n* WIX\n* SHOP\n* ZM\n* NVDA\n* UBER\n* QQQ\n* CRM\n* ROKU\n* WDFC\n* ETSY\n* LYFT\n* NOW\n* LULU\n* NFLX\n* PTON\n* SNAP\n* SQ\n* SMK\n* NKLA\n* BABA\n* DOCU\n* SPOT\n* TTD\n* W", "id": "hlu2y3", "created_utc": 1593982652.0, "score": 138, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "What the fuck even is normal anymore.", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "This is the new normal.
