Everyone who jumps into stocks are at different points in their investing careers with different amounts of funds at their disposal. When people ask \"what stocks should I invest in?\" it's always a loaded questions because it depends. What's your risk tolerance? How much do you have to invest? How long are you looking to invest for?   \n\n\n3. Don't get emotional. A trend I've seen on this board is when a stock, say Microsoft for example, goes down, and people get freaked out because they feel they're losing money. When you invest in something like Microsoft, Apple, Visa, Johnson & Johnson, etc. those are companies that are not going anywhere anytime soon. They're cornerstones of the stock market but they're not exempt from going up for down on any given day. Selling those stocks right now would be crazy. You've got to trust your picks and don't put any money in you're not prepared to lose.   \n\n\n4. Personally, I stay away from options trading. Yes, I know it's popular, yes I may be missing out on making more money, but I can live with that, because I'm just not there comfort wise, and frankly, I think a lot of people who do options trading don't really know what they're doing.

Most new people have no plan. \n\ngetting into the bank (looking at the option chain) and saying \"I'm robbing the bank\" (buying an option) is the easy part. the hard part is how to get out of the bank (selling the option)\n\nThat's why you need a plan. I generally only buy weeklies unless it's a ETF like SPY. So the premiums move faster on Thur/Fri then they do on Mon/Tue. So saying cut losses at 20% might work on Monday but on friday morning that might mean 1 bad candle.\n\nSo have a plan. If i enter a weekly on Monday i go in saying if this drops to -30% then I'm out. If I think it will run then I made a bad entry and I'll try to re-enter. That % might be -45% on a friday or example. \n\nHere's a formula if you can only trade Tesla for example and you really study the chart and can scalp it well.\n\n    156 Mon-Wed Trading Days (70% win rate)\n    ----------------------------\n    Winners: ($6000 * .3) * 109 ~= $196k\n    Losers: ($6000 * .4) * 47 ~= 112k\n    Diff: $196k-$112k = $84k\n    \n    104 Thur/Fri Trading Days (70% win rate)\n    ----------------------------\n    Winners ($2500 * .3) * 72 ~= $54k \n    Losers: ($2500 * .4) * 32 ~= $32k\n    Diff: $54k - $32 = $22k\n    \n    Total: $106k \n\nIf I told you that you could make $100k then most people would trade like this. Most could quit their job. I trade like this for a retirement fund and it works if you learn how certain tickers move. \n\nYes it's not sexy as a 400% runner but I can almost with 100% certainty tell you that those people who want 200% runners will blow up their account because they have no plan. \n\nThat's not to say i exit a trade as soon as it's 30%. If for example i hit 30% I set a mental stop at around 15%. If the thing runs to 150% then my mental stop might be 100% or I sell 1/3 at 100% let 2/3s run another 100% then let the final 1/3 run and see where it goes.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the trading tips!\n\nFor clarification, is the $6000 amount arbitrary in this example?

They need this stock at around $500.  Option trading went through the roof the past few days.  I\u2019m expecting an interesting pre market for NFLX.  I don\u2019t know how much further it will go down.  But MM have a way of pulling through to send stocks into a zone that\u2019s profitable for them.  Secondly the algos killed it right at close and it dropped to the $440s.  Rose to $480s right when After Hours ended.  So where it goes tomorrow is anyone\u2019s guess.  I think both people who made calls and puts will be greatly disappointed.  Puts most likely need to sell right away.  As for calls, I\u2019m not sure.  It goes up $10-20 Pre-Market and explodes initially at the open that\u2019s going to be volatility and call premiums will rise quickly.  This could give people a minute opportunity to break even or take a minimal loss.  But it\u2019s also good for MM because they got those traders out and if the stock rips and dips or dips and rips, it\u2019s less money for them to lose in the end.  I think NFLX will rally pretty well if I were to make a bold guess.  The earnings report is actually really really good.  From an investor stand point, the company is right around where it should be at the $500 level.  Tremendous positive cash flow.  Beat subs.  Beat revenue.  Just a missed EPS and shitty guidance for Q3 brought it down.  But there\u2019s a lot of bulls for this stock that don\u2019t give a shit about numbers and they want it up and up.
