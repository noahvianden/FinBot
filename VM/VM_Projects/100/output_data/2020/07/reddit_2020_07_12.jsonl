Mar 2022 will bring in about 58k which will put your cost basis around 950-1000/share. \n\nThen I would look at the bigger picture. If you think Tesla is gonna keep rallying, then you won\u2019t get assigned and just take in the premium alone. Still not bad given the return on capital. But you say you want to be long TSLA, not take in the premium. If you want to be sure you\u2019ll be long and truly believe in the company long term, you would need to take that premium and buy shares now, essentially doubling down on your bet. All good still as this will get you long the shares at a discount, but if things go wrong you\u2019ll be long 200 shares of Tesla rather than 100 for the put.  \n\nWhen you look at some of the fundamentals of Tesla, there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s way overpriced. There\u2019s zero question about that. Even the CEO went out and publicly said he thinks their stock price is too high. This is when Tesla was trading at around $900. So you\u2019re buying into the future potential of the company which is where the stock is valued. What if they start getting bad numbers on their next couple earnings reports and reality kicks in and the stock snaps back to $700/share? Just a year ago they were facing bankruptcy Concerns and the stock traded down to $180/share. \n\nI think there\u2019s a good chance the COVID concerns will be a lagging effect on Tesla and their reality will kick in dropping the stock price significantly. Look what happened to oil prices. Oil demand shot down because people were staying home. Do you really think people are out there buying just as many Tesla\u2019s as well they were prior to the coronavirus hitting? The demand for Tesla\u2019s will shoot down with a similar but lagging effect to oil. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m bullish on Tesla too, but $1500/share is just unreasonable and soon reality will kick in and the stock price will correct, leaving you in a situation where you could have got in at a significantly lower price.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "The argument I\u2019ve heard (to just share and discuss with you) is that people who can afford Tesla cars aren\u2019t the ones losing jobs in this pandemic (at least not yet).

That\u2019s nearly double the cost of a fully loaded top of the line Honda Civic, which is the best selling car in Canada. \n\nBulls are really out to lunch on the thesis that Tesla is changing the world. Electric vehicles were here before Tesla and they will sell, especially as ICEs are phased out gradually, but to think that the vast array of competitors with deep pockets are simply going to disappear and yield the entire market to Tesla is ridiculous. \n\nFurthermore, the argument of Tesla having the most data on self driving is a moot point since FSD won\u2019t be a reality unless every single car on the road is FSD and they can communicate with each other. \n\nLastly, there are two enormous risks to Tesla.

{"title": "DD from a post of mine 2 weeks ago. VIX 70 calls 08/22", "selftext": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgeyf9/weekend\\_discussion\\_thread\\_for\\_the\\_weekend\\_of\\_june/fw7tu1m?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgeyf9/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_june/fw7tu1m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nComment was made 2 weeks ago and so far it's panning out exactly as planned. I'm calling the top this week (7/12) or the next as mentioned in the original comment. The behavior of TSLA and others during the past week has all the hallmarks of the start of a blown off top. Here's the original text:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\n40 contracts on VIX 70c 08/22\n\nI usually get call contracts for VIX as a hedge. Last time paid off handsomely as it coincided with dklev's post.\n\nI am seeing the same behavior and decided to re-enter the position at $0.8 per contract. In my opinion here are the following catalysts for VIX potentially breaching $80\n\n1. EU ban on American travel including Business starting on July 1st.\n2. Inevitable lockdown measures from Florida and Texas. Death rate is not yet high because both states still have ICU beds. That will change in the next 10 days after which, unfortunately, the death rate will spike in those states.\n3. New stimulus check will not pass until we get a few red days. Internally, the GOP is facing an existential crisis. There are MANY members who oppose continuing the $600/week or the $1200 round 2. But they will change their mind with a 15-20% drop on SPY.\n4. NIKE earnings. This is much bigger than people realize and I honestly think this will be one of the main catalysts. NIKE showed that the USA is completely halted sale-wise but also that the REST of the world including the countries that are already on post-covid reality. Spending habits have changed, perhaps for the foreseeable retail future and Q2 earnings will bring a barrage of bad news plus very conservative guidance (if any at all)\n5. RH/Day trader/Home trader: this is exactly the same thing that happened in 2000. After record spending in IT many IT contractors found themselves at home with spare cash to spend and all of a sudden considering day trading as a serious full time job. With a \"stonks only up\" market many proceeded to make serious $$$ while making fun of Buffett, Wall St, etc. But eventually the lack of full time job and inevitable market slowdown required people to take profits and this happens at a time where earnings were just starting to get really sour. Well, the same exact thing is happening now. The last unemployment checks will come on July 26th. People are already curtailing their spending very aggressively. RH traders that are beating the market handsomely will keep doing it until the first serious red days (i.e. when a major player like AAPL or similar reports a big drop - same like in 2000s when AMZN reported lackluster quarter). The lack of discipline combined with the diamond hands effect will drive this market into the ground. Fundamentals will get it going but RH/home traders will drive it into overdrive just like in the turn of the century. I believe this will happen within the next 2 month time frame.\n\nTLDR: I'm calling rally market top in the 2nd or 3rd of week of July followed by maybe 1-2 days of blown top (i.e. major green day) and then the inevitable deleveraging.\n\nVIX 70c 08/22\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------EDIT: Note the additional items:\n\n\\-> Florida just recorded 15k cases a nearly 40% jump in a single day.\n\n\\-> Houston beds completely at capacity and many others as well\n\n\\-> Multiple comments from Senate members that any additional stimulus (if passed) will be lower than $600 a week\n\n\\-> Death rate 2 weeks ago was 300/day now around 900/day.
