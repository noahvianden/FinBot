He detailed the work his teams have done over the years and it's a lot of post manufacturing software testing so that chips can be properly binned into their correct speeds, i.e. what makes a chip an i3/5/7 is really just based on the quality of the production of the chip, often called the \"silicon lottery\" where the best chips that can go the fastest often are made from the same wafer as the lesser chips that go slower. There are systems in place that allow them to yeild many more of the high end chips than their competitors. So much so that most of them come out this way and they actually had to design a system to LOWER the quality of their chips by switching parts of the CPU off permanently via internal one times fuses. Once you measure the capability of the CPU the software determines what product level it can be sold at, again i3/5/7 etc and then pops all the necessary fuses to make it so. This process is so powerful and unique that as far as I know not many other companies do it. It's simply not worth their time and money to bring that level of quality control to their products, but Intel designed these processes a long time ago. And that's why if they really wanted to go all out, they'd rofl stomp the market. They've literally spent billions of dollars reining in their power. Now admittedly they are having a hard time with 7nm, which is interesting, but the company I work at is working hard every day to provide the chemicals they need to get the best wafer etches and overall layer to layer consistency. I always joke with my dad that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree as I just ended up working at a chemical company that sells to Intel haha.

And spun of their fab and as tech nodes kept shrinking they\u2019ve been getting ridiculously hard to build and crazy expensive to outfit for. Intel has to carry that weight all on their own.  Amd has had the option and ability to work with multiple fabs.  The fans have had the benefit of working together to build these new technology nodes and sharing the cost on it.  Since they worked together developing the chips can be designed under a single design package and designers are able to change who builds their chip whenever they like, even after production has begun, or have two favs making them. Apple shunned Samsung\u2019s fab because they don\u2019t like to source from any company they see as a competitor. That freed up a lot of room to produce a lot of chips though it did cut down on how much anyone could get out of tsmc. Another benefit of not owning their own fab is these favs are working with a bunch of different design companies to make their processing better and increase their yields. \n\nWith intel they\u2019re carrying all the cost, all the load, and everything about everything that they do is intel\u2019s style.  That can even make it tough for them to hire people since everyone else is on industry standards for methodology, procedures, even the type of software they use. It makes it tough for them to bring on skilled labor because the my have come up on a totally new environment.  Some people don\u2019t want to work for them because they\u2019re not fans of the firm \u2018intel way\u2019, which in many opinions is not the innovation it used to be.  And again, they\u2019re on their own. Even the universities teach by industry standards, only intel teaches intel standards. \n\nWhen I worked at AMD there they still had major issues getting their foresight and spending under control. The company actually started on the comeback at the same time they were starting to cut down head counts and even sell off teams. It also was also around that time they\u2019re thinking changed to \u2018forget intel and whatever they\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing our own thing\u2019.  People had no idea they even had a chance for the comeback. Most people thought it was more likely they\u2019d keep selling off pieces, cutting headcount, or maybe get bought out for their patents.  \n\nDamn, I\u2019d have more to talk about, but I didn\u2019t even expect to type this much.  I was just gonna make a quick comment. \n\nLisa has been great for the company, but even better for the stock.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth what it\u2019s at but it can keep running on the break out. After all, there isn\u2019t anyone who owns it that\u2019s not making money, so why would they sell?  Then intels stock, probably not worth where it\u2019s at, but they\u2019re known as the lower house. It\u2019s really the IBM story all over again. Will they emerge?  Maybe if they give up on the intel way and start getting into the industry to share the weight but keep their talents to shine.  Lately, I kinda feel like the only reason intel is even up where they\u2019re at is because all the semi companies have been on monster runs for a long time now.

We can make our own stuff.\", maybe they would have tried alone for a couple years and then come crawling back to Tesla, but it wouldn't be a good business relationship. \n\nIf the wait another 2-3 years many OEMs would start to have a lot of sunk costs into their own battery and powertrain technology and be hesitant to abandon everything in favor of Tesla. Who knows, someone could have actually started making really good electric powertrains and start to rival Tesla. \n\nDoing this now most OEMs have been forced to dip their toes in the water. They don't really have solution and are scrambling. Are investigating Tesla's technology they've realized this is something very different and they may actually be screwed trying to compete with this. \n\nLike BMW started making some EVs but recently said they will continue to stand by combustion engines since they think some people may still care about them in the future. I mean, if everyone goes EV there's a niche in the market to sell just really polished and beautiful ICE cars for novelty, like horses today. But it's also pretty much admitting defeat and recognizing there's just no way your company will be able to compete, so you need to capture a more niche market. \n\nHow it will affect Tesla's business and how many will choose to buy real Teslas vs repackaged Teslas in the future, I don't really know. However, if other automakers go for this, it will solidify Tesla as the market leader and stop other OEMs from treating them adversarially. \n\nThis may not be the best for the actual consumer, but battery and manufacturing costs are dropping rapidly for everyone. If others were racing with Tesla to make the best EV, it would start becoming a race to the bottom with margins and price. People seem pretty comfortable paying $30-40k for a car nowadays, say that $35k car costs $25k to manufacture, costs for everyone drops down to $15k based on cheaper batteries, motors, automation, and stamping ect, then other companies would be inclined to lower their prices to push their inferior cars over Tesla. A $20k brand new EV that still does all the basics is hard to pass up Vs a $40k Tesla, so prices will have to come down for everyone. \n\nIf everyone starts using the same Tesla powertrain and underlying technology, there will be more cooperation and kinda mutual agreement to keep costs around the same to maintain healthy margins for everyone, benefiting Tesla most of all. Just look at Smartphones, the first iPhone was $499, nowadays people seem mostly fine with a $1,000 flagship phone, that's just what they cost. \n\nA few years ago Smartphone makers could buy a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC for around $40, this generation Qualcomm wanted $150 for the Snapdragon 865. Everyone was mostly fine with that cost increase, like every android smartphone sold in the world uses a Qualcomm SoC so there are no winners or losers here, costs increase equally for everyone. They're kinda getting greedy and pushing up the Snapdragon 875 to $250, every flagship phone released 2021 will still use that chip and pay that price. Qualcomm is releasing a cheaper SoC for $45, but you know, everyone wants the fastest phone. \n\nThis is getting very long, but to pull this back, I don't think Tesla will jack up prices immensely, they kinda seem to want to lower prices whenever they can. However once they're established as a reliable powertrain supplier, they could turn to OEMs and say like \"Hey do you want this SpaceX Powertrain with ROCKETS? Air compressors and cold gas thrusters to accelerate at up to 2G included, we can sell it for $150k.\"", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You can\u2019t compare to smart phones.
