{"title": "TSLA June 2022 $5 PUTs", "selftext": "Just curious on TSLA June 2020 put options with stike price of $5 dollars. There are over 20,000 open contracts with 48 traded today ( very low volume). These are trading at 24 cents with low bid to ask spread. If I sell these put contracts, it is about 4.8% return for about 23 months (approx 2.5 percent per year). This is much better than any CD or treasury return for 2 years. There is opportunity cost of not using the $500 for two years but other than that is there anything I am missing?

You can be obligated at any time to buy $TSLA stock for $5.00/share. It closed today at $1,546. That would be a 99.67% pullback.\n\nIt is virtually unthinkable on July 15th, 2020, however, as others have pointed out, if it were a sure thing that it wouldn't exercise people wouldn't be taking the other side of the trade. If Tesla were to Enron itself and completely disappear in two years (anything can happen, I suppose, and you don't know what you don't know) your max loss would be $500 - $24 = $476 per contract less commissions paid to STO.\n\nThe best case scenario is you make 2.4% nominal per year. The average market return is 8-11%. I don't like to use the phrase \"picking up nickels in front of a steamroller\" but this really seems like it.

So my philosophy and decision-making revolves around where I see the company in 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.\n\nIndustry analysis:   and i do it very broadly speaking.  Who is competing in the industry, who has  the edge, but even more importantly, is the entire industry a growing one.  It's okay if an industry is saturated with competition as long as the industry is growing, which allows the players to capture a piece of the pie that is growing.  I personally like growth, so if i don't think the industry has room to grow in the long term I won't invest there.\n\nCompany analysis**:  who are the insiders/ what is their vision of the company/ where do they set themselves apart.  What is the culture of the Company?  -- this is where you find and adopt your belief in the company.  I can't emphasize this research eniugh because at the end of the day. My decision comes down to  \" do i think this company has a significant place in the future\"  -- if the answer to this question is a no then no matter what other positive information I've read, I will not invest into a company if this is a no.\n\nFinancial analysis, I'll try and keep this light: I put the least amount of weight here when making a decision.

Is it r&d? Cost of sales? Operational expense?\n\nIdeally u want cost of sales to be growing much slower than revenues because this tells you that there is scalability.\n \nWhat doesn't concern me: eps/ and pe  ratio/ a lot of other value investing statistical ratios : my philosophy revolves around growing companies.  And tbh  If a company isn't profiting because they are spending money on themselves and investing towards their growth, that's good for me.  If they're not profiting because they haven't reached economies of scale that is also fine, but I do want to see that they're trending towards scalability.\n\nBalance sheet: \n\nGrowing companies tend to fail because they mismanage their current year to year finances.  Looking far ahead is great as long as you can get through the year \n\nWhat i look for: current assets vs current liabilities.  Can they afford to meet their annual obligations.  If not, do they have access to capital from somewhere and will it be sufficient.\n\nCash flow statement:\n\nThis is basically the circulatory system of a company.  Healthy Cash flow in my opinion holds way more power than profits.   If a company has a negative cash flow it doesn't mean game over,but you should research as to why.  Is it because there is no economies of scale or is it because theyre spending profits on themselves. I like to see the latter if free cash flow is negative.\n\n\nI apologize for the length of this post.  Feel free to dm me if anyone wants some clarity on any of the topics I wrote about.

You could sell and cut your loss because it's anyone's guess which way it will go now and I suspect it's overbought significantly. That said, it could also go up. Its hard to say because Tesla is a cult stock with massive hype. If it didn't have cult status and hype most people would tell you it's going to drop, a lot. The problem with hype is that you don't know when it will end. Probably why even though people load up on Tesla shorts they keep getting burned. But it will stop eventually. The graph can't bend over back on itself. It has to correct eventually.\n\nThe problem I see with Tesla at this value is that it's not something everyone has or is looking to get. Apple and Amazon, I get it. Everyone uses prime. Everyone wants an iPhone.\n\nNot everyone wants a Tesla and when I drive I still see only a handful of them. A lot of car owners still have problems with the idea of getting a Tesla. Especially truck owners which is a huge part of the market. If they had it, maybe they would deserve this valuation. I think people are pricing in future market dominance before it's happened. It's become very speculative.\n\nYour only other option. (other than sell or hold) is to start averaging your price down. I would do it slowwwwwly. That means increasing your exposure to risk though and you're potentially in for a long time. You put in smaller amounts of money at lower prices and start averaging cost out to increase your position. I would only do this if you're leaning towards going long and you have money to burn. Do it in several price levels. Start with a small piece and increase as the dip expands. You will know when it's going back to steady and back up.\n\nBe wary of prices that are parabolic. Be sure it's going to continue or stay away from it. People like to say on reddit \"stonks go up\" and they do, but they also go down. The majority of stocks are not a straight arrow up and it's entirely possible that some levels will not be seen again. That's true for the majority of stocks. When they are exploring new prices, it's risky to buy in.\n\nOne thing you can do, is you can watch the volume indicator and check sentiments around the stock in the next few days. If they start trickling off, that's a bad sign.\n\nLearn the lesson from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel for you and anyone I see who makes this kind of post.
