Not likely considering one is in the rise and the other is on the decline.\n\nSo Apple revolutionised the smartphone market and dominated it.\n\nMicrosoft revolutionsed the software industry and dominated it.\n\nFb dominated the social networking industry.\n\nGoogle dominated the search industry.\n\nTesla is in the midst of revolutionising the automotive, energy, frieght and transportation (robotaxis - possibility) industries(Dont sleep on their Tesla insurance). All these industries are behemoths and just to capture one of them would result in them absolutely crushing competition. All these industries have quite a high barrier of entry (extensive charging network, software, etc..) especially if you need to throw in self driving to really bring transportation into the future. \n\nFor my bull sceneario, i would say im fairly certain that Tesla would be a trillion dollar company (if not more) once they solve self driving and get government approval.\n\nFor my bear sceneario, they lose their competitive advantage(Highly unlikely as it takes years and years to catch up to Tesla's current standards) and become just another car company. \n\nAs an investor of Tesla, i do not want them to focus on bringing the company to profit, i want them to dump money back into research, into expanding their charging network, their solar integration and other competitive advantages that would make it impossible for competitors to catch up. Then we start to look at profits. The Jeff Bezos way if u will. \n\nSo to paint an ideal bull case for Tesla:\n\nYou park your tesla at home, charged by your solar roof. When you leave for work, you are chauffeured to your destination in your self driving tesla while u can have some shuteye. If your vehicle detects that its low on battery, it drives itself to a super charger while you get to play games on your car's massive screen. \n\nYou reach work refreshed and ready to go when your shipment arrives in a Tesla Semi. You unload your shipment and distributes it to your retail outlets in a Tesla van. You get off work all tired and your Tesla is there to pick you up. If say you get into an accident with a human driver on the way home, your insurance would be so much lower than that of the ICE vehicle.\n\nYou reach home and you send your car off on its own to a repair shop. During your vehicle's downtime, you could book a low cost Tesla robotaxi ride instead. \n\nLook at Apple as a comparison, their ecosystem is so robust and profitable that they need not be the company with the most devices sold to be the largest market cap in the world. They sell things that people want and need. You may think that comparing Tesla to Apple is ridiculous but consider this. Do you need energy? Do you need batteries? Do you need stuff delivered to you? Do you need a cleaner and healthier world, a world not as reliant on fossil fuels as we are now? Tesla has been making cars people want for quite awhile now, all the while not spending a single cent on advertising. \n\nSo to me, the potential upside is so much greater than the downside.

You make calls and text your friends the same way. \n\nElectric cars on the other hand is fundamentally different from ICE cars. People are used to filling up their tanks in a short period of time. People may feel uneasy not being in control of their car. The entire dynamic of the automotive and transport industry has changed. \n\nThats only on the consumer side of things.\n\nOn the distribution side, Tesla eliminated the middle man. They are vertically integrated and streamlined the production process. Imagine toyota cutting out dealerships and after sales model.

Most ICE cars cant even turn on electricity without turning on the engine! \n\nSo.. they cant play catch up cos they are really far behind, they cant turn a profit due to declining sales( ford and gm is in a real hole now). And they are still developing a product that would in time to come, be obsolete. I think the plan going forward for these legacy makes is to just buy tech from Tesla. And thats the beauty of this stock.\n\nIn conclusion, yes, Tesla is competing in several categories and industries. But those industry are slow to react in the digital age.

But then in fall/winter of 1998 it pulled a Tesla and skyrocketed to $80/share, holding there for a very short time and then crashed back to $50/share in Feb of 1999.  Between Feb and April it did what TSLA is doing now and skyrocketed to $105/share for absolutely no good reason.  Then over the summer of 99 it collapsed back to $45/share and everybody was bummed and many were wiped out.  But then in August through December it again skyrocked to $106 in early Dec of 1999.    That is pretty much like TSLA is today.  A price absolutely unhinged from reality.   AMZN then did a steady but consistent fall from $106/share to $6/share by Sept of 2001.   Most of the stockholders got wiped out.   However those that held finally got back to $106/share in late 09/early 2010.  Whew, what a long time to be totally underwater.

Meanwhile Tesla has scaled, finally reaching profitable quarters and experiencing exponential growth, all the while extending their lead. Not to mention Tesla's invested heavily on battery manufacturing and already has a gigafactory battery production factory in Nevada.\nThere's EV slated for 2024 coming from other companies that are short of today's model 3 priced at 60k without self driving or autopilot.\nVolkswagen said in their shareholder meeting that they're behind a decade behind Tesla in software.\nAll the while they have to restructure their entire production for the inevitable EV transition, while losing their massive investment on their combustion engine. On top of that, Tesla sells online to order. They have to restructure all their sales infrastructure because dealers will become irrelevant since most of their revenue is acquired via car maintenance. But all you have to maintain with \nEVs are tires and windshield wipers. \nAlso for example BMW and Mercedes just ended their alliance on the race for autonomy, signaling that they can't agree on direction or the current pandemic is slowing down plans. Other companies have also since shut down their autonomy campaigns.\nNow these companies have to partner up with Nvidia, Waymo, Zoox, Cruze and hire drivers for their Self Driving program. Meanwhile  Tesla gathers data from a fleet of their own customers essentially getting paid for it.\nThe difference here is Tesla created the race, and its in their DNA.

Instead, just look at revenue, COGS, gross profit, market cap. That shows you what the markets are offering for inputs and outputs to any business trying to operate in that market. Everything else is merely how well the business can operate those inputs and outputs. Toyota $280b revenue for $230b COGS gives $50b gross profit, for a market cap of $174b, about 3.5x. Tesla $26b revenue for $21b COGS gives $5b gross profit, for a market cap of $224b, about 44.0x. Not unsurprisingly, the gross profit relative  proportion is about the same - there are not amazing efficiencies to be discovered in car manufacturing lines. So for current valuation to hold up, Tesla must grow about 10x with no change in valuation. That would put them at the size of Toyota. And they'd still be higher valued than Toyota at that level. You take a guess if the size of the $50k luxury electric car market is as big as all of Toyota's global sales combined. Tesla revenue actual / estimate growth is like 1.9x, 1.9x, 1.2x, 1.1x since 2016.  \n  \nAll of that, and TSLA is absolutely a pop culture / meme stock. You hear people talk about buying it at the grocery store. The fundamental financials are completely bonkers and make zero sense, even when you hope for growth.

You did not say \"Mommy\" by saying the M sound and then the \"O\" sound and then the M sound again, etc. and put all the sounds together. That's more complex than just speaking for Pete's sake! So why should we teach our kids to talk that way? The ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) method does just that. They show the kid the letter \"T\" and the kid needs to say the \"T\" sound 8 of 10 times to \"master\" it before going on to the next sound. I have seen this first hand. If you buy into my common sense approach, the whole traditional education system should be changed. The reason the system still exists is that us normal, typical folks, figure out the meaning ourselves and we learn. For example, I used to play with numbers when I was five years old.

The bell curve distribution the guy showed for it in the video showed that 100% of those in the standardisation group that got 38+ had an ASD. This is what got me thinking about all this again recently. \n\nMy psychiatrist said that the main issue he had with saying I had an ASD (apart from that as I was then late 20s it wouldn't have made any difference in treatment for the real issues), was that I seem to have developed relatively normal social skills, and be able to understand emotions of others to a reasonable extent, even though I'm extremely unemotional and have a flat affect myself.\n\nHe said that it's possible that I learned these skills through observation and trying things repeatedly. When people are showing emotion around me I feel extremely awkward, but know what to say to show I care and to get people talking and open up and I can go on for hours discussing whatever they want to about it without feeling drained emotionally (because to me it's just ask a question, get an answer, then ask another based on that and so on), but inside me I just don't feel it, or care on an emotional level, though on an intellectual level/have thoughts that I do.\n\nSorry to be a bit long winded, but basically, is it possible for someone with a milder ASD, be able to essentially be able to learn these skills over time and develop a kind of repetoire and behaviours that are known to work in this or that situation, and in a sense, seem less \"typical\" for an ASD? One previous gf of mine was very good socially and she really noticed that I was a bit awkward and seized up when things were unfamiliar and I couldn't work out what was expected or what I should do, so I'd kinda do nothing. For example, if I'm in a situation in which I'm working with anyone on something, I'm fine and comfortable talking and making jokes etc, but if there isn't that small focus or purpose of working together, things for me become much more difficult even though you'd think if you're okay in the first situation you should be fine in the second. \n\nI spoke to one of my parents about it and went through that whole test with me and agreed on each answer, but disagreed that I was on the spectrum. I saw a few specialists for ADHD as a child and they never brought anything AS related up. Though I have really wondered since that test now whether the psychiatrist, and 2 friends who've worked with autistic people might've had a point. Plus yeah, getting really deep into trading and loving all the patterns and numbers etc, that's kinda hard to ignore too tbh.\n\nEdit: I just remembered one other thing too, I tend to go on and on about the same shit when speaking or even messaging, sometimes to the extent that even I realise I should shut up and move on. Haven't managed to fix up that habit yet, but maybe one day. And yeah, go into way too much detail, like this question I guess haha.

Why can a child not have a friend in first grade and continue to not have a friend in 8th grade? What a failure of the educational system! That's because being in a class with others is not enough. What I mean by an internal/developmental change is for example a person may not consider others and be very egocentric. This starts to develop around two and many kids on the spectrum do not develop this, and there is what I call a developmental gap.

One way to practice emotion regulation is to put people in a situation where they want something \u2013 something that they are motivated to do or get, and then force them to use logic. How does a person control his emotions?  It\u2019s practicing putting himself in, or someone helping him put him in, a situation where he\u2019s motivated to stop this emotional impulsive reaction, in order to get what he wants.  He needs to think and use his intellect and logic to his benefit.  The final step is for him to be aware of what he did and say \u2018wow, hey now, it might be OK to stop reacting\u2019 and to stop and think instead.  That\u2019s the goal.

{"title": "[DD] All aboard AXDX!", "selftext": "This is my first DD. I feel really good about it. I\u2019m just your average investor/trader/gambler, but do like to dig deep, and think I found something here. Let's go.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nBuy AXDX calls. July/Aug/Nov exp.  15-20 strikes. Shoot for 25 for max tendies.\n\nGo long AXDX shares on margin, too.\n\nWhy?\n\n* Experienced investor with an awesome track record of winning as a shareholder (and fighting for shareholder value) recently showed showing extreme confidence in the company ($25MM buy)\n* They are gonna get $ from COVID testing revenues incoming which were not expected in their business plans at all (and this is a relatively low rev company, so the boost will look great)\n* EUA for the tests < 2 weeks away from being announced - we have evidence from other applications that it should be any time now\n* Besides all that, everything on track with their normal core business and it shouldn't be much affected by COVD\n\nNow, for the real story...\n\n**It started with a LARGE buy that caught my eye**\n\nActually, a series of buys from [Jack Schuler](https://www.schulerprogram.org/staff/jack-schuler). Schuler has spent over 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, including having served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Abbott Laboratories.  Today, Mr. Schuler serves on the board of directors for several companies, including Accelerate Diagnostics, Quidel Corporation and Biodesix, Inc.\n\n[I'll do the math for you: that's $26.7MM of stock purchased during this dip. ](https://preview.redd.it/gy6yh4icti851.png?width=3106&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7772f0e78fa18ee01554cd2a9b85fff26c97aa)\n\nOK, so insider sales don't mean everything? We don't panic when we see selling because sometimes people just need to cash out. So we cannot just assume this means anything. Can we?\n\n**Looking back at Jack's buying history - this was a v big buy for Jack**\n\nLooking back, Schuler is quite active in [investing in his companies](https://elite.finviz.com/insidertrading.ashx?oc=1021412&tc=7). But it's not always buys, he does sell. And if you look further back, you actually see some interesting things.\n\nStarting with AXDX: Before the buys shown above, the last time Jack made a slew of purchases was between [Aug 11 2017](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727207/000114420417043378/xslF345X03/v473193_4.xml) and [May 15 2018](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727207/000114420418029491/xslF345X03/tv494321_4.xml) when he purchased $29MM total. Note that this was over the course of a year for an average price of about $20 a share. Prior to those buys, you have to go back to Jan 2017 before he made any other bets.\n\n*In other words, Jack just bought as much stock in the last few months than he'd bought in the previous few years.*\n\nSo it seems like Jack feels really good about buying this dip. Is that enough? Probably... but let's keep going.\n\n**Jack has been around the block - and Jack likes winning (Jack gets top $ for Ventana)**\n\nHe's been quite successful in being an activist that fights for his shareholders. That is a great thing if you are in investor. I managed to stumble across this gem: [Jack Schuler historical record of 'dirty tricks' in business](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4349&mn=39&pt=msg&mid=6732323). It's truly amazing. It's some dude's salty manifesto about how Jack S is a actually just a bad ass investor.\n\nBack in 2007, Roche wanted to buy Ventana who Jack was an investor in. He has big problems with the initial price that was offered and slowed down the deal. Here's what he said:\n\n>\"This is about stockholder value,\" said Ventana chairman Jack Schuler. \"Simply put, we believe that Roche is trying to capture value for its stockholders that rightly belongs to Ventana's stockholders.\" Ironically, as Roche was hailing its offer as a 44% premium on Ventana's stock value of $51.95 on June 22, 2007 (the last trading day before Roche submitted its bid to Ventana), the stock has steadily risen to a recent close of more than $83.\n\nPreach! He's not playing dirty tricks. He wants shareholder value. What's wrong with that? Long story short, the deal was hung up because Jack needed all of his tendies.  It eventually went through at a [19.3% premium to Roche's initial offer on June 27, 2007](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/roche-holding-ag-to-acquire-ventana-medical-systems-inc-for-89-50-per-share-/). Well done, Jack! I'd certainly want him to negotiate 20% more for my shares.\n\n**Turns out Jack has a history of winning - Jack wins with Stericycle, Medtronic, and more**\n\nDigging deeper, Jack (and John Patience, the same one from the screenshot below) did the same trick with [Stericycle](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121617335185356747). The buys referenced in this article were unloaded 4-5 years later for 80-100% profits.\n\nHe also did it with [Medtronic in 2010](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052970203296004575339213130461810?tesla=y).  He picked up 30,000 shares at an average price of $36.93 each on June 25. Medtronic is at $93 today ($115 pre-covid) and pays a dividend. That ones seems to have worked out too.\n\nHe has other winners too. Jack. Is. A. Winner.\n\n**Is** ***that*** **enough?**\n\nHonestly, for you degens, yeah it should be. Jack has a strong track record. He thinks $10 is way too cheap, so he just bought an assload. Also, we know he doesn't hate money. A man like that never starts to hate money.\n\n**Did I say a COVID tailwind? Yup.**\n\nDid I mention that they have a [COVID tailwind](https://acceleratediagnostics.com/fight-against-covid-19)? I shit you not. It keeps getting better. You know the serology tests that determine if you've had CV? That test for antibodies? Well, turns out AXDX was perfectly set up to capitalize because they can make these. And they are planning to do so!\n\nOn top of a slow and steady growth of sales of medical devices, which is AXDX's core business, AXDX can monetize on these tests which will be really important in the coming year  as the world learns how to live with COVID (knowing who has had the disease is very important). From the CEO on the [earnings call in May:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/09/accelerate-diagnostics-axdx-q1-2020-earnings-call.aspx)\n\n>Lastly, through a recently signed collaboration agreement with BioCheck Ltd, we have begun commercializing the MS-FAST fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer and SARS-COV-2 test for the detection of IgG and IgM. **This partnership has the potential to provide both an avenue to reengage prospective customers on Pheno as well as a near-term revenue uplift.** The performance data for these assays are best-in-class with sensitivity and specificity estimated as exceeding 95% for both assays based on over 100 samples collected at the source of the pandemic, Wuhan, China. Since announcing the partnership on April 15, we have received several indications of interest across the global business.  \n>  \n>**We are continuing to work with the FDA on our emergency use authorization for commercialization in the U.S., and we have taken initial orders in EMEA.** While we are tremendously excited about this collaboration agreement and are eager to play a role in fighting this pandemic, it remains too early to estimate the revenue potential of this opportunity. In my 30 years in diagnostics, I have never experienced a period of such profound disruption. **However, with this disruption comes the creation of new opportunities, the near-term impact from this pandemic to accelerate and most other healthcare companies is significant while at the same time shining a brighter light on the value of rapid diagnostics for infectious disease.**\n\nAwesome! So, we are stumbling into quite a bit revenue we were not expecting. That's dope. More good news? Yup. The CEO references that their **core product (Pheno) now has advantages due to COVID that will help future sales:**\n\n>And a big part of this will be, in my opinion, will be around how do you better manage infectious disease crises, how do you better manage secondary infections, how do you better manage bed utilization and staff utilization? And those are all things that Pheno directly addresses. I mean **Pheno gets patients on optimal therapy much, much quicker, two, three days quicker, and get patients out of the hospital two to five days quicker in some cases**. And so with that, I mean, as healthcare providers look at these things, I mean, **we fully expect them to be really having a heightened sense of interest in what we're doing in this space.**\n\n**Is now the time?**\n\nI think so. First, let's check AXDX over the past 5 years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0o2vw40m3j851.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd6870849fbd180cae421c934b8c6f509301dfb\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Lots of ups and down, but pretty consistently shoots above $20 (which will make us tendies)\n* In 2019 (pre-covid), it easily sat in the $18-$22 range.\n* We closed at **$15.86 today** after touching $17s yesterday and this morning. Profit raking before the weekend in the Hamptons. I'm not worried.\n* Looking back in the news on AXDX, I see no cause for concern. This is just a medical device company that's finally starting to see revenue.\n\nYou may notice the spike at the end of the chart...\n\n**Let's zoom in to the last three months - a recent run up and dip offer a chance to buy**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fiy5eew34j851.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=a868130d3e1a2449542e6822029ece6603088f4e\n\nIn the past month:\n\n* I suspect that others noticed what I have noticed, so it's been up up an away.\n* This week was especially bonkers. Up 5-10% most days. Never seen action like it.\n* But notice that **today was a BIG DOWN** day after 6 in a row up. It had to cool off. Maybe it cools off more Monday...? It will have reasons to go up soon that have not yet materialized (more below)\n* I see no reason why we wouldn't be headed back to ranges that it was safely in last year... especially with the tailwinds due to testing revenue, Jack S's confidence, and the recovery of markets (though AXDX is hardly affected by the shutdown).\n\n**Buy the dip, before the EUA approval!**\n\n***Remember those serology tests? AXDX is within weeks, by my estimate, of getting those approved for use.*** What pharma company doesn't love a nice FDA approval pop?\n\nSo when will it happen? Some digging: if you check here, you can see that the [FDA is pumping out these approvals](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covid19euas).\n\nBeckman Coulter was a recent company to get the approval, this [Monday on June 29, to deliver 30MM tests a month](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/en/about-beckman-coulter/newsroom/press-releases/2020/q2/2020-june-29-bec-sars-cov-2-igg-antibody-test-fda-eua). If you check back on their press releases, they were [chirping about this in late April](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/en/about-beckman-coulter/newsroom/press-releases/2020/q2/2020-apr-22-bec-serology-tests). So this process for them took \\~2 months.\n\nGoing back to AXDX's last conference call (May 8), we can read between the lines:\n\n>We **recently** filed for FDA emergency use authorization for our Pheno respiratory test kit, positioning its benefits for ventilated COVID-19 patients. If approved, this authorization will provide accelerate an avenue to reengage prospective and current customers, obtain useful analytical and clinical data on this new test and help some affected patients.\n\nAnd in the Q+A:\n\n>We have an EUA submitted, as I mentioned, for IgG and IgM combo test. We're also going to be submitting an EUA for individual tests for both IgG and IgM over the next couple of days. **The FDA has already come back to us with a few pieces of data that we need to follow up on which is pretty standard.**  \n>  \n>And we're working on that now. And in addition to that, I would say that we are submitting for a 510(k) for the MS-FAST instrument, and we're working on that currently as well with the consultant. Accelerate is the authorized legal agent for BioCheck. **And so we're basically spearheading all of the dialogue between the FDA and this opportunity which is a good thing because of the vast experience we have with the FDA already.**  \n>  \n>And so our expectation is, again I guess to be clear, t**here's been no setback at all relative to our submission**. And the new guidance that has come out. And then the last thing **I would say is the performance data that we have already submitted with the FDA is excellent data. And it already meets the requirements that they have called out.**  \n>  \n>Our sensitivity and specificity for both the IgG and IgM test or are both very solid. And again, **we're continuing to work with the FDA and hope to hear some positive outcomes here over the next couple of weeks.**\n\nBy the looks of it, from the statements and how press released line up, AXDX [was also writing press releases](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/accelerate-diagnostics-and-biocheck-announce-commercial-supply-and-collaboration-agreement-to-distribute-ms-fast-chemiluminescence-immunoassay-analyzer-and-sars-cov-2-antibody-tests/) in April about this, ***they applied to the FDA in late April or early May***. Given that Beckman Coulter's process took about 2 months... ***I think we could be very very close to an announcement, and I'd certainly expect it before 7/17*** (cough - calls - cough). \\[I checked a few other EUA timelines, and \\~2 months is about right\\]\n\n**That's it. What else do you need? Go buy some AXDX because:**\n\n* Experienced investor with an awesome track record of winning as a shareholder (and fighting for shareholder value) recently showed showing extreme confidence in the company ($25MM buy)\n* They are gonna get $ from COVID testing revenues incoming which were not expected in their business plans at all (and this is a relatively low rev company, so the boost will look great)\n* EUA for the tests < 2 weeks away from being announced - we have evidence from other applications that it should be any time now\n* Besides all that, everything on track with their normal core business and it shouldn't be much affected by COVD\n\n***What's not to like?***\n\n**My positions**\n\nJacked to the tits on 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 calls expiring in July, Aug, and Nov. Probably $25k across those. Then another $25k or so of shares.
