{"title": "The real reason $TSLA will only go up", "selftext": "Hey guys. Keep loading up on $TSLA calls, because at this rate, they're only going to go up. \n\nThere are two huge reasons; one is based on real evidence, the other is my autistic brain figuring out Elon's 2000 IQ play.\n\nNumber one, and the obvious reason $TSLA is going up at this rate, is due to Elon's recent bonus deal. \n\nElon will be awarded a 55.8 billion bonus should the company reach the 650 billion mark within the next 10 years (as well as other set conditions). This plan was originally started in 2018 I believe, so he's just being aggressive and trying to fulfill this duty.\n\nThe second, 3000 IQ play that Elon is doing right now is YUGE.\n\nFor some background, Tesla recently announced that their factories produced around 100,000 vehicles this quarter, drastically exceeding expectations, and putting them on the road to break even, and even better - exceed earnings. This will give Elon and Tesla their 4th positive quarter in a row, which could land them on the S&P 500, increasing investor confidence, therefore increasing value, sending them closer to that 650 million mark. \n\nThis is where Elon's big brain, 4000 IQ play is coming into play. \n\nElon understands us degenerates; he understands our bullish nature, our gambling nature, and the retards and autists alike - and here's the thing - although they exceeded production expectations, earnings may or may not break even or be positive.\n\nSo, he, Grimes, Kanye, his team, and his group of investors, etc. are doing what they can to moon Tesla, and along with it, put money in our pockets. Elon figured out if he can somehow get money in our pockets, earned off of Tesla stock, we would then take those tendies to a Tesla dealer, and buy a brand new model S, X, Y, Cyber Truck, you name it, therefore pushing them to their earnings goal, and reaching that milestone, landing them on the S&P 500. \n\nSo keep buying calls, because $TSLA is about to moon. It's free tendies; free tendies to be spent on a brand new Tesla, or two.", "id": "hmkege", "created_utc": 1594082766.0, "score": 408, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "Dad I think I caught autism", "score": 156, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "$TSLA 2000c 9/18 ... some guy named Dr Musk gave it to me right in my dickhole", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12456369400024414}, {"body": "\ud83e\udd2d", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I mean it makes sense to me", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07782997936010361}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1748267114162445}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1115984246134758}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03844743221998215}, {"body": "Going to $40,000 a share, I\u2019ve heard.", "score": 133, "replies": [{"body": "Child\u2019s play. 400,000k", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Then it will split into multiple securities, listed as TSLA Class A, TSLA Class 69, TSLA Class 420, and TSLA Class xXPornhubXx", "score": 59, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "4 million is what my tea leaves say, but thats only after they discover the core of Mars is made of gold and surrounded by ice.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I will eat my dick on national television if it goes to 4 mill a piece", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "...careful, Elon lurks here.
