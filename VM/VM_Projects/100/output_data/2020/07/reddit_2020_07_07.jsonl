{"title": "The real reason $TSLA will only go up", "selftext": "Hey guys. Keep loading up on $TSLA calls, because at this rate, they're only going to go up. \n\nThere are two huge reasons; one is based on real evidence, the other is my autistic brain figuring out Elon's 2000 IQ play.\n\nNumber one, and the obvious reason $TSLA is going up at this rate, is due to Elon's recent bonus deal. \n\nElon will be awarded a 55.8 billion bonus should the company reach the 650 billion mark within the next 10 years (as well as other set conditions). This plan was originally started in 2018 I believe, so he's just being aggressive and trying to fulfill this duty.\n\nThe second, 3000 IQ play that Elon is doing right now is YUGE.\n\nFor some background, Tesla recently announced that their factories produced around 100,000 vehicles this quarter, drastically exceeding expectations, and putting them on the road to break even, and even better - exceed earnings. This will give Elon and Tesla their 4th positive quarter in a row, which could land them on the S&P 500, increasing investor confidence, therefore increasing value, sending them closer to that 650 million mark. \n\nThis is where Elon's big brain, 4000 IQ play is coming into play. \n\nElon understands us degenerates; he understands our bullish nature, our gambling nature, and the retards and autists alike - and here's the thing - although they exceeded production expectations, earnings may or may not break even or be positive.\n\nSo, he, Grimes, Kanye, his team, and his group of investors, etc. are doing what they can to moon Tesla, and along with it, put money in our pockets. Elon figured out if he can somehow get money in our pockets, earned off of Tesla stock, we would then take those tendies to a Tesla dealer, and buy a brand new model S, X, Y, Cyber Truck, you name it, therefore pushing them to their earnings goal, and reaching that milestone, landing them on the S&P 500. \n\nSo keep buying calls, because $TSLA is about to moon. It's free tendies; free tendies to be spent on a brand new Tesla, or two.", "id": "hmkege", "created_utc": 1594082766.0, "score": 408, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "Dad I think I caught autism", "score": 156, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "$TSLA 2000c 9/18 ... some guy named Dr Musk gave it to me right in my dickhole", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12456369400024414}, {"body": "\ud83e\udd2d", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I mean it makes sense to me", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07782997936010361}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1748267114162445}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1115984246134758}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03844743221998215}, {"body": "Going to $40,000 a share, I\u2019ve heard.", "score": 133, "replies": [{"body": "Child\u2019s play. 400,000k", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Then it will split into multiple securities, listed as TSLA Class A, TSLA Class 69, TSLA Class 420, and TSLA Class xXPornhubXx", "score": 59, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "4 million is what my tea leaves say, but thats only after they discover the core of Mars is made of gold and surrounded by ice.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I will eat my dick on national television if it goes to 4 mill a piece", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "...careful, Elon lurks here.

In this respect, CPUs (Intel/AMD) are eating the GPU market (NVIDIA/AMD) and may some day overtake it.\n\nAMD does not appear to have a plan to escape this inevitability, likely because they can just eat their GPU sector with their overperforming CPU sector.\n\nNVIDIA has nowhere to run, so they've made investments in 'escape routes':\n\n1. Raytracing: NVIDIA has been spreading market interest in raytracing as the future of rendering, something that is even *harder* for CPUs to take over. In this way, NVIDIA can secure their future in rendering for a good amount of time going forward.\n\nNot only that, but NVIDIA has ownership of the leading framework for raytracing in games. Their hope is that they remain solidified in the market as they own the software needed to make these things work. AMD has followed suit, but does not have that first-mover benefit that NVIDIA has.\n\n2. Artificial Intelligence: as well as injecting their cards with Raytracing Hardware, NVIDIA has provided them with Neural Network processing hardware.\n\nNVIDIA has marketed this by training AI to render games at higher fidelity. They are essentially quickly making a lo-fi image and asking an AI to fill in the blanks. This gives two benefits: it dramatically boosts performance with little downside, and it eliminates the need for beefier raytracing hardware (as they can use it for raytracing too).\n\nLong story short, NVIDIA *also* owns this framework. Not only that, but AMD has no market equivalent, which is a serious step ahead in technological advantage. But all this alone can't keep NVIDIA ahead as long as AMD produces cheaper goodies. So here's the last edge NVIDIA has:\n\nNVIDIA owns the community accepted framework for Neural Net Artificial Intelligence which uses their hardware. Almost universally, if any company, any end user, anyone wants to take advantage of this new upcoming AI technology, they are anchored to NVIDIA. Even if CPUs make GPUs irrelevant, NVIDIA has such an overwhelming presence and technological advantage in the field of Artifical Intelligence that they are the only answer.\n\nTo put this in very layman terms, if AI is drone delivery, then NVIDIA is the only producers of drones in the world that matters.

There is no way NVDA is going to double however, AMD could double from here. I think there will be rough times ahead for NVDA certainly in consumer computing and especially in Laptop space. APUs will start to eat entry level to mid level sales from NVDA. See the trend. AMD Renoir Ryzen 4000 series outclasses NVDA MX250 and comes close to MX350. Intel Tiger Lake coming later this year will be more powerful than Renoir (based off leaks certainly in synthetic benchmarks). Also, there have been numerous rumors of AMD Van Gogh APU and Cezanne Zen 3 APU with RDNA2 architecture. On the high performance laptop, for now RDNA is similar to Turing on perf/W. I expect penetration of RDNA based laptops soon but real game changer would be RDNA2. 50% perf per watt on similar process and is the same tech that goes in to next gen consoles. So all in all trend is clear. Much powerful graphics embedded in the CPU. NVDA does not have x86 IP and ARM just cannot take high performance x86 cores soon enough.\n\nOn the HPC space, NVDA is not found in any of the 3 exa flop supercomputer contracts. 2 was awarded to AMD and 1 to Intel (All Cray). Based off current NVDA offering for HPC, one would say they have superior products by far but none of NVDA product was able to make it in those super computers. Reason is simple heterogeneous computing. Based off rumors, Custom Milan (Zen 3) APUs will be installed in one of the supercomputer.\n\nSimilarly, AMD is developing architecture especially for data center HPC/AI workloads that will be placed against HPC volta/Ampere. Before AMD used to have same architecture for both gaming and data cente/AI.\n\nFor now I would say NVDA is doing great on the desktop and mobile front but there is a reason for it. AMD does not have high end graphics card to compete against NVDA. Tables will turn once AMD launches RDNA2 GPUs. RDNA2 will have 50% increase in performance per watt and is the same architecture that powers PS5 and Xbox One series X. And we all know How poor NVDAs strategy/ implementation for RTX turned out. Only handful of games featuring RTX even after 1.5years of launch.\n\nI bought NVDA in the $30\u2019s and AMD in the $3s but sold all NVDA in the $70-80s and went all in to AMD ($6-$7) due to my assumption of higher growth (%). AMD has paid off much higher that what NVDA would have. AMD is more diversified. Has both high performance CPU and GPU IP.

EBAY reports on July 15th (just over a week from now). I know what you're thinking... ha ha ha, EBAY, what a garbage company. No. This is why you're poor.\n\nEBAY is currently mooning harder than a hollywood film lot in 1969. Why is that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It's an affordable alternative to Amazon, AliBaba, Shopify, and every other eCommerce site out there. Those other sites are currently priced in the hundred or even thousands. At the time of this writing EBAY is sitting at $56.00. If you missed the boat on those other plays, this is your last chance to avoid swimming in Trump's swamp.\n* They sold StubHub earlier in the year and are flush with cash, which they've been using to strengthen their core business\n* They recently settled a dispute with **Starboard Value** an activist investor hedge fund that currently sits on their board.\n* They brought on an outside CEO-Jamie Iannone former COO of fucking Walmart. This dude is an expert at personalizing the eCommerce experience and retaining customers of which EBAY recently got a LOT\n* As above, they've gotten a LOT of new customers thanks to the pandemic. Everyone who got laid off and didn't get their bailout checks is selling their shit. Everyone who DID get their check is buying. People are only going to sell MORE shit if there's no stimulus and the economy tanks.\n* The stock popped July 1st on the RUMOR that they are selling their classifieds division for $8 BILLION (Dr. Evil pinky finger). If this happens bam, instant upsized-tendies.\n* Analysts believe in this shit too. EBAY is a Zack's #1 Strong Buy.\n\nTL;DR EBAY cheap eCommerce. eCommerce to moon. Rumor of big tendies if sell Classifieds division. Buy rumor sell news.\n\nEBAY 60c 7/17\n\nEDIT: this seems to be getting some traction. Follow me, and I'll post my next DD after EBAY earnings.\n\nEDIT: Many of you pointed out the earnings date has been announced to be the 28th. All of that DD up there is still good. Either roll your options to the 7/31 or hold them, depending on your personal risk tolerance. Since I posted this DD though, the stock tested 60 and closed at 59.22, so I think it'll print for me.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Some of you guys have messaged me for financial advice. I'm just some retarded autist like the rest of you, except I can read. Don't take financial advice from strangers on the internet.
