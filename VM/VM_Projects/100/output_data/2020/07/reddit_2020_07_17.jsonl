Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia Tuturiol](https://www.investopedia.com/university/all/fundamental-analysis/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "hsru8q", "created_utc": 1594973242.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "I love buying MSFT and two days later it drops $10 in price per share", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Buy more", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "If I had the funds I would.

Buy 10% of the shares we need now, and we'll wait to buy the other 90% later.\". I'd think most funds will buy most of their shares around the inclusion.\n\nIndex funds speculating on what stocks will be included next seems even more implausible to me. It completely goes against the nature and goal of an index fund to speculate on something like an upcoming S&P 500 inclusion.

{"title": "Massive Debt Bubble and How to Play it", "selftext": "Over the past 40 years the Federal Reserve has been gradually lowering interest rates. Now, the reason that they do this is because the total amount of debt in the economy increases with every business cycle. Once interest rates hit zero there is no more room to move down (and no Negative rates DO NOT WORK.) Once this happens the FED begins monetary policy #2 this is when they begin to buy corporate assets and flood money/liquidity into the markets. (This began after the financial crash of 2008-09) This with the extremely low interest rates causes many companies to become over leveraged because borrowing is too attractive to pass up. Eventually, the FED can no longer pump money into the economy and the companies who became over leveraged cannot pay back their debt. This causes the burst of the debt bubble and the cycle starts all over again. Right now we are in a massive debt bubble and while you might not believe a guy on Reddit here are some facts:\n\n1.)

Edge browser - yep it\u2019s chromium based now and all your plugins work. That\u2019s at least some default home page ads and default bing search engine traffic just by itself - but it also means enterprises large and small can go back to having easy gpo browser policy configurations and not having to make special gpo templates or accommodations for FF or Google Chrome. Another big advantage on this is that Edge plugs into the login credentials and can use those automagically for SSO things. It\u2019s a pretty powerful convenience. It would not surprise me to see measured market share shifts in the browser space as a result of MS finally not having a crap browser. The money will come from the monetization of the usage and usage metrics into other things useful.\n\n2.) Azure File shares as a service - yes, it\u2019s reported to be a bit slow so far (it\u2019s SMB3 over the internet after all) but every company uses basic file shares still and Microsoft now owns the easiest cloud available attachment that auto scales storage. You just can\u2019t easily do the same thing with AWS S3 or other storage providers and get all the access restrictions and other configuration a windows admin is used to. You can cifs mount these from Linux or Windows so it\u2019s the easy button for shared hybrid environment storage. No need to have, manage, or backup a file server. That\u2019s powerful stuff.\n\n3.) Windows Defender ATP - everyone is already using their O365 subscriptions to protect Windows endpoints - but now defender now runs on Linux. Anyone who needs to pass an audit needs capable hybrid virus protection and the short path to an integrated solution in a single pane is MS ATP. The competitor at this level would probably be Cisco AMP vs a McAfee. \n\n4.) I also think as these products ramp up in adoption MS services like sentinel, and power BI will more probable choices in product selections for consolidating products in terms of management and bundled pricing.

{"title": "MRNA insiders have sold $226+ million in last 3 months, crash incoming", "selftext": "MRNA hit an all time high of $95 today (+700% Y/Y) and we saw multiple heavy sell offs at every $95 touch, followed by retail investors FOMO buying the dip.\n\nMRNA insiders in the last 3 months have cashed out over $226 million and the majority of their ownership! MRNA insiders now care more about where to invest their money next, not if their company is profitable, a huge red flag.\n\nInsider ownership of MRNA is 2.6% and just 3 months ago was 30%. Forward P/E is 319 and massively overvalued. Institutional ownership has increased only 0.54%, meaning institutions are holding, but not buying more at these sky high prices, and may sell soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxbso7o1khb51.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=5eea2a5fd02306d21b4614e1a46881aaefe9c058\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompare this to NVAX, a comparable smaller company with $8 billion market cap, 11 forward P/E, institutional ownership has greatly increased from 8% to 28%, and insiders cashed out only about $2 million of stock. Looks like insiders and institutions think NVAX has a much better chance of winning the vaccine jackpot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jft6bcv6khb51.png?width=1135&format=png&auto=webp&s=273fc5f520b58fa58574dc1aa748db0504709a4e\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVAX&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVAX&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\nFurthermore, MRNA has massive open interest at the $95 strike august calls, but very little interest beyond $100. To me this means there is a lot of incentive out there to pump MRNA to $95-100 by pump and dump organizations and it looks like they just started cashing in today. As long as retail investors continue to FOMO buy the dip, they will cash out slowly for max profits. Once the FOMO dip buying money runs out though, expect a heavy 20-30% sell off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zolj2qnsghb51.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=12d78199bfdd006bb0eb4bbb99754b2f55310d54\n\nLastly, the US government gave gave $1.6+ billion to NVAX ($8 billion market cap) and only $0.5 billion to MRNA ($37 billion market cap). So 75% chance NVAX wins and 25% MRNA wins? I think there might have been another round of funding for each and can't find it right now, but essentially the US gov strongly favors NVAX over MRNA on winning the vaccine race.\n\n[https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/moderna-snares-483-million-u-s-funding-for-covid-vaccine-tests](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/moderna-snares-483-million-u-s-funding-for-covid-vaccine-tests) \n\nMRNA 7/24 $80p\n\nMRNA 8/21 $105/95 bear call spread\n\n[www.twitter.com/speedToTheMoon\\_](https://www.twitter.com/speedToTheMoon_)", "id": "ht54de", "created_utc": 1595023980.0, "score": 343, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "As much as I want to agree, MRNA has a legion of retards behind it.", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "So does every meme stock.
