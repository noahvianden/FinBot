The problem is not all enterprise customers had that level of scale challenges and Google's method made migration to GCP more challenging.\n\nFor example, VMware virtual machines was the prevalent technology when AWS introduced EC2 (AWS virtual machine services) back in 2006.  People understood virtual machines.  Adoption and migration  was made easier when going to AWS EC2 instances from VMware.\n\nGoogle on the other hand thought containers was the better technology (I happen to agree) and thought enterprise customers should use containers instead of virtual machines.  The problem was most customers were not familiar with containers until more recently.  Google didn't even introduce Google Compute Engine (virtual machines) until 2012, 6 years after AWS EC2 was introduced.   And I've heard, GCE is a virtual machine running on containers.  Google was too far ahead of it's time.  However, GCP has gotten a little better in recent years about releasing products based on what the customers want.\n\nAWS on the other hand have been releasing products and services left and right based on what they hear from their customers.  A little too aggressive sometimes where they are releasing products/services before they are ready for prime time.\n\nEven though Microsoft got a bit of a late start with Azure, Microsoft has been working with enterprise customers for a very long time and probably have the best understanding of what's important to enterprise customers.

Microsoft became more open to open source and the company became more relevant again with enterprise companies.  For example, there is now native support to allow running Linux on Windows.  This would never have happened under Ballmer.\n\nWall street has always rewarded companies with re-occurring revenue model vs companies that had a \"CAPEX\" or \"one time purchase\" revenue model such as Apple (but now Apple is pivoting more towards software and services) with higher valuation.  Microsoft shifted from one time purchase model of their consumer Windows (95/XP, Vista, 7, etc) and Office licensing.  Office became O365, which could be purchased on a monthly/annual subscription.\n\nAzure services helped and played into the re-occurring revenue model for Microsoft.

However, the big advantage with Microsoft and Azure is that they have an existing enterprise organization that sold into enterprise accounts for many years.\n\nAWS didn't have an enterprise sales team and in the early years really only catered to the developers and \"rogue IT\".
