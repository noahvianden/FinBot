In the example above, if tesla closes at 1210.7, the profit for the 3x cs is still 50.7, just as if it had closed at 1180. This is the break even point for the lone 1160c (1210.7 - 1160). If tesla closes at 1300, the 3x cs profit is still only 50.7, and the lone 1160c makes 140 (1300-1160). \n\nThe reason people play the spread is that there normally is an extremely small chance that tesla shoots up 9% like it did this morning.
