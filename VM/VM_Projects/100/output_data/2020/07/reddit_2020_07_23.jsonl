OP needs to fill his time with something else. Someone suggested twitch streaming. Maybe going to the gym. Pick up hiking or maybe even a new skill. \n\nI've seen people that are so successful that they don't know what to do with themselves once they've made it. They've got nothing else to strive for. It depends on the person, but the way I see it is OP is missing at least one of two things that's contributing to his habits: \n\n1) Lack of a challenge/ motivation. People need to feel like they're working towards something otherwise they'll go by on cruise control. It sounds like this comes easy to him, so maybe that's what's lacking. \n\n2) Daily schedule structure/routine. This is where the hobby, gym, or any other regular activity helps. Without a consistent daily structure, it's easy to just waste the day doing nothing. Seeing that OP's only routine is to read a couple hours a day and go to the bar, filling that time throughout the day might be of interest\n\nThe most important thing is that OP realizes he could be a little less of a bum. Step 1 is identifying the problem and is often the hardest step for many people. The fact that he's financially in an awesome position provides lots of flexibility. My personal recommendation would be to combine the two and pick up a new challenging skill and work towards it. Maybe it could be somewhat related to the markets, or maybe completely unrelated.\n\nTLDR: read the comment I replied to ya lazy bums\n\nEdit: grammar & cleanup", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Both of those things definitely affect me also.

I have a lot of trouble keeping a consistent daily structure so to force myself to do it I ironically got a work from home job on the side, haha. I don't think OP's post is meant to brag...this is definitely a real thing that people go through and it is hard to get out of the spiral if you don't have any need to strive. I actually did a speech about this at a toastmasters event before the pandemic came along and killed that part of my routine which was really helping ... it was basically about how occasionally successful people have to throw themselves out of their success in order to create a struggle and something to strive for. Some people are inherently motivated. I'm personally inherently lazy as fuck lol so if I get too comfortable I have to actively force myself to do something about it...whether that means giving away some money to charity, joining an organization that has a strict schedule, committing myself to a project for someone else ... whatever. Just anything to force you to get out of bed and actually DO SOMETHING is good. \n\nAlso 100% agree it's important that OP recognize this weakness cause that means he's aware and realizes it's not a good trait. the good news it can be fixed but I will admit it's hard as fuck to keep it going. Case in point right now I actually have a huge project I'm supposed to be finishing by the end of the month but here I am on reddit rambling about this bullshit because if I got kicked off the project it wouldn't really matter to me...haha. that makes me seem (and feel) like a shitty person but it's the reality of the struggle OP is talkin about.

I was a tech dude before I left my job so I had some coding skill, and had been messing w/ Python to do stuff like scraping financial info off various websites and had a bunch of scripts written but no way to manage them, so I started learning Django and built a website to manage them all and when I got it polished up I decided it was worth setting up a payment system and seeing if I could get some side income from it. In the process of building it I also inadvertently became really good at Django and Python, got a mentoring gig on the side helping students learn software development and eventually started writing content for that company for their courses they sold and used that money to fund growing my subscription site. I also started volunteering at a local animal shelter and went and walked and socialized dogs which helped a lot. These days I'm almost completely independent from trading thanks to my software dev work on the side, my subscription site, and then trading to pay the bills, but if I stopped trading entirely I could still survive and I'm working on growing my sub site to the point it will be able to support me with recurring revs on its own. I guess my point is, you're doing well w/ trading but don't write off expanding into other things. Start a side business, build something, volunteer, learn a new skill you can use to create a new revenue stream ... give your life some variety. People covet this \"trading lifestyle\" where you wake up and make $1000 in 30 min and then have nothing to do the rest of the day but the truth is if you ever get to that point it actually really fucking sucks cause you will be bored out of your damn mind lol \n\nI'd also really recommend checking out /r/getmotivated, /r/getdisciplined, /r/getoutofbed, /r/entrepreneur and some of the related subs. They really help me with staying motivated and not becoming lazy just because I \"can\". If you are at the point where you could just stop working entirely and survive for multiple years, it's time to level up, not be a lazy fuck. Give yourself a challenge and overcome it. If all else fails, start donating all your money to charity to put yourself back in the grind and give yourself a reason to hustle!!", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Get a boat... seriously, get a boat.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.034403592348098755}, {"body": "Also started trading with funds from being crypto rich\n\nGet out of crypto.

{"title": "18 learnings from options trading after losing 6 digits", "selftext": "I spent the last 6 months options trading (both buying / selling) and lost 6 digit sums. Here are my learnings shared with all of you so you don't repeat them.\n\n# 1: Don't buy options in high IV\nDon't buy put options when IV is high. I bought put options in March 20th and didn't exit them before the IV collapse.\n\nHeck, I didn't even know what IV was at that time. This was WSB-days\n\n# 2: Don't sell when IV / premium is very low\nThe risk isn't worth it. Always calculate the return on risk (return on nominal capital) before placing a trade\n\n# 3: Wait for probabilities to play out\nPosition size and have a plan so you can afford to let probabilities play out. I got rid of a couple of positions too early unnecessarily.\n\n# 4: No covered calls on individuals\nThe data & research seems to be clear that covered calls on most individuals is a net loser vs. keeping the underlying and selling part of it.\n\n# 5: No naked calls on individuals\nSold naked calls on BA before the spike and lost -9k. Combined with #3, I bought back the contract at the peak price\n\nIf you have to sell naked calls, then go for a spread\n\n# 6: Gamma risk is not an issue if you can take assignment\nJust wait it out and accept assignment. Also it means selling weeklies is ok\n\n#7: Don't sell more than 3 underlyings at a time\nIt's hard to track the prices and manage the positions\n\n#8: Early assignment of single leg on spread\nThis can lead to large paper losses till the other leg assignment\n\n#9: Dividend risk no spreads\nOne of my legs got assigned before dividends (short) and I got charged a lot of money which I could have avoided if I bought back the spread earlier\n\n#10: Start with simplicity\nI started by selling too many underlyings and trying fancy things. I should have sold on index underlyings and kept things simple\n\n#11: Use a portfolio / Analyse tab\nHave a plan and use a beta-weighted portfolio to know (a) POP (b) break-even points (c) delta risk\n\n#12: Have a plan\nHave a predefined plan and stick to it. You should be able to win in any market direction\n\n#13: Stick to a plan\nStick to the plan; Reference back to the plan when you're confused and want direction. Write down plans & goals\n\n#14: Correlations can change\nIf you beta-weight multiple underlyings, the correlations can change drastically even day-over-day particularly if there's an individual.\n\n#15: Short stock can close automatically\nI had two short stock positions which I was ok to hold till recovery and the broker covered them because there wasn't enough liquidity.\n\n#16: Look at recent backtests\nLook at recent backtests to verify strategy. Spintwig has a great site\n\n#17: Look at price movements\nDon't sell calls when the price is 52-week high!

Looks like those trades are losers.\n\nHere's some advice:\n\nThat's not how in-the-money options work. I was reading through this post, and it looks like if you think they are in the money, then you are making gains. Ex. I was looking at your 7/24 1600 calls. You said, the closed out at $101. That means TSLA needs to be at $1701 when the options expired to keep that price. If TSLA opens up at 1680 like yesterday, then those options were going to lose that extra $21 and fall from $101 to $80 by expiration on 7/24. \n\nFirst off, never trade in-the-money options going into earnings. Your risk is usually negative. Second, during your DD, make sure the strike price you pick can be profitable (that means you expect the stock to trade past the strike and the cost of the strike price). Finally, never use more than 10% of your portfolio on earning trades, and always expect a total loss as a possibility. If you open a position of $50k on TSLA for an earning trade, then expect a total loss, and make sure you are mentally ready for a loss of $50k.
