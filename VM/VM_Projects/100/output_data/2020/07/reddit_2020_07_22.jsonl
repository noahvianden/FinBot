{"title": "Tesla earnings expected move and strike selection", "selftext": "* Tesla (TSLA) reports Q2 earnings after the close Wednesday (\\~4:10pm)\n* Options are pricing an expected move of 12% by this Friday, just over half of the move expected over the next month, which is about 20%.\n* The trading day following the prior earnings (in April) TSLA was higher by as much as +8.5% intraday before reversing and closing -2.5%. \n* On the day following the last 4 earnings, TSLA stock has closed higher twice and lower twice.\n\nHere is the 1 month expected move chart for TSLA, with this Friday's expiration (via Options AI technology)  highlighted (+/-11.6%):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8exo5wkkjfc51.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd04dcc0f9f2a55248845f35148635c3edf247b\n\nThat's nearly $200 in either direction. The prior earnings in April, the stock had a $100 range intraday between its high and low (about 11%)  but only closed down -2.5%. The most it moved in either direction that day was +8.5%. The stock then went sideways for a few weeks before launching higher in early June and nearly doubling.\n\n*Neutral* \\- First let's look at neutral strategies that isolate the earnings itself, expiring this Friday: [Fly and Condor comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.37.02-AM.png)\n\nThe fly is quite a lot of risk so we'll focus on the **Iron Condor**,  which is 10 wide (the call spread and put spread are each 10 dollars wide, so risk is the total credit received from the 10). Here's how it  looks on the chart, with breakevens set near the expected move: [Condor](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.45.51-AM.png)\n\n*Educational note - The reason the max gain of a condor is the total credit received of both spreads, whereas the max risk is the width of 1  spread (the wider of the two if they are not equal width) is because the stock can only be beyond the range in one direction on expiration, not both. Therefore one side will always expire worthless, at max gain, even if the other side is max loss.*\n\n*Bullish* \\- For those thinking directionally the expected move can be used to help determine strike selection. Here's some trades based on a bullish price target looking out a bit further in time beyond  earnings, to August expiration. The bullish consensus is about $1930 in  August: [Bullish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.01.19-AM.png)\n\nHere's a closer look at the **long call spread** (+1590/-1910) to the expected move: [Call spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.48.46-AM.png)\n\nThe +1590/1910 call spread breaks even near $1687 in the stock. It  costs about $97, which when looking at the individual strikes is  \"striking\" because it is selling the 1910 calls at about the same price: [Strike comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.57.30-AM.png)\n\nIn other words, a call spread to $1910 can be bought for about the same price as buying the 1910 call outright. That breakeven is lower in the stock by more than $300. ($1687 vs $2007).\n\nLet's now zoom in on the bullish **short put spread** (-1590/+1270): [Short put spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.00.52-AM.png)\n\nThis is a high probability trade, that needs to risk more to make less. For those concerned about a collapse of implied volatility following an earnings event short spreads can be a way to express a  directional bias while also selling vol.\n\n*Bearish -* Going the other direction in August, (bearish expected move about $1275) we can see these trades, via Options AI technology: [Bearish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.10.45-AM.png)\n\nWe see the bearish **short call spread** is on the other side of the advantage of the bullish long call spread above. It has to buy that really far out of the money call (1920 strike) to define its risk. But those calls are really bid up and a high implied vol, which severely damages its risk-reward profile. (It is selling an at the money  call at a lower vol than it is buying its out of the money call.)\n\nThe **long put spread**  (+1600/-1285) has a much lower breakeven, and therefore a worse probability of profit, but it does not have the same issues of unfavorable IV skew as the short call spread above. \n\nAlso, the  strikes of that spread can be moved to make the put spread a bit more in  the money, moving the breakeven closer to where the stock is trading,  and taking advantage of the skew on the upside strikes: [ITM put spread](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.19.27-AM.png)\n\nTesla is likely to move a lot today before the event so exact strikes will change, but the overall percentage expected move should be roughly the same for all these examples. \n\nFull post [here](https://www.optionseye.com/tesla-earnings-preview-expected-move-directional-and-neutral-spreads-tsla/).", "id": "hvwhag", "created_utc": 1595433968.0, "score": 287, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Trying to build a fence around a dragon I see, good luck not getting burned", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "Very good analogy..don\u2019t trade IC guys no spread is wide enough with such high volatility.

Typically the index funds can simply transfer these mid-cap holdings from the S&P400 to the S&P500 which requires most often no new purchase of shares. Not this time. Look for Tesla to be granted S&P 500 inclusion in September with execution a couple weeks later. Let\u2019s just pray that no private equity placement occurs to help the index funds acquire shares w/o destroying their capitalization ratios. That could bring in another $50-$75billion into Tesla\u2019s coffers. The float on Tesla is awfully small for a company with such demand. I think a potential private equity placement is our greatest enemy right now.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There are more than enough shares available because that is literally one of the requirements for S&P inclusion.\n\nIf the fund management company can make some money buying shares now to later sell to the index fund, why not?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Reading your comments in this thread made me realize something (a bit too late):  \n1.

{"title": "DD: The dollar, the next SPY crash, and JPow hoisted by his own petard", "selftext": "Ok. First things first. I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years. I do have some idea what I'm talking about. However:\n\n1. Timing is always impossible. I know there have been several prophets on here who proclaimed the end of times, only to make fools of themselves. I have suspicions about when the crash is coming, but won't claim I know with any certainty.\n2. Macroeconomics and our current financial system are so, so, fucking complicated that NOBODY really understands them perfectly. You can listen to two legitimately genius dudes on macro podcasts who are saying precisely opposite things. So - you can have a hunch. I do. But at the end of the day, NOBODY knows anything.\n\nOk then. That being said. Here's one thing I feel pretty strongly about in all markets: there are no easy fixes; the rubber *always* meets the road, eventually.\n\nSo what's fueling this insane stock rally? Obviously it's the Fed. It's the Fed pumping money like crazy. And what will pop this bubble? ***When printing money itself starts hurting the situation, rather than helping it.***\n\nExhibit one: The dollar index over the past six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp82kbk3adc51.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9f406fae57dc932bc6a9bd7f91e5016f192b8c\n\nThe dollar index, ($DXY) measures the strength of the dollar against a few other currencies. Specifically:\n\n* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY) 13.6% weight\n* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight\n\nThe dollar has been gradually weakening since April, and yesterday it absolutely nose-dived. Why? Some say the past months dip has been because the dollar is where people run to in times of crisis, and now that the crisis is passing, they don't need dollars as much anymore. Yesterday's dip in particular was attributed to the EuroZone passing a stimulus, giving investors faith that the Euro zone will remain unified and strong (there were rumors of it potentially breaking apart).\n\nHonestly, I don't know why the dollar has been tanking for three months (I have guesses, that's all), and anybody who tells you they do know is a lying sack of shit. And maybe the reason it's been tanking is less important than what the *narrative* around it will be, if it drops much further. You probably guessed it. What's everyone gonna be saying?\n\n**The Fed is printing too much money. They're inflating the shit out of the dollar!**\n\nAgain, whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, because if that's the narrative, the further devaluation of the dollar becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: other countries don't want to hold dollars anymore because they'll lose their value. More sellers of dollars = $DXY drops even further, etc, etc.\n\nAnd now you're JPow watching $DXY drop down past 93, and you're starting to shit your pants. Because the rubber is meeting the road. The Fed wants modest inflation (2-3%) because it will make their debt worth less. But at the end of the day, a*bsolutely nothing scarier than* ***hyperinflation***. That's the nightmare scenario.\n\nAnd you know hyperinflation sneaks up on you. You have to be fucking vigilant. Not only do you have to stop printing, you might have to RAISE interest rates to avoid inflation getting out of control.\n\nBut again, it ultimately doesn't even matter if JPow changes his colors or not, what matters is the *narrative* that he's going to have to stop printing.\n\nThe market might already be sensing this... while Gold has been shooting up nicely and consistently, Silver has been fucking killing it the past two days. Maybe this \\^ is why.\n\n**Positions:** As I said at the beginning, even if I was 100% sure things were gonna go down like this, I'm wary of trying to time it. I have IWM and SPY puts for November, and GLD and SLV calls, for times between September and January 2022.\n\nNote: Even if this is totally wrong, I'm think there are other factors that will rain hellfire down on the market by November. Second wave in New York + Uncertainty around elections --> both of these could actually *cause* the above cycle to start. Dollar strength is about faith in the US government. Remember that if Biden wins, Trump is still president for another two months. Those two months, where we're not sure if he's even going to leave office willingly or not, could be enough to shake $DXY down and start this thing off.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nTL;DR  November SPY $280 and IWM $120 ,  SLV and GLD leaps\n\nEDIT: 7/22: Dollar index down bigly again today. You'll know if something is happening if yields shoot up past .70 (Now .58). That will indicate people unloading treasuries because they're scared of dollar devaluation. Fed will then have to buy even more treasuries to keep rates down. It's a death spiral.
