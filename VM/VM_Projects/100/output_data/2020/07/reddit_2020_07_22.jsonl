{"title": "Tesla earnings expected move and strike selection", "selftext": "* Tesla (TSLA) reports Q2 earnings after the close Wednesday (\\~4:10pm)\n* Options are pricing an expected move of 12% by this Friday, just over half of the move expected over the next month, which is about 20%.\n* The trading day following the prior earnings (in April) TSLA was higher by as much as +8.5% intraday before reversing and closing -2.5%. \n* On the day following the last 4 earnings, TSLA stock has closed higher twice and lower twice.\n\nHere is the 1 month expected move chart for TSLA, with this Friday's expiration (via Options AI technology)  highlighted (+/-11.6%):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8exo5wkkjfc51.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd04dcc0f9f2a55248845f35148635c3edf247b\n\nThat's nearly $200 in either direction. The prior earnings in April, the stock had a $100 range intraday between its high and low (about 11%)  but only closed down -2.5%. The most it moved in either direction that day was +8.5%. The stock then went sideways for a few weeks before launching higher in early June and nearly doubling.\n\n*Neutral* \\- First let's look at neutral strategies that isolate the earnings itself, expiring this Friday: [Fly and Condor comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.37.02-AM.png)\n\nThe fly is quite a lot of risk so we'll focus on the **Iron Condor**,  which is 10 wide (the call spread and put spread are each 10 dollars wide, so risk is the total credit received from the 10). Here's how it  looks on the chart, with breakevens set near the expected move: [Condor](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.45.51-AM.png)\n\n*Educational note - The reason the max gain of a condor is the total credit received of both spreads, whereas the max risk is the width of 1  spread (the wider of the two if they are not equal width) is because the stock can only be beyond the range in one direction on expiration, not both. Therefore one side will always expire worthless, at max gain, even if the other side is max loss.*\n\n*Bullish* \\- For those thinking directionally the expected move can be used to help determine strike selection. Here's some trades based on a bullish price target looking out a bit further in time beyond  earnings, to August expiration. The bullish consensus is about $1930 in  August: [Bullish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.01.19-AM.png)\n\nHere's a closer look at the **long call spread** (+1590/-1910) to the expected move: [Call spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.48.46-AM.png)\n\nThe +1590/1910 call spread breaks even near $1687 in the stock. It  costs about $97, which when looking at the individual strikes is  \"striking\" because it is selling the 1910 calls at about the same price: [Strike comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.57.30-AM.png)\n\nIn other words, a call spread to $1910 can be bought for about the same price as buying the 1910 call outright. That breakeven is lower in the stock by more than $300. ($1687 vs $2007).\n\nLet's now zoom in on the bullish **short put spread** (-1590/+1270): [Short put spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.00.52-AM.png)\n\nThis is a high probability trade, that needs to risk more to make less. For those concerned about a collapse of implied volatility following an earnings event short spreads can be a way to express a  directional bias while also selling vol.\n\n*Bearish -* Going the other direction in August, (bearish expected move about $1275) we can see these trades, via Options AI technology: [Bearish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.10.45-AM.png)\n\nWe see the bearish **short call spread** is on the other side of the advantage of the bullish long call spread above. It has to buy that really far out of the money call (1920 strike) to define its risk. But those calls are really bid up and a high implied vol, which severely damages its risk-reward profile. (It is selling an at the money  call at a lower vol than it is buying its out of the money call.)\n\nThe **long put spread**  (+1600/-1285) has a much lower breakeven, and therefore a worse probability of profit, but it does not have the same issues of unfavorable IV skew as the short call spread above. \n\nAlso, the  strikes of that spread can be moved to make the put spread a bit more in  the money, moving the breakeven closer to where the stock is trading,  and taking advantage of the skew on the upside strikes: [ITM put spread](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.19.27-AM.png)\n\nTesla is likely to move a lot today before the event so exact strikes will change, but the overall percentage expected move should be roughly the same for all these examples. \n\nFull post [here](https://www.optionseye.com/tesla-earnings-preview-expected-move-directional-and-neutral-spreads-tsla/).", "id": "hvwhag", "created_utc": 1595433968.0, "score": 287, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Trying to build a fence around a dragon I see, good luck not getting burned", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "Very good analogy..don\u2019t trade IC guys no spread is wide enough with such high volatility.

You can look at past volume and trade size and conclude that little if any index buying is occurring. And while brokers could do what your saying, what would be their incentive? The index funds need to track the index, not try to beat it by pre-guessing new additions and buying early. And unlike most new additions, Tesla is not part of the S&P400 mid-cap index. Typically the index funds can simply transfer these mid-cap holdings from the S&P400 to the S&P500 which requires most often no new purchase of shares. Not this time. Look for Tesla to be granted S&P 500 inclusion in September with execution a couple weeks later. Let\u2019s just pray that no private equity placement occurs to help the index funds acquire shares w/o destroying their capitalization ratios. That could bring in another $50-$75billion into Tesla\u2019s coffers. The float on Tesla is awfully small for a company with such demand. I think a potential private equity placement is our greatest enemy right now.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There are more than enough shares available because that is literally one of the requirements for S&P inclusion.\n\nIf the fund management company can make some money buying shares now to later sell to the index fund, why not?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Reading your comments in this thread made me realize something (a bit too late):  \n1.
