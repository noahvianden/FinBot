{"title": "DD: New Fed Repo Schedule/analysis for what it means after today (SPY, VXX)", "selftext": "EDIT: link for the Fed repo email list signup. \n\nhttps://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFRBNEWYORK/subscriber/new\n\nIn the midst of today\u2019s storm, I am calm. Joyous even. Why? Because this weekend I signed up for the FED Financial Operations E-mail List Serve: **the new FED repo was released this afternoon and will give us a shot in the arm heading into the close tomorrow and EOW**. Here it is, and here's some analysis/confirmation bias\n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details)\n\nContext:\n\nMy previous DD on the FED Repo schedule ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd\\_playing\\_vxx\\_and\\_spy\\_against\\_the\\_fed\\_repo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/)) saw a connection between days of what became known on the sub as \u201cdouble pump days\u201d and rises in SPY. These DPD\u2019s were going smoothly on Tuesdays, but last week we hit a snag in the plan. What was the issue?\n\nThe issue became **no bids being entered for the Fed repos**. Jerome Powell extended his gracious hand, and the banks poo-pood it! What does this mean? It likely means one of two things:\n\n1.\tAfter already taking issue with the rates and terms from when Repo operations began in daily capacity in the winter, there had been displeasure among the banks with the FED. This, combined with a new set of restrictive regulation standards borne of of the Stress Test Results, led banks to break from the Fed for Repo operations even if they weren\u2019t necessarily on the financial footing to do so, needing to shun the additional liquidity based on terms.\n2.\tThe banks saw the market\u2014and themselves\u2014doing so well now and in the near future from the recent euphoria that they balked at the FED\u2019s increasingly aggressive rates.\n\n**Recent history leads me to believe it\u2019s a mixture of the two with the second being the larger factor by far:** the day they last offered a pump (repo loan) of 0 basis points on the overnight were 6/12 and 6/15, SPY increased 1.1% and .93% respectively. *What\u2019s even more notable is that these came after a drop of 5.7%\u2014sheeeesh*.(this will matter later)\n\nWithin last months Repo schedule, they weened the banks off of 0 basis points loans (literally free money) and started to introduce 5 point loans on 10 point days. This worked fine for a few weeks of double-pump-Tuesday bliss. But then last week, it failed and we dipped. Did the mechanism fail? No.\n\nThe banks refused to take the loans.\n\nThe FED was offering the lifeline while trying not to dive into more spending debt, and holding banks accountable through interest rates. Things were going well until today, and the banks likely thought they didn\u2019t want\u2014or need\u2014the increasingly high interest rate loans of the FED.\n\nSo what now and why does this shit matter\n\nNow they do need it. We are approaching tragedy levels today. As they did when they took the money after we dipped 5% the day before the last 0 basis points loans, they will take this money tomorrow. They *need* to take this money for two reasons tomorrow:\n\n1.\tBecause the market will have a cascading fall affect if people link this to COVID numbers rising\n2.\tMore importantly, banks have their earnings run this week. It\u2019d be a debacle if they didn\u2019t shore up financials with some swift loans amongst each other.\n\nBanks probably will not be as frenzied to borrow the loans as they were when they were 0 basis points, but tomorrow is the first double pump of the new calendar and the 5 basis point overnight +10 basis point term operation has been a fine combo for them up until they got cocky last week. In addition to the two factors above re: banks need this fucking money, there is a big factor as to why this will shore up today\u2019s losses:\n\nROLLOVER DATES FOR FED REPO OPERATIONS PRINT BIGLY\n\nI looked at each rollover date for new fed repo operation and GUESS what I found? ***On almost every rollover date\u2014going back to last year when the operations weren\u2019t even daily\u2014 SPY is elevated***\\*\\*.\\*\\* Even more of note, almost all the rollover date were preceded by a dip. The only time the rollover date didn\u2019t elevate SPY was during the March crash, which is a no-brainer. Someone smarter than me can explain why rollover dates lead to jumps in SPY, but I do not believe that\u2019s coincidence.\n\n**These factors lead me to conclude that this was a correction today, and we will come out of through the week leading into another beautiful Monday.**\n\n*What could go wrong? Problematizing factors include:* 1) the fact that the overnight repos are taking place in the afternoon this time around. I don\u2019t know how that change affects things and didn\u2019t have the time yet for that breakdown and 2) the beige book will be released this week, which carries some\u2014but not a ton\u2014of weight depending on if they\u2019re glass half full or half empty and 3) talk about UI benefits and stimulus 2 may heat up a bit, and you know how Mango be\n\n**I will try to update here when I can, but do more stuff on my twitter of the same name because I can react quicker to news and such.** For all the people who think I\u2019m spouting permabull insanity, here\u2019s a picture of the last time I played VXX last month so you can see my only allegiance is tendies. I have no quarrel with you bear folk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf426uulooa51.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=021f822b606da9eddcf73a9079e2e092f147e89b\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nWe\u2019re gonna be fine.\n\nSPY 7/17 318c\n\nQQQ 7/17 267c\n\nMy other short term positions if anybody cares:\n\nAAPL 7/17 390c\n\nHPE 7/17 9.50c\n\nMRNA 7/17 75c\n\nWMT 7/17 134c\n\nEDIT 1- 9:35 AM EST: my vibe is undoubted by futures overnight or that open.

{"title": "16K YOLO on TSLA puts as warmup to getting back in the game", "selftext": "A decade and a half ago I made a decent living learning to read the tape at a prop shop. While many of my fellow trading desk autists traded lame shit like Twix and Pfft, or rebate traded attain (~~ATTN~~ADFN ECN) crosses with under $5 NASDAQ stocks (JDSU), I traded shit that actually moved during the day with actual volume. I'm talking the top volume movers of the Big Board back in the day. Texas/TI(TXN), Head(HD), the mouse(DIS), Whammy(WMT) and that good'le pussy(CAT). We were a colorful bunch (and yes, we called our bitches that).\n\nEvery once in a while the squawkbox would get loud and I knew it was time to get me some handles on the e-minis following paper. When paper trades, you draft it's wake which ever way it's going while you make some tendies. If paper's got 250 at 80, you fucking pound the 75 bid on the minis until you run out of buying power.\n\nAnyways, started lurking here about a month or two ago. After seeing so many retarded TSLA gains, I sold some boring shit I was holding last week to have some cash in my account. Decided to spend Friday just seeing if the tape could still be read despite the algos taking over. Figured I'd try TSLA, just like the rest of you retards.\n\nSo I got ready to trade this morning, saw the crazy gap up premarket, figured paper was going to let this run as close to 18-even as they could get away with while letting FOMO retards fill their shorts. My plan was simple, trade the closing of the gap after paper showed its hand. Bought my 7/17 puts around 1770 after they hammered down the spike to 1794, i.e. the tape read that paper was saying \"So long retards, and thanks for all the fish!!!\": 4x1500p @ 16.9 (the low printed 15), 1600p @ 39.4 (low 33) and 1650p @ 57.9 (low \\~47). Almost the full cash balance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n94z39ckapa51.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=d988becf46031ac6b80ad462d0d9200ebf4a63f8\n\nSold the 1650 for enough to cover my position during the first break of 1550. Holding the rest (\\~50K unrealized) to see a test of 1400 tomorrow (because that's the tale of the tape).\n\nYou retards need to stop chasing your trades and learn to understand what the tape is yelling at you so you don't end up bagholding nor paperhanding shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** So a lot of you are asking about the tape and how you can learn and what not. Some have already answered below, but here goes.\n\nThe tape is what we called the T&S (times and sales) which combined with the book (NYSE order book, essentially a fuller level 2 quote) allowed you to see the price action as it happened. You could see where the liquidity was on the bid and at the ask (yes, the bid is always on and the ask is always at), where it was light but more importantly where it had a bias. You could literally make \\[almost\\] free money by hitting the last few lots on the inside while having a pending order to close your trade at the next tick (which you placed way in advanced to be higher up the queue).\n\nWhen I started, affordable charting software was terrible. Essentially a streaming chart that updated every 15 seconds. So you had to keep the important orders from the book and what you saw print on the tape in working memory for those 15 seconds, then when the chart ticked it would tell you how bad you were keeping track of the price action. That's how I learned, I first got a feel for what the book was saying about liquidity and others' intentions, and later got a feel for what the prints on the tape showed that you couldn't get from the charts.\n\nUnfortunately, like open pit trading, reading the tape is a bit of a lost art. Everything just flashes too fast and the level 2 quotes are meaningless (when I started trading canceling orders incurred a fee, something like a nickel or a dime, seemingly nothing but enough for people to not spoof the shit out of the book).\n\nI can't really tell you how to learn now in the age of HFTs and algos everywhere. I can tell you that there are things that you can still read if you already knew how. For instance knowing how quickly the buying dried out on the spike to the high of the day, probably a few that covered when it started to move past 1780, then a few FOMOs trying to catch the ride to break 1800 and  then finally the last few bagholders bailing out of their early shorts before 1800 hit. Then shit STOPPED for seconds with no prints and suddenly got sold down to 1770 with a shitload of volume in a blink of an eye (yes, I was caught being that last bagholder plenty of times just to be shaken out at my 10 tick stop and see it rip a full point in 5 minutes).\n\nThat's how I knew that was the level to watch out for. Got in the 1500p shortly after the spike, and later when the 1750 level really broke (again the real break could be seen coming on the tape) got in the 1650p, then realized a 150 spread was too much to easily adjust the trade and got another 1600p contract.\n\nI can also tell you they were pinning the price to the strikes while the floor was falling out from under the SPY and the cubes. If the market hadn't continued selling off the area around Friday's close would have held and I would have closed my trade. But it btoke, and then seeing the impending break of 1500 I placed an order at 170.1 for my 1600p contract. It all happened too fast but I believe I saw my order on the ask (the .1 is an old trick to be able to see where your orders are) but the high print was around 167, otherwise I'd be up 17k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 2:** To expand on the how I read the tape part, I'll retell the weird afternoon pinning from my point of view (I don't know if it's weird or not since I've been watching the stock 2 days, but definitely looked like something was up). So when everything else was dumping TSLA started printing FOREVER at the 10s. If it went down to 1540 you could see the tape fill red with hits on the bid and rebound straight to 1550 and print FOREVER AGAIN at the ask full of green, and fall down to the lower strike just to start all over again for shits and giggles. It happened for a long while from the 1560s (maybe the 70s) down to the 1530s until, my best guess is, liquidity for keeping the pinning ran out because the market continued to tank.\n\nWent it started tanking like everything else a test of the 1500 price looked inevitable (mind you I wasn't directly trading this move). But I know from experience that these kind of \\[very\\] round prices attract stop loss orders, so I threw an ask out there in case the break of 1500 triggered stops selling and see if I got a fill at what is effectively ridiculous price improvement caused by the sudden volatility that dries up option liquidity.\n\nLike I said above I didn't get filled but I do believe I saw my order at the ask for a few seconds (just checked and the actual high print was in the 165s). This is also how I got filled at the ask (166) on my 1650p when the race to fill down the gap happened (the high print for that move ended up in the low 180s, so I went for a little more when it looked like a bigger move was going to get triggered)\n\n**Update:** Closed out today for a 43k gain\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hr5pgv/bought\\_tsla\\_puts\\_yesterday\\_just\\_after\\_top\\_16k\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hr5pgv/bought_tsla_puts_yesterday_just_after_top_16k_to/) ", "id": "hqpbml", "created_utc": 1594679323.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Damn right, except im using my unemplyoment money", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.
