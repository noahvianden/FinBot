{"title": "Unusual Options Activity from the week. LB, VXX, PINS, PTON.", "selftext": "What's up my fellow options traders. Swaggy is back with a few plays that caught my eye from last week in the unusual options activity segment. A quick note about my [option flow sentiment tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I created and where I am scanning most of this data from. I noticed it was tracking WAY too much data, so in order to keep the accuracy higher, I've modified the script to analyze much more trades that would be marked as \"unusual\" instead of any block trade that was at the money. It is definitely much easier to look through the data now.\n\nHere's a few things I spotted this week.\n\n**LB - L Brands**\n\nOn Tuesday this week a player rolled out their long call position to a further OTM strike price. They sold their position of 15,000 January 2021 calls at the $17.50 strike price and collected almost $7 million in premium. They then opened a new position in the same expiration with 15,000 calls at the $22.50 strike price. Their original position was 7% in the money, the position they rolled out to was 20%(!) out the money for January 2021 expiration. I'm not sure what initial amount of capital they entered the position with, however, they were willing to risk $4 million on a 20% OTM play. Personally, this is the kind of unusual activity I like to see if I am going to enter a position. Very interesting. It's important to note from the graphic when someone rolls out a position vs entering a brand new position the sentiment will look the opposite. Usually they close out a larger position (in this case closing the original position was bearish), and enter a smaller position, but further expiration or strike price for less premium (in this case entering a new long).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibrdu6dj89d51.png?width=2284&format=png&auto=webp&s=8642afd38f86dfecb6fe7f1fa83ce9a1bb0bf992\n\n**PINS - Pinterest**\n\nPINS saw some notable bullish option flow come through this week. The largest position was on Wednesday where a player purchased 11k CALL contracts for November expiration at a strike price of $26 (3% OTM at the time). The position size was approx $4 million in premium. 11k call contracts, 3% OTM strike price, November expiration, all pretty bullish and qualify it for 'unusual activity'. The stock has been pretty stagnant since reaching high point of $26.50 a couple weeks ago.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6no4qz4u89d51.png?width=2282&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7b27b3583c3108fe9552423b0802b7a502736b\n\n**VXX - (VIX Short-Term Futures)**\n\nFor those unfamiliar with VXX, it tracks VIX which is a volatility play. On Monday last week I came across some bearish activity, betting that volatility would go DOWN by September. Multiple directional bets were placed in LONG PUTS and also a BEAR SPREAD where they purchased a long PUT closer OTM and sold a short PUT further OTM to reduce the risk on the play. In my opinion, this week and next week's earnings reports will provide us with guidance moving forward (as all companies refused to give guidance previously) and should ease the markets in terms of volatility. I think volatility might pick back up again as we get closer to elections and fall season of potential 2nd/3rd corona wave.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ea8jax0099d51.png?width=2534&format=png&auto=webp&s=5536aa790ce29045b9d855f65f2ce98766bba26f\n\n**PTON - Peloton Inc**\n\nPTON has been a beast of it's own having very high volume in option flow recently. This lucrative meme stock is expected to blow earnings out of the water and the stock price has nearly doubled in the last 2 months. Last week witnessed a slew of bullish call option activity. They ranged from large bullish bets at the money, to selling puts, and also one September 18 bet for 1,000 CALL contracts with a premium of $330k and strike price of $80 (25% OTM). These are pretty directional bets with a high volume of contracts.\n\nIt looks like the one large 'bearish' sentiment activity could possibly be a fund selling a covered call on a larger share position. The strike price was $65 and 1.18% OTM at the time. If the stock stays above $65 they collect 1.18% return on the share position as well as pocket the $3.85 million in premium from selling the calls. Assuming they are covered calls that would mean the position size of the shares is 3k contracts \\* 100, or 300,000 shares. Also assuming a current share price of about $65 means their entire share position (or at least the amount covered by the calls) is about $19.5 million. The $3.85 million they collect in premium + the 1.18% they could collect if the stock stay above $64 ish would be a 20% return overall on the play. Keep in mind they collect the premium from the covered calls regardless if the stock goes up or down, as it provides protection.\n\nPeloton reports earnings in 2 weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdodmh6m99d51.png?width=2526&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa266e8dc9431015729a92f39e2b320486fbf9c", "id": "hydixo", "created_utc": 1595793259.0, "score": 365, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "I look forward to this analysis every week.

Follow these general guidelines as a beginner and you should do ok.\n\n\nSell contracts 30 to 60 days out. Try to make the majority of your moves around 45 days to expiration.\n\nAnchor your short positions at between 16 and 30 delta\n\nSell options on underlying with high volume (> 1 million trades)  and high IV (> 50% IVR on stocks or >30% IVR on ETFs)\n\nTake profit at 50% of potential. Set a GTC limit order immediately after opening a trade\n\nConsider rolling up/down/out your viable losers at ~21 days to expiration\n\nClose your trades before expiration. 3 days until expiration at the latest. Near the money losers rarely become winners in the final week and finding a liquid market right before expiration is very hard. \n\nCalculate your risk reward ratio before entering trades to be at least $.30 premium on every $1 risked on a 70% probability of profit trade. Implied volatility is usually overstated so take profits early to raise your win rate. Anything less than that ratio is a zero sum game or worse.\n\nThe majority of your trades should have defined risk. No more than 5% of balance at risk per symbol.  Scale up from 1% to 5% based on quality (IV Rank and risk reward ratio you can get)\n\nBuy cheap protection when you can get it. Expensive long positions significantly reduce delta on a narrow spread. \n\nTrade small and trade often. A high number of occurrences is critical to seeing probabilities play out the way they should.\n\nDon't dwell on losers. No one wins them all. Learn whatever you can and then move on.\n\nKeep half your balance in cash in a margin account\n\nBe very slow to adjust trades. I've turned many a winner into a loser that way.\n\nTrade beta neutral so your portfolio profit is greatest at where the S&P 500 is today meaning some bullish, some bearish, and some non-directional strategies. \n\nAlways use limit orders and start your initial offer slightly above the mark price. Give your broker time to find a buyer.\n\nDon't force trades. You will feel better later having no trade than a bad trade. Not losing money is right up there with making money.\n\nDiversify across sectors and asset types\n\nHave a few core ETFs that you trade routinely each month. Base your remaining trades around where the market is.\n\nBe mindful of earnings, dividends, and hard to borrow stocks. Many people avoid these risks and do very well. \n\nHave a plan and do something with your profits.\n\nKeep a trade log in a spreadsheet so you can look back and learn from experience. \n\nThere is no need to stare at the computer screen all day and don't overthink what you see on TV.\n\nDon't gamble or take more risk than your comfort level.

IV should be significantly higher (maybe 2x as high) for the closest expiration date. The whole purpose of this play is to take advantage of the inherent IV spike during earnings, so you want to sell as close as possible.\n2. Call credit spread \\~10 delta, no higher than 12. Put credit spread as low as possible because tickers can fall a lot faster than they rise.

The securities laws seek, to the extent possible, to put all shareholders on an equal footing. One technique in achieving this end is the simultaneous disclosure of information to all shareholders. It is one reason why companies give advance notice of quarterly investor calls and release of information through public press releases.\n\n**The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) does not permit companies to decide who they like, who they dislike, and then to disclose information only to the favored group. This flatly contravenes the spirit of the securities laws.**\n\n\nBlocking access to Trevor's Twitter feed is certainly not at the same level as refusing to disclose quarterly financial information, but there is value in the Twitter information and it certainly has the potential to move the stock price (in either direction).\n\n\nI understand Nikola has an \"official\" Twitter page but it is much less active and one HUGE discrepancy I can most recently point out was Trevors tweet announcing he is buying 91MM shares. Unless I missed it, this was not tweeted on Nikola's official twitter page.
