By holding a share of the MF, you are entitled to a share of the fund's assets.\n\nMutual funds can be actively or passively managed. Actively managed means that the fund's manager(s) decide what securities to include in the fund, based on whatever methodology the fund is designed for. Your choice, FSPTX, is an active fund. A passively managed fund, on the other hand, automatically picks its holdings.\n\nAn index fund is a shorthand for a fund \u2014 be it mutual fund or ETF \u2014 that is passively managed by tracking a benchmark index. The index is just a ranked, weighted list of stocks, and it typically gets updated quarterly. One of the most popular indexes is the S&P 500, which is the list of the top 500 US public companies by market capitalization.\n\nMost index funds are cap-weighted, meaning they use the stocks' market cap to decide the percentage to allocate towards each stock. For example, when you add together all of the stocks in the S&P 500, then MSFT's market cap is around 5% of the total. So an S&P 500 fund like VFIAX (mutual fund) or VOO (ETF) will have around 5% MSFT.\n\nPassively managed funds usually beat actively managed ones because it turns out humans, even professionals, aren't very good at picking stocks. Passively managed funds also have much lower fees because they don't need to pay for expensive fund managers, as their entire entire lifecycle can be automated.\n\nFor example, FSPTX has a net expense ratio of 0.71%. Vanguard's VGT, which is a passive fund (it tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index), has an ER of 0.1%. Fees add up over time and should be avoided.

Back testing is great for people with many millions of dollars or for fund managers who need to know how to invest safely in the long run.

{"title": "Intel DD - Dependant on AMD's 10-Q/K, It may be time to short.", "selftext": "Addendum at the top: $INTC may bounce back next week. I don't know. Maybe they take another dump. Again, no idea where it comes to short-term price action. This is some \"pre-DD\" for AMD's quarterly report which is going to be interesting. It's my thesis that if AMD picks up the market share which Intel claims to have lost in the desktop market due to COVID, that's a sign of a dramatic shift in the consumer processor market, which implies that consumers are moving to what can be considered the leader in both price and processing performance for most applications.\n\n*For anyone who reads SEC filings, this is a rehash.*\n\nTaking a look at Intel's released 10-Q, here's some quotes:\n\n>\u2022We now expect an approximate six-month delay in our 7nm-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7nm manufacturing process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately twelve months behind our internal target. We will continue to invest in our future process technology roadmap, but we will be pragmatic and objective in seeking to deploy the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies combined with our disaggregated architecture give us the flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, we now expect that our data center discrete GPU design, \u201cPonte Vecchio\", which was described in our 2019 Form 10-K, will be released in late 2021 or early 2022 utilizing external and internal process technologies combined with our advanced packaging technologies.\n\n>\u2022We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm product, a client CPU, in late 2022 or early 2023. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process roadmap, including for holiday 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm data center CPU design in the first half of 2023.\n\n\n#They are going to be four years behind AMD ON 7nm production.\n\nI figured I was going to look into what kind of business consumer-grade Intel products were, compared to their server counterpart, and had to look up some specifics for Intel's internal nomenclature.\n\nHere's the results:\n\nIntel DCG (Data Center Group) consists of everything server related. Server processors, network infrastructure, that type of thing.\n\nIntel CCG (Client Computer Group) consists of all consumer stuff. Mobile, PCs, Laptops, etc. The CCG is all consumer-grade stuff for home use.\n\n\nDCG operating income was **$3.1 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared to **$1.8 billion** in **Q2 2019**. A rise of **+$1.3 billion.**\n\nCCG operating income was **$2.8 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared with **$3.7 billion** for **Q2 2019**. A drop of **-$0.9 billion.**\n\n||Q2 2020 vs. Q2 2019 | | YTD 2020 vs. YTD 2019 | |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|| % change | $ Impact | % change | $ Impact |\n|Desktop platform volume |down\t(14)%|\t\t$\t(460)\t| \t\tdown\t(9)%\t|\t$\t(607)|\n|Desktop platform ASP |up\t3%\t|\t$ 61 \t| \t\tup\t3%\t|\t$ 162 \t \t\n|Notebook platform volume|up\t9%\t|$\t434 \t |\t\tup\t15%\t|\t$ 1,501 \t \t\n|Notebook platform ASP| up\t5%\t|$\t274 |\t \t\tup\t1%\t|$\t138 \t \t\n|Adjacent products and other||$ 346 ||\t\t\t$\t650 \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t\n|**Total change in revenue**||\t\t\t\t\t$\t655 ||\t \t\t\t\t\t$ 1,844 \t  \n\nSo Intel's PC market is down from last year for both the quarter and the year. They claim it's because people are poor due to COVID, but seem to contradict themselves in their statement about why their notebook group is doing so well. I am supremely intrigued to compare AMD's notes on the topic.\n\nTo quote (emphasis mine):\n\n>Revenue in Q2 2020 was up 7% compared to Q2 2019, driven by strength in notebook platform demand, strong ASP and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales, partially offset by desktop demand. YTD 2020 up 11% compared to YTD 2019, **driven by strong demand for notebook platform products** and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales. Strength in notebook platform products reflects the increased reliance on PCs as more people are working and learning from home due to COVID-19.\n**While we expect notebook strength in Q3 2020, desktop demand is expected to remain weak in the second half of 2020 as a result of weaker global economic conditions due to COVID-19.**\n\nI'm going to read this as \"When a consumer has the choice of building a desktop out of components, they are going to choose our competitor because they are better.\"\n\nThis is a play on Intel. I am intentionally ignoring AMD because I think Intel is going to become irrelevant in the processor market in the near future.\n\nHere's what I am suggesting: keep an eye on the portable/laptop markets. If AMD has their shit together, we will start to see a more competitive AMD/Intel split on laptops. It's pretty difficult to find an AMD laptop now, and if it becomes easier, people are going to start buying the better performer with the better price.\n\nFurther, Intel seems to already be suffering when it comes to desktop unit sales. When AMD puts out their 10-K, take a look at their CCG equivalent numbers, and see what they look like. If there seems to be an equivalent amount gained by AMD which was lost by Intel, it will become more apparent whether this was a COVID related drop, or the fact that Intel's processors are plainly worse by comparison.\n\nFor those interested in a play depending on what AMD has in their 10-K:\n\n   * If AMD has a similar drop in consumer grade sales, take no action\n   * If AMD sees a rise similar to the drop in Intel's report on CCG, **INTC 21 JAN 2022 $30P**", "id": "hxpfqv", "created_utc": 1595694187.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "I don\u2019t care what anyone says....if it comes down to it when you see Intel or AMD as the processor...normal people that don\u2019t know a thing about it go with Intel...\n\nIt\u2019s like Nike or Under Armor...you go with Nike...it\u2019s that easy...that\u2019s the DD\n\nIntel will bounce.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "Got it, UA puts", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "No no dude clearly AAL calls", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aal"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1312047243118286}, {"body": "This type of thinking is why I\u2019m long AF AMD", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "You know anything about AMD?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Only that I owned it from ~$20 and sold at the top in March but I\u2019m rattled I didn\u2019t get back in.

There's much more nuance the deeper you dive, mainly due to the various flavors/iterations of each node.  I agree with you that tsmc is the big winner here.  Case in point, their 6nm node is a much easier path to euv than the N7+ node I understand amd is using for zen 3.  As far as I can tell, amd had already taped out zen3 in N7+ when tsmc conceived the 6nm node.  N7 designs can be taped directly to 6nm with no redesign, which isn't the case for N7+.\n\nNo doubt amd's strategy of marrying heterogeneous die in the same package has paid off.  This has enabled them to leverage the process node advantage where it counts - in the cpus.  But that comes with some performance tradeoffs in the mesh and full factory cost implications.\n\nAnyway, can go on and on about this.  My original point is just that it's wrong to think amd/tsmc have a 1-2 generation node advantage on intel.  Tsmc's \"7nm\" is not a measure of any physical dimension and is purely a marketing term, sort of like att's \"5g e\".\n\nI'm no fan of intel, but you can bet it'll rebound from the recent drop.

But this is a moment of unparalleled national humiliation, of weakness.\u201d\n\"When you listen to the President, these are the musings of an imbecile. An idiot. And I don't use those words to name call. I use them because they are the precise words of the English language to describe his behavior. His comportment. His actions.

Well, he's the President of the United States now, and the man who said he would make the country great again. And he's brought death, suffering, and economic collapse on truly an epic scale.\"\n\"And, let's be clear. This isn't happening in every country around the world. This place. Our place. Our home. Our country. The United States. We are the epicenter. We are the place where you're the most likely to die from this disease. We're the ones with the most shattered economy.
