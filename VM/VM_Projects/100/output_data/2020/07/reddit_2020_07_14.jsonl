{"title": "Cheaters (Always) Prosper: Covenants in the Time of Corona", "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Another beautiful day begins in the neighborhood, and what better place to spend it than here, with you poop-flinging retards? I feel like [Jane Goodall](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/cultureexploration/2019/01/jane-goodall-difficult-women/01-jane-goodall-difficult-women.jpg) out here amongst you - a mixture of curiosity, repulsion, and a strange... attraction I can't quite shake that's keeping me around.

Either way, with apologies to u/pokimane, I'd definitely hit that. ([PS - welcome back Gary Larson!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2mp43svgB1qeoyxwo1_400.jpg))\n\nAnyway, this post is a bit inside baseball, but it's my party and I'll do what I want. Today I am going to give you guys a lesson on one of the under-the-radar impacts that the pandemic-du-pangolin has had on the debt markets. Long-time readers know that I'm always banging on about the impact of the covenant-creep of high-yield style structures into traditional bank financings. It's a fact of life in 2020 that the docs governing most bank debt are a lot looser than they used to be (and it was that way before the virus, too), but unscrupulous borrowers and shitty bank lawyers asleep at the wheel during the pandemic have made it worse. The specter of the money-printer looms large, too - with the implicit support of a government hell-bent on keeping the money markets afloat with synthetic liquidity, people just have more appetite for risk in negotiations than they had 18 months ago (from a documentation standpoint). Anyway, one of the big ticket items on the agenda has been the rebirth of the so-called '*J. Crew*' issue - the ability of companies to send valuable shit out of the credit when things start going sideways, so the lenders can't get at them in an enforcement scenario. This can have a major impact on the creditworthiness and overall value of a corporate group and I've spent the last week having a major fight about it with a few idiots on the other side of a deal, so I figured why not take a break from clowning them and clue you guys in to what it is and why it matters.\n\nIt's been a while, so a reminder for the new readers and slow learners in the audience. I will answer any legitimate question I get asked about the post, no matter how stupid (as long as it is sincere or at least funny). Sometimes it takes me a couple of days but I get around to everybody eventually. I do this because getting flamed by someone who knows what they're talking about is the only way to learn - it's how I learned, and it works. **But remember - I don't give advice for free**. So please don't ask me what to buy (long $POPCORN), if your 95% OTM option is fucked (it is) or for a strike/exp (TSLA $6940C 4/20/21) because I'll just have to repeat that in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n\nOK. Got it? Good. Here is what you are about to read:\n\n1. Subs Aren't Just For Doms: Why Corporate Groups Are More Than Just A Ticker\n2. Investment Covenants: How Companies Spend Their Tendies\n3. *J Crew* And You: Exploiting Loopholes For Fun And Profit\n\nIf you are interested in playing along at home, [here is J. Crew's credit agreement as it then existed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1051251/000156459014000667/jcg-ex10_201403057.htm), and [here is a copy of the relevant court filings](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=g3bQfywJstNqt/O3VUqiaw==&system=prod).\n\n**TL;DR**? Fuck you. I am large. I contain multitudes. If you can't handle that, that's on you. Bitch about it to your body-pillow. I just don't give a shit.\n\nLet's do this.\n\n1. **Subs Aren't Just For Doms: Why A Corporation Is More Than Just A Ticker**\n\nA long, long time ago on a tweedy, tea-soaked rock in the North Atlantic, some smart young autists with terrible teeth and a colonialism problem decided it would be a fun idea to YOLO their life savings into speculative investments involving the rape and/or pillage of various locations in the South Pacific and Asia. Unfortunately for them, at this time, you could only do this by either (i) commandeering a ship, sailing there, and raping and pillaging to your heart's delight or (ii) asking the monarch for a permission slip to let you do this without being personally liable for the consequences. Fortunately for these hungry young retards, the great and glorious Queen Libby I (she of the clown hair and white face paint) loved this idea. So she created 'chartered corporations' to facilitate these little excursions. See, back in the day, you needed her permission to make a corp. Anyway, 100 years, several hundred million pounds of profit and millions of dead Indians later, the idea had been so successful that the OG East India Companies formed by those retards were worth nearly a trillion dollars of today's money, and everybody else wanted to get in on the idea - so they did away with royal charters and the rest of the world quickly cottoned on to the idea that separating investors from the actions of the companies they bought into was a cool idea. Thus was born the doctrine of the separate legal entity and modern corporations law.\n\nForward-thinking legal eagles like yours truly then figured out that if it was cool to have one corporation separating investors from actions (and, therefore, liability), it would be *even* *cooler* to layer several corporations between them, making it harder to (i) see who actually owned the company and (ii) to take their shit if anything went wrong. So was born the concept of the modern 'corporate group' - companies that created their own subsidiaries, in which they owned 100% of the issued equity, who then created their own subsidiaries, in which they owned 100% of the issued equity, and so on down the ladder. All the profits can be sent straight up - but the liability (generally) stops at the immediate level of the actor. Awesome, right? Having cake and eating it too - if cake disgorged profits instead of carbs.\n\nIn 2020, pretty much every company that's not a Mom & Pop dry cleaning business works this way. Investors on top, 'name' company nearby (either directly underneath or with holding vehicles in-between, and lots and lots of subsidiaries sitting below the name. There are a bunch of tax reasons to structure this way but the liability shield and diversification of revenue streams is generally the key structural consideration.\n\nSo what happens when the name brand company wants to borrow money? Remember from our previous lessons that how much money you can borrow is directly related to the sort of security you can provide to the lenders - \"Look, I can give you this much dollar value in assets as collateral, and prove to you that my corporate group makes this much money over the course of a year\". Some back office nerds at the bank crunch the numbers (like EBITDA - [check out my primer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1xq3e/cookin_the_books_with_tsla_fuzzys_ebitda_explainer/)), and the computers spit out a number that the business guys fight about and ultimately gets settled, and hey presto, you've got a brand spanking new billion dollar term loan. Easy so far, right?\n\nHere's where it gets a little tricky. Not every subsidiary is treated the same way in calculating these numbers - because not every subsidiary is necessarily included in the credit support as a guarantor, pledgor, whatever you want to call them. Some get excluded because they're offshore and including them would have adverse tax consequences. Some get excluded because they have complicated ownership structures. Some get excluded because they're just not doing anything - shell corporations parked at some PO box in the Caribbean waiting for a purpose don't have much to contribute to the revenue calcs of the broader group. The distinction here is between what we call '**Restricted Subsidiaries**' - companies who are subject to the various rules and regulations of the credit docs (e.g., can't buy shit, can't borrow shit, can't spend money) - and '**Unrestricted Subsidiaries**' - companies who can do whatever they want because they're 'outside' of the credit, even though they're owned by companies who are inside the credit. The borrower can typically designate (and re-designate) subsidiaries as 'Restricted' or 'Unrestricted' by jumping through a few hoops - most commonly showing that an unrestricted subsidiary being designated restricted would otherwise be in compliance with the debt and liens covenants applicable to restricted subsidiaries. You might want to do this for a variety of reasons but normally its because sometimes there are rules about how you can move shit around inside your credit group; typically you can only move money and assets to companies that are subject to the rules the banks have agreed to ahead of time (not those sneaky unrestricted subs sitting off there away from where the banks can get at them). You can check out the definitions in the J. Crew credit agreement by ctrl+fing \"Restricted Subsidiary\" or \"Unrestricted Subsidiary\".\n\nAnyway, the punchline is that when you look at, say, $TSLA, there's a lot more under the hood than a ticker, a substandard engine and snuff pics of Elon getting pegged by Grimes. You're actually talking about hundreds of subs spread across a wide range of jurisdictions - the ticker is just the tip of the corporate iceberg.\n\n2. **Investment Covenants: How Companies Spend Their Tendies**\n\nAs you may know from my previous posts, [credit agreements have a lot of rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/). They mainly dictate what the borrower and guarantors can and can't do -  can't change shit about the company **except for shit that doesn't matter**, can't sell your shit without telling the banks **except for shit that's really cheap**, can't buy stuff **except for stuff you need**, etc. The big one for our purposes is called the Investments covenant.\n\nI know, I know. It's a word you recognize. Hooray! But slow down, little autist. In credit agreement land, 'Investment' doesn't mean 'investment'. It means whatever the definition in the document says it means. It's not what you use Robinhood for. Here, it means any 'loan, advance, or capital contribution to... another person'. If you want the unfiltered version, ctrl+f \"Investment\" in the J Crew credit agreement to see what I'm talking about. This formulation is broad enough that you can read it to encompass pretty much any transfer of assets you can think of to a subsidiary, so this little doohickey is how companies move money and other shit around their corporate group. Typically, you get a dedicated 'basket' in the negative covenants that allows you to make 'Investments' in subsidiaries up to a certain dollar figure.\n\n3. ***J Crew*** **And You: Exploiting Loopholes For Fun And Profit**\n\nSo, in 2016,  J. Crew was in bad shape. The company was at risk of going under. It was subject to a pretty strict credit agreement that severely limited its ability to incur new debt or repurpose its existing debt. The board was stressed that the company would default under the credit agreement and the lenders would come in and take their shit, limiting the ability of the company to bounce back after filing for bankruptcy. So, they decided to take a very risky gamble - what if they could manage to get the most valuable collateral out of the reach of the lenders? If shit gets moved out of a corporate group, generally there is a trigger that releases whatever liens the lenders have on it, so if they could pull it off, they would be home free.\n\nRemember, credit agreements are **expressly designed to prevent you from doing this**. Why would I lend you a billion dollars on the back of certain collateral if I knew there was a risk you could throw that shit out the window the minute I signed on the dotted line? So this was a ballsy move. Banks would be **pissed.** Here's how it went down.\n\nThe most valuable shit that J. Crew owned was not, surprisingly, shitty chinos and ill-fitting polo shirts. It was intellectual property. So that was what they needed to move.  Section 7.02(t) of the credit agreement allowed investments by non-loan party restricted subsidiaries in any other person (including in an unrestricted subsidiary) if the investment was initially \u201cfinanced with the proceeds\u201d of certain other permitted Investments. Here, these other permitted investments included the intercompany basket that allowed investments by loan parties in non-loan party restricted subsidiaries up to the greater of $150 million and 4% of total assets. In English, this meant that J. Crew could send shit out the door untouched by routing it through another restricted sub before posting it to the unrestricted subsidiary - 'laundering' the IP.  All it had to do was transfer the value of the IP to a non-guarantor restricted subsidiary prior to moving the IP to an unrestricted subsidiary and it had capacity to move collateral out of the group (up to the limit of the applicable basket). Now, this was **not** how things were intended to work - it was a loophole, and the smarties on the borrower side both spotted it and had the stones to try and drive $500 million worth of IP through it. Hats off to them.\n\nStill with me? This was a **big problem** for the J Crew lenders. And they kicked up a huge stink. So J Crew turned it up a notch and filed for a declatory judgment that what they did was legal. Ultimately the case was settled out of court and the credit agreement was amended to allow the transaction retroactively... which basically was the lenders admitting that J. Crew was right in their interpretations of the documents. So. The market quickly pivoted to prevent this happening by putting a hard cap on how much value could be transferred out of the credit to unrestricted subsidiaries - often called the 'J. Crew blocker'. This is in most credit agreements signed between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe bat-flu, though, has encouraged borrowers to start fighting this -  as distressed issuers look for ways to address their liquidity concerns and/or reorganized and optimize their capital structures. By my count there are at least five instances in the last three months of either proposed or consummated J. Crew moves. L Brands, Cirque du Soleil, DSG, Maclaren, and GAP are all on my personal shit list for this, but there are more in the pipeline.\n\nThe impact of pulling a J Crew on the value of the equity can be significant, as it is essentially (i) showing the market that you think the name brand of the equity is in financial difficulties (ii) moving value out of the core brands and (iii) damaging the creditworthiness of the business in the eyes of the market.\n\nAnyway. Here ends the lesson. This is something that is being actively negotiated across the market as many companies adjust to the new normal of precarious relationships with their financiers. Whether or not the market goes up or down is increasingly divorced from the true financial position of companies, but debt never lies and is - as my long time readers know - the best way to understanding the 'real' health of a company and how it is positioning itself for the future.\n\nBless up.\n\nFuzzy", "id": "hr5f9i", "created_utc": 1594746595.0, "score": 338, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 255, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m still not sure what the tie-in to Jane Goodall is, so can you repost with nudes?

So then after it was signed they closed some investment within the group and used the new space to funnel their IP to a restricted subsidiary that was not involved directly with the loan, and then from there to an unrestricted subsidiary, at which point it was beyond the reach of the creditors.

I'm on vacation this week and just proved to myself that I'd rather read about corporate finance than go outside so... here's what I'm thinking:\n\n\n1. I'm listening to a biography of Warren Buffet in my commute and the author just described how Buffet bought into American Express after its share prices dropped - and the share prices dropped because a subsidiary of Amex was left bagholding when a company that was supposed to be shipping vegetable oil (tanker gang losing money since the 1960s) turned out to be shipping ... seawater. \nThe author specifically said Amex could have divested itself of legal responsibility for this liability because it was the *parent* company and a subsidiary was bagholding. Anyway apparently the CEO issued a statement saying Amex felt a \"moral obligation\" to pay up for its subsidiary and said it would resolve whatever debt it could, which caused the share price to tank because nobody knew exactly how big the debt hole was, and Warren bought in as much because he thought the CEO was an honest/stand-up guy as because the stock was on \"discount.\" \nIs that the same kind of subsidiary you're talking about? And it sounds like the way things work is companies will now try to more actively shuffle liabilities to absolve themselves of illiquid or insolvent portions of their companies? \n\n2. Regarding subsidiaries, you said,\n\n> Not every subsidiary is treated the same way in calculating these numbers - because not every subsidiary is necessarily included in the credit support as a guarantor, pledgor\n\nSo you are basically *included* in the numbers if you are a **restricted** subsidiary, because you are \"playing by the rules\" of regular companies, so your finances can be included under the larger company's umbrella of corporate accounting, and if you're **unrestricted** then you don't play by the rules, and the larger company legally owns you for purposes of shenanigans, but you don't really contribute much and typically can't take on any risk because you are ... not playing by the rules?\n\n* Finally (not sure how to adjust formatting to make this #3), what J Crew did is basically... they knew they were going bankrupt and would get margin called/told to pony up collateral for their debts and seeing as they couldn't pay off those debts/recover anyway, their best move was to hide their collateral. So they exploited a loophole to move the \"J. Crew\" brand name rights to a subsidiary that *does* play \"by the rules,\" and then from there to a little Carribbean-offshore-equivalent sub that *does not* play \"by the rules\" because the one that doesn't play by the rules can't be legally obligated to cough up the J. Crew brand/intellectual property?\n\n\nOk, I realize these questions are basically restating what you said but I want to make sure I'm processing it correctly. Finally, the take-away I'm ending with is that if I watch for companies attempting shenanigans with their IP/brand names/debt, and specifically with subsidiaries, that's a canary in the coal mine that the company's financials may suck regardless of how nice everything else looks on the outside. I remember a robinhood stocks podcast (I know... I'm an idiot I know...) said Victoria's Secret (which is owned by L brands) was bought for $1B USD... which seemed like a very cheap price for the brand recognition that victoria's secret has around the world, plus all the actual merch that comes with said acquisition.

Only thing I'm wondering is what exactly the purpose of sheltering IP using a sub would do. In the case of bankruptcy, assuming JCrew owns 100% of the sub which holds the IP, I don't see how this would make a difference because what would typically happen is that either shareholders still get wiped out and bondholders now own equity in the JCrew and therefore the sub and IP in a Chapter 11, or the sub and the IP it holds will still be sold off in a Chapter 7.

The company acknowledged that at least 22-23 million of those losses were on \"marketing and promotions\" i.e. CEO Dan Bilzerian renting jets, mansions, cars, and yachts and also purchasing personal items such as bed frames, Star Wars kits, guns, etc. and also, most importantly, paying the expenses of an army of perfect 10 models to hang out with and accompany him on exotic vacations around the world.  Dan puts the Ignite company logo on literally EVERYTHING: the jets, the mansions, the cars, the yachts, and yes, even the models that hang out with him (they are almost always wearing an Ignite branded bikini).  He then bills Ignite for all of these expenses saying that they are integral to the maintenance/ promotion of the brand image that the company promotes on heavily on instagram and other marketing materials.  Of course, this appears to be embezzlement as he's clearly using investor/company money to party, live lavishly,  and bang models ten at a time all over the globe.   \n\nAn article from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/07/07/dan-bilzerians-company-lost-50-million-last-year-will-likely-fail-auditor/#5d8ab7c5d745) reads:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Ignite \u201cmade\u201d money in two ways last year.

As per its annual filing, Ignite recorded $25 million from \u201cproceeds of issuance of shares,\u201d     $19.9 million from \u201cconvertible debt,\u201d and $23.7 million from a \u201cshort-term promissory note.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question:  If so many companies out there can cook the books and transfer their asses and TP  into whichever subwaydairy picnic basket they like, as long as they write the proper jargon into their 10-k's and 8-k's, does Bilzerian have a chance of pulling this off if he gets the right team of accountants and lawyers together??  If he structured the company a certain way from its inception?  What are your thoughts on this????
