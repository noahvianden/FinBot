{"title": "Tesla Model Y price cuts", "selftext": "# [TSLA drops prices for Model Y](https://imgur.com/gallery/3CUdXaK)\n\nThe Long Range AWD version went from $52,990 to $49,990 ($3,000 drop) and Performance AWD version went from $60,990 to $59,990 ($1,000 drop). This is huge because it means Tesla is committed to keep demand for their Electric Vehicles (EVs) high during the pandemic (even after inclusion to S&P 500 based on likely performance beat in Q2 ER).\n\nYou could take this in two ways: A) TSLA is having issues keeping demand during the pandemic and are hurting their profit margins or B) TSLA has optimized manufacturing for Model Y and is capable of bringing prices down to the consumer to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\n\nThe price drop is **YUGE** for Tesla because it allows the Model Y Long Range AWD and Performance AWD MSRP price to qualify for EV rebates in some states (e.g. $2,000 off in NY for EVs with MSRP less than $60,000 and range greater than 120 miles). This means a Model Y Performance in basic configuration could qualify for EV rebates in New York.\n\nConsidering the Model Y captures an extra 5-10% margin over the Model 3 (according to [Sandy Munro](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/articles/sandy-munro-tesla-model-y-costs-are-shocking)), the Model Y is positioned to be one of the most popular, in-demand EVs in the world (surpassing the Model 3 which is insane) since it is a more affordable SUV/CUV. Furthermore, this is consistent with the recent price cuts from the Tesla Model S, 3, and X.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla is going to Mars!

Now, they\u2019re about to reveal what three more months of Covid-19 did to the industry.\n\nSecond-quarter results, set for release next week, will probably show that the trends that took hold at the start of the year only intensified: surging provisions for loan losses and slumping consumer spending, with trading gains helping some banks weather the storm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a full three months of the pandemic coming through the numbers now,\u201d Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in an interview, adding that the second quarter was probably the worst for bank earnings since the financial crisis. \u201cThe first quarter was rough, but it really only reflected a couple of weeks in March.\u201d\n\nSoaring unemployment left many consumers unable to pay back their debts or take on new borrowing, forcing banks to set aside more to cover souring loans and crimping their net interest income. At the same time, nationwide stay-at-home orders left once-bustling downtowns and retail districts deserted through much of April, May and June, which probably hurt a cornerstone of banks\u2019 growth in recent years: service charges and credit-card fees.\n\nLending Trouble\n\nLoan-loss provisions seen continuing to weigh on bank earnings\nSource: Estimates compiled by Bloomberg, company filings\n\nShares of the companies reflect how rough this year\u2019s crisis has been on the banks. The S&P 500 Financials index has slumped 26% since the end of December, compared with a drop of just 2.4% for the broader S&P 500. Wells Fargo & Co. is the year\u2019s biggest loser among major banks, tumbling 55%.\n\nMost firms probably set aside even more provisions than in the first three months of the year, and combined earnings at the four biggest U.S. banks will be the lowest in more than a decade, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\nWells Fargo to Start Cutting Thousands of Jobs This Year\n\nWells Fargo & Co., the largest employer among U.S. banks, is preparing to cut thousands of jobs starting later this year.\n\nFor Wells Fargo, already struggling under the weight of a series of scandals before the pandemic hit, second-quarter earnings could be the worst since at least the financial crisis. The company will disclose how deep it has to cut its dividend when it releases results next week, and people familiar with the matter said the San Francisco-based bank is also readying thousands of job cuts for later this year.\n\nWells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said last month he expected the bank to set aside more for bad loans in the second quarter than the $4 billion tally for the previous three months, which itself was the most in a decade. For the industry as a whole, loan-loss provisions are poised to reach their highest levels since the financial crisis, according to analysts at Barclays Plc.\n\nTrading, Underwriting\n\nTrading and underwriting will likely be the silver lining for most banks, as a global hunt for liquidity drove up fees in the second quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nCombined stock- and bond-trading revenue at the five biggest banks probably jumped 31% from the second quarter of 2019, the estimates show, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. seen posting the biggest increase. The bank expects trading revenue to climb about 50% from a year ago, co-President Daniel Pinto said in June.\n\nTrading Bump\n\nEquities and FICC trading expected to outperform last year\nSource: Estimates compiled by Bloomberg, company filings\n\nBanks\u2019 revenue streams have remained much healthier in this crisis than in previous ones, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report. Previous cyclical downturns saw investment-banking and trading revenue drop as much as 30%, according to the report.\n\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s Richard Zogheb, global head of the debt capital-markets division, said last month that he expects record volume for the period.\n\nU.S. investment-grade corporate bond issuance more than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $757.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. High-yield sales jumped 61% to $130.1 billion.\n\nMortgages\n\nMortgages are set to be another strong spot for banks in the second quarter as historically low interest rates spur homeowners to refinance. U.S. refinancing activity has almost doubled from last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage has tumbled to 3.03%.\n\nLenders sell most of the loans they make, and the spread between what they charge borrowers and what they\u2019re able to sell the loans for was at its widest in April since 2008. Also that month, a measure of lenders\u2019 profitability maintained by the Urban Institute hit a record high.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe outlook now depends on whether businesses continue reopening, or if a resurgent virus in the Sun Belt and other regions forces another nationwide shutdown. States that faced the initial brunt of the pandemic in March and April have managed the spread of the virus, but new outbreaks in states such as Texas and Arizona are stoking fears of a second wave.\n\nWhile banks\u2019 net income will continue to face a substantial hit, the crisis is still expected to be one that brings temporary earnings pain rather than existential capital concerns, Royal Bank of Canada said in a report.\n\n\u201cOur outlook is cautiously optimistic as we expect the economy to continue to gain momentum into the end of the year,\u201d RBC said in the report.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.570081889629364}], "tickers": ["jpm", "bac"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "!Remindme 1 week", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2216716855764389}, {"body": "That\u2019s a good bear argument, yet you give no bull argument. Let me help you. \n- \n\n1.) The PPP loans - The JPM, but especially BAC are almost certainly making a killing there. More loans processed in a quarter than multiple years combined.\n\n2.)this is different from 08 in the sense that the banks were the bad guys then. In this case - they didn\u2019t cause the recession, they have had 12 years of FED induced stress tests to prepare, and they are the industry facilitating the FED\u2019s tools (and getting paid well for it)\n\n3.) The banks are going to understate how well they are doing, partially because they do not want to look like the bad guys again. This seemed to be the theme of The previous earning season, when they allocated a ton of their capital to accommodate POTENTIAL losses on loans. I think they were intentionally overestimating the impact of COVID, and rightly so, because that\u2019s their job. Always better to underpromise and overdeliver right? We will see for sure this week.\n\n3.) banks took an additional hit when Buffett sold all of GS and some of the rest of his bank stocks, but what was missed is that he sold some of his bank holdings to get his ownership just under 10% (to avoid insider status) and he *likely* sold all of GS because they are in the middle of expanding into consumer banking with their Marcus platform. \n\n4.) interest rates are low and yes that affects bank profitability to an extent. But JPOW is adamant that we are not going negative, which means rates can only go up (lol). In the meantime, this presents the buy and hold investor with year(ish) opportunity. \n\n5) commercial real estate is hurting, but residential is booming due to the low rates - banks also make money on the underwriting.\n\n6.) The fact that most banks came out of the stress test and didn\u2019t cut dividends is hella bullish for me. WFC is the exception, but they have self inflicted wounds (legal expenses) due to their fake account scandale (full disclosure; I do not like WFC)\n\n7.) A big reason banks do buybacks is because there\u2019s very few things they are allowed to do with money. That changes with the repeal of the Volcker Rule: https://www.complianceweek.com/regulatory-policy/regs-rollback-volcker-rule-restrictions-on-bank-investments/29123.article << this is slipping past a lot of people, but it means that bank can now invest alongside their clients. More risk, but certainly more reward; and I\u2019d rather they did then get back into Collalterized Debt Obligations in a big way. Will likely only see the consequences of this post COVID.\n\nIn sum: bank are the shit for buy-and-hold guys; they make money in all scenarios, so long as they continue to regulated against over-leveraging like in 08.

It's not a balance sheet issue, it's an earnings issue. (with the exceptions of course namely WFC)\n\n3. Again not irrelevant. Banks front loaded all their covid losses up front and from appearances overestimated them. This is important to earnings. If loan losses are way lower than what they prepared for, banks are likely to pop really nicely to the upside. \n\n4. Is the long term buy and hold strategy. Interest rates will only go up in the long term. It only matters for the buy and hold strategy and not any type of earnings play. \n\n5. It will depend on the bank. Banks are being pretty careful with who they give great rates too. I have a credit score in the high 700s but my bank isn't giving me remotely the best rate possible. I'd extrapolate that and would think the banks are not lending to high risk individuals on a large scale level. \n\n7. Why the hell is this negated? Buybacks were one of the main ways they could do with money. Now they have more options with the repeal of the Volcker Rule. This is hella bullish long term. IT takes time for investments to pan out so again this is a long term buy and hold bull point. \n\nI mean I definitely worry about some of the points you've made in the post.
