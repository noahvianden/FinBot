{"title": "Sell wide Iron Condors for Earnings Play. Won 19/19 times. Was it a good strategy or pure luck?", "selftext": "Hello, fellow theta warriors,\n\nI've been selling wide ICs since May.\n\nAll of them expire the same week as earnings. I sell them right before earnings and close them immediately after unless the stock price stays flat and my strikes are so far away that my closing order could not get filled.\n\nSold 19 times and won 19 times (I haven't closed my FB/AMZN plays yet, which was sold yesterday).\n\nI know someone will say this is picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. Indeed, I used to sell ICs with risk as high as $60K. But now I limit the max loss to $20K and never do more than two plays at the same time.\n\nAs for picking tickers, I first filter out low liquidity ones (unless the IV is really high), then choose from those with an IV of 80% - 200%. After that, I only follow my **instinct** whether this stock will fuck me up or not. I do go to WSB to see if a stock is over-hyped or not and adjust my instinct basing on that. But I never check the company's previous earnings, nor read technical analysis, nor draw a line on the chart or anything.\n\nFor stikes, I check the 6-month chart to get a feeling on what strike is safe. Then I try to find a play that risks $20K and win $2K \\~ $6K. If the play is not good enough, I simply give up and wait for next week.\n\nI almost got fucked a few times but eventually won. And I almost bought INTC & QCOM recently (for which I will definitely lose but I indeed gave them up as the plays did not look good enough).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My theory:**\n\n1. The market knows the price better than me do no matter how much research I perform on the ticker. The price right before earnings reflects the most anticipated price after the earnings (i.e., priced in). Assume the market is effective, this is actually the BEST guess you can have on the stock price after earnings (imagine the peak on a normal distribution).\n2. High IV stocks are hyped by crazy people (WSB, Robinhood, etc.) who want to become rich in one trade. Option price before earnings are comprised of: \\[true option price with expected movements priced in\\] + \\[a chance to become rich\\]. My understanding is that the former has an expected profit of 0 (meaning if you do it enough times, your profit tends to be close to 0). And I'm collecting money not from the former but the latter part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My questions:**\n\nIs it a good strategy or pure luck?\n\nWhat other risks in this strategy am I missing?\n\nIs it better to close a seemly super safe ICs right after earnings or wait for it to expire?\n\nCan the strategy be tuned to have higher (expected) profit but the same or lower risk?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd really appreciate it if you can give me some insights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My plays so far](https://preview.redd.it/ytcstqxck8e51.jpg?width=565&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68b7cebea631466b1b9c835ac62fe1ed90cf627a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The play I had today, screenshot from Fidelity Active Trader Pro](https://preview.redd.it/xyjjus5hq8e51.jpg?width=1076&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f69dd1b79fe50b48ac3fd19ac090118ec1a8203)", "id": "i1cgcz", "created_utc": 1596219129.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "I do this every earnings on big companies with high IV.\n\nDone this on Tesla 1340 to 1900.\nEarned $300 credit, $700 risk.\n\nAnd Amazon $2800 to $3300.\nEarned $200 credit, $800 risk.\n\nI actually tried to do this on Apple but the premiums werent paying enough.

{"title": "After 50k AMD play last week, this is next week\u2019s play\u2026", "selftext": "So after making money on  [50K AMD play](https://imgur.com/gallery/9MDo4UZ) last week (see also my last posts), the play for next week is Activision (ATVI) on Tuesday\u2019s Q2 earnings. I believe they are going to beat expectations by **a lot**. This is my reasoning:\n\n\\-So Activision Blizzard is roughly 35% Activision. Q1 net revenue was 519M. However a lot of people were at home during Q2. Warzone has 60M+ players. There were 2 seasons Warzone seasons during where a Battlepass alone costs roughly 10 bucks. Let\u2019s assume at least 20% of players pay for ingame purchases, and they spent 20$ on average (I have friends who spent 150+, 3 months is a long time to sit at home) so that would estimate 240M alone in revenue. And this is only Warzone, they have more games obviously.\n\n\\-The same arguments can be made for Candy crush and the Blizzard games. But I am not familiar with them (and their ingame purchases), but I would guess at least 30-40% more in Q2 compared to Q1.\n\n\\-The outlook for Q2 (1,690M) is LESS than Q1 (1,825M). I am expecting atleast 2B+. Stock has gone up from 65 to 81 already but this is mainly due to NASDAQ increase. \n\n\\-More companies who profited from many people staying at home have blown away their Q2 expectations (Amazon for example)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis stock has the potential to blow past 90 next week. Here are the best plays ranked from risk averse to ultimate WSB.\n\n\\- Jan15 21 60/100 callspread.\n\n\\- 08/21 85 Call\n\n\\- 08/07 82 Call", "id": "i18plf", "created_utc": 1596206685.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Don't you guys have phones?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Is this an out of season april fools joke?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10975898802280426}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18523740768432617}, {"body": "Never forget...", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23204240202903748}, {"body": "Same, they didn't live up with Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04830843210220337}, {"body": "I wish I knew how many hours of my life was absorbed by Diablo 2.\n\nLvl 99 barb (hardcore)", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10900165140628815}, {"body": "Just think about how sweet diablo four will be in 2032, though!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.034483086317777634}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04103388637304306}, {"body": "08/21 85c \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc", "score": 33, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08883079886436462}, {"body": "EA barely moved after crushing.

Hopefully you legged in right and your long leg will be ITM and your short leg ATM, or even slightly OTM.

And gains would be credit from the shorts. A reverse strategy can be made so that you're neutral on movement where you leg into something like long 34 short 35, 33 and with this, you lose if they end up right at the middle of 34 but you're already accounting for a movement by initiating it OTM and you win if they don't move either.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But why would I open an iron condor at earnings ?

A condor involves having both calls and puts. So the butterfly strategy works if you're bullish but still neutral on earnings. If you already expect a stock not to move above a certain price, hence the credit spread, youre saying you expect it to to go up. Otherwise, a put debit spread might be better than a credit spread since you're already bearish.\n\n So let's say you do decide to leg into an OTM butterfly. By legging with 2 calls instead of just 1, you can set up a spread on both sides with a lower cost basis and secure some profits while maintaining a position where your credit spread makes money as long as it's below a price, and with this, you can take part in the earnings movement if they do go up. Your short calls are used to lower your max loss, and your max gain is increased COMPARED to capital in play at earnings report. In short, capitalize on run-up, hedge against directional loss, and participate in market movement. \n\nYou can read up what exactly are the max losses and profits on a butterfly is. But I only really advise legging into options if you know what you're doing since legging can go against you really fast really quickly if you FOMO or panic into it. \n\nThis is of course assuming that your sentiment is what I highlighted above.\n\nI'm by no means an expert btw and I can be wrong about the risks in this strategy so plug in the play you wanna try on optionsprofitcalculator for a better picture of how your trades will look like.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Very detailed, thank you, I\u2019ll look up more about the butterfly spread.
