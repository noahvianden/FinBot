So before anything else, thanks for the advice, learning, and retarded-ass humor. Yeah I'm a simp fuck you\n\nStarted in late Feb during the airline/travel crash with $850; I accidentally diamond-handed on a cross country flight, made 500 bucks, and was.... intrigued. Also had puts on the airline I was flying which felt like living on the edge. \n\nLong story short, I got serious, and by serious I mean reading the fucked up DD that was all over this sub. Also started learning about theta gang, only chucking around FD's when I was willing to lose the money, etc. Made it to around 15k and stagnated between that and \\~10k for a while fucking around with AMZN FD's; finally got out of that with some dumb luck, TSLA, and FLIR calls. Passing 25k felt like an emancipation, but I quickly found out that the paper hands you get with unlimited day trades is risky as fuck. Started running the wheel on high dividend energy stocks and playing a stupid FD or two; made it to 40k largely on Amazon and Tesla calls, then went back down to 26k trying to catch the falling knife on both. Been crawling back up with theta and earnings plays and trying not to repeat my mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, these gains are small compared to the big fish on here, but they represent a whole new way of how I look at $, and a whole bunch of knowledge, stupid decisions, and good times that I wouldn't have had without this sub. So again, thanks a bunch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll post again when I double it or lose it all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent positions: 8/21 TSLA 1600c, 8/21 AAPL $400c, 9/4 AUY $7c, 8/14 UPS $120c, a few OTM spy p hedges just cause im a pussy, then MPC and SLB shares para la THETA gainz. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5b0zx98rhd51.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ded82dc0a331e594470008703286e7c9e59c011", "id": "hz4bfu", "created_utc": 1595895693.0, "score": 591, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "Makes over 4000% returns in a fucked up market\n\nCalls them small gains\n\nI can confidently buy puts on this guy's humility because it's topped\n\nCongrats and fuck you", "score": 308, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5554881691932678}, {"body": "Unless you have real money or don't really need money...bank $10k.", "score": 345, "replies": [{"body": "Im a grad student and a dirtbag so no real money but also dont need money.

Is this true?  Holy crap that's brand new information and you're totally the first person to post that joke!!\n\nI am no NKLA fan, but you are truly an autistic moron.  NKLA is overvalued based on where they are as a company because a bunch of morons got excited and treated their IPO like they were 3 days away from having a product on the road instead of 3 years.\n\nThe theranos comparison is beyond idiotic, and is an illustration of how much of a retarded moron you are and why you are losing money.  Theranos was a private company that hid everything and never let anyone see inside their box.  NKLA would have to be as big a morons as you are to go public if they were doing the same thing, especially since they already had enough money to buy their mansions before the IPO.\n\nThey live stream their trucks running on twitter where every hydrogen engineer on the planet can run it in slow-mo and pick it apart for anything fake.  They literally have the trucks sitting in a place where you, or one of those engineers, can walk in and crawl under the truck and look at it for anything fake.\n\nIf they're faking it then they're fucking retarded for having as much transparency as they do.  Far more than any other company this far away from actually putting their product into production.\n\nThey're a bad buy BECAUSE of their transparency.  Because they are buyable 3 years before they have a product and having it so accessible makes dumb investors think it's closer to reality than it really is.  Did you see the Tesla Roadsters engine 3 years before they actually started selling them?  Did you see an iphone's internals 3 years before they actually started selling them?\n\nNKLA is a bad investment because there's a 1% chance they are the future of the trucking industry and a 99% chance they fizzle out into nothing.  And that small upside chance is a long ways off with probably many cheaper buying opportunities before it even has a chance of hitting.\n\nBut this dumb WSB meme about Theranos is fucking retarded and anyone repeating it deserves to lose their money on their dumb short dated puts that already have sky IV.
