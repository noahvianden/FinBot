Also had puts on the airline I was flying which felt like living on the edge. \n\nLong story short, I got serious, and by serious I mean reading the fucked up DD that was all over this sub. Also started learning about theta gang, only chucking around FD's when I was willing to lose the money, etc. Made it to around 15k and stagnated between that and \\~10k for a while fucking around with AMZN FD's; finally got out of that with some dumb luck, TSLA, and FLIR calls. Passing 25k felt like an emancipation, but I quickly found out that the paper hands you get with unlimited day trades is risky as fuck. Started running the wheel on high dividend energy stocks and playing a stupid FD or two; made it to 40k largely on Amazon and Tesla calls, then went back down to 26k trying to catch the falling knife on both. Been crawling back up with theta and earnings plays and trying not to repeat my mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, these gains are small compared to the big fish on here, but they represent a whole new way of how I look at $, and a whole bunch of knowledge, stupid decisions, and good times that I wouldn't have had without this sub. So again, thanks a bunch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll post again when I double it or lose it all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent positions: 8/21 TSLA 1600c, 8/21 AAPL $400c, 9/4 AUY $7c, 8/14 UPS $120c, a few OTM spy p hedges just cause im a pussy, then MPC and SLB shares para la THETA gainz. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5b0zx98rhd51.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ded82dc0a331e594470008703286e7c9e59c011", "id": "hz4bfu", "created_utc": 1595895693.0, "score": 591, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "Makes over 4000% returns in a fucked up market\n\nCalls them small gains\n\nI can confidently buy puts on this guy's humility because it's topped\n\nCongrats and fuck you", "score": 308, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5554881691932678}, {"body": "Unless you have real money or don't really need money...bank $10k.", "score": 345, "replies": [{"body": "Im a grad student and a dirtbag so no real money but also dont need money.

Is this true?  Holy crap that's brand new information and you're totally the first person to post that joke!!\n\nI am no NKLA fan, but you are truly an autistic moron.  NKLA is overvalued based on where they are as a company because a bunch of morons got excited and treated their IPO like they were 3 days away from having a product on the road instead of 3 years.\n\nThe theranos comparison is beyond idiotic, and is an illustration of how much of a retarded moron you are and why you are losing money.  Theranos was a private company that hid everything and never let anyone see inside their box.  NKLA would have to be as big a morons as you are to go public if they were doing the same thing, especially since they already had enough money to buy their mansions before the IPO.\n\nThey live stream their trucks running on twitter where every hydrogen engineer on the planet can run it in slow-mo and pick it apart for anything fake.  They literally have the trucks sitting in a place where you, or one of those engineers, can walk in and crawl under the truck and look at it for anything fake.\n\nIf they're faking it then they're fucking retarded for having as much transparency as they do.  Far more than any other company this far away from actually putting their product into production.\n\nThey're a bad buy BECAUSE of their transparency.  Because they are buyable 3 years before they have a product and having it so accessible makes dumb investors think it's closer to reality than it really is.  Did you see the Tesla Roadsters engine 3 years before they actually started selling them?  Did you see an iphone's internals 3 years before they actually started selling them?\n\nNKLA is a bad investment because there's a 1% chance they are the future of the trucking industry and a 99% chance they fizzle out into nothing.  And that small upside chance is a long ways off with probably many cheaper buying opportunities before it even has a chance of hitting.\n\nBut this dumb WSB meme about Theranos is fucking retarded and anyone repeating it deserves to lose their money on their dumb short dated puts that already have sky IV.

Sorry if its not too collected.  \n>  \n>The core of what you need to know is that gold is one of the leading - if not the #1 alternative - to government bonds. (It's not the only one though.)  \n>  \n>You need to know the bond market is fucking huge. Way bigger than the stock market.  \n>  \n>You need to know government bond yields go down when interest rates go down.  \n>  \n>You need to know that the world governments have no choice but to stick to 0% interest rates for a long ass time, because our entire domino tower global economy is addicted to monetary policy expansion.  \n>  \n>You need to know that with 0% interest rates, the bond market is going to give almost meaningless returns.  \n>  \n>You need to know that if 0% interest rates don't save us, the central banks are going to start talking about negative interest rates, and no one is even going to want to hold bonds.  \n>  \n>You need to also know that in addition to the bond market issues, there is also the secondary inflation discussion. As interest rates are low, fractional reserve banking laws have been repealed, and government handouts are at an all time high, the number of actual dollars (and all currencies) in circulation are going way way way up. As the economy recovers, the velocity of money will likely lead to large amounts of inflation.  \n>  \n>Investors are afraid of sitting in cash and losing to inflation.  \n>  \n>In a stagnant environment, gold protects against even 1 or 2% inflation.  \n>  \n>In an environment where inflation could be even higher than that, there could potentially be a real fear of inflation running away, and there could be an unprecedented demand for inflationary protection, above and beyond the regular bond market hum drum.  \n>  \n>You also need to know that these crazy ass economic conditions could even lead to major currency issues. Governments buy other countries currencies as one way to stabilize their own currencies. They also typically hold onto gold, even though there isn't a real gold standard anymore.  \n>  \n>Even without a gold standard, in the event of wide spread global currency devaluation (such as whats coming following all this government spending and monetary madness), purchasing other currencies isn't going to be very attractive. Even with all the current central banking policies remaining constant, this suggests to me that the government demand for gold will likely increase. Even if just China or Russia go back to buying up gold it will spike the prices even further.  \n>  \n>However, Donald Trump is now quietly pushing this lady, Judy Shelton into the fed board of governors/directors. She believes in getting USA back to the gold standard. She has already been nominated by the fed committee, and now she needs approval from the Senate. As of the time of writing this post, it is suspected there is enough republican votes to elect her. However, the democrats have been clear they wont support her. 2 republican senators said they wont either. I think she is 1 or 2 votes away from not getting elected.  \n>  \n>If this lady gets elected, it does not matter if the USA doesn't go back to the gold standard. The possibility of it alone is going to make people go crazy and buy gold.  \n>  \n>To be clear, I don't think the US go back to the gold standard even if Shelton gets nominated and then even made chair of the federal reserve. I consider myself extremely educated in politics (I work in Canadian politics, as does my significant other). I just don't see this gold standard thing happening.  \n>  \n>BUT.

If you want to make big money in gold, its the miners, not the bullion.  \n>  \n>All these companies are breaking even at like $1200-$1400 per ounce. Most of their costs are fixed. This means if they were making like say $100 per ounce at $1400, when gold increases by 35% or whatever from $1400 to $1900, their profits go up from $100 to like $600 or a 600% increase, not 35%.  \n>  \n>I've been trying to tell people, gold trading at $2000 is like the barrel of oil trading at $200.

A higher gold price will make or break a project, and therefore make or break a junior(to compare with seniors, a changing gold price might significantly influence some of their mines, but not not all - if gold drops and one of their mines closes down as a result, at least they have 9 other mines that are still profitable).  \n\n2) Juniors make discoveries. As I stated, they focus on exploration. Seniors allocate a relatively small portion of their cash to exploration (as they're more focused on the mining aspect). With more money flowing into the sector during a bull run, juniors are able to finance their exploration programs - thus, a major discovery is more likely to be made with a junior.  \n\n3) Juniors get bought out by the majors - usually at nice premiums in bull markets. Majors exhaust their mines and the easiest way for them to replenish their reserves is by buying up other assets.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4913255572319031}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I think this is satire... but you can never tell on this sub.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "It's actually real.
