IMO they simply haven't tried shopping elsewhere, many other companies have similar sites nowadays.  Maybe there is some feature I am not aware of on [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), but if the point is simply to find a wide variety of stuff online, then my point stands\n\n3)  Amazon has become the stock of \"going up because people said it is going to go up and there are alot of articles about it.\"  I feel like that is a really shoddy foundation to buy an investment on.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Amazon is not only e-commerce.

Most of the stuff I buy seems cheap so I am not putting more effort into finding it even cheaper.\n\nAs per the last part about him being forward thinking, what pisses me off, is that the majority of companies are forward thinking in that way.  AT&T is in my portfolio and I disagree with their strategy.  But most other stocks I'm aware of and follow seem to have a strategy that goes years out.  I don't see anyone pricing in the growth they forecast, only the opposite, if guidance doesn't seem strong enough, the stock drops.\n\nNot saying you said anything wrong, just providing my view of what I see.
