{"title": "Apple & Tesla Announced Stock Splits; Here\u2019s How It Could Impact Your Investments", "selftext": "## What\u2019s A Stock Split And How It Could Affect Your Current Holdings\n\nApple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, let\u2019s understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be \u2018too high\u2019. For example, in [Tesla](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=TSLA) 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.\n\nA stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they end up boosting demand and driving up prices. A stock split also reminds investors that the share price had been increasing in the past. It is not surprising that many investors extrapolate the historical growth into the future and bid up the share price again. One thing to also note is that even though the number of outstanding shares increases and stock price decreases, the market capitalization doesn\u2019t change.\n\n# Who Tend To Benefit From Stock Splits?\n\nGenerally speaking, stock splits are neutral events for current shareholders. In the case of the Apple 4-for-1 stock split, you used to own 1 share, but moving forward you will own 4, but the total value remains the same. Essentially, a stock split wouldn\u2019t change the company value, all else being equal. But the truth is, all else is rarely equal when we apply it in the market.\n\nBoth TSLA stock and [AAPL stock](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AAPL) jumped after the announcement. This may be the fifth time for Apple to do a stock split, but it is Tesla\u2019s first. The price change will be more dramatic for Tesla, whose stock split will bring individual share to the $300 range. Compared to Apple\u2019s post-split of $100 range, Tesla\u2019s post-split stock might find it harder to attract smaller investors.\n\nCertain online brokerages offer investors to buy fractional stocks. Conceptually, it offers the same thing in the absence of stock splits. Then again, not all brokerages will offer such services and it\u2019s not that easy to move shares between brokerages. Therefore, it will not create a much stronger demand than actual stock splits. Now, like it or not, news of stock splits tend to cause share prices to jump. And that is not really rational. But who cares? As long as the prices go up, existing shareholders would not be complaining.\n\n## Tesla & Apple\u2019s Stock Splits Could Restart The Trend Again.\n\nIs stock splits a thing in the past? Tracing back the history, in 1997, 102 companies in the [S&P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) split their stocks, and in 2016, only 7 companies did so, a decline of more than 90%. That is about to change when two of the hottest tech companies announced they will be splitting their shares at the end of this month. The zero brokerage fees environment gives companies a greater incentive to split shares today. In addition, it creates a more affordable and accessible stock for Robinhood traders to start trading. After all, many retail investors are nonetheless still prone to judging how \u201cexpensive\u201d a stock is based on its dollar value. That said, it is not surprising to see other tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Alphabet make such moves on their own timeline.", "id": "i8zf3r", "created_utc": 1597323399.0, "score": 729, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for the informative post!", "score": 137, "replies": [{"body": "No problem.

{"title": "Can someone make the positive Apple stock outlook make sense?", "selftext": "I am in my twenties and like many \"new\" investors became very interested in the market as a result of the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. I saw a lot of my peers on Twitter and FaceBook making decent gains and it really piqued my interest because I have been saving roughly 4k per month in a high interest savings account and not really doing much else with it. I always thought the market to be too risky for my taste but after becoming comfortable with my base savings, I was ready to start my own journey into investing. I am not really the kind of person to go off of word of mouth so I set out to learn as much as I could on my own through reading and online courses. I took a course on the basics of the stock market on Udemy which mainly covered fundamental analysis but touched on the technical side of things as well. In addition to this I took a more in depth course on just technical analysis which covered trend lines, candlestick patterns etc ... I didn't find it too helpful for long term investments but it still seemed interesting. Lastly I read the Intelligent Investor as well as One Up on WallStreet and a book on basic accounting to help me understand how to decipher what I was seeing on these annual reports and what all of the numbers meant when I was attempting to valuate a potential purchase .... as well as various YouTube courses and tutorials\n\nAll of this has occurred over the course of the past 3 months, so while I have become a little more knowledgeable than most of my friends just blindly throwing money into the market, I still don't feel very confident in my newly developed skills because .... well, they are new and I haven't had enough experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME AND MY JOURNEY INTO THE STOCK MARKET, SKIP TO HERE:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I have been seeing a lot of talk about this 4:1 Apple split that is coming up and while I understand that this doesn't change the company fundamentally at all, I really can't seem to see why Apple is trading for what it is ... or more importantly, why so many analysts are rating it as a \"buy\". I know that Graham specifically warns against needing validation from \"professionals\" for your decision making but since I am still really a newbie, I wanted to know if there is something I am missing in forming my opinion that the stock is severely overvalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is how I arrived at this conclusion:\n\n**Point 1:**\n\nIn my opinion, Apple is nothing more than a 1 dimensional hardware company. When you look at the annual report for FY 19' the revenue stemmed from the following:\n\n* iPhone Sales: 54.7%\n* Services: 17.8%\n* Mac: 9.9%\n* Wearables, Home, & Accessories: 9.4%\n* iPad: 8.2%\n\nOut of all of these things, the only one that is not hardware is services which means that 82.2% of the sales come from hardware alone ... mainly iPhone.\n\nFurthermore, if you look at what exactly makes up this \"services\" category you will see that it is Apple Music, Apple Care, iCloud, App Store Subscriptions, and also baked in there is the free version of iCloud, Maps, and Siri.\n\nNow, while I respect apple for growing this particular vertical (services) of its company which has experienced some good growth over the last few years\n\n2017: $32,700M in sales\n\n2018: $39,748M in sales (increase of 21.55%)\n\n2019: $46,291M in sales (increase of 16.46%)\n\nI can't help but also realize how closely coupled the services vertical is to the hardware vertical. Mostly all of the services Apple provides depend on the successful sale of its hardware. I can speak personally that I cancelled Apple Music in 2017 for Spotify because I switched jobs (software engineer) to a position that required me to work in a secure environment where I couldn't bring in my phone and since Apple Music had no web app, I couldn't listen to music and code while at work. This makes me weary of their services business as a whole because if for some reason the hardware becomes less popular then the services will suffer severely it seems ... you don't really need Apple Music without an iPhone .... and you aren't really paying for app store subscriptions if you don't have an iPhone or Mac ... and you also don't need Apple Care without an Apple Device, see where I am heading?\n\n&#x200B;\n\niPhone sales are plateauing which can be seen by the data leading up to 2018 as well as the official announcement from Apple that they would stop providing exact numbers on the numbers of units sold at the end of 2018.  Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/)\n\nIn addition to iPhone sales slowing up ... PC sales have been declining across the board for a while due to the fact that handhelds have become increasingly more powerful, this has also resulted in the plateauing of Mac sales as well. Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say all of this to point out that for a company that is getting 82% of its sales from hardware, the hardware growth seems to be slowing down tremendously and the services market that it seems to be  shifting into seems largely dependent on the hardware, which seems concerning to say the least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Point 2:**\n\nApple does not appear to either be a growth stock or a value stock in the current climate. Don't get me wrong, I think Apple is pretty good company as a whole and they appear to clearly be financially stable  even despite the declining hardware sales ... but at this price they are far from a \"value\" stock and from a financial perspective, they don't seem to be a \"growth\" stock either.\n\nWhen you look at net income for the past 5 years you will notice that it hasn't really changed too much, when comparing the most recent annual report with the one from 5 years ago the net income has only increased by 3.5% which doesn't even take into account inflation which in actuality would make it seem like the net income for FY 19' was actually less than what was earned in FY 15'\n\n2015: $53.39B\n\n2016: $45.69B\n\n2017: $48.35B\n\n2018: $59.53B\n\n2019:  $55.26B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, what seems funky to me is that the EPS actually seems to be increasing over time ... but it is not due to the net income rising, it is due to the fact that Apple has been buying back stock each year thus decreasing the total number of shares outstanding from 5.75B in 2015 to 4.62B in 2019, a decrease of 19.65% over the past 5 years ... this makes the EPS seem higher and the P/E seem lower, making the stock seem more valuable than it actually is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SHARES OUTSTANDING:**\n\n2015: 5.75B\n\n2016: 5.47B (-4.87%)\n\n2017: 5.22B (-4.57%)\n\n2018: 4.96B (-4.98%)\n\n2019: 4.62B (-6.85%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: - 19.65%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS (as is in annual report):**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $8.35 (-10.02%)\n\n2017: $9.27 (+11.02%)\n\n2018: $12.01 (+29.56%)\n\n2019:  $11.97 (-0.37%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +28.99%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS (based on consistent shares outstanding of 5.75B across all years)**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $7.94 (-14.44%)\n\n2017: $8.40 (+5.79%)\n\n2018: $10.35 (+23.21%)\n\n2019:  $9.61 (-7.15%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +3.56%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen if we use each 2019 EPS to calculate the P/E based on todays closing price of $452.04\n\n**P/E TTM as is:** $37.76\n\n**P/E TTM adjusted based on consistent shares outstanding:** $47.04\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot really sure if I am even allowed to make an adjusted calculation based on what if they never brought back the shares but nonetheless here it is ....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Point 3:**\n\nThis is purely speculation which is against the rules, I know .... but I can't help but think consumer psychology has to play a role in the market.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that consumers don't really know what they want until it is presented to them, iPhone has dominated the market for what seems like forever but in actuality, it has really only been about a decade. iPhone 4 was the real game changer since it allowed people to get their hands on an iPhone for other carriers. There seems to be a general consensus among many consumers now though that all Apple does is slap a new camera on each new model, repackage it, and put it on the shelf .... being in tech myself, I understand that the technical upgrades such as chipsets and other components that don't bring forth clear, tangible improvements do play a vital role in allowing the device to move forward and become more capable but I don't think the average consumer understands that.\n\nApple vs Android is a tired and pretty much done battle, they have been battling for the market for a while and many consumers have chosen their side and will likely stick with it at this point when comparing the 2 ... however, I have a feeling that if a new product were to emerge onto the market that were neither android or apple but introduced something reliable, new, and fresh then consumers would be more than ready for a change. Apple's double edged sword is that it is a complete ecosystem, all of the devices rely on some type of proprietary operating system which when paired together create a pretty good user experience between the devices. However, make no mistake, iPhone sits at the top of that ecosystem and for many consumers, iPhone is the segway into the Apple ecosystem. You get an iPhone and you like it .... so now when you get a computer you want a Mac etc. I say this to point out how financially dependent Apple is on the iPhone, if ever it should fail ... then the performance of the company will suffer miserably. How long can iPhone continue to dominate? Touch screen phones of this type have been running the scene for the past decade, I honestly think a major change is on the horizon for smart phones, but I don't necessarily believe Apple will be the company to usher it in .... and because of that belief I just don't think it would be a good idea to overpay for a stock now with the stupid belief that the what goes up must continue to go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom everything I see it seems like Apple is severely overvalued right now, the company  has shown a long history of growth and one would like to think that would continue but based on the financials it doesn't seem like the growth factor is really there right now. I don't think the company is doomed or is a bad pick, I just don't think it's a good pick at its current price. However, with that being said ... I don't have nearly as much experience as many of you I'm sure and definitely not those analysts. on Wall Street, so I was trying to figure out why people are so excited as the price sits now and why the buy rating seems to be so high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure, I have no position.

This can be seen in their decision to keep iPhone sales the same at 999 since the X and offering cheaper models like SE, xr, regular 11, and future 12. The 12 is expected to be a \"supercycle\" for iphones where everybody buys this model because it has a different body design. The rumoured price of the regular 12 is also lowered to 649.

Prior to this late last year/this year, Apple's PE ratio was only between 14-16x.  Take a look at the historical PE ratio for Microsoft and Google.

I don't agree with your points personally, but I think they are well thought out and rationalised.\n\nMaybe not necessarily counter points, but a couple of things that come to mind are:\n\n* **Lack of new product segments/innovation:** I see this as a super common complaint about Apple, but truth be told I think because people don't see a hugely game changing product like the iPhone or iPad they assume this is true. I believe it's not. Take the Apple Watch for example, which is now about 5 years old. It's now one of the best selling wearable devices in a segment that's growing. Sure it's a digital watch (to over simplify it) so it's not ground breaking, but the useability has jumped in leaps and bounds since Gen 1 which is driving it's success. Airpods are another example. I think where %'s are concerned, yes iPhone dominates it's revenue streams, but %'s don't necessarily tell the story. 5 or 6 years ago, if you bought an iPhone, that'd be it. Now you are likely to buy Airpods and an Apple Watch to go along with it. So regardless of whether iPhone sales go up or down, Apple has already bolstered it's revenue streams with these add-on accessories. Yes you're right Apple needs iPhone as a gateway product (and Watch only works with iPhone), but there are so many Airpod android users (and it's one of the best selling android bluetooth headphones, or at least were previously).\n* **Management and People:** One thing that gets discounted too often is the talent within of some of these companies. People often look at the figurehead, whether that's Steve Jobs, Tim Cook or Johnny Ive and tie the companies fortune against them. What Apple have shown is that they are long past the era where 1 person makes or breaks the company. There is clearly a fantastic team of people working at the company that's driving this performance, even if they aren't the ones in the head lines\n* **Share market is crazy:** This kind of ties with the point above. Ultimately it looks as though the share market has decided that it's just going to look as far into the future as possible and price based on that. That would explain some of the crazy P/Es we're seeing in big, established companies. I think people (and have been for a while) are pricing in unknowns due to proven track records. This is most likely the case with Apple, and has been for years now. I know past performance is not indicative of future performance, but one thing Apple management has shown is that they certainly know how to meet or exceed already lofty expectations consistently.\n\nI know you didn't say AAPL bad, so I'm not trying to discredit anything you've written.\n\nDisclosure: I'm a happy holder, but happy to pick up more if it comes crashing again.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "With companies like Apple and Amazon, you are not suppose to trade them.

Therefore, it would be one of the most covered companies in the world. Therefore the probability of the stock being \"severely overvalued\" is lower than other stocks on average. That is not to say future information won't have a significant impact on the stock price because every company faces risks. \n\nAlso, with respect to your points that are centered primarily on PE; forward PE in itself can't be used to determine whether a company is overvalued. There are many companies with higher forward PEs than AAPL in this market, including NKE, SBUX, AMZN, DIS, COST, V to name a few. \n\nI'll introduce one concept that is important: earnings quality. Look at INTC's financials, and repeat your same analysis. \n\nNet Income increased from 11bn in '15 to 21bn in '19.\nShares outstanding deceased from 4.72bn to 4.29bn\nEPS increased from 2.39 to 4.78.\n\nPE is only 9.\n\nIf you apply your metrics to INTC, it is severely undervalued. Higher growth rates than AAPL and low PE.\n\nYet AAPL stock price almost quadrupled while INTC stock price hasn't doubled.\n\nThis is where earnings quality concept comes into play. Not every dollar is equal. The market doesn't deem Intel's earnings to be of high quality, it's not reliable and at significant risk. The market deems Apple's earnings to be reliable.\n\nThe COVID-induced recession highlights the importance of earnings quality. Where many companies/industries suffered major losses, Apple was not impacted, in fact their net income went up YoY.

Apple manufacturing their own chips looks extremely promising from the standpoint of better performance and pricing. \n3.
