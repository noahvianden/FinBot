{"title": "Fastly - Some Myths Cleared Here", "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do?\n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case.\n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n1. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling.\n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 1: Some of you are hellbent on debating that MSFT will use Azure to provide CDN service for Tiktok. Take a look at this link to see a list of Azure CDN customers**\n\n[https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customers](https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customers)\n\nHow many do you recognize? More importantly, how many do you think are critically dependent on cold start time?  Short answer is that except Adobe, HP, Heineken, and Maersk, I do not recognize others.  I will rest my case here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 2: Here is why MSFT will not care about moving Tiktok to Azure**\n\nFrom Fastly's 10Q  and shareholder letter published on August 7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Revenue for Q2, 2020 = $74.66MM\n* Revenue for Q1, 2020= $82.92MM\n* Revenue guidance from the chief: $290-300MM for FY2020\n* Tiktok's contribution to this revenue: 12% of $300MM = $36MM\n\nNow, think about this #---> $36MM is what MSFT would have to pay Fastly if they are going to continue using them this year. Of course this number will get compounded every year with the Tiktok's growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you really convinced that a $1.6T market cap behemoth  is interested in saving $36MM per year for an acquisition that they will be paying north of $60-65BB to Bytedance? I mean, really? This is a drop in the bucket for MSFT. Tech spends more than that much money on free food for employees. If they were really thinking about cutting costs, you would have observed it from their other practices. I will not go any further than this statement.\n\nAgain, this is my perspective. You can believe what you want to, but I tried to give you a well documented reason behind why MSFT will not pursue Azure for Tiktok.", "id": "i5nb19", "created_utc": 1596838317.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Hello knowledgeable cloud dude\n\nCan you please give your opinion of compute@edge.

Now, I'm totally not into WWE but I have a friend who is so diehard it makes me worried. He told me there was a WWE event in another city not too far away and asked if I wanted to go. I said sure. Why the fk not. I used to watch when I was in middle school. I go, and I proceed to have the most insane white trash time of my life, mind you I'm asian. First off, I get totally obliterated and I'm just screaming my ass off the entire time. That part was great. But the part that blew me away was when I went to the merch stand. You will not believe how much cash money I saw getting shilled out for merch by people who look like they do not exactly have a lot of money. And these products were extremely subpar in quality, made from China bullshit. I proceed to purchase a glowing unicorn horn thing that was like $15. Totally worth it. \n\nAnyhoodles, as we are driving back home (not driving because dammit I'm responsible), my buddy is telling me about their streaming service they're coming with as well as the other brands they have under the WWE company, which is NXT if you did not know. So I don't do any DD. Just pulled the trigger the next day. Stock was like $30 something dollars. The next thing I know, the stock goes on a WrestleMania run nearly tripling in value. I sold at $90.\n\nI just wanted to share this story because I'm trying to get different perspective from other people. I ask everyone.

Those guys move a lot of cars each month and aren't willing to budge as much as a walk up guy trying to hit a bonus. \n\nIf they use a digital camera to take the photos and there is a time stamp on it, take note of how long the car has been on their lot.  The longer the car sits, the more willing they will be to move it.  If they just got it, its probably not their lowest price yet.  Usually a big dealership wants to move their cars as fast as possible, but won't sit on a car for more than 60 or 90 days.  \n\nGet the vin number off of the website if possible (ill explain later).  It also helps to find a similar vehicle from their competition at a similar price point.  I bought a toyota tundra, but there was a Ford dealership (owned by a different company) next door.   They had a very similar F-150 for a few k less.  The different company is key, even if its a different brand (ford/toyota).  I worked at a Ford dealership with a dodge/ram/jeep dealership next door.  If you walked away from me and bought a ram next door, I still got half of your commission and didn't have to deal with your bullshit.\n This is why you don't fill out the internet thing, the sales guy has to split the commission with the internet guy.  You need to tell them upfront you DIDN'T fill that out.  Bring it up casually in conversation like, \"hey I didn't fill out the coupon thing online, I can do it now from my phone if you want.\"\n\nAnyway, \n\nThe price they have the car marked on the lot will be significantly higher than the internet (theyre competing with every dealership online).   They'll try to say thats a different car blah blah.   pull out the paperwork with the vin and compare it. the vin is stamped to the dash on the inside the windshield on the driver's side, so you can  call them on their bullshit standing next to the car.  The salesman will play dumb, but feel free to call them out for lying.  \n\n\nGet a pre-approval offer from your bank or capital one or whatever.   Get approved on the actual vehicle with the vin number, enter in your parameters (number of months, down payment, trade etc).  You can exaggerate the value of your trade just a bit $1,500-$2k.  Don't be stupid, you're not going to be able to make up $10k.  \n\nWhen you sit down, they're going to bring you some bullshit number (1st pencil).  Make a joke, tell them they made a mistake, you're only buying 1 car.   Give them the sheet that shows your bank approved you at the price they have listed online, on that vehicle (vin number) and tell them you'll finance through them if they can beat the price, if not, you just need the cash price and you'll deal with your bank.  They likely won't be able to actually beat the price bc you lied about your trade, and you'll probably have to give a little ground, but thats OK.\n\nChances are, they'll come back 2-3 times with numbers higher than you are already approved for. Theyll try to throw in an extended warranty, free car washes etc.  Deny any and every extra the salesman tries to sell you and get the bottom price from him. (I'll explain later). \n\n You still have the other vehicle you're already approved on at the other dealership as a trump card. If the salesman is being a dick or not playing ball, call the other dealership, either when he walks off or just conspicuously walk past the sales desk and ask them if they have the car in stock.  Tell the dealership you're already pre-approved can you come buy that car *right now*.  The dealership will 100% of the time say yes, even if they already sold that car (yeah, they're all fuckin liars).  \n\nIf they still won't budge, tell them you're tired of playing games. You're buying a car today, if they won't work a deal, pull out the sheet and say this dealership is ready to sell me this car right now and you already called them.  If they're willing to let you walk at this point and you're way off, they can't and/or aren't willing to make the deal.   \n\n\nNow remember, you lied about the price of your trade in.  Its highly likely they won't be able to get you to exactly the price you quoted yourself.  Depending on credit and interest rate and term, every $1000 financed is roughly $15-$30.  If you lied by 2k and you're pre-approved at $405/month and they're offering you $430/month, that's a pretty good deal.  If they offer you a range of between $430-$450 cross out the 450, circle the 430 and sign it saying you'll buy it right now at 430.  They'll agree.  \n\nThe bottom line,Get the lowest price they're willing to give you from the salesman.   Don't add any bells and whistles, just get the lowest price. \n\nIf you DO want to purchase the extended warranty, or the free car washes (scam) or the whatever just wait.   \n\nAfter you're done with the sales guy, you'll go in the finance office.   The finance people have the ability to manipulate the interest rate to lower your prices (which the salesman/sales managers either don't or wont).  \n\nThe dealership will get you approved at a rate (your buy rate) but won't tell you what that is.  If, for example,, they get you approved at 1.9% and charge you 3.9%, they make the other 2% on the back end.  This is dealer profit and is a part of the finance guys commission. They almost always try to squeeze 2% unless they're offering a promo interest rate to move a certain car.  \n\nThe finance guy makes a nut off of all of the packages the car salesman can't sell, and that extended warranty is likely a bigger commission to him than the back end interest.   \nObviously at this point, the news has spread from the sales manager that you're a tough cookie.  Here you can use his ego to your advantage.  He'll REALLY want to rub it in everyone's face that he is a really Badass salesman. \n He is the only one that can/will manipulate the interest rate,  so he can lower your interest rate to keep your payments close.  The end result is you can get a $3k package added for $15-20 bucks /month that the salesman could only offer you for $50-60/month.  \n\n\nNow, this whole process is designed at getting you the best price possible.  You're going to have to be willing to be a dick and stand up and walk out if they're not playing the game, but it's A LOT easier to pull off if you come in cool, calm and collected and act like you don't give a fuck.  If you come in aggressive, being an aasshole, and you're a tough sell, they won't be as likely to play the game and they'll tell you to fuck off.  Don't go in guns blazing.  \nYou've done your homework and have a couple of cards up your sleeve. \n\n\nTheir job is to get you to fall in love with the car to justify over paying for it.  Don't fall into their trap.  \nHertz is liquidating 180,000 cars before December 31st.  The used car market is going to be FLOODED over the next 6-8 months.  The auctions are going to be overflowing and dealerships with cash will be getting flooded with great deals.   Theyre going to TRY to sell them at the regular price at first, but if they can't move them, they'll be dropping prices (as they can't send them to auction). \n\nA few months from now will be a really good time to buy a used car. \nIf the prices of used cars drop, its going to hurt new car sales, so the manufacturers will likely be throwing around incentives left and right.  \nIf demand slows AND supply increases (hertz) it will be a perfect storm.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nice.

People also refresh their phones way more frequently than they do cars. Price gap between ICE and EV is too great, both when you buy and when you do repairs.\n* Everyone has an outlet at home to charge their phones. An EV charging network is nowhere near as expansive as gas stations, and self-charging is reliant on home-ownership. Can't have your own charging station if you're not a homeowner, and even then, you probably have to have a SFH\n* The smartphone changed the function of the generic phone. Now you can do everything with your phone, and stay connected everywhere. Fundamental use of a car is from point A to point B. Only functional change with EV is charging aspect (refer to point 2). Only way ICE will be irrelevant is the coming of fully automated driving, but that will take years, and isn't even necessarily exclusive to ICE (don't quote me on this, just a guess)\n\nI'm sure there's more reasons, but these are the ones off the top of my head. ICE vehicles are here to stay, for at least another decade", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "To your first point, When you look at the overall performance and quality of Tesla vehicles compared to ICE vehicles, Tesla owners are more satisfied with their vehicles than any other car. Therefore, they are prices higher than most typical sedans. But the prices are coming down steadily over time. A model 3 is now $37,990 ($33,690 when you account for gas savings). I understand that this isn't a reasonable price for everybody, so some people are gonna choose ICE vehicles for this reason, which is fine. However, we are only going to see decrease in costs over time as companies invest in R&D efforts. EV manufacturing is nowhere near perfect yet and it will take years for prices to get down to the same as Honda Civics, or Camrys. \n\n--------------------------\n\nI don't understand your second point at all. Yeah I agree EV charging is nowhere near as expensive as fueling your gas tank but I don't see how that's a negative for EVs??\n\n-----------------------\n\nAnd you're right, EV's don't change the function of cars. I do think that autonomous driving is closer to being a reality than people expect, but it's still speculation at this point. I haven't heard any talk of autonomy with ICE vehicles but it might be possible??\n\nHowever, while EV's don't inherently alter the function of cars (despite better performance metrics), they do provide value to our environment. I know that not everybody has the capacity to care about climate change, but as people in my generation (I'm 19) get older and buy their first car, the overall % of people who will be swayed due to their fears of climate change will be a significant demand push towards purchasing EVs. Also, as government's wake up to the importance of electrification (such as Biden's $2 trillion climate plan) they will (hopefully) implement more incentives towards Evs.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "So I think you're debating a different thing than I am. I completely agree with you about EV satisfaction being much higher and EVs being better for the environment. I also agree with you that EVs are much better than ICEs. But I think there needs to be a distinction between what people want and what people can afford. \n\nYou can very easily get a new ICE for 18k, or a used but reliable one for 10k. When I was looking to buy last year, the cheapest EV was 30k and it was so small - I ended up getting a nicer used ICE in that price range. \n\nTo even compete with the cost of ICEs, costs for EVs would have to be cut in half, and this is when EV margins are already razor thin. While it may be eventually possible, it's not going to happen any time soon\n\nFor the charging network, I said exp**a**nsive, not exp**e**nsive. Meaning that if my EV is losing charge, there's not many places I can go to conveniently to charge it. Sure major cities in the US might have great networks, but what about more rural ones? Or other countries that don't have the infrastructure necessary?\n\nTrue and demonstrable autonomous driving has only been achieved by Tesla so far. That's one company. I'm sure companies like cruise and waymo will come out with great stuff soon. But even then, regulations aren't going to be changed overnight. There will be a lot of legislation that needs to written to even ALLOW automated driving. And inevitably, when the first fatal autonomous driving accident happens, this will push it back that much more", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Okay I see what you're saying. Yes, price is going to be an issue for a while. I believe that at Tesla's price point, no car compares to their value. However, there's speculation that Tesla will come out with a 2 seater in the next 5 years or so that will be at a 20k ish price point. A lot of people don't need more than 2 seats in their car and this price would be compelling for such people. \n\nAlso I just read through Biden's climate plan and two things that he plans to do are funding a national EV charging station and reinstating federal tax credits to help lower the cost of EVs for middle class people. It might take a while for EVs to be affordable for every car owner, but at least we're seeing sequential improvements. \n\n------------\n\nAs for autonomy: hopefully tesla is about to prove that their autonomous driving is significantly safer than human driving (which it is supposed to be) and regulators will be forced to approve them.
