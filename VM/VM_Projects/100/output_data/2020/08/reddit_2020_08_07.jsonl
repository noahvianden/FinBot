{"title": "Fastly - Some Myths Cleared Here", "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do?\n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case.\n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n1. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling.\n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 1: Some of you are hellbent on debating that MSFT will use Azure to provide CDN service for Tiktok. Take a look at this link to see a list of Azure CDN customers**\n\n[https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customers](https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customers)\n\nHow many do you recognize? More importantly, how many do you think are critically dependent on cold start time?  Short answer is that except Adobe, HP, Heineken, and Maersk, I do not recognize others.  I will rest my case here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 2: Here is why MSFT will not care about moving Tiktok to Azure**\n\nFrom Fastly's 10Q  and shareholder letter published on August 7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Revenue for Q2, 2020 = $74.66MM\n* Revenue for Q1, 2020= $82.92MM\n* Revenue guidance from the chief: $290-300MM for FY2020\n* Tiktok's contribution to this revenue: 12% of $300MM = $36MM\n\nNow, think about this #---> $36MM is what MSFT would have to pay Fastly if they are going to continue using them this year. Of course this number will get compounded every year with the Tiktok's growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you really convinced that a $1.6T market cap behemoth  is interested in saving $36MM per year for an acquisition that they will be paying north of $60-65BB to Bytedance? I mean, really? This is a drop in the bucket for MSFT. Tech spends more than that much money on free food for employees. If they were really thinking about cutting costs, you would have observed it from their other practices. I will not go any further than this statement.\n\nAgain, this is my perspective. You can believe what you want to, but I tried to give you a well documented reason behind why MSFT will not pursue Azure for Tiktok.", "id": "i5nb19", "created_utc": 1596838317.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Hello knowledgeable cloud dude\n\nCan you please give your opinion of compute@edge.

Now, I'm totally not into WWE but I have a friend who is so diehard it makes me worried. He told me there was a WWE event in another city not too far away and asked if I wanted to go. I said sure. Why the fk not. I used to watch when I was in middle school. I go, and I proceed to have the most insane white trash time of my life, mind you I'm asian. First off, I get totally obliterated and I'm just screaming my ass off the entire time. That part was great. But the part that blew me away was when I went to the merch stand. You will not believe how much cash money I saw getting shilled out for merch by people who look like they do not exactly have a lot of money. And these products were extremely subpar in quality, made from China bullshit. I proceed to purchase a glowing unicorn horn thing that was like $15. Totally worth it. \n\nAnyhoodles, as we are driving back home (not driving because dammit I'm responsible), my buddy is telling me about their streaming service they're coming with as well as the other brands they have under the WWE company, which is NXT if you did not know. So I don't do any DD. Just pulled the trigger the next day. Stock was like $30 something dollars. The next thing I know, the stock goes on a WrestleMania run nearly tripling in value. I sold at $90.\n\nI just wanted to share this story because I'm trying to get different perspective from other people. I ask everyone.
