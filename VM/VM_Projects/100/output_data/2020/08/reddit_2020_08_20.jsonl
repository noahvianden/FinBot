Accumulated 12 shares within past weeks and I plan to have 20 shares before the split. I plan to save this for 4-8 years and keep adding to it, and hopefully buy a small house and move out. I figured I'm still young enough to aim big and these 20 shares isnt too crazy of an amount ( a lot ot me though) but i think this is the best path to wealth accumulation.

I only buy stocks and hold.\n\n[Here are my percent gains](https://imgur.com/R5Ryk0Y). Certainly nothing to brag about! But it's a good visualization of how diversifying is actually bringing down my gains from TSLA. \n\nThe question you have to ask is if your money could do better elsewhere. If so, jump on that.\n\nARKK is actively managed, they eke out more green days than red. It's filled with stocks like TSLA that are ready to break out. I think it's important to hold some ARKK in case it breaks out, and I don't have the time or interest to research everything in their portfolio. Cathie seems like a goddamn genius and I trust her decisions. I'm only 15% ARKK, the rest TSLA.\n\nMy mentor (a retired stock broker of 40+ years) says a rotation is happening/about to happen from tech sectors to recovery sectors. He mentioned airlines, since they are cheap right now, and will likely come back. I think it's a sure bet, but it will take too much time for too little reward. TSLA could 3x-6x by the time the airlines reach pre-pandemic levels. I dunno.\n\nWarren Buffett only invests in what he understands. I think you are doing that, and it's a good thing. He also prepares for more than one disaster hitting at a time, though.

I thikn my move is pretty risky in that TSLA fails, i lose all my money but im willing to bet they outperform and stay relevant. I apoglogize if my financial thoughts aren't the most analytical as I'm not a very good businessman but i know a good company when i see one. \n\nand on ur last question: i think buying each week is an awesome idea. On dips, just buy more. I'm just doing a mix of lump sum and DCA. Aggressive DCA i suppose; split my purchases in different days all within a week. Lump sum wins like 60% of the time according to this Vanguard article i read.

{"title": "Macro DD, since no one has posted the correct take yet.", "selftext": "So, what's the deal with the market? Why does nothing make sense? Why is Jim Cramer losing his mind every day?\n\n\nWell, Jim Cramer is wrong about the market this time. Here's why. \n\n\n**In 2008**, the sky fell because the banks took the hit directly when consumer prosperity faltered. In the legendary video of Cramer losing his mind about the fed policy back in 2007, he gives us a clue about why the situation in 2020 is different. (For the uninitiated, here's a link, turn down sound lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVXh4xM-Ww&t=91s )\n\n\n**What's different now?** This time, the fed is funneling infinite liquidity through the economy to the banks, and to the corporations who were above junk bond rating in March. Back in 2007, the hit went right to the top, but this time, all of the large caps and big banks are being treated as 'too big to fail', so only the small cap stuff, individuals, mom and pop shops, and the rest take the hit. All of this extra money being pumped into the economy through jobless peoples' bank accounts into cash registers, and these 'un-failable' institutions, is playing a game of musical chairs where the *only places* they have left to sit are in rich, still employed, peoples' pockets.\n\n\n**How it used to work pre-corona.** The big guys have, for years, dominated several markets that are walled off from us mortals to get consistent returns, without having to stick their neck out. Namely, the safe municipal bond markets, with their 5-10% returns, which can pretty much only be bought via bloomberg terminal chat, and secondly, corporate bonds. Both of these markets, in addition to treasuries and interest bearing accounts, are completely up in smoke at this point. Cities and towns are broke, and if the fed is having to buy the big corp bonds, what do you think the prospects are on non-prime firms' bonds?\n\n\n**So what's left?** The big guys have all of this fresh liquidity pouring in from JPow's printer, but their old stand-bys are gone.\n\n\n**There are three main routes left** that can still net them the gains they demand: equity in the companies on JPow's list, companies with large holdings by influential VC firms, and property.\n\n\n**1. The too-big-to-fail crowd.** Here's the official list of firms whose paper JPow is eating up: [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalreserve.gov%2Fpublications%2Ffiles%2Fsmccf-transaction-specific-disclosures-8-10-20.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalreserve.gov%2Fpublications%2Ffiles%2Fsmccf-transaction-specific-disclosures-8-10-20.xlsx)\n\n\nEver heard of any of them? lol\n\n\n**2. VC backed firms.** Uber posts $2B losses every quarter and lost its license in its homestate, and is *still* sitting pretty with its massive market cap. I mean, just look at snapchat. These firms with heavy VC investment in them basically have their own little Fed made out of silicon valley billionaires.\n\n\n**3. And finally, the last option for the big guys: property.** We don't want to look at homebuyer sentiment here. You and me know that everyone outside of the while collar crowd and tradesmen are losing their shirts rn. What we want to look at is home *building* sentiment, which is sky high. People with a bunch of cash that they're looking to do something with are the ones who *build* homes, and snatch existing properties with cash, or with secured lines of credit. Back in 2008, everybody was losing their homes, mom and pop landlords were losing their minds, so how did the mess get cleaned up? Per NYTimes: \n> \"Before 2010, institutional landlords didn\u2019t exist in the single-family-rental market; now there are 25 to 30 of them, according to Amherst Capital, a real estate investment firm. From 2007 to 2011, 4.7 million households lost homes to foreclosure, and a million more to short sale. Private-equity firms developed new ways to secure credit, enabling them to leverage their equity and acquire an astonishing number of homes.\" \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/magazine/wall-street-landlords.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/magazine/wall-street-landlords.html)\n\n\nSo what does this mean? Long construction materials producers, suppliers, and whatever else this construction money runs through, like HD, LOW, ANGI, MAS. Look at HD and LOW earnings, they absolutely *crushed* the estimates. Angie's list, even with the jobsites closed for a couple of months saw revenue up, and marketplace growth.

The reason is simple as you've stated the market is supported by a few companies and loads are still in the dumps. When these companies rise from the dead in a few months/years when covid fears are gone and econ recovery is on track what do you think will happen to the indexes ?\n\nWe now know covid was blown out of proportion, govnt around the world lockdowned for no apparent profit, in fact most economies went into recession because of it, so it's a manmade recession unlike the last 2 ones which were financial recessions. Even tho the fed & co blatantly pumped the market and didn't let much company fail, there's still record bankruptcies out there. That's a lot of loss of jobs but also loss of shitty businesses that were a drag either way, new businesses will emerge from that, and by that i mean market share gained for some or straight up new businesses. Unfortunately there's a lot of small biz in there. These small biz will come back in time tho because right now it's max fear for them still.\n\n\nThere's an insane amount of governance uncertainty over covid right now. There's people saying NYC will never be the same, it will never rebound etc. and for now that's true, the city seems to be a ghost of it's former self. That's all a load of bologna. NYC will be back, maybe not as roaring as it's been after 2009 but it'll come back, the countless small biz will reopen and things will get better.\n\n\nCovid clearly showed the weaknesses of some (lots) of companies and the market punished them for it since the fed didn't let them fail/get shitty rates on their bonds, it also showed clear strenghts in some names and the market rewarded them for it.\n\nFor example aapl sold bonds in early may and got this : for the three-year, Apple is paying 0.75%; 1.125% for the five-year; and 1.65% and 2.65% for 10- and 30-year bonds, respectively\n\n2.65 on 30 year bond, that's barely double the 30 US treasury yield.\n\nAAPL now has the yield of the US 10 Year bond and \"finally\" a tech company P/E ~35.

Here's a little chunk of a previous post I wrote:\n\nI would say, yes, the ARK valuation is more than justified and in fact is probably on the low side. Their bear case was based on a market share decline, that did not happen. They are building three of the near-largest factories that the world has ever seen simultaneously. They are already planning four after those ones. They have, in all likelihood, dry cell battery technology that they're going into production with to make their own batteries -- that means that their manufacturing speed will dramatically increase and their square footage to manufacture will be dramatically reduced compared to all other manufacturers. IOW, they're going to corner the battery market.\n\nWell let's ignore vehicles and just assume that the supposition about battery day is correct -- and it's a reasonable supposition. What percentage of the vehicle battery market can Tesla get? I believe LG's goal was to get to 170GWh of battery production -- in a few YEARS. Tesla will have 1000GWh and fairly soon. And since they're faster to make [since they're dry cell], they'll be cheaper. GM is building a plant with LG to make 30GWh of batteries. That's a joke.\n\nSo forget cars, Tesla would potentially have 80% of the battery market. And that ignores their other business segments. Since all cars sold will be EV's, that's like building car engines for 80% of the cars in the world. Let's say $4k a car for the battery, and there are 60 million units sold worldwide, that's $192 billion gross per year for Tesla.

{"title": "TSLA red tomorrow as options pushing stock up expire", "selftext": "**Unusual Tesla Option Trades Pushing Stock Higher And Higher\nToday 1:31 PM ET (Benzinga) Print**\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) once again traded sharply higher by 6.2% on Thursday, briefly touching the $2,000 level, despite no major news from the company.\n\nTesla shares are now up 77% in the past year as the company has made a profit in four straight quarters, and some say strange option trading activity could be driving the recent gains.\n\nThe Trades: On Thursday, Tesla\u2019s sharp intraday rise coincided with large trading volume in some significantly out-of-the-money Tesla call options expiring on Friday.\n\n\u201cActually\u2026 someone is buying a LOT of 8/21 $2,100 call options,\u201d GLJ Research founder Gordon Johnson told Benzinga. \u201cThis has been going on a LOT (i.e., someone buying way out of the money short-dated call options, which forces the person writing these options to buy stock), which has pushed the stock up consistently.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, there were 55,616 contracts worth of volume in Tesla $2,000 call options expiring Friday and 22,892 contracts worth of volume on Friday $2,100 call options. The $2,000 strike price contracts and the $2,100 contracts have open interests of 14,798 and 5,091, respectively.\n\nUpward Spiral: Stanphyl Capital Partners portfolio manager and Tesla short seller Mark Spiegel has also recently noticed the strange trading activity in the Tesla option market.\n\n\u201cSome entity \u2014 I don\u2019t know who \u2014 was executing a strategy of buying massive quantities of out-of-the-money call options,\u201d Spiegel said of Tesla\u2019s huge run in 2020.\n\nThis strategy forced call option sellers to buy Tesla shares to cover their positions, according to Spiegel.\n\n\u201cThis thing just kind of spiraled its way up,\u201d he said.\n\nTSLA 3100 calls expiring tomorrow bid pic.twitter.com/7Xl2ci3g52\n\n\u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 20, 2020\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take: There are plenty of explanations for Tesla\u2019s insane run in 2020, including strange option trading, short squeezes, profits from regulatory credit sales, a spike in inexperienced Robinhood retail traders and the stock's inclusion in the S&P 500. However, the ultimate metrics that will define Tesla\u2019s success or failure in the long-term are auto sales and earnings growth.", "id": "idf0js", "created_utc": 1597945485.0, "score": 147, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\"Some entity\" = WSB", "score": 232, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cSpiraled it\u2019s way up\u201d\n\nSpiral entity confirmed", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "It's always spirals\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/gallery/y6mqS\n\nI hope you slept already.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s was really weird", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15108686685562134}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5808460712432861}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13987770676612854}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0772913470864296}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "So buy calls tomorrow to get jacked to the tits in tendies?

(TSLA) recently announced a 5-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for each shareholder of record on Aug. 21. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.\n\n\nIf you own shares of TSLA before the market open on Aug. 31 you will own five shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fifth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of TSLA trading at $1,500 per share, after the split you will own 500 shares valued at $300 per share. Likewise, if you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.\n\n\nIf you sell TSLA shares after the record date of Aug. 21 for TSLA but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading TSLA, Aug. 28 you sell 100 TSLA shares for a pre-split market price of $1,500 per share you will receive $150,000. You will not receive any split shares.\n\n\nIf you buy TSLA shares after the record dates but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $1,500 per share, you will pay $150,000.

{"title": "Cornering Silver Market", "selftext": "Would you like to entertain yourself with a story about one of the greatest schemes in the history and, maybe, learn a few plays? This story is about three brave autistic brothers, who almost cornered the entire commodity and how one (not so brave, but shrewd) bank did it without anyone noticing. As in any good fable \u2013 there\u2019s a moral and a strategy that you could draw from it.\n\nThe year is 1971. Nixon temporarily abolishes gold standard. And every temporary government program is never reversed, as you know. Trading price of gold went sky high: from 270s to 800s in two years or so. Enter Hunt brothers, sons of H. L. Hunt, oil tycoon, one of, if not the, richest man in the world at that time. Hunt family was, what one might describe as, right-wing libertarian and anti-globalist. They believed that Keynesian economics and the US shift to the left in the 60s will lead to the debasement of the US dollar and monetary collapse. Thus, return to the gold or silver standard was the way, as they thought. Allegedly, Hunts also had a feud with Rothschild family and other financial speculators, and were resentful towards the US government for doing nothing to protect their oil assets in Libya, confiscated by Gaddafi. So they started their move against America, alpha-silver bug style.\n\nIn 1973 Hunts began buying all the silver they could. And, instead of just speculating futures contracts, they actually took delivery. Initial price was $1.5/oz. Silver was shipped to Switzerland in secretive and costly operations and stored in vaults (brothers feared confiscations \u2013 remember, private citizens were still prohibited from owning gold in the US).\n\nThe following events are quite vivid and include the efforts to create a cartel similar to OPEC, talks with Iran and Saudi monarchs, pump and dump publicity and large scale purchases of miners. But we will spare the details, except one: Hunts even tried to corner the soy market at the same time. Reminds you how WSB slv gang quickly switched to corn gang. But the soy scheme didn't fly and they focused on silver only. Their efforts pumped the price to almost $50/oz by early 1980. At some point Hunts controlled around 230 million oz of silver and the majority of what was traded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hunt brothers laughing at your pump&dump effort](https://preview.redd.it/sywtej0at8i51.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=2df6d38a1c447e4bcd40b99cb71771be688f53c6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, when you are such a smart ass, you become a target. Chicago exchange officials became very concerned citizens by 1979. They started issuing numerous regulations limiting the amount of market share one can accumulate in one hands. As all American concerned citizens, they had financial incentive to do so: Hunts managed to prove that Chicago exchange board members had short positions against silver. Finally, CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) issued a ruling that basically forced Hunts to liquidate part of their portfolio by February 1980. This sent silver prices down dramatically and brothers started to get margin calls which they could not cover. And so their story ended with bankruptcies and heavy fines for the family. Shortly after, Reagan and Volcker raised interest rates and silver price never recovered to $50/oz ever since.\n\nWe skip to the year 2008. Global financial crisis is in full swing. Bear Stearns is royally fucked, as due to all bears. Before the music was over, they mastered paper speculation of futures contracts like no one else. Bear Stearns accumulated world biggest naked short position on silver. What could go wrong? Stonks go up, silver goes down. Until it reversed and silver skyrocketed from $11 to $21. This became one of the margin calls to screw Bear Stearns. JP Morgan is asked by the FED and co. to buy out BS and to save the entire market. Since BS's shorts are now deeply down - JPM gets the whole bank with pennies on a dollar.\n\nBut the problem is that JPM themselves have massive naked short position on silver. Combined with BS it will exceed anything permitted by the CFTC. Since Obama administration was in a rush, they push CFTC to grant JPM basically a carte blanche to accumulate any position over the limit for a period of time. Period of time comes due and turns out that JPM not only didn\u2019t trim the shorts significantly \u2013 they even bought more shorts at some point. Even with all the fines, it went very much their way, because in 2009 silver dropped. So they pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBut come 2011 and silver spiked again, dramatically. JPM, now bleeding cash on shorts, could close short positions, like any of us would do, right? Nope, fuckyall says JPM and starts hedging short futures positions with\u2026 physical silver. 'But wouldn\u2019t that be even more control over the commodity?' - you might ask. See, nothing in the rules of CFTC says you can\u2019t do that, because to help cronies speculate with paper futures contracts, made of thin air, CFTC basically started treating physical silver and futures as two different instruments (it\u2019s, actually, even more complicated than that: google difference between physical, eligible, registered and so on).\n\nIn the next 9 years JPM becomes the world biggest holder of both short contracts and physical silver. The later they 'loaned' to SLV trust, of which they are custodian. This way upkeep of physical silver, which otherwise would be a liability for hedging, becomes an asset, because we, retards, who own SLV pay the maintenance. People are often confused here, because SLV is issued by Black Rock, not JPM. Well, there is a difference between being an operator of a financial instrument and being a custodian providing backing. Now, to confuse you even more \u2013 JPM is one of the major holders of Black Rock itself with 1.6% or sth like that.\n\nBy estimates of Theodore Butler, JPM acquired 900 million oz of physical silver since 2011. That\u2019s 4 times more than what Hunts owned. Just shows you, that banks can get a pass with something that even the richest individuals can not. And you have to give it to JPM - their play was very clever. Instead of risking it all on a margin call, they make money on every turn.\n\nAs of 2020, JPM still holds both shitton of physical silver and short COMEX contracts. You can call this the most epic straddle of all time. With such mass they can swing prices in any directions and profit from this on any given day. Latest example you\u2019ve seen on the August 11th.\n\nWhy am I bothering your poor gambling soul with this wall of text, you might ask? Market makers manipulate the market as they please, what\u2019s new about that? Well, here we come to the conclusions and a strategy. How can a small retard replicate what the big boys are doing?\n\nConclusions:\n\n1. There will not be a linear up or down with silver and the swings might be dramatic. The reason being not only the sentiment of investors, but the ease of manipulation that is eligible to big players.\n2. If we believe that speculation will throw the price of silver in all directions \u2013 it is unwise to go only long or short on silver, especially on a short term;\n\nWhat shall we do?\n\na) Only long expiration dates and calls; no weekly expiration, not even monthly. Ideally \u2013 at least half year options;\n\nb) Go long on certain silver stocks. Maybe I\u2019ll do a write up on good silver stocks to buy;\n\nc) Sell covered calls on long positions;\n\nd) Buy 1-3 month puts on your long positions as a hedge;\n\nNow, day trade with those positions: on red days sell your puts and buy back covered calls. On green days \u2013 reload puts and sell calls. Repeat until lambo.\n\nP. S.: I gathered these facts from the open sources, since these events were of interest to me. Some facts are intentionally oversimplified, google for more details, there are good reads. And feel free to correct me if you know contradictory facts.\n\nP. P.

He is a 11 year old Boxer named Diesel and he has a lot of skin tags and other lumps, so we did what pet owners do and took him to get looked at. He checked out, but the Vet told us to keep an eye on them. The one on his love nub  used to be a lot smaller but last week it started to grow and the bump on his man lump turned from a healthy pink to a nasty purple so last  week so we took him back to the Vet to get it checked out. the Vet tells us that its a infected  mast cell tumor and after the infection goes down they can biopsy it but its going to be anywhere from $1300-$1500. so if you are reading this THANK YOU PAPA MUSK FOR THE STOCK SPLIT HYPE IT'S SAVING MY DOG'S DICK!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: added dick pic\n\nEdit Edit: wow this blew up.....thanks so much for the love you beautiful autisit i never thought more people would know about my dog's dick than know I exist.
