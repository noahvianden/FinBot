{"title": "The technical background to Intel's problems.", "selftext": " \n\nSince its\u2019 Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its\u2019 next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who\u2019ve been paying attention. Today I\u2019d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they\u2019ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future.\n\n**Lithography techniques**\n\nLithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [\\[1\\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).\n\nOver time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area \u2013 this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\\[2\\]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you\u2019re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to \u2018print\u2019 the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn\u2019t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem \u2013 patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its\u2019 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its\u2019 10nm process.\\[3\\] Meanwhile, its\u2019 competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. \\[4\\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice\u2026\n\nOther terminology I\u2019ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together)\n\n**The problems with 10nm**\n\nBack in 2013, Intel was in it\u2019s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its\u2019 chips \u2013 every two years you would have a die shrink \u2018tick\u2019, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change \u2018tock\u2019. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next \u2018tock\u2019 of 10nm in 2016. The \u2018tick\u2019 \u2013 Skylake architecture came, but the \u2018tock\u2019 never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn\u2019t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 \u2013 but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the \u2018mass-market\u2019 generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel\u2019s own 14nm offerings. \\[5\\] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 \u2013 but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn\u2019t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it \u2013 you\u2019re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm \u2013 this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it\u2019s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD\u2019s chiplet approach, built on TSMC\u2019s less defect-prone EUV process. \n\n(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)  \n\n\nSince you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that \n\n1) they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS\n\n2) The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD\u2019s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. \n\nThese are bold statements but I believe Intel\u2019s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.\n\nWhen you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be \u2018better\u2019 than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can\u2019t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture \\[6\\], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would\u2019ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete \u2013 there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its\u2019 double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm \\[7\\] \u2013 not to mention AMD\u2019s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.\\[8\\] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on \u201810nm+++\u2019, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken.\n\n**7nm and beyond**\n\nSo now we\u2019ve established just how much of a disaster Intel\u2019s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its\u2019 built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel\u2019s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the \u20186 month delay\u2019 in 7nm rollout. While I don\u2019t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were \u2018we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm\u2026 12 months behind our internal target\u2026 we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation\u2019. \n\nThere\u2019s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob\u2019s claim of a \u2018buffer in planning process\u2019 as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed \u2013 running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don\u2019t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process \u2013 that\u2019s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob\u2019s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they\u2019re going to breach industry standard and \u2018launch\u2019 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel \u2018launched\u2019 Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.\\[9\\] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake \u2018launched\u2019. This \u20186-month\u2019 delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays).\n\nThe second part of the comment, relating to a \u2018defect mode\u2019, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. \\[10\\] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history \u2013 the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a \u2018working prototype\u2019 demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \\[11\\] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. \n\n\\[12\\] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the \u2018defect mode\u2019 Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.\n\nBeyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/) As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its\u2019 own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html) \n\n\\[2\\][Dennard,  R., Gaensslen, F., Hwa-Nien Yu, Rideout, V., Bassous, E. and Leblanc,  A., 1999.

Same thing happened to AMD when they spun off Global Foundries.\n\nThere's also a big issue with executives thinking they can hire their way to innovation and fire their way to profitability.  It's an open secret in the tech industry that the more senior you become, the more likely you are to be fired due to the salary you command.  The way the bean counters see it is \"Hey, these senior folks are costing us a lot of money, lets bring on a bunch of cheap interns, train them with the seniors, and then fire the seniors.\"\n\nThe problem?  It takes YEARS to gain the experience needed to approach what (some) senior tech people are providing in value.  Further, people aren't fungible like bean counters think they are.  The fact is that a junior tech person is going to deliver a far lower quality product than a senior person.  Bean counters don't give a shit about that.  They think they can compensate by hiring 10x the juniors.

Now this might all sound a bit pedantic, but the reason I bring it up is that it means that moving from tri-gate to GaaFET is actually much less of a technological leap than going from FinFET to GaaFET, which is already much less of a leap than going from a classical MOSFET to FinFET. Moving forward it's really anyone's guess if any nodes further than 7nm will actually be possible, we're approaching some serious fundamental physical limits with Si and so it will be exciting to see where the industry goes. I'm not sure where the transistor industry is with the adoption of wide bandgap semiconductors but if scaling picks up with those we could eventually see considerably smaller devices in the future. The other billion dollar engineering problem is heat management, processors have been stuck at or around the 4 GHz mark for years now due to the inability of Si to dissipate heat at higher frequencies. Whether this is achieved through new materials (once again wide bandgap SCs like SiC do this much better) or exotic materials processing (thermal bandgap materials are an interesting new area of research) I think building transistors that can operate faster may be the path the tech development takes in the future.\n\nAnyways I'm rambling, I don't get to talk this stuff too often and thought you might appreciate these thoughts.

The current challenge with thermal bandgap materials is that materials often have several different phonon wavelengths that can exist in the material, so if you make a film with thickness equal to one phonon wavelength it won't likely block phonons with a different wavelength.

The perfect cpu is one that can handle workload quickly, uses very little power, takes up very little space, and costs very little. The technology that's used to get there will be a combination of techniques. There is no one solution that will solve this problem and customers don't care how the problem was solved. \n\nThe technical issues you're discussing places too much emphasis on the \"tick\" to solve the problem of handling workload quickly with lower power. A fixation on only one key aspect of cpu design occurred in the early 2000s when everyone promoted the idea that the cpu with the highest clock rate would be the fastest cpu. People were predicting cpus would be 10-20 gigahertz in the future. Unfortunately they hit a wall around 4gigahertz (i forget exactly where) and the increase in clock no longer correlated with decrease in processing time. What changed the mentality of the whole industry was a new cpu architecture that was significantly faster and used less power. We are on like the 10th or something generation of that initial iteration. \n\nAnyway, I'm just pointing out a brief example that you're a little too focused on lithography. There are a ton of many other factors like the fact that cpus are so fast now that people can use 10 year old pcs and still get their basic computing needs accomplished so there is a diminishing rate of return for producing the the fastest cpu on the market. There is also the decline of the consumer PC market as people start to utilize mobile devices. The upside is that it draws in new demand for server CPUs with higher profit margins but they lose out on a lot of volume.

Even though Tesla continues to grow rapidly, to the many investors who don't understand the relationship of stock price, market cap, and growth, the high price for a share means TSLA is \"too expensive\". So using a share split to reduce the price per share means that many of these \"next Tesla\" investors will buy TSLA instead of the alternatives.\n\nTesla was likely thinking of a share split anyway, but the recent increase in reverse mergers /  IPOs and investor reaction to them likely encouraged Tesla to accelerate the timing of the split to take advantage of the opportunity and become more competitive relative to their rivals.

My understanding is that when I sell a put, I get paid a premium (credit) when someone buys it.  Does that premium go immediately into my account's available cash?  Or is it somehow tied up in the position?  For example, if I sell a put contract at $1, do I immediately get $100 cash deposited in my account?\n\n2. Then my next point of confusion is after I sold the put, my broker shows that I have a position of -1, and the position appears to be worth some dollar amount based on the contract's current price.  What the heck is this?  Why is this position worth some value?  For example, if my -1 position shows it is now worth $50, if I were to close the position, would I make another $50 (ignoring fees)?  And how does that $50 relate to the premium I got when I sold the put?  Is the $50 added to the premium I got when selling it, making my total profit $150 ($100 premium + $50 when closing the position)?  Can this position value ever exceed the premium?  Can it ever go negative?  If it can go negative and went way negative, could it exceed the premium I got, resulting in a net loss when the position is closed?\n\n3. Next, why do I even have to \"close\" this position at all?  I already got my $100 premium, right?  Can't I just forget about the contract, let it expire and move on?  I realize that I'm on the hook to buy 100 shares if the buyer exercises it, but if it expires, what happens to the value of the position (discussed in question 2 above)?  Does the broker just keep it or something?  Would I still keep the premium?\n\n4. Last, let's take a hypothetical situation where there are only 2 people in the universe.  I sell one put contract to the other person and collect my premium.  I now have a -1 position on my broker.  Next, before the contract either expires or is exercised, I decide to close the position.  Would it even be possible?  I would have to buy 1 put to get back to 0, but remember that there is only 1 other person in this universe, and we already have a contract and he doesn't want to give it up.

There might be higher profit potential in better bid-ask but where does it add value to the long naked option contract?\n\nA narrow spread is more cost efficient. Compare a $1.00/$1.02 spread to a $1.00/$2.00 spread.  If you buy at the asking price and immediately turn around and sell at the bid, you lose more money with the wider spread. No one actually does this in practice, but it illustrates why a wider spread is detrimental. \n\nIn practice, the further the bid and ask are from your ideal price, the longer it will take to get a fill, because there is less competitive pressure to make better offers. The guy asking for $2 doesn't have to worry about being underbid by someone who wants the trade more.\n\nWhen you are closing a trade, let's say $1.50 or higher is profitable vs. the $1/$2 spread. That's a pretty big $0.50 gap to for buyers to leap and you may wait a long time to make a profitable close.\n\nPricing models like BSM influence the market, but ultimately it's the market who makes the final determination on price. If there are only 3 orders out there defining prices (very low volume), it's not going to resemble the BSM or other pricing model very closely.\n\n> 2) Just checking again: Also for monthly long options, the volume one month before exp might be low but I can expect this volume to increase as it gets closer to exp right?\n\nVolume is more strongly related to moneyness than expiration, though beyond 60 days it does fall off for all strikes. The ATM strike for a popular underlying will have good volume all the way out to 60 days and beyond.\n\n> 3) Is there a way to normalize IV with vega or some other option metric? So instead of using IV tank or percentile, is there a way get a number from IV, vega, and the premium that I can use to compare with other options?\n\nWell, maybe. Vega is highest ATM and furthest from expiration (declines as you approach expiration). The charts in this PDF help visualize how vega works: http://people.math.gatech.edu/~shenk/OptionsClub/vegaTalk.pdf\n\nJust like for theta, the impact of IV and vega declines as the extrinsic value declines, so if you take the same delta strike across the comparison -- that's critically important, since moneyness is a key factor for vega and IV -- and compare extrinsic value/|vega|, that might give you a somewhat useful comparison. The problem is that it might just be encoding moneyness and you end up with the same information as delta/dollar.\n\nWhy not just use IVR?

One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.\n\nFor Chinese companies\u2014such as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.\u2014that want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm \u201cwith comparable resources and experience\u201d that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.\n\nThe new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.\n\nDetails of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President\u2019s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6.
