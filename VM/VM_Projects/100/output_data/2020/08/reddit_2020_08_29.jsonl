They have many business problems that a lot of people don't talk about, and which get suppressed or downvoted in social media due to the cult love of the Netflix service.  \n\nOne is that they're insane when it comes to spending.  Studios normally live or die on a razor's edge of miserly budgeting and surgical decision making on which projects to approve, sometimes inching forward only a couple episodes or shoots at a time.\n\nMeanwhile Netflix approves anything and everything, tests nothing, doesn't negotiate, they just flood creators with lottery jackpots of money.  For content creators, it's been heaven, but it's not even close to sustainable.  You simply can't make money giving guys $60 million for 3 standup routines.  Any \"real\" studio that approved every pitch and outbid every distributor by 10x would be bankrupted in 3 seconds.  \n\nSo the obvious question: why isn't Netflix bankrupt? Well, technically, they sort of *are*.  Insolvency is when your debt obligations exceed your ability to pay them, and by Netflix's numbers, that's where they are currently.  Netflix has massive, massive debt, that's very unpopular to mention to fans, and also to Wall Street guys, because, as the top of this story states, Netflix is a darling of the stock market guys.\n\nContrary to popular misrepresentation, Netflix is NOT actually profitable.  How can it be?  They give people $100+ worth of entertainment for $10.  They push dozens of dollars worth of rich digital bits to you for far less than the raw data even costs to send.  \n\nTheir debt is so large, Forbes estimated that at current rates, they'd need 100 years to pay it off, but only if they stopped borrowing.  Except they're *not* ceasing to borrow.  They're taking on *more* debt.  \n\nSo why don't people realize this?  Well, they've been good at using funky accounting to downplay the debt and make it seem like some abstract future problem not to be worried about.  They claim to be technically \"profitable\" which is all the wall street guys want to hear.  They hope nobody notices the huge operational losses.  And people, especially fans and Wall Street, tend to hear what they want to hear.  (See also: Tesla)\n\nAnd unlike other businesses, Netflix can't just adopt regular price increases to slow those losses.  Whenever they try to raise prices, subscribers get skittish.  Last year they experimented in some test market with price hikes to see if it might slow growth.  But it was much worse.  It didn't just slow growth, it reversed it.  They lost customers, and they had to abandon the market trials.\n\nThey also have to stop spending insanely.  But now, they almost can't do that either, since they've created the false expectations with content creators.  And worse, they're now bidding against the richest and most evil companies on earth: Disney, Apple, Google, Amazon, AT&T, Facebook, China.  They did this to themselves.\n\nAnother issue is saturation.  Who do you know that doesn't have Netflix already?  The pat answer is \"what about other countries\", but the problem there is the price that other country markets will bear tends to be much lower, which works against Netflix.\n\nNetflix is basically in a race for survival.  They need to outlast the debt that's chasing them and they need to win the land grab of loyal subscribers, then sneak the price upward somehow.  I'd be more confident if they would have opened up a bigger head start back when there was no competition.  Like if they'd gotten closer to break even operations.  But the fact they're still far from true, organic profit and now they have lots of competitors who have bottomless pockets... that's not great for Netflix.\n\nAnother pat answer is \"advertising/freemium/premium\".  But again, they trained subscribers to be fickle.  They trained them to expect thousands of dollars worth of movie rentals for $7.  And having been trained, customers would freak out to see ads.  They already do rebel against trailers and previews.  If Netflix announced commercials, you'd see the mother of all cancel culture uprisings.\n\nAnd Netflix is still free-riding on other company's infrastructure, by virtue of the fact that we all use it over our data plans. If Netflix had to actually bear the true costs of their service  the price would be $15/month PLUS the cost of a high bandwidth account, say $75.  Other than a few token partnerships and squabbles, they've somehow managed to hitchhike by getting providers and consumers to not realize they're subsidizing most of Netflix's overhead.  They've also thus far ducked regulation that squeezes legacy tv providers.\n\nThe one advantage they have is they're still the most loved and respected streaming brand.  And sometimes that's enough.  Apple products have become increasingly overpriced and they cut back features and functions and support and product life constantly.  Still, because they're a beloved brand, they succeed.  That could happen for Netflix.  But they really need to stop overpaying for content and then dumping it in one day, squandering its value.  My guess is they can't win this race, but they'll end up merging with someone who can take the losses and find other ways to make it work.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "What's the problem with users paying for Netflix's data? That's how pretty much all services over the internet work, and it's basically an understanding that the consumer is paying for access to the internet on their end, while NFLX pays for their datacentres and access on the other. Both components add together to maintain the overall internet network.\n\n(I agree with most everything you've said, btw, but this perspective is a bit strange to me)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You have to consider the sheer scale of it.  Netflix uses 30-80% of most people's internet traffic, yet Netflix doesn't pay for that.  The other \"all services\" you reference, like your email or banking web site or whatever use one millionth of one percent.  It's not even close.\n\nUsing the analogy of a road, where individuals and corporations share the public access, it would be as if Netflix hogged every street by running 500 cars wide and you could barely get your bike in between.  Yet they pay nothing for piggishly taking advantage.  We let them.  The providers let them.  \n\nAnd how it's relevant is in the somewhat self-deluding mental gymnastics people use to justify their consumption choices.  \n\nBefore Netflix, movies and entertainment cost something.  Families would spend $20 a week renting a couple of movies or $40 a week visiting cinemas.   To put it in monthly terms, $90-$150/month.  That was sustainable.  Netflix giving 2000 movies for $7/month breaks that, and is not sustainable.  \n\nIt hasn't crumbled yet because of the loss leader land rush of mega corps and investors footing the losses.  But if it ever had to be justified, either the price of Netflix would have to skyrocket, or the quantity of what you get would have to be slashed.  \n\nIt's even more stark with Disney Plus, who are giving away 100 years worth of beloved valuable content for... $3/month.  That's ridiculously unsustainable.  They're pumping easily $20-$30 worth of data bits, let alone the added value of the intellectual property.  Worse, they're training a whole generation of customers that each Disney movie ever made is now worth about 10 cents.  Previously, they'd trained customers that Cinderella or The Lion King were these somehow scarce resources, kept in an imaginary vault, a vault that would only be opened every 12 years and \"giving\" those customers a chance to replace their $25 melted VHS with a $30 DVD, and then replace their $30  scratched DVD with a $35 bluray, and so on, multiplied by 70 films.  Today's kids will never value a Disney movie again, after bingeing them of $3 Disney Plus.\n\nCord cutters are too young and unaware of the current incongruency of it.  So they think getting everything for nothing is normal.  \n\nWhen they do price comparison, they look at a cable bill and say \"it's $100, what a ripoff!\"  They don't realize it's about 80/20 of broadband data to content.  \n\nThen they compare the $100 to Netflix at $7 or $14, conveniently forgetting that to use Netflix, they have to pay for a $75-100 data plan.  A more fair comparison would be to include the cost of a data plan, because Netflix without data is... nothing.  Instead, they fire Netflix as the hero and they hate the cable provider who is actually making it possible.

We pay for the infrastructure separately to the service itself, because it doesn't really make sense for them to be combined.

And where did you get that upvote?  You are trolling me, aren\u2019t you.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Look man, consider the ramifications of what Tesla is and what their goals are. They want to change the world by transitioning it to a sustainable future. The Alien Dreadnought is coming online in China. GigaBerlin and Austin are making major progress. Tesla Semis and Cybertrucks aren't online yet.\n\nThey've had huge success with energy storage in Australia and have contracts for South Australia, UK, Dubai, and California. Their Autobidder software is printing them money. Their battery day is likely to either achieve ~400W/hr or come close to it. Supposedly, they're close to L5 autonomy and may be away from achieving it by at most another year.\n\nThey're production constricted for their power packs, because demand is greater than supply. They are selling every single car they're making and they made a profit in the middle of a black swan event despite having one of their core American plants shut down and then reduced to 30% capacity.\n\nAnd with the Chinese market just unlocked, their sales number in Q3 and Q4 will be quite enlightening via China.\n\nFinally, and *most* importantly. TSLA opened at 442.64 at 9:30a today, and closed at 514.75 by the end of extended hours. The stock went up 72 dollars in a day. A solid 16% gain, and people are going to be buying it in droves to get in on the next run up to 2-4k range per share.\n\nI suspect with all of the above, the stock will break 7-800 by battery day and reach or cross 1k by end of September. Ark investment thinks that their analysis of 7k/share (pre-split) is still valid and are holding on that. If TSLA achieves L5 by end of the year to mid year next, they'll go all in on RoboTaxis. Which is going to eat into Uber and Lyft's market considerably. If L5 autonomy is achieved, you won't need drivers for grubhub or Uber eats style businesses. Customers would be able to directly interact with food services with everything becoming seamless through the car.\n\nAs all these items come online, their stock is going to skyrocket higher and higher. 7k might end up becoming an *average* marker with beyond 7k becoming the next peak.\n\nBut fundamentally, once the stock crosses the ~3k boundary, it becomes out of reach but the biggest hedge funds and banks, which tend to want to short stock than hold them. Equally, 3k and beyond means individual investors can't get in. This means that TSLA will *have* to split their stock again and again and again.\n\nNormally, a company splitting their stock could be viewed negatively because of share dilution, but there's enough evidence to the contrary that with TSLA, it won't matter. The technology, science, software, and vertical integration advantage backed by a philosophy of reinvesting most of the money made back into company and r&d means that they'll become like Nvidia, where they are competing with themselves and not their competition in the market. Ark thinks TSLA's around 3-4 years ahead with their software stack from rest of the automakers, and their battery tech is around the same time scale too.\n\nAnd with the insane demand to be part of the company which is basically uprooting every market it enters via evolutionary changes, there's little that can stop their momentum.\n\nAnd in closing, Elon has said on Twitter that he's got ideas for an eVTOL already, that he *really* wants to do that, but his brain will melt if he tries. Between Tesla, SpaceX, Boring, OpenAI, and Neuralink he's pretty capped. He also said that they'll achieve 500W/kg in 3-4 years. Electric jets are only possible once battery tech crosses ~450W/kg. Tesla will very much likely enter that market 2025-2027, and their energy business will likely overtake their auto business.\n\nSo, they'll have to keep splitting their stock over time. 10 shares becomes 50, then 250, then 1250, then 6250. ***I AM ASSUMING A 5:1 SPLIT EACH TIME, I COULD BE WRONG BUT I'M ROLLING WITH IT.***\n\nPoint is, after just 3 more 5:1 splits, IF the stock still goes up to 5k a share because of all their staggering levels of disruption, you'd be sitting on a multi-million dollar investment. It becomes a long term golden egg. So don't sell your pre-split holdings. It's a 10 year lock and key stock. Only dip into it if you need money for life alerting events. Sell around it or expand it.\n\n*One other point. For *many* Tesla has become an idea of the future promised in the 90s that 2000 and 2010 would be. For *many*, they're now betting on that. You look at other ICE car makers and they're starting to put out EVs, but they're still token EVs. They're business decisions being made for them in a way that doesn't cannibalize their ICE supply chain. People don't want to perpetuate and oil and ICE future. They want an EV future with cars that drive themselves and to live in an era where in the next 10-25 years flying cars are a normality. The fact that Tesla can keep raising money despite burning **so much** of it constantly should tell you exactly how the market and people feel about the company. And a belief of a sci-fi future becoming attainable is worth more than anything else in this world. It's basically hope.

It doesn't really matter though, even if Playstation goes on to somehow steal some Xbox players. \n\nFrankly, nothings really going to change if neither console can take a substantial market share from PC users - and neither will ever do that. The mass production will always hold them back from being top tier gaming machines, so the market share between Xbox and PS will basically forever stay the same (due to loyalty) and consequently, never falter either (because they are all extremely profitable).", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Uhh ps4 outsold Xbox 2 to 1.

The Xbox Series X has a faster CPU, more powerful GPU and 175 more GB of SSD space, not to mention it is an NVME and not a regular SSD, which are typically better. These are arguably the 3 most important components of a computer, outside of the mobo, which we don't have a lot of distinguishing information on, to my knowledge.\n\n>Sony has better exclusives\n\nThis is true.\n\n> and games\n\nThat's the same thing boomer\n\n> a more loyal fanbase\n\nI don't think you could argue that either has a more loyal fan base than the other tbh. Try getting a PS fan or Xbox fan to appreciate the other console and you just got yourself into the worst conversation of your day.\n\nE:btw I don't play either console, cause the mid range gaming PC I built a year ago is better than these consoles will be.

I was thinking though, if someone had around $35k that they did not need to touch and were willing to invest it, what would be the downside to simply running the wheel on a large ETF like SPY or QQQ? It seems almost like a zero risk strategy to me. If a market crash were to happen like back in March, they could just stop trading the options for a few months and wait until the stock price rose back up to what they had to buy in at, and then just continue.
