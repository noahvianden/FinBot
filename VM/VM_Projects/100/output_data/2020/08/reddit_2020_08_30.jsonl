{"title": "How Tesla and Apple have Primed the Slingshot : A Theory on Stock Splits", "selftext": "\n\nI. Background \n\nIf you follow the markets or watch CNBC you will quickly notice hosts and professional investors refer to day traders or \u201cRobinhood traders\u201d. This is a frequent trope that they will roll out whenever someone bring up the current record highs and overextended valuations. Cramer has said he has not seen a group of bullish traders like this since the 80\u2019s whose battle cry is \u201cStocks Only Go Up\u201d. \n\nNow in your daily life you may have ran across numerous people who have never even once cared an inkling about the market. But now these same non participants are looking to buy the dip and \u201cstocks are cheap due to the pandemic.\u201d The markets have more broad retail participation than ever before, and members here are quick to mention cousins,aunts,moms,dads, social media people who are giving stock tips. These people have never been in the market nor cared for it before. \n\nII. The Evolution of Trading \n\nWe joke about Robinhood being a game and the money not being real. How it\u2019s addictive like a video game and you can keep buying as long as you purchase DLC, micro transactions.\nBut all these things are true Robinhood is incredibly addicting and it\u2019s interface is simple and intuitive, enough so that practically anyone can start trading complex financial instruments: options, spreads, condors, straddles. The best part is it\u2019s all \u201cFREE\u201d no commissions and all done from your phone. \n\nCall Options are a leveraged product for a finite amount of money one can have infinite gains and trade 100 shares for a fraction of the cost. The way the market makers hedge themselves against selling call options is by buying up the stock, so that they don\u2019t lose their shirt in case those same options start hitting.\n\nIII. WEAPONIZED AUTISM \n\nI believe the smart people at Apple/Tesla have realized the changing dynamics in the market. More retail trading with more options CAN in fact influence the market! They\u2019ve realized a positive feedback loop of retail buying call options and forcing MM to buy shares is in fact DRIVING PRICES HIGHER. So how do they keep this train rolling? Well their stocks have ran so high that premiums even on a weekly is around $1k for Apple and 5k+ for TSLA, so they announce a split. Now weeklies/monthlies are going to be a few hundred bucks each. With options more cost accessible I expect new buyers to rush in, but their not rushing in buying shares; there rushing in leveraged to the tits with 100x options. \n\nEdit: Many of you autistics have a hard time comprehended things, so I\u2019ve decided to to compress my thesis. Stocks are sold in the open market and the ONLY thing and I mean ONLY thing that determines the price is what someone is willing to pay for it. Everything else you know or think should DETERMINE price doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s used to JUSTIFY the price. This is why pump n dumps happen, this is why some random tickets like Kodak can 25x in value in 2 trading days. Nothing else matters except people were willing to pay more for it. So now that Apple and Tesla are actually materially CHEAPER,  more people will buy it, and stats show that more people will use leveraged instruments to buy it, such as call options. \n\nTLDR: APPLE $250 Jan 2021 Tesla $1000 Jan 2021", "id": "ij4tyb", "created_utc": 1598753139.0, "score": 308, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "Apple never hitting $250.

You pay your ISP, they pay their ISP, and both your ISPs pay the Tier II ISP.

Now you don\u2019t need to pay the ISP, but you pay for the exchange, and your load times are still not great. Clients keep clicking away before your autoplay viagra ads can buffer. \n\nThe pro gamer move is to simply have a rack server at the client\u2019s Tier III ISP, for every client. Now that\u2019s a lot of clients all over the world, but you\u2019re a chad and you can just pay for rackspace directly at Tier III ISP\u2019s local offices, at every office.
