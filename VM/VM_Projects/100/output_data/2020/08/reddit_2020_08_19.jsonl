{"title": "A guide for those looking to invest in Renewable Energy. (My Renewable portfolio with DD)", "selftext": "I've dedicated a large percentage of my portfolio to renewable energy companies and have obtained some knowledge on the sector and specific companies in doing so. I've noticed a trend of people inquiring about these companies so I hope that this post can provide some information. \n\n---------------------------\n\nI'll provide a brief bullish thesis and some information about my investments in renewables. These are in order of weight in my portfolio. \n\n------------------------------\n\nTesla (TSLA)     (511% gain) \n\nMost of us know what Tesla is about. They are the global leader in electric vehicles and will eventually come out with autonomous driving but I'll focus on their energy business. They sell solar panels with the lowest cost/watt of U.S. manufacturers, but this isn't the exciting part of their energy business. They are a leader in battery storage, which is an integral part of a renewable future. Energy storage systems store energy produced from solar panels and when the sun isn't shining, energy is consumed from the batteries instead. Also their autobidder software, which is out in trial in Massachusetts and Australia I believe, eventually will turn energy into a market place for Tesla customers. Read more about autobidder here: https://www.tesla.com/support/autobidder \n\nMy bull case for Tesla (specifically the energy side of the business) is that they will continue to innovate with their low cost panels, and be a leader in battery storage, plus leverage their autobidder software to bring added value to residential customers.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nVestas Wind Systems (VWDRY)         (91.4% gain)\n\nhttps://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/investor/investor%20pdf/financial%20reports/2020/q2/2020%20q2_pres.pdf\n\nVestas is the leading manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. They have a global footprint and are expected to grow in line with the growth of the wind industry as a whole. A major growth engine in their business is going to be their expanding service and maintenance business, which has very high margins. My bull case for Vestas is that they are a unique pure play wind turbine company with years of experience in the growing industry. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR).    (24% gain)\n\nFirst Solar is an American based solar module manufacturing and solar project operating company. Most of their business comes from corporate and grid level solar projects. Notably, they have Next Era Energy, Microsoft and Apple as customers. The real bullish case behind First Solar is around their differentiated Cadmium Telluride solar modules. Compared to the standard Crystalline silicon technology, First Solar's modules last longer and produce energy at higher efficiencies in hotter climates. \n\nMy bull case for First Solar is around their differentiated technology, strong balance sheet, and position as an American company, which typically warrants a higher P/E ratio than foreign companies. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nJinko Solar (JKS)         (22% gain)\n\nhttps://ir.jinkosolar.com/static-files/5a6d9266-d288-4ece-a0ea-f8e49ff60119\n\nJinko Solar is a leader is a Chinese based solar panel manufacturer. They produce low cost modules and also manage solar projects. Their business model is similar to First Solar's, however they trade at a cheaper valuation, due to being a Chinese company. You can read more about their technology on their investor relations page, but my main bull case for this company is around their position in South East Asia as a leading manufacturer, as this is undoubtably the biggest potential market for solar energy. \n\n--------------------------\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ)           (27.5% gain)\n\nhttp://investors.canadiansolar.com/events\n\nCanadian Solar is also a leader in the module manufacturing & project development business. They have a similar business model with Jinko and First Solar. Canadian Solar owns equity stakes in several of their solar projects, which gives them a source of recurring revenue. They also have a large footprint in American grid/commercial systems and are a market leader in North America. \nThey trade at an absurdly low 5 P/E ratio despite significant growth expectations in the coming years. \n\nMy bull case for CSIQ is around their ability to dominate the current market and potential to capitalize off of further market growth and consolidation towards the biggest solar companies. Also their current valuation is very intriguing. \n\n--------------------------\n\nSolarEdge (SEDG)           (126% gain)\n\nhttps://investors.solaredge.com/\n\nSolarEdge is the global leader in the Inverter space, with a 60% U.S. market share. For those who don't know, Inverter's turn the D.C. electrical current from the sun into an A.C. current, which is used by households. The inverter business is also much higher margin than the module (panel) business, due to there being fewer players in the industry. They are also expanding into energy storage and electric vehicle manufacturing. \n\nMy bull case around SolarEdge is around their market dominance in the Solar Inverter business, which will grow exponentially in the coming years plus future expansion in storage & EVs. They have a very strong management team as well. \n\n--------------------------\n\nTPI composites (TPIC).            (70.55% gain)\n  \nhttps://ir.tpicomposites.com/download/companies/tpicomposites/Supplements/TPI%20Earnings%20Deck%202Q20.pdf\n\nTPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex & Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them.\n\n-------------------\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH)        (46% gain)\n\nhttps://investor.enphase.com/static-files/81902e59-7d61-4693-aa86-8d54e63975b9\n\nEnphase is the sole producer of Microinverters, which are smaller inverters that go on individual panels and provide a safer, more efficient, but more expensive solution than the standard string inverters. Microinverters are used in smaller solar systems, mostly residential. They also have an energy storage business that is just starting to scale. Enphase and SolarEdge are competitors in both of these spaces, and are expected to be major players in the future. Like SolarEdge, Enphases' inverter business is high margin and expects rapid future growth, as the residential solar market grows. \n\nMy bullish case around Enphase is around their Microinverter technology, potential for expansion into storage and unique Ensamble home energy management system (read about Ensamble on the Investor relations page). \n\n-----------------------\n\nBrookfield Renewables (BEPC).          (12% gain)\n\nhttps://bep.brookfield.com/~/media/Files/B/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/events-and-presentations/bep-investor-brochure-q1-2020-vf.pdf\n\nBrookfield Renewables owns and operates renewable energy systems and projects. They sell energy produced from such systems to utility companies and have a recurring revenue stream. They also pay a 3.73% dividend yield. Their investments are split between Hydroelectric, solar and wind. \n\nMy bullish thesis around BEPC is the consistent cash flow positive revenue stream and relative safety in the business model. Also, they provide me with exposure to hydroelectric energy. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nLet me know if you have any comments, hold, or plan to buy any of these companies!\n\nNOTE: I'm 19 years old and have a 5-10 year+ timeline for holding/buying into all of these companies\n\nPS: These are not all of my holdings, just the renewable energy portion of my portfolio.

Hydro-electric needs consistent wave/water currents). Solar is also the most fleshed out of all the techs, they are readily available to me and you, and have a BIG lead as far as market share vs it's cousin renewable technologies. Thats my reason for grabbing TAN as well as ICLN. \n\nBut if you only get one, bet on the entire sector as a whole i.e. ICLN. The market for renewables is going to continue to grow. Our survival as a species depends on it, something not many sectors can say regarding the future of themselves. We are seeing it with cars. We will see it with industry and homes.

First Solar's Cadmium Telluride tech is promising, but there's room for many winners and JKS/CSIQ have long track records of improving technology as well. \n\n------------------\n\n2) I think that battery storage will be the most important industry in energy in the future. The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow, so we need energy storage for when energy isn't being produced. \n\n-----------------------\n\n3) I don't know much about the installer market, and it's not really a tech sector as these companies buy panels from manufacturers and install their tech.

I've been following this market for some time and nobody is denying that it is experiencing massive growth but I have had a hard time to find a company profiting from it. First Solar is a great example of this. Global adds of PV capacity went from 51GW in 2015 to 121GW in 2019. First Solar's revenues and gross margins are flat over that period while solar PV install costs for utilities are decreasing 10-15% y/y. Same thing happening for Jinko Solar.

That's priced in with a lot of these companies but once demand reaches a level in line with supply, the margins will hopefully start to improve. Solar makes up 2% of global energy production today and I see that moving to 25% + in the next couple decades. It's hard to say who the winner will be, and it will likely be multiple companies. I agree with you though, panel manufacturers are riskier investments due to their commoditization. There is some market consolidation expected in the near term towards more market share for the biggest module players. And as companies start to differentiate themselves with unique technology this trend of commoditization could start to unwind. If not, the companies stock prices will likely be in line with demand for solar, which is expected to increase exponentially.\n\nThe inverter business is an interesting one and will grow hand in hand with the panel business, but with higher margins and less competition as you said. These companies (ENHP & SEDG) trade at premium valuations so you have to take that into consideration. \n\nIf you want to spend the time really learning about these companies I recommend you check out Canadian Solar's Q2 conference call or read the transcript.

Modules manufacturer so far have not made any significant amount of money from this. The market is fragmented and utilities are extremely price sensitive, which is why none seem to have been able to capture any of the double digit growth in top line/EBITDA. Why is this going to change in the future to justify the 80x P/E on First Solar and others?

Is there really any money in solar? I keep seeing articles like this, \n\n [https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/07/27/exclusive-interview-jinkopower-on-how-it-offered-the-worlds-lowest-solar-power-price/](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/07/27/exclusive-interview-jinkopower-on-how-it-offered-the-worlds-lowest-solar-power-price/) \n\n\"world record low solar bid $0.0135/kWh\"\n\nEven at 1.35 Cents per kWh, there's still a lot of overall money in energy, [$52 billion/year](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%240.0135%2FkWh+*+%28US+electricity+consumption%29) in the US alone. But solar is really just semiconductor manufacturing, we like keep getting better and better at that, and it's just turning sand into silicon modules. \n\nIt all kinda seems like a race to the bottom, no idea if anyone will actually be able to make money with it. Tesla have carved out a niche with making nice looking solar roofs. They can charge higher prices because their product is both a solar panel and a roof. They're very far away from making it truly large scale though. \n\nIf you compare batteries to solar, Hornsdale Power Reserve recently expanded battery capacity by 64.5MWh for A$71 million. Normally a NMC battery (which Tesla uses for this), shouldn't get much more than 2,000 cycles, but given that it's a stationary plant and capacity doesn't matter so much they might get 5,000 cycles out of the batteries, max. \n\nThat ends up being [$0.1594/kW\u00b7h](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=A%2471+million%2F%2864.5MWh*5000%29+in+%24%2FkWh) , like 10x higher than the cheapest solar price. If you compare that to other energy sources, Nuclear is around $0.09/kWh; Wind around $0.07/kWh and $0.17/kWh off shore; Coal is around $0.095/kWh; Natural gas around $0.07/kWh.\n\nIf you go with solar, you also just need the batteries to compensate for night time. Overall even going 100% solar + batteries seems competitive. Assuming that for every hour of the day you buy solar energy at $0.0135/kWh and 12 hours per day you buy stored battery energy at $0.159/kWh (plus the solar energy). 0.0135 + 0.159 \\* (12/24) becomes $0.093/kWh average price. That is very competitive, drop battery prices by an extra 30-50% and it's near unbeatable.\n\nAlmost all the money (and likely profits) is going to the battery manufacturers though. \n\nUtility companies can barely get a hold of batteries because people want them so badly for electric cars. The largest battery manufacturers in the world I think is, \n\nCATL, LG Chem, BYD, Panasonic (Tesla), Envision AESC.

CSIQ on their earnings call said they are seeing a trend towards this consolidation (although who knows if this is unbiased or not). If not, these companies will have to differentiate themselves with their technology, which I see especially from JKS and FSLR.
