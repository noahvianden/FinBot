{"title": "Thoughts on aviation from inside the industry", "selftext": "I see a ton of talk and speculation on this sub about airlines - some good but some totally wrong and showing a clear lack of understanding of the industry instead, but more so how COVID is affecting it. I am an experienced airport operations manager who holds a BS in Aviation Management, so I hope that I can provide a bit of insight. I\u2019m not a financial advisor so I can\u2019t advise you to actually buy or sell anything. A lot of my info is coming from internal docs so I can\u2019t share them as they contain information that can\u2019t be shared. The information I share is likely verifiable with other public sources. \n\nObviously we\u2019re all aware that traffic is way down. But to show you how much it is, in the USA the daily average passenger throughput at commercial service airports this time last year was approx 2.5M. The past four weeks have been hovering at ~750K and are now starting to decline with the most recent data showing just shy of 700K and likely declining through September. Speaking of, airlines have been publishing massive schedule reductions (feel free to buy a Diio subscription if you want data) through September and continue to do so week after week. There is some hope in that the October schedule is being elevated but my personal take is that they are just pushing the schedule in hopes something changes. Hawaii flights have been doing this for months - just having their schedules pushed each month Hawaii renews their quarantine orders. The only somewhat stable international travel I\u2019ve noticed is Mexico flights which are, for something reason, even growing in some capacity. All of this is to say that just because your state is opening doesn\u2019t mean that air travel is returning yet. In fact, I see it declining until the holiday season which is actually normal in a seasonal sense, but is much more drastic right now. \n\nDoes that mean you shouldn\u2019t invest in airlines? I don\u2019t think so. I think that there needs to be a bit more waiting as the aviation industry tends to lag behind general industry and we\u2019ll see some more discounts on airlines like we did back in March. EXCEPT for maybe Southwest because they have insane cash reserves. Also remember that airlines are not \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d in the financial sense, only the laymen sense. I see a ton of talk on this sub like \u201cTrump would never let American Airlines go under!\u201d It\u2019s not up to Trump, and he would - especially if he had a shiny penny to make off of it. Airlines go under all the time. American is actually a conglomeration of bankrupted airlines at this point. American as a label will probably exist forever, but they could bankrupt and send shares to $0 in the process. \n\nThis does not mean that aviation is doomed forever as I\u2019ve seen on this sub. Do you really think that the fastest and safest transportation method known to modern society will stay dormant forever? Even if Covid never ends our society will perform its own large scale Darwinism experiment. People will fly to Disneyworld or wherever regardless as long as someone is willing to sell them a ticket.  \n\nIm sorry that this post became more of a rant, but I had no real focus for it in the first place. Let me know if you have questions and I\u2019ll try to answer.\n\n**Edit**\n\njust finished some Monday reporting and August continues to bleed air traffic as well, as well as continuing to more in sept with pushes to November for resuming service on some routes. \n\nAs I added in another comment chain - cargo is king right now. Thanks to the explosion in e-commerce, airlines are starting to spread out to keep operating and are even filling seats with packages. Domestic US airlines will probably only carry USPS (or affiliated) items as at least at my airfield FedEx and UPS have their own dedicated flight departments. Speaking of, FedEx and UPS are obviously huge global cargo handlers! Along with DHL as well.\n\nWow I didn\u2019t expect this post to get this kind of attention.

Yes, they'd all have to do it, but airlines have had a long history of magically and simultaneously agreeing on things like bag fees and security and other things.

Changes that flick the switch from loss to profit and only require them to silently collude seems like a no brainer.\n\nGetting even more ruthless with their schedules could also shift the numbers.

So the 3 major cost levers are already being pulled. I don't think there is much variable cost left to cut. Everything that remains is \"fixed\" cost. We shall see if they can do things like renegotiates leases. It's a big unknown at this point. i.e. you are leasing a 787 dual-aisle widebody from Air Lease for a certain route, now how are you going to fill it? You may be able to substitute a 737 or an A320 on that route, but you've still got a 787 lease sitting on your books generating costs. I'm sure Air Lease and others are extending some credit terms at favorable rates but they aren't likely to want to shift all the risk onto their books just to help the airlines.\n\nIn terms of pricing, I think it is unlikely that they can drastically up-gauge ticket prices on desperate fliers due to the unemployment/economic data that we are seeing, there may not be any capacity to pay drastically increased fees. I do agree that there is likely to be some pricing power though.\n\nFor me, i just think you are taking a lot of risk for not much guarantee of reward. Compare this to aerospace aftermarket companies like TransDigm. Sure TDG is going to take a near term revenue hit but their parts are generally required for flight safety, so if something breaks it must be replaced.

Fuel cost hasn't bottomed since they're still on the old hedging programs.

Labor, don't ever underestimate corporate ability to slash and burn that.  Underwater leases and assets can be, and often are, financially engineered away.  Start some regional or spin off, stick them with the bad planes and leases and tenured employees, then it can go bankrupt separately on someone else's dime.  \n\nI quite disagree that airlines can't jack prices.  They've done so in unison many times.  They might not do a $30 \"fee\" increase but they'd all do $30 \"bag fees\" overnight.   And your logic assumes everyone needs to fly, but that's not the case, especially now in COVID times.  The market that have to win is now smaller and more affluent.
