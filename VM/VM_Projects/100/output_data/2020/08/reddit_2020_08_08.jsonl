{"title": "$PSTG: PURE STORAGE for them, PURE TENDIES for you", "selftext": "This is actually my first DD I've ever posted so fuck you and forgive me if this doesn't work out for you.I've been looking at $PSTG for a while now and if my buying power didn't get so fucked from my decision to buy 8/7 UBER puts, I would have been already all over this play.\n\nWhat had got me looking into Pure Storage was an unusual options activity alert. I've looked into this company before but didn't entirely understand what they do. Now after looking at them again, I'm still not exactly sure wtf they do....BUT I've gotten a better clue. Basically what I got from my research is that these guys fuck with \"all-FLASH data storage solutions (enabling cloud solutions and other low-latency applications where tape/disk storage does not meet the needs).\"......and ultimately what this all means to me is that these are the motherfuckers making those stupid fast laser money printers with the rocket ships attached. And that's something I'm interested in.\n\nNow, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:\n\n*Fundamentally*: [PureStorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double motherfucking digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales).\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21](https://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21)\n\nThe 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62. 74% Buy Rating on RH. PSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33 \ud83d\udcb8\n\nThe company has a market capitalization of \\~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. IMO, they should rename themselves PURE PROFIT. As of 04-2020, they got the cash monies flowing at $11.32 million . The company\u2019s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenue #s of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21.\n\nChart of their financial growth since IPO in 2015:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7](https://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7)\n\nAt the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.Earning highlights from last quarter:\n\n* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year\n* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year\n* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%\n* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million\n* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year\n* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year\n* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion\n\nI bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$ >!\ud83d\udcb0<\n\nWhat are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as the products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/01su6chrwnf51.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=16e6a705f9392291bc0c3932c815802d9101365e](https://preview.redd.it/01su6chrwnf51.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=16e6a705f9392291bc0c3932c815802d9101365e)\n\nSo far, it seems like Pure Storage's obviously passionate and smart as fuck [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Also seems like he's not camera shy either. Pure Storage's \"Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store\" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and the subsequent shift to the cloud. This increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line. To top it off, **NAND prices are recovering!** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues.\n\nPSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/4n0e5nve5of51.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=495416bb6f5a2dab77f3ac483ca4d9510b39037c](https://preview.redd.it/4n0e5nve5of51.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=495416bb6f5a2dab77f3ac483ca4d9510b39037c)\n\nCustomers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. Their products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry.\n\nThe industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.Pure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/3w51io8yvmf51.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f7d06825d0ad9d126216e5069af2f9c3636f86a](https://preview.redd.it/3w51io8yvmf51.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f7d06825d0ad9d126216e5069af2f9c3636f86a)\n\nEnterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and more modern data arrays, based on NAND flash. They do this because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of business inter-connectivity. This shit is the ***5g revolution*** sort to speak of the corporate business world. Storage demands and needs aren't changing because of the pandemic and isn't changing in the future. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM.\n\nPure Storage\u2019s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.HPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.According to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:\n\n* \u201cDell EMC \u2013 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago\n* NetApp \u2013 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago\n* Pure Storage \u2013 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago\n* HPE \u2013 8.4% \u2013 $185m vs. 10% a year ago\"\n\nPure has been gaining marketshare almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as this chart shows:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/5agj17gcgnf51.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=da9c6389baccab85261d6e0f71b3474e84b90d3c](https://preview.redd.it/5agj17gcgnf51.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=da9c6389baccab85261d6e0f71b3474e84b90d3c)\n\n**Hedge Funds are on this like flies on shit.**\n\nAlliancebernstein L.P. grew its position in Pure Storage by 0.5% in the 4th quarter.

Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water. This chart shows Pure Storage\u2019s past performance and we all know for sure that past performance = future results.....right?\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/4xflpezdhnf51.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1660a80a1a1821ef8098791a8cee632e25f1445](https://preview.redd.it/4xflpezdhnf51.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1660a80a1a1821ef8098791a8cee632e25f1445)\n\nMy Prediction: After ER**8/25**, Pure Storage will hit new 52 week highs.$20.50  - $23.50 is my guess.

Lack of faith in the market, gold and silver prices rising\n\n4. The Fed being in a pickle between printing more money causing inflation without raising interest rates\n\n5. Stock market overvaluation, current bubble that is all over the news. Once a small drop happens rapid selling is likely to occur as the bubble pops\n\n6. 11 year bull run with no real crash as of yet debts have been ever increasing with low interest rates\n\n7. Over 9% (34% annualized) drop in US GDP with stocks hitting all-time highs afterwards and investment in business dropped 49% annualized in Q2\n\n8.

Last week, the 10-year T-bond closed with a yield of 0.536%, marking its second-lowest daily close of all-time.

Elon said the new plaid power train will use a more advanced battery pack so I assume we're going to see the announcement of the plaid Model S (maybe X) at battery day with immediate opening of reservations and imminent deliveries. The next products these cells will go into are the Roadster, Cybertruck and Semi. \n\nPlaid power train needs to have no compromise else it can't do rapid charging and discharging (needed for extreme power) and last a long time and be light enough to boost the range. Cybertruck needs them to compete in price and Semi needs them just because of the vast amount that are needed plus they need to be light enough to not reduce the cargo capability, and of course last a million miles.\n\nModel 3/Y will continue to use local partnerships and gradually improve the chemistry and initially they need all the batteries they can get their hands on anyways. My suspicion is they will gradually phase out external cell suppliers as their own cell production ramps up in the coming 3 to 5 years.

I'm not going to bore you with my life story, I have things to do and your wife to fuck. The Fed's biggest issue right now is the **velocity of money.** \n\nDeposits are up, savings are up, revolving credit (Credit Cards) is down 31.9%, and banks are tightening lending standards. Why is this bad you ask? Good question.\n\nThe velocity of money is basically how quick the dollars you're paid change hands. It's like when you give a dollar to your prostitute, who then gives is to her boyfriend, who gives it to your wife who is also a prostitute, who spends it on her boyfriend, and so on and so forth **all** of that creates **velocity**. Velocity tracks consumer sentiment and how willing we are to spend money. *Loose definition right there... And I mean your wife after I'm done with her loose.*\n\nIn case you've been *sucking someone off* since **1971**, ever since we lost the Gold Peg our dollar's value is derived from Intrinsic factors but most importantly, debt and how we handle it. America is the worlds biggest importer because of our ability to go infinitely into debt. This is amplified at a Federal level, but held up by the consumer. \n\n**In short,** what he thinks we'll have **bigly inflation** because when the **velocity of money returns**, we've done so much QE, Rates are so low, and The Fed balance sheet is so big, it will cause inflation to rip up to **10%+** (Probably more) which will buttfuck our economy that is and will be still deflating. \n\n*(I'm going off his idea here, mine is a bit different but also related)*\n\n**TLDR:** Suck my dick, read the info because it's actually very important and you should invest based on Stagflation, Deflation, or hyperinflation.

Meanwhile, overnight repo draws are spiking again, ie liquidity pressure:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RPONTTLD\n\n\nSo, here's what's happening:\n\n\nLiquidity on the Nasdaq-100 futures is absolutely gone. Here's a picture of the Level II book from yesterday:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/v0zI1Tn\n\n\nFor comparison, here's the /ES book at the same time:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OO5O6zz\n\n\nNow, it's normal for /ES to be more liquid than /NQ, but that's a huge gap. Liquidity on /NQ is non-existent.\n\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\n\nMarket isn't willing or able to short or sell /NQ futures anymore. There isn't a single reason for that, it's a multitude of factors such as: shorts that shorted the March lows got blown the fuck up, others are fucking broke, big boys can't hedge shorting /NQ very well anymore, some drank the kool-aid and went full \"stonks only go up\" again, etc.\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n\n    Market is stretched extremely thin\n\n    It's the reason SPX and DJI have been outperforming NDX recently.\n\n    Leveraged funds like TQQQ are completely fucking up the market again.\n\n\nHow?\n\n\nYou see those stupidly large gaps at 3:50pm for the past several days? That's TQQQ and all the other dogshit leveraged funds.\n\n\n    \"you're retarded, TQQQ is too small to move the market like that\" - /u/random_wsb_autist\n\nBitch, sit down.\n\nAs of 06/03, the open interest on /NQM20 futures (Nasdaq June futures) is 208,571 contracts.\n\n\nOut of that, lev funds hold outright 3670 contracts. But they also hold a fuckton more notional in swaps. And you know what happens when the funds buy swap contracts from the big banks? The banks in turn go out and hedge all or most of the position by buying or selling futures. SQQQ, QID and PSQ in turn hold short positions. Estimating an approximate net positioning across all these funds looks like this:\n\n\nDate\tFutures contracts held\tTotal futures equivalent\t1-day change\n06/03\t+3670\t+66534\t+605\n06/02\t+4335\t+65929\t+1388\n06/01\t+3755\t+64540\t-\n\n\nSo, out of 208,571 OI on /NQM20, these lev. funds alone keep long 66,534. Almost 32% of the OI is in these garbage ass funds. On 6/2 at 3:50, these things bought about 1.4k contracts, hence the retarded spike. Yesterday, at 3:50pm, they bought about 600 contracts, hence the retarded spike. But right after, UVXY, TVIX and the rest of the long vol funds came in and bought a fuckton of VIX futures, which dunked everything back down.\n\nUVXY:\nHolding\tContracts 6/2\tExposure 6/2\tContracts 6/3\tExposure 6/3\nCBOE VIX FUTURE Jul20\t12776\t383599400\t16509\t479999175\nCBOE VIX FUTURE Jun20\t14196\t400682100\t14855\t401085000\nIPATH SERIES-B S&P 500 VIX SHT-TERM FUT SWAP - GS\t1542183.61\t49931725.84\t1542183.606\t48050940.41\nCash\t\t555951374.59\t\t618918110.14\n\n\nYou'll notice 2 things:\n\n\n    A fuckton of cash coming in long vol\n\n    Futures weight shifting from June futures towards July futures. And this, motherfuckers, is very important.\n\n\nIt's important due to its effects on the VIX. As VIX futures get bought, the short side will be hedging them via short SPX exposure. The VIX is calculated from SPX options with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration. See:\n\nhttps://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf\n\n\nThat means June VIX futures are hedged via SPX June short positioning, which is also reflected in the options. But starting with 5/27, those 6/19 positions that hedge VIX Jun futures slip out of the calculation for the VIX itself, hence vol started shredding at that point just for this stupid-ass reason.\n\n\nSo now, money is finally pouring back into long volatility AND VIX etfs started rolling to the July futures. This means that July SPX will be hammered down, and those expirations ARE included in the VIX calculation, which is going to move the VIX higher and the market lower.\n\n\nAnd guess what, we're also in a short squeeze on volatility. TVIX & UVXY short fees are over 5%, and almost no shortable shares available anymore.\n\n\nOn top of that, all these garbage-ass long leveraged etfs have to start rolling those June /NQ futures soon, and they're not going to be able to roll those huge amounts in this dogshit liquidity => TQQQpocalypse again. Short interest on TQQQ is going up big as well.\n\nSee expiration and roll dates:\n\nhttps://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/rolldates.html\n\n\n\nSo, what you want to do is this:\n\n\n    Dump every-god-damn-long except long volatility\n\n    Long VIX\n\n    Long TQQQ way OTM puts for every god damn expiration.\n\n    If ya played the akimbo, close the put spreads, should be a 2-3x right now, ride the other positions for free.\n\n    For the love of god, if you don't want to go short, at least move to cash. You can move back in after the 1st week of July, if market's still intact. But fuck me who am I kidding you guys are greedy assholes, see you in a couple of weeks when you'll be shitposting about \"cLoSing thE mArkEtS\" again.\n\n\n\nAnd if you want to be cocky ass retards, how about you inverse this and post some screenshots. I double-dare you, motherfuckers.\n\n\n\nPS: If you're holding ZM puts (exp. next week or later, this week's probably fucked) you want to keep those. You retards think that was bullish action yesterday on ZM? It was shorted so hard on open that it went straight into a short squeeze, just on IBKR over 300k shares were shorted in the first minutes all the way to no shortable shares available. That was a market hatefuck like I've never seen before.\n\nPPS: Zoom sucks, blow me.\n\nTLDR: Short every-fucking-thing-except-the-vix-and-especially-tqqq.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["gs", "vix"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "The orders are bullshit.
