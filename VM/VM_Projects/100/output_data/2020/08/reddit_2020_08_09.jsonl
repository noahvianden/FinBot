Not ever. \n\nYou've gotten very sidetracked form the original discussion, but let's just look at what you're saying for a second.  But to put it simply, you'd get a lot less argument if you just said, \"I think it's very unlikely...\".\n\nFor anyone that does continuous research into this market (I showed you those sales sources above) it's certainly easy to imagine a future possibility where Tesla could have 50% market share of all US vehicles sold for some period of time, even to the point that of vehicles actively driven on the road they have 50% market share.  NOTE: I am not saying this is PROBABLE.  I'm saying it is a reasonable possibility based on their apparent lead in mass production of EVs.  The US and European auto manufacturers seem absolutely lost when it comes to real EV manufacturing.  Yes they've made and shown some prototypes but mass producing a vehicle that competes with Tesla in cost and features is going to be really tough for them.  The old manufactures have waited on the sidelines for too many years thinking EVs wouldn't take off anytime soon. Meanwhile Tesla has spent 12+ years and tens of billions of dollars getting the incredible lead they have today.  Existing ICE manufacturers can't transition to an mass EV producer without a lot of time and investment.  The vehicle doesn't have to just be designed to please the consumer it has to be designed to be mass producible at a reasonable cost.  There's a lot of tech and IP that goes into batteries, drivetrains, motors and software that the old ICE companies just do not have.\n\nThe Chinese have the biggest chance of competing with Tesla (in my opinion because their government lets them reverse engineer and steal IP freely, but that's a different subject) but I'm not sure they'll be able to compete in the US market when you take brand/style/quality/features/cost into the equation.\n\n> This would only work if the chargers could work for other electric cars.\n\nWhy?  Even if Tesla was just the most popular brand with say 10% market share and has the best option they'll probably go with this Tesla offering as a means to attract customers.  This is already happening today.  Two restaurants in my little mountain town have two or three Tesla specific chargers and then they have 1 that works for \"everything else\".", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.237977534532547}, {"body": "I agree that in places where there is currently a diverse offering of high quality EVs on the marker from a variety of manufacturers, it wouldn't make sense for a business owner to install a Tesla specific charger right now.\n\nHowever, the majority of small and medium sized business owners in the United States think Tesla when they think \"electric vehicle\" because no other automaker is advertising EVs for sale today. The media (partially legacy auto's fault) has done a great job of making sure the public perception of Tesla owners as tech savvy, white collar people with disposable income to spare... Exactly the kind of customers businesses want to attract. The fact that other EVs exist that the business owner isn't aware of won't factor into their decision at all. \n\nI think this will have a major positive impact on the probability that other automakers join Teslas charging network vs the other way around... As more of these chargers are installed in more places, the public perception (remember, the vast majority of the public knows nothing about Tesla or EVs) will be that there are TESLA chargers everywhere, and that will either make them wait to make the transition to EVs until they can afford a Tesla, or until they hear that the new 2023 Bolt can use the Tesla network.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What do you mean when you say no other automaker is advertising EVs?
