Since the announcement, Tesla has added an additional **$126 billion** to its market capitalization bringing the total to **$382 billion** as of Friday\u2019s close.\n\nThe surge pushed Tesla\u2019s market capitalization past many household names including retail giant Walmart and consumer goods corporation Procter and Gamble.\n\nWalmart recently announced an earnings beat on both revenue and earnings per share led by **97% annual eCommerce growth**. Walmart\u2019s total revenue in the second quarter was $137 billion, while Tesla\u2019s second-quarter revenue was only $6 billion. Walmart\u2019s net income was $6.48 billion while Tesla\u2019s second-quarter net income was just over $100 million.\n\nProcter and Gamble reported $17.7 billion in revenue with $2.8 billion in net income in its last quarter, more than **173%**, and **2,592%** respectively when compared to Tesla\u2019s most recent earnings.\n\nTesla currently has a $10 billion market capitalization lead over Walmart and a $41 billion lead over Procter & Gamble.\n\nOutside of the stock split announcement, investors are excited about Tesla\u2019s delivery of 90,000 cars in the second quarter, 10,000 above estimates.\n\nTesla is gearing up to pass finance conglomerate Visa and the multinational corporation Johnson & Johnson. Visa\u2019s market capitalization is only $14 billion ahead of Tesla\u2019s while Johnson & Johnson has a $20 billion lead over the automobile company. Surpassing Johnson & Johnson would put Tesla in the [Top 10 by market capitalization](http://assetdash.com/).\n\nTesla is not the only company seeing its shares rise in price following the announcement of a stock split. Apple announced a four to one stock split on July 30th. Since the announcement, Apple has added **$480 billion** to its market capitalization making it the first US company to pass the $2 trillion market cap milestone. The rally has increased Apple\u2019s lead as the most valuable US company over Amazon and Microsoft by more than **$400 billion**.", "id": "iffsjm", "created_utc": 1598233028.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "By end of next week, it would be above the market cap of Google.", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5270273089408875}, {"body": "I don\u2019t care how much the stock grows.

I'm interested in specifically how Tesla will capture my money and yours, indirectly or directly, as consumers, and how much of it.  \n\nI've looked at solar and energy storage, and I just don't see the market being that large any time soon or for Tesla to have some sort of monopoly in it.  Competition is going to be tough if the market materializes, and better tech / efficiency is great but it's not going to command significantly higher profit margins unless it can do so while also being the best value for the consumer.  Energy and energy storage is a commodity, brand doesn't matter there as it does with cars.\n\nEvery household has an electricity acquisition bill which covers generation and distribution.  Most households are not paying anything currently to store energy because they don't feel they need to, they are relying on the grid and they'll just wait out power outages.  Will that change?  Well let's see what the value proposition is.\n\nCurrent Tesla Powerwall pricing is $17,000 installed (I just priced it on their site) if you don't have solar (the minimum suggestion is 2 Powerwalls in the quote tool) and this will protect a normal sized home from most power outages.  The two Powerwalls have a 10 year warranty.  So for $17k you can get no power outages for 10 years for your house.  This cost is equivalent to 12 years worth of the average US household electric bill.  So let's say your battery outlasts its warranty and lasts 12 years with a usable charge capacity.  You have essentially upgraded your home to outage-free electricity at a cost of doubling your total electricity costs for 12 years and having to pay that second 12-years-worth up front, right now.  Tesla makes 12% (last reported energy storage business margin) which averages out to $170 net profit per year from this household for that time period.  IF the Powerwalls last much longer then your cost is lower and Tesla's profit is lower.  \n\nThat's still not a bad per-household annual net, but the limiting factor though is just how many households can afford it.  I think the answer is not many, and even the ones that can probably aren't jumping at the value proposition.\n\nOkay now what about solar?  First I will have to update my previous example, because if you have or are buying solar panels or a solar roof, then Tesla's quote generator will tell you you need a minimum of 1 Powerwall and its installed price is $11,000.  So then the numbers above get better for you (but enough to make it attractive?) and worse for Tesla for just adding the Powerwall.\n\nAs for the solar generation capacity, I'm not going to go into as much detail because I'm tired, but I have looked into this in depth before.  Basically solar pricing is such that you pay for the cost of 15 to 25 years of electricity usage up front and for that you get solar panels which will generate that power and should last longer so eventually you're getting an ROI.\n\nSolar generation is still not a thing that makes sense for most household budgets or ROI timelines.  It's also not a high margin business, though Tesla's solar roof (which looks amazing and that counts for sure!) might be an exception to that.  So idk, maybe I'm missing out on some massive annual per-household profit that will come from the Tesla solar roof?\n\nAt a PE of 35, a trillion dollar company making 50% of its profit from the super-spendy-not-so-savey United States needs $14.2 billion net profit per year from the US, which averages out to $111 per year per US household.  Or, you know, $1110 each annually from 1/10th of the households or some other weighting.  I do not see that happening from \"energy\".\n\nCould it happen from cars?  Well, I suppose, VERY optimistically, if Tesla cars only last 10 years (lower is better from Tesla's perspective!) and Tesla can sell an average of 1 car every 10 years to 12 million households at a profit of $10k per sale, well that's most of the way there.  The top 12 million US households (90th percentile) by income made $184k or more last year, so they're in Tesla's target audience for high-margin vehicles.  This example, however, assumes 1.2 million cars produces per year and still takes 10 years to each that level of net income and assumes production and customer base are both still growing at that point.\n\nIt might happen, but this is not a thing I would bet on today.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I have a tesla solar setup.

Tesla is already the cheapest manufacturer of solar panels in the US, but they're riding the cost decline and part of that will be turned into profit. Batteries (Powerwall) are riding an even more extreme cost decline. Meanwhile the competition (coal and nuclear) is becoming more expensive.\n* Tesla and their consumers will earn money through their consumer to grid power delivery software. This is free money for them while actually earning money for their customers as well.\n\nAlso, just for the record:\n\n> Solar generation is still not a thing that makes sense for most household budgets or ROI timelines\n\nThis hasn't been the case for a while already, and with Tesla's latest price reductions in solar it's now very worthwhile from a ROI perspective for almost every household.

Even if it's 1-2 weeks after that it's not abnormal. I agree with your thoughts that August holidays likely skews the probability to a later inclusion instead of earlier.\n\n2) Can the committee announce a lower weight? Wouldn't that be unprecedented? I thought S&P was strictly market cap weighted with no individual treatment - hence how Apple and Amazon have effectively saved the index this year...\n\n3) I don't expect a phased inclusion, seems too unprecedented to be likely.\n\n4) the large number of sales from people trading inclusion is the elephant in the room. I think it is possibly very underestimated by the members of this sub. There are billions of $s in hedge funds that run this exact play (they are agnostic on the stocks, they just try to front-run additions and deletions from the S&P).

{"title": "Oil: The Tropical Storm Play", "selftext": "Hey all, if you want to take a break of counting your AAPL and TSLA tendies may I direct you to the Gulf Coast. In an unprecedented 2020 move, 2 tropical storms (potentially hurricanes) will make landfall in Texas and Louisiana next week. Hurricane Marco will make landfall in eastern LA on Monday, with tropical storm Laura coming later this week with potential to upgrade to a hurricane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0no03w966wi51.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=f311c746210d7cc5e3dd7ab602511a7a0e88b220\n\nTo anyone in the effected areas, godspeed and good luck. But, this being WSB, how can we profit? The answer is oil.\n\n# Chevron (CVX)\n\nIt's simple economics, when hurricanes threaten the gulf states  oil production and refining slows, hurting supply and driving price up. Which oil company is best positioned to profit from reduced competition? Chevron. Chevron operates 5 refineries in the United States. 2 in California, 1 in Utah, 1 in Mississippi and 1 in Texas. Unlike its competitors, Chevron has very little oil refining exposure in the gulf states. Its operations in Texas and Mississippi added up do not make one Richmond, CA refinery in terms of barrels per day.\n\n[Chevron Facilities](https://preview.redd.it/eyqhecluuvi51.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c80a98ba6906d9db7179ab7e0b53cf0ce4f141c)\n\nAs a foil to Chevron's advantageous positioning, consider Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A). Shell's **entire** US refining operation is concentrated in Louisiana and east Texas. This represents nearly 30% of their global refining output. Similar competitors like Valero (VLO) and Phillips 66 (PSX) are highly concentrated in this area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shell Facilities](https://preview.redd.it/709sy6dyvvi51.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=4feddcbc8ef424558acfebed11c823a9f29f5615)\n\n# Historical Precedent\n\nHistorically has Chevron benefited from Gulf Hurricanes? Yes. Following Hurricane Katrina in 05 and Hurricane Harvey in 17, Chevron stock gained around 12% in the following days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Effect of Katrina on CVX](https://preview.redd.it/710e8wlxwvi51.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a23db5c384475913e99b5923d134b56f52e39cf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Effect of Harvey on CVX](https://preview.redd.it/nrdo8jr9xvi51.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d1c478913eac2da5067ee780f9862c4ac6b949)\n\n# Technical Setup\n\nRegardless of the hurricane play, CVX looks oversold and ready to bounce. It, like many other non-tech stocks is testing one of its last uptrends from the initial crash. We're already watching the Russel 2000 bounce off of this level in futures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CVX 4 hr Candles](https://preview.redd.it/ownt0ss1yvi51.png?width=1853&format=png&auto=webp&s=da9036bf33548be26c718c242ce2f4b332bcb23c)\n\nTo me, there seems to be some positive divergence on the RSI with a bullish setup on the slow stochastic.

CVX is not moving as much as others, despite where their refining and production facilities are. RDS, MPC, VLO etc up 3%+. Consider getting into those.
