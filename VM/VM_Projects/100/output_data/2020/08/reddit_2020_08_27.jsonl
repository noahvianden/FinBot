{"title": "The Amazon of Pets - Chewy", "selftext": "E-commerce and pets. These two areas garnered unprecedented attention during the pandemic. When people think of pet products, they think of PetSmart. However,  PetSmart isn\u2019t publicly traded. Chewy, an e-commerce platform focused on everything pets, is. As an added bonus, Chewy was acquired by PetSmart in May 2017.\n\nThe US pet supply industry comes up to about $100 billion, with Chewy taking a nice chunk out of that. Chewy has approximately 13 million active customers, 100 million orders shipped (since 2011), and net sales of $4.85 billion for 2019. Its customer base is gradually growing by the day and the pandemic has only made it more lucrative. \n\nAccording to 24PetWatch, a tracker of 1500 animal shelters in the US, 46% fewer dogs and 49% fewer cats entered animal shelters between March-May 2020 compared to the same period last year. Foster home adoptions have increased as well as domestic adoptions (by as much as 90% in major cities such as NYC, Dallas, and LA).\n\nAs you can see, this is a simple multipart cause and effect. First the Covid, then the pandemic, then the lockdowns. People were in need of new companions and not necessarily human ones. Chewy has taken advantage of this, and has offered a service called Autoship, which is a subscription-based service that replenishes pet food supplies. The sales from this service totaled $3.3 billion in 2019, a 45% increase from the prior year. \n\nIn sum, Chewy, AKA the Amazon for Pets, has placed itself in an industry that keeps on growing, especially during a pandemic. People consider pets to be a part of their family and will spend accordingly. Earnings are coming up on September 10th, and I believe that Chewy will destroy them. I\u2019m playing the before, during, and after of the earnings and wanted to let you guys know.

Bezos has already showed his affinity for a split, most famously from his wife, the ultimate girl-chad who if Elon wasn't already in a relationship, would definitely try to get his FUNDING SECURED from. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[At least 2 for 1 split](https://preview.redd.it/zpri3bswpkj51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=523a6fb45f443862e39d7ac610c2a016b9b786f9)\n\n2. Like how his Highness [tweeted on 5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibfipq/musk_is_genius/), covertly giving everyone the signal that TSLA will be split 5 for 1, Bezos has been giving the signal throughout the years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Elton Bezos showing you 5-for-1](https://preview.redd.it/wz2go4ulqkj51.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2f2c13e36d64ad7a9ce4b4922c27e321e485fd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hitman Bezos flashing the same BULLGANG symbol](https://preview.redd.it/hqtqz0tnqkj51.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d85f4151ca6c5ffef957712d66eff13439e9091)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Even at a 5 for 1 split, AMZN would be at around $600, far beyond the reach of the average autismo or retard.

{"title": "TSLA Study: Weekly Options Theta Decay during Hard Pullbacks.", "selftext": "Hi faggots. I'm tired of hearing noobs complain about \"well TSLA went back to $2240 after dipping down to $2160. Why is my $2400 call option expiring this week so far down even though it reclaimed $2240?\" I'm using TSLA becuase of its high IV and accelerated theta decay.\n\nI've decided to show you retards using visual aids what theta gang doesn't want you to know.\n\nFirst graphic is TSLA's intraday 1 minute line chart on the left, TSLA 08/28/20 $2300 Strike Call Option 1 minute line chart in the middle and TSLA 08/28/20 $2400 Strike Call Option 1 minute line chart on the right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8pesg7btlj51.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=7815fa27cd4e0fdf9a73bd788de64e1cadafb65e\n\nAs you can see, the line chart of the two call options contracts on the right are very similar to the underlying TSLA stock line chart. However upon TSLA's first minor pullback near the HOD you can see the call options taking a deep hit. After TSLA takes a huge dump mid-trading day, it proceeds to retrace and make higher highs as indicated by the crayon line. Unfortunately for those \"diamond hands\" dumbasses, their OTM call options make lower lows going into market close. The further OTM such at the $2400 strike call options take the hardest hit, even though TSLA stock is making higher highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext graphic I'm using ITM call option strikes 2100 and 2200 in the middle and right respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q4cqohaulj51.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=676f200f1788edf921cb821a67e80170fe3c9d1d\n\nAs you can see, because the $2100 call option has instrinsic value, the option line chart is almost identical to the underlying stock. Theta decay, even though the option expires tomorrow, doesn't affect the option premium as much as deep OTM contracts. On the right you see a $2200 strike call contract that is showing signs of premium attrition even though it came back into the money.\n\nWell there you have it. I just spilled the secret that theta gang and the market makers didn't want you to know about how stupid \"diamond hands\" and deep OTM FD's are.\n\nJust doing my job to educate and hope I saved somebody's portfolio.", "id": "ihsz53", "created_utc": 1598560432.0, "score": 302, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "Theta gang sent me to tell you take this post down immediately", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "Get him before he reveals more of our secrets!

As a large cap stock drops hard the probability of it dropping further intraday decreases IMO. Just look at TSLA and its strong support near 2140 defended by a giant green dildo. As long as you play a reasonable strike price, keep a small position size with a wider stop loss it was a high probability profit play.
