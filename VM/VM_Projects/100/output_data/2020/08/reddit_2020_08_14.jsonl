And Apple is currently price at $400. \n\nWithin that timeframe and up to it, you're hoping your fucking ass off that those shares go up at $500 or more. If it Apple stock end up at $600, you make $100 profit per share (so 100*100 = 10,000).\n\nYou want $500 or more. Anything below makes the contract worth less. There is no value to it other than to straight up exercise the contract. Basically saying okay I'mma buy it at $500 even though at the end of 6 month it's at $450 per share. Which is dumb.\n\nRemember the stock option is a contract that gives you the right to buy 100 share. You don't have to exercise that right at the end of the time frame. You can take your loss which is how much you pay for the right to buy 100 share.\n\nYes, you're paying for a contract. Someone have to take a risk writing and selling that option. So you have to pay for that right to buy 100 shares.\n\nThat's the dumb down version of it. \n\nIt get more complicated because betting it goes up is a call contract and betting it goes down is a put contract. ANd this is just buying contract. You can sell contract too and collect rent.\n\nIt's risky because you bet that Apple will lose, say it's at $400, and you're betting it'll fall. So you agree to sell 100 shares of apple at $400 within 6 months. So you want Apple to fall in prices at the end of the contract. Say Apple at $100 at the end of six months. They agree to buy 100 shares of Apple for $400. You're made money. (400-100)*100\n\nSo why is this risky? Apple can rally $1,000,000 at end of 6 months. You have to buy 100 shares of apple at $1,000,000. You're fuuucked. In theory there is no limit to how high a share can go up.\n\nThis is called a naked put. Naked anything will screw you over.

When you pay for a option, the person who wrote that option (seen as a contract) have to factor in the value. The value contain stuff such as volatility and time value. \n\nThe big thing here is how the fuck do you value a stock option to sell to people. Two main component is volatility and time. An option contract for one week should cost less than a contract that is 6 months. The reason being you got 6 months to get that stock up and make money. So the writer have to factor that in. So as the days goes by while you holding that contract, you lose money on your contract because option are price by time among other things.\n\nIt's like paying rent. If this fucker want 6 months contract he's gonna pay me a shit more money than a 1 week contract. There is more risk cuz the buyer got 6 months to get the stock price up.

My recommendation is to understand at the foundational level what an option even is, without worrying about how to make money.

Options are famous for offering many different ways to make money with them.\n\nIn the simplest terms, an option is the right to buy or sell stock at a fixed price within a specific time period. But even the option itself has value, and thus it is a derivative market of the stock market. \n\nThe important thing to understand is that the value of the option will change depending on the stock price change, the time to expiration, and the volatility of the market (the greeks). Since time is always moving, volatility is always changing, and stock price is always changing (at least in high volume markets), the price of an option will also change constantly. This is what people clue in on and how they learn to make money with options. They can sell an option at a better price than they bought it (or buy an option at a lower price than they shorted it). But it gets even more complex as then strategies emerge which involve multiple option contracts in the same stock hedging each other (option spreads). So it's like a layer cake of complexity because options have so many variables (the greeks) and thus many different ways to use them. This is why it's hard to come up with a brief explanation of how to make money with options. I definitely recommend taking a full options course online, as it's the sort of thing you'll never truly get until you dedicate a few hours into really exploring the concepts.

The faster the stock is moving into the money or out of the money, the bigger the impact on the option price.\n\nThe Theta is the time element. You pay money for time. For example if I said I'll sell you a house for $100 anytime in the next month, or I'll sell you a house for $100 any time in the next 24 hours. Which would you choose? You'd prefer a month, because it gives you more time to do whatever it is you need to do before you buy, and gives you time to see how the market reacts, and lets you see if that price of $100, which is fixed, is a good deal. So the option with 1 month of time is more expensive. This is Theta. \n\nThis is important, because every day you hold your option contract, it loses value, because it now has 1 less day in its option period. This isn't linear. If your option expires Friday, and you hold from Wednesday to Thursday, the value drop will be very large, while if it is a year from expiration, the drop will be much less than 1% probably.\n\nThe last one is Vega and it represents the implied volatility of the underlying stock. A stock that moves 5% on average per day is risky and could go anywhere, while a stock that moves 0.5% per day on average is more predictable. You pay more for risk, so if you buy an option on a volatile stock, you pay more premium. This has some interesting applications. For example, you buy an option on a stock that is very volatile, and then it becomes very stable. The vega will crash, causing you to lose money. This can happen even if you correctly predict the price movement of the underlying stock! The opposite is true as well, if you buy an option on a super stable stock and some news comes out and it starts moving all of the place, your option contract will become worth more due to vega, and you could make money on it.\n\nNow to actually answer the question, How much does he make? It is impossible to predict. You just don't know unless you know all the greeks and also how they moved in relation to what they were at the start. Lastly, these are traded instruments, so there is spread and uncertainty in the pricing. Liquidity is a concern. You may have an option that should have gone up in value on paper, but at the end of the day you need a buyer, which can complicate how much you actually make for less liquid options.\n\nSo, I know that isn't ELI7, but this concept is just too complicated for seven year olds.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Options trading deep down is merely an incentive mechanism to keep the capital flow of the markets liquid.

{"title": "NVDA's ER in 5 days will officially make them an AI company rather than a gaming hardware company", "selftext": "Historically, NVIDIA has been a hardware gaming company. This is still the impression most people have even nowadays when they think of NVDA. NVDA has been fighting this image, claiming that they're just as much a software company or an AI company. If you've been paying any attention then you'll have noticed that this is true. But what would \"officially\" make them primarily an \"AI\" company? By making more money from data center than from gaming. Of course this is a generalization, they're nowadays already implementing AI in their gaming GPUs (DLSS 2.0, RTX voice), but details don't make headlines.\n\nThe big growth stories for NVDA have been data center and self driving cars. Surely also their gaming revenue can be expected to grow but it's not what has been driving NVDA's high PE. Self driving cars haven't taken off yet, they're even expected to decline due to covid, but the story is intact and NVDA has been making progress and partnerships.\n\nData center meanwhile is already now turning into a gold mine for NVDA and it has been a big part of the stock's valuation. Expect the stock price to take a decent hit if their revenue from data center doesn't meet expectations in their next ER (8/19). On the other hand, a beat could push the stock price past $500, especially if data center revenue exceeds gaming revenue. Obviously this doesn't technically matter, it's just one number passing the other which may have been priced in, but that's not how these stonks work. NVDA's valuation is based on a story and not on numbers and if they're starting to make more money from data center than from gaming we're certainly entering the next chapter of that story.\n\nSo how could we get there? Let's look first look at their first quarter of fiscal 2017 (2016 year). This was when they first started disclosing revenue from data center.\n\n* Gaming $687M\n* Data Center $143M\n\nAt this point in time their revenue from gaming exceeded revenue from data center 5 fold. 4 years later these are their revenue numbers for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (2020 year):\n\n* Gaming  $1,339M\n* Data Center  $1,141M\n\nSo within 4 years their revenue from data center increased 8 fold. We're almost quite there! Now what could push revenue from data center above gaming revenue?\n\nAccording to their 10-Q for the last quarter, the A100 (data center GPU) is in full production, it's fastest ramp in history and already contributed to Q1 revenue. This despite the report being released just one week after the release of the A100. NVDA claims that the A100 is up to 20x faster vs. the V100 and that this is the biggest generational performance leap ever. So we have a yuge new product here and this is the first quarter in which they're pumping it into the market at full steam.\n\nMeanwhile this is the last quarter for their RTX 2000 series for gaming. They've already stopped the production of these cards and the new cards are going to be announced in 2 weeks. Covid has certainly helped drive demand for gaming gpus and NVDA seems to be doing just fine with clearing their inventory, but apart from people holding back with buying due to waiting for the 3000 series, summer historically isn't a strong quarter for gaming because people spend more time outside.\n\nNow onto the actual reason why data center revenue will increase even further. **The Mellanox acquisition closed on April 27 and starting with Q2 FY2021, data center will incorporate Mellanox revenue.** Mellanox revenue last quarter was $429M. So had Mellanox revenue been included in their last quarter's ER, data center revenue would already have exceeded gaming revenue.\n\nWhat does this mean for NVDA's ER in 5 days? Data center revenue should range from $1.5B to $2B. Anything below $1.5B would certainly be a disappointment considering that it will include the revenue of Mellanox. Of course that's kind of baked in but I'm fully expecting the biggest beat NVDA has had in years, confirming the story the stock is trading on and sending it past $500.\n\ntl;dr: \n\n* leather jacket man says data center is now a $100B market and will be a $1T market in a few years\n* leather jacket man is trying to play a big role in that market\n* leather jacket man is delivering on that promise", "id": "i9m7tn", "created_utc": 1597412672.0, "score": 337, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "I sold 500 calls last week and this run up has me clenched", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "500 bro?

Having talked to some people that work with machine learning, they're in general a little salty buying \"graphics cards\" when they really just want the AI tensor cores. \n\nGamers I don't think care, it says \"GRAPHICS\" in the name, right? Plus for the RTX cards they sneaked in tensor cores at the same time as ray tracing cores, gamers I don't really understood that the RT cores is what's doing the ray tracing. Tensor cores is literally just AI research. But in consumers, they're linked now and they don't really mind it. \n\nIf Nvidia ultimately had to pick between selling gaming cards to data center, or selling AI cards to gamers, they would 100% go with AI cards to gaming. As you said, the A100 is seriously impressive, vast majority of the development effort went into making it a better AI card, and there's some real innovations there for AI compute. \n\nIf you look at what other options you have in tensor accelerators (AI chips), Amazon has some \"Inferentia Chips\", AI accelerators they rent out in AWS, they do 64 TOPS fp16, with 16GB of \"RAM\". Google have a similar deal with renting out their Cloud TPUs, v3 does 90 TOPS with 32GB of HBM (2?) VRAM. From what I've heard these chips, are kinda a pain in the ass to work with, everyone hates having to deal with them. \n\nCUDA is the shit for machine learning, everyone loves CUDA. Most ML applications don't even support AMD cards, they just run CUDA on Nvidia chips. And compared to 64 TOPS, 16GB for Amazon, 90 TOPS, 32GB for Google. Nvidia A100 can do 312 TOPS fp16 with 40GB HBM2. They also added another trick that anyone should really be able to implement with tensor sparsity (you zero out values like 0.0001 to optimize compute), that will double compute to 624 TOPS.\n\nThey also added \"TF32\" which is like a 19 bit value that you can use interchangeably with 32 bit floats, [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/TensorFloat32-TF32.jpg](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/TensorFloat32-TF32.jpg) \n\nThis is like a really big deal actually, all those previous compute numbers for Amazon, Google were in 16 bit integers. Machine learning researchers are generally pretty lazy and not that computer savy, most models just run 32 bit floats, because that's the default and what's used for graphics. You get higher precision, but there's only specific parts of neural networks that actually needs this precision, for the vast majority of computation it doesn't give a fuck if it's really 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit precision, or if half the network is zeroed out, the network will learn. Performance difference is negligible. Nvidia's TF32 will run any model designed for 32 bit floats as their hybrid 19-bit word. The Nvidia A100 can do 19.5 TFLOPS of FP32, for gaming ect. With TF32 it can leverage it's tensor cores and do 312 TOPS. \n\nUsing the tensor cores in Google's, Amazon's, even the Nvidia V100 is really annoying. The A100 will just do it automatically since all the popular AI libraries have been updated to use them by default. \n\n [https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/) \n\nWith this kind of stuff being implemented, anyone that keeps tracks of hardware in AI should definitely start to see Nvidia GPUs basically being dedicated AI chips, and not like they're really buying gaming hardware. \n\nOne more note on that, nowadays GPUs are really just limited by their total power output, not transistors. Burning more than 400 Watt in a tiny area is nearly impossible to keep cool. Number of transistors keep growing, 87% more on TSMC 5nm over the 7nm used in A100, another 70% more on TSMC 3nm over 5nm. You're already capped out on power budget, you really do have the transistors to just bake a gaming card and a AI card into one. They're not really gonna be used at the same time anyway, plus memory, power management, cache and a huge part of the GPU would be the same for both purposes anyway. Designing one chip to do both really streamlines development, and you're not really losing much. Silicon itself is like $200, and they sell the GPUs for $9,999 to data centers, $1,000 to gamers, you can add a bit of unnecessary silicon, whatever. Their strategy to sell the AI stuff to gamers with Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), AI up-scaling, RTX voice, people think it's ray tracing, that's strategy is working out really well for them. \n\nDLSS is actually [really nice](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-big-leap-in-ai-rendering/) as well, it's not like a scam, just having your pie and eating it too. Most phones are starting to pack pretty beefy AI accelerators as well, like 15 TOPS.

Compute demand is also skyrocketing in AI. They've recently figured out that the philosophy of \"just make it bigger\", works extremely well. \n\nData center is growing 80% per year, it will probably keep doing that.

Industry experts are predicting airlines won\u2019t fully recover until 2023 and even that may be optimistic. AAL\u2019s losses last quarter were approximately $4 billion. That was partially offset by the $2 billion in bailout money from CARES. Let\u2019s (very) conservatively say that UAL will lose $10 billion in the next year and receive another $4 billion in bailout money from another 2 rounds of stimulus. That\u2019s $6 billion in losses over the next year. Again, I think that\u2019s pretty optimistic. Fauci expects us to get \u201cback to normal\u201d by end of 2021. We are going to be having a second wave this fall and it is going to be BAD with schools all across the country reopening. I expect the modest increases in airline bookings over the last month or so to reverse. \n\nMeanwhile, AAL\u2019s latest quarterly filing shows that they have roughly $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents and roughly $10 billion in short-term debt and expenses. So even if they were breaking even, they just barely have enough to cover their short-term financial obligations. \n\nEven if they somehow survive hemorrhaging money for the next couple years, they have another $36 billion in long-term debt, a number which will surely grow over the next couple years if they are to somehow survive. Let\u2019s (very) conservatively day they add another $10 billion in debt before they become profitable again. That\u2019s $46 billion in long-term debt. In 2019, AAL\u2019s profits were $1.7 billion. That means it will take 27 years for AAL to pay off their debts if they can get back to their pre-pandemic level of profitability.\n\nIt\u2019s almost a certainty that AAL will need to declare bankruptcy in the next couple years. It\u2019s losing too much money too quickly and cant cover its short-term debt obligations without a lot of bailout money. Even if it somehow escapes this pandemic without going through bankruptcy, it\u2019s debt burden is going to be so large going forward that it is going to deliver very poor returns for decades. \n\nTLDR: AAL is fucked", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aal"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "out of all the airlines there in THE worst position.

{"title": "Sociopathic Bears and Zombie Fish", "selftext": "In Alaska, I met a naturalist who told me about sociopathic bears.\n\nDuring spawning season, the rivers are chock full of salmon struggling against the current. They do this until they are just about to die, whereupon they release their \u201cproduct\u201d and shuffle off the mortal coil. The stronger they are, the further they get, the best milt inseminating the best roe. Thus natural selection unfolds. \n\nThese are not salmon you want to eat. The fresh water fucks up their flesh, so that by the end of their journey they look like zombie fish and smell just as bad. But bears love them, and the good news is that there are millions of these fish trying to live out their natural purpose. So bears come down from the hills to jam as many as they can into their gullet before it\u2019s time to hibernate. In fact, bears are compelled by their own natural calling to do this. Sometimes you will see one by the river half-heartedly swiping his claws at the water, though his eyes are clearly saying \u201cJesus Christ, I\u2019m full.\u201d\n\nBefore you get carried away, this is not an analogy about market shorts being gluttons for rotten shit nobody else wants. \n\nIt\u2019s also not analogy about retail investors swimming upstream until they die or get eaten. \n\nThose are for another day.\n\nIn their world, each bear has an implied territory and if another bear gets within range, they take it very seriously. When this happens, they will stop what they are doing, make threatening moves and so on. If neither bear stands down, *it\u2019s go time*. During spawning season this poses a problem because there are a lot of fish but only so much river, and it\u2019s pretty common for a sort-of-hungry, more-kind-of-peckish bear to shamble down and accidentally enter the territorial radius of another. Suddenly, both are faced with a standoff neither expected. Both of them know that there\u2019s no real reason to fight \u2013 there\u2019s plenty to go \u2018round - so this usually ends with the encroaching bear being like, \u201cSorry bruv, my bad,\u201d walking an appropriate distance downriver and all is well. Sometimes, though, one of the bears is like, \u201cHey, is that Carl? Fuck you, Carl!\u201d, and the threats escalate. Then a throwdown happens, all teeth and claws, until one of them runs away.\n\nThems the rules of bear society.\n\nSometimes a bear is big and aggressive and pushes his luck. Sometimes a bear is small and cowardly, and never does. Sometimes a bear is just young or dumb, doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s breaking the rules and gets clobbered when he doesn\u2019t expect it. \n\nBut there is another kind of particularly fucked-up bear. This bear fully understands the rules of bear society and knows how events will unfold depending on how he acts. He knows other bears generally won\u2019t fight unless they have to because they don\u2019t want to get hurt. He knows the reasons to fight are particularly low at this time of year. \n\nHe\u2019s also a lazy motherfucker who doesn\u2019t want to do the work of catching fish himself.\n\nSo this smart, lazy bear will stand downriver from another bear he can see but is out of territorial range. The moment that other bear catches a fish, he will run towards it aggressively. Now, this other bear who thought everything was chill sees this other bear suddenly coming at him and is like, \u201cOh shit!\u201d He drops the fish he just caught and rears up, bracing himself for a throwdown against this charging psychopath. But the lazy bear isn\u2019t coming in for a fight. No. Instead, he snatches the fish and just runs away. This leaves the other bear, *sans* salmon, completely flummoxed at what just happened. It takes him a little while to get over the audacity of that asshole to get back to what he was doing.\n\nThe naturalist explained that within social mammal groups, there are always roughly 4% that act in such bald and selfish way, fully grasping social convention but manipulating it to maximum advantage. These individuals do not actually feel shame or rejection the way the rest of the group does. \n\nWe know them as sociopaths, and they tend to do very, *very* well until (and unless) their behavior is caught on to and they are culled from the group in some way. \n\nThe reason there can only be a ratio of up to one sociopath for every twenty-four \u201cnormal\u201d members, he explained, is that this is the most a group can withstand before the social order totally breaks down. No one trusts each other, and everyone is a suspect.\n\nToo many sociopaths in a group, you get the Salem Witch Trials.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce in a while, I meet someone who rocks the pillars of how I view the world. Chris was one of those people.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, I was doing pretty well. I had owned my own home for almost two years and had mostly recovered from that particularly massive purchase (any family man who has done the same will know what I am talking about). I had a few months of emergency savings, started a college fund for my kindergartener, had a little money socked away in a 401k, and paid the family car paid off. I had a full-time job and a side hustle, so I didn\u2019t have a lot of spare time. I decided to splurge and hire a guy from Craigslist to mow my lawn.\n\nEnter Chris.\n\nChris was five years younger than me, but somehow owned 5 houses. He lived with three other guys in one of them and rented the rest out. These guys were real bros, complete with the baseball caps and devil-may-care attitude reminiscent of Bill and Ted - like a fraternity, minus the college. They had no real skills, so they did this yardwork gig for pocket money. Chris was making a killing on the houses. \n\nThis was the height of the housing bubble, you see.\n\nChris explained that every few months or so, he either refinanced or took out another HELOC on the properties, each having appraised 5%, 10% even 20% since the previous time, tens of thousands of dollars at a cycle. Prices kept appreciating, so he kept taking out cash. Chris thought it was hilarious how the banks were practically throwing money at him. He made it a point to put as little of his own money in the properties as possible, drawing them down to the hilt and putting the proceeds into savings accounts. He used multiple banks due to the FDIC limits, which were $100k at the time. \n\nI was blown away. I asked him what would happen when the bill came due? I will never forget his answer or how he said it, with that stupid grin and stupid red cap and stupid sleeveless shirt, standing on my porch that hot summer day:\n\n\u201cWhen all this ends, they can take the houses, but they can\u2019t take the money.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cThey can\u2019t!\u201d\n\nA year-and-a-half later, I was begging a parking attendant to let me out of the airport parking lot. I had used a credit card to put my car into the garage, the last one that wasn\u2019t maxed out. I had just returned from L.A. for orientation for a job that paid half of the one I\u2019d been laid off from months ago, and while I was there the bank cancelled the card. I had nothing else with which to pay the parking fee, all my other funds having been drained from an accident with an uninsured motorist and the monthly grind of bills that are always due. \n\nI was, for the first time since I had been an adult, absolutely-not-even-two-nickels-to-rub-together fucking broke.\n\nI had never felt so humiliated in my entire life, and this grizzled, hardened, world-weary woman in the booth had my fate in her hands. She could by all rights impound my car, and then I would be in some real hurt.\n\nShe assessed me for a long time, then simply opened the gate.\n\nI don\u2019t know whatever happened to Chris. I never got his last name. I imagine him running some sort of hustle somewhere, and I expect he is doing well. Despite my tone, I don\u2019t wish him ill \u2013 don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game. This kind of gamesmanship is how people get ahead all the time. \n\nBut thirteen years later, I still can\u2019t help but think of him as being somehow lesser than me. This is entirely the sin of self-pride, I know. I can\u2019t help it. He understood what was happening far better than I did \u2013 hell, better than *most* of us did. Despite appearances, he was a shrewd man who grasped that we were on a merry-go-round of stupidity, backed by social norms nowhere close to what the actual consequences of violating them would be. While most of us followed the rules and honored the social contract, we suffered while people like Chris profited. Laughing all the way to the bank, as they say.\n\nSo who is the lesser in this equation?\n\nChris\u2019 outlook and actions were the very definition of Moral Hazard. \n\nMoral Hazard is a term experts throw around when the Plebs find a hole in the system that they can exploit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy [last post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i5mgqn/why_yolo_is_better_than_boggle/) was received fairly positively, but as with all things internet there were\u2026 *detractors*. There was considerable concern for my lack of faith in the market indices. There was disgust at my telling impressionable young fools to put all their retirement funds into FDs instead of something sensible like an index fund. But most of all, there was desperate need to point out how stupid I was for not having saved enough money to prevent tapping into my 401k when disaster struck. One commenter believed I should have foreclosed on my house before ever touching my retirement fund.\n\nUnderstand clearly: I own all my choices, past present and future. I take responsibility for all the mistakes and the consequences, and I do not blame \u201cthe system\u201d for the situations I found myself in. I do not claim to have made perfect financial choices, but I stand by the choices I made with the information and values I had at the time. \n\nTo blame the world for your problems is the ultimate in weakness of character. Doing so is to resign yourself to being a spectator in your own life. \n\nFurther, as a point of pride I want to establish that I have honored every contract I have ever entered. I have defaulted on occasion, but I paid back every dime I ever borrowed plus the appropriate interest and fees. I did not have to. I could have let my accounts go to collections and pay 50 cents on the dollar to resolve the debt. I could have walked away from my house when it was $100k underwater. For how long it took to rebuild my credit and recover my losses from what they now call the Great Financial Crisis, it would have been the smart thing to do. \n\nIt\u2019s just not how I do things. And if I may be so bold to speak for others, it\u2019s not how most of us to do either.\n\nBut as an older, wiser man, I now understand that it is not how *everyone* does things. There are a considerable number of people \u2013 4%, in fact \u2013 that only care about the rules insomuch as how they can benefit from them personally. Not only are they banking on most people following the rules, they understand that those people are unprepared to react when they *don\u2019t* \u2013 and not even have the courtesy to feel bad about it. These predators are ever present, and thus the \u201cnormal\u201d among us must remain ever vigilant.\n\nAs Machiavelli says, just because you abhor the rules of power does not prevent them from being used against you.\n\nAs we watch the drama of PRPL unfold, we can see a social struggle regarding intent play out. Some people are angry, feeling scammed by the champions of this ticker. Others profess a kind of strange fealty, denouncing the angry ones and doubling down on their faith. The champions themselves speak to the faithful, assuring them of their own well-meaning and shared experience. It muddies the waters, and one doesn\u2019t really know what to think.\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to know the motives of these guys. I had no skin in the PRPL game. For all I know, they are fine folk who are simply zealous believers.  I have seen this story unfold several times, however. \n\nRegardless of all that, *you must own your own decisions*. If you chose to back the play and lost money \u2013 and some of you lost a *lot* of money - that is entirely on you. Same goes if you listened to that great WSB prophet Variation\\_Separate, if you followed Cramer on one of his many shitty plays, or just hit a spinner and clicked \u201cbuy\u201d. How you reflect upon this, what you learn from it and how you choose to act upon the lesson are what matters.\n\nMost people are generally good, just trying to provide for their families or perhaps buy a Lambo. But the world is also filled with people who would skin you in a heartbeat if they thought they could sell your hide for a nickel, and they do exceptionally well in a world obfuscated behind corporate entities, computer screens and internet handles. Best not forget that when entering any transaction. That goes doubly so when following the advice of strangers. Even me.\n\n*Caveat emptor* \u2013 buyer beware.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any investment prospectus, you will usually see two phrases: \u201cpast performance does not guarantee future results\u201d and \u201crisk of loss up to and including the entire investment.\u201d These are the only real truths in the world of business \u2013 perhaps even life. Everything entails risk, even doing nothing. Anything can happen tomorrow. And the world, I\u2019m afraid, is in no shortage of some real and true fuckers.\n\nRather than allow this reality to paralyze me, it liberates me. Passive investing, in my view, is also no better than being a spectator in one\u2019s own life. This is not to say I\u2019m going to day-trade my life savings on YOLOs, or that I won\u2019t be patient and let certain investments mature. But I refuse to just \u201cSave, Buy, Hold and Diversify\u201d and allow all control to be passed off to the whims of an ever more capricious market. Fool me once and all that.\n\nThe more you learn the rules of business and finance, the more you will find opportunities. Some opportunities are illegal, and others you will find distasteful. You should certainly avoid those - you aren\u2019t a sociopath, after all. But you will find many, many tasteful opportunities often disguised as risk and/or hard work. The best of them, I would say, are those where everybody wins.\n\nSome of my previous detractors pointed out that options are a zero-sum game, or as Theta Gang puts it, \u201cthe other end of your win is someone else\u2019s loss.\u201d Perhaps. *Perhaps*. With an ever-increasing NAV of the equities market, I am skeptical of this assertion. Further, I have bought options that expired worthless as part of a strategy I profited from and sold options that I am certain were used to hedge an otherwise profitable position. Besides that, I think it\u2019s worth pointing out that as of 2017 [1% of the world owns half the money](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/richest-1-percent-now-own-half-the-worlds-wealth.html) \u2013 and most of the other half aren\u2019t in this market. The likelihood that your winning option just fucked over a fellow retard is far less likely than it is of having sapped a hedge from some fuck who doesn\u2019t know what else to do with all his wealth.\n\nTherefore, I reject the notion that every smile creates a tear when trading options. \n\nLastly, anyone who tries to quote you the \u201cstable\u201d returns of the S&P 500 should also be made aware of its regular [30%+ YoY swings over the past 60 years](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp). This is not a safe place to park your money, and someone is profiting handsomely from telling people that it is. These are the \u201cMarket Makers\u201d, the players buffeting your passively invested retirement funds back and forth like a bowling ball going down a lane with bumpers. They don\u2019t give a shit about what you plan to do with that money in thirty years, just that you put it into the market *right fucking now*. Don\u2019t ever make the mistake of thinking they have your best interests at heart.\n\nMy great sin is believing you shouldn\u2019t let these assholes just have at it with the resources you expect to keep you going into your old age. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for a person to really grasp the *trillions* of dollars at play. Take a pair of night-vision binoculars into the woods on a new moon, look to the sky and you will get a notion. These people and institutions are playing with all that money because they don\u2019t have any idea what to do with it, just that they want more. But by virtue of holding a Social Security Number, you get to sit at the same massive table \u2013 and I\u2019m guessing you have a pretty good idea what *you* would.\n\nSo I am going to say it again, because it is worth repeating: we live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth. Go out and get your fucking slice. \n\nYou aren\u2019t special \u2013 but neither are they.\n\nI love you retards.\n\nEDIT: Dear mods. I did not fuck the parking attendant. But I would have.

August is typically a thin month on volume and banks shove the price around a lot.  Monday was an absolute rape fest.  BUT - this doesn't change the FUNDAMENTALS of what is going on in this shiny rock.  Banks came in on Monday and flushed the shit out of everyone so that they could buy to cover at a lower price - expect to see more of this in August.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2) Congress failed to get another Stimulus Check out - so fuck everyone I guess. Now they are on vacation for the next 2 weeks, so the soonest anyone can see a check would be like, 9/18? ( [https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/stimulus-check-2-update-when-could-the-irs-send-your-payment-now-what-we-know-today/](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/stimulus-check-2-update-when-could-the-irs-send-your-payment-now-what-we-know-today/) )\n\nThat aside, we all know the Fed WILL continue to print money - they even tell you when/what/where they are buying $100bn/month of assets. ( [https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo big things are coming to public announcement.  #1 is that the Fed is going to let inflation run as they try to inflate away the debt, and #2 is yield curve control.  The funny thing is that if you look back to 3/23 whn JPow announced that he was letting QE to inifinty run, they already started YCC in June.  They will keep interest rates super low (look at mortgage rates right now) - but they have been doing this for a while already.  Notice how since mid June, the 10 year Bond has seemed pretty range bound of .5-.75? ([https://www.tradingview.com/x/8z1jLmJO/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8z1jLmJO/)). The next FOMC meeting is 9/16 and JPow will officially announce this to everyone - because they have already been doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will cause negative REAL interest rates(it already is, people are just retarded) - and people will continue to run from bonds and into metals.  Metals are pet rocks and you can't eat them - they pay 0% but that beats out negative rates for a foundational instrument for things like Pension Funds, Retirement Funds, endowments, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(3) So given all of this, there is still a MASSIVE run on metals.  There are a RECORD amount of people that are keeping their open interest buys all the way to delivery. This is going to cause massive issues as Silver has been rehypothicated so much that when they have to actually square the books against the amount of physical silver available - all hell will break loose to the upside on price.  Once this happens, mobs of people will show up wanting metals.  Call your local coin/metals dealer and ask them what the demand has been like for silver over the past month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo because RECORD amounts of people are standing for physical delivery, and the banks are naked short, they are having to start unwinding their positions.  Today, the COT showed that Large Specs have the smallest net LONG position since 6/18/2019 on Gold and Silver.  The Spec net long ratio is the smallest its been since 7/9/19 (very bullish) - they are reducing the amount of paper being traded to try and ease the pain when it hits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mre7u68yb1h51.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=db0a22dd664c110ac4e3f58dc3ecd36eb54d9f31\n\nBanks are still having to unwind their short positions. We can see it in the COT report, and we can also see it in the price action.  After the NYMEX closed, we saw a massive buy cover of Silver contracts from 4-5pm EST.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven more indicative of banks covering their shorts and adding to longs is to look at the options Market.  This week alone, SOMEONE bought  $750k of SLV 9/18 $30c ( [https://twitter.com/unusual\\_whales/status/1293637436367613954](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1293637436367613954) )\n\nSOMEONE bought $690k of GDX 10/16 $46c ( [https://twitter.com/unusual\\_whales/status/1294334426265063425](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1294334426265063425) )\n\nand SOMEONE bought $714k 12/17 GLD $220c ( [https://twitter.com/unusual\\_whales/status/1294334426265063425](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1294334426265063425) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless this was that crazy rich mattress dude - it smells like banks are taking their losses on the futures contracts as they cover their shorts, and are going long in options to recoup costs.  The banks know that they can't be naked short on Silver anymore because people will show the fuck up and demand metal. Once word gets out that they can't take physical delivery - the price will moon.  MOST silver that is mined is consumed on industrial applications (phones/TVs/electronics) - there isn't a whole lot out there for speculative purposes.  This makes it a thin market and subject to price movement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeptember is a Delivery month for COMEX metals (March, June, Sept, Dec).  If these banks don't figure the shit out they will have to start delivering metals to contract holders starting on 9/1. A bank can only sell and deliver so much metals before they have none - so they are having to cover.  September is also the first month the traders are back from vacation and the BIG BOY volume shows up.  So keep an eye out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(4) Buffet dropped JPM today and bought Gold Miners. JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver.  Maybe Warren doesn't wanna be associated with a company like that or something, IDK?  JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause we will show the fuck up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what the rest of August looks like, but expect volatility and big price spikes and flushes. Get some October calls for slightly OTM and sit on them.  They WILL go red and they WILL go green, but patience pays off here.  I expect September to be a BIG month for Silver as physical deliveries take place and they will have to start squaring the books with actual physical metals.  You can't paper trade 2x the amount of Gold above ground when people show the fuck up and demand metal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\n(1) There is still a run on metals. Turkey is currently in the middle of a run on gold ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-currency-gold-analysis/gold-rush-at-turkish-bazaar-a-test-of-trust-for-lowly-lira-idUSKCN25A0GW?utm\\_source=twitter&utm\\_medium=Social](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-currency-gold-analysis/gold-rush-at-turkish-bazaar-a-test-of-trust-for-lowly-lira-idUSKCN25A0GW?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social) )\n\n(2) Banks are still having to unwind their positions and cover shorts, and go long.\n\n(3) I'm tired of writing this shit.
