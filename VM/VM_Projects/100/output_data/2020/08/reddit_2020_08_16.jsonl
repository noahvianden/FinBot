If they get exercised you\u2019ll sell the shares for that much, obviously the closer to how much you paid per share, the less the premium is valued.", "score": 214, "replies": [{"body": "wow didn\u2019t know anyone actually used options as they were intended", "score": 101, "replies": [{"body": "Wish I understood this better", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "The short of it: you can sell a call option for every 100 shares of a stock you own. You pocket the premium as cash immediately. If the strike price is reached before expiration, your shares get sold at the strike price. If the stock price never reaches the strike, the option expires worthless and you keep the shares. \n\nThis can be a good way to exit a position you\u2019re ready to take profits on. For example I had bought $F at $6/share and sold covered calls at the $7 strike. The stock hit $7.10 before expiration. So my shares got sold at $7 (the strike price) and I kept the premium on top of the $1/share profit. I missed out on the extra $0.10 in upside, which I\u2019m fine with which is why I sold calls to begin with. So I paid $600 per lot of 100 shares, collected a $9 premium per contract. My shares got called away at $7, so $700 sale price. $100 profit on the shares plus $9 on the premium for $109 in total profit. \n\nThe downside to this strategy is that if the stock starts tanking, you\u2019re in a tough spot because you may want to sell but then you\u2019d have a naked call out there which has unlimited downside. That\u2019s scary stuff. There are ways to mitigate the downside there like buying a call around the same price you sold calls for which if the stock is tanking may be cheap anyway.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Would.. robinhood just recognize this and correct? Or is it just how the math works out after everything? If so how do you end up with 100 shares of the contract expires", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "In this case we're talking about *selling* a *covered call* option which means from the start, you already own at least 100 shares. So take my Ford example and here's the timeline with two possible endings:\n\n1. I buy 100 shares at $6/share. -$600\n2. Sell 1 call option with a strike price of $7. Collect say, $9 in premium. +$9. That's cash deposited into my account immediately. I can go buy ice cream with it. It's mine. (Options are *always* dealing with 100 shares at a time. 1 option is for 100 shares)\n\nScenario 1: Before the expiration date, the stock price goes above the strike of $7 and the contract owner exercises their option to purchase 100 shares at $7/share. The shares are \"assigned\" (called away). The broker automatically sells my 100 shares at $7/share to the buyer. This could happen when the stock is at $7.01 or $500/share; doesn't matter. The contract was for $7 so I only get $7/share. +$700 for me. My total on this trade is now +$100 in profit on shares plus the +$9 on the original premium.\n\nScenario 2: The contract expiration date comes and goes, the stock price never reached $7, the contract expires worthless for the owner. After all, why would they buy shares at $7 when they could buy them on the open market for less? I already have their $9 in premium, and I still have the shares. At this point, I could sell the same contract again and collect more premium!\n\nThat's the gist of it. I'm not sure exactly what you were asking, but if shares get assigned, the broker will manage selling them for you to settle the contract.\n\nThe most important thing to remember here is that we're selling *covered* calls, so you already own the shares that you're writing calls against. Selling *naked* calls would be saying \"yeah, I'll sell you this stock at $7/share, but I don't own any of it\". Now some major news story comes out, the stock pops to $100/share, and now you spend $10,000 to buy 100 shares on the open market to sell at $7/share. F.\n\nI hope this made some sense. If not, ask away!", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "If you already own 100 shares and want to move away from the position... What is the advantage of selling a covered call versus selling the asset itself?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Collecting the premium. \n\nFor example right now I own a stock that\u2019s had a great run for me and I\u2019m ready to ring the register. It\u2019s trading at $29.90 a share. I can sell a call with a $30 strike and expiring Friday next week for a premium of $1.30 a share or $130 for each contract. Money in the pocket immediately. It\u2019ll almost certainly hit that strike price in the next 9 trading days and so for each contract I sell, 100 shares would be sold at $30/share. If for some reason the strike price isn\u2019t reached in the next 9 days, I keep the premium anyway and I can just sell another call and collect more premium. \n\nSo I could put in a normal sell order for 100 shares with a limit of $30 and get $3,000 for the sale. Or sell that contract for $130 in premium which I get no matter what, then if the shares get assigned I still get the $3,000 for the sale, a total of $3,130. \n\nIf a stock is just going sideways for a while you can keep selling calls and collecting the premium over and over again.

I could sell at that same $30 strike but expiring in 9 months and collect $360 in premium per contract.

{"title": "Airlines are a pandoras box (with pictures)", "selftext": "This is pretty basic broad strokes shit. Just look at the TSA throughout chart if you can't read.\n\nAll these finance talking head losers have been telling regular joes to pour their life savings in the airlines because you know ThEy'Re ChEaP aNd WhAt LiKe ArE pEoPlE gOnNa StOp FlYiNg??1 but right now buying airlines is like buying a company that incinerates dollar bills.\n\nI don't need to tell you airlines are in a tornado of shit. They're going to need another massive bailout AND a vaccine by end of year to keep the lights on. Government gave them a $25b allowance and said hey keep flying all your routes cuz you're like idk a public utility. Ok well the airline industry did $248b in revenue in 2019. That $25b is only going to carry the industry for 1.2 months.\n\nBut being mandated to fly light planes doesn't just decrease revenue, they're filling the fuel tanks with cash money and burning it across the country. Someone who read their 10-Qs can chime in on exactly how fucked that is, I just remember their earnings were fucking atrocious. Routes they would otherwise kill to reduce losses they just have to nut up and fly anyway. For this kind of cutthroat business with astronomical operating costs that is really really fucking bad for bottom line.\n\nAnd here's the real problem. The great vagina shaped stonk recovery is not materializing for raw air travel numbers. In May and June air travel rates showed steady growth. But in July it started to plateau hard.\n\n[TSA throughput vs last year](https://preview.redd.it/gj0ubshlsdh51.png?width=2416&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb8ec757fa1023f1fbf0257e206c64c1657c6a1)\n\nExtrapolating out, ASSUMING IF that steady traveler growth continued, we would have been looking at 4 months at least before approaching normal levels on the same trend. That would have been 9 months total from near total cessation of air travel to recovery. That would have been an airline industry revenue reduction of roughly $100b or a 40% haircut for the year. Assume 10% profit across the industry (very generous), their $25b profit for the year just turned into a $75b loss. $50b after trump bucks.\n\n[TSA throughput extrapolated](https://preview.redd.it/3jow0v8osdh51.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=0926eb0feef2f477ba50fa2d80f4ae52b0169ce1)\n\nBut it's all so much worse than that assumption. They're mandated to fly loser flights, increased expenses from safety precautions, salaries to non-generating furloughed employees, juicy international flights cancelled cuz American passports are toilet paper right now.\n\nWorst of all, air travel has fallen out of that trend and there are no models to predict what happens next. When do people start flying again? When are Americans allowed to travel to popular vacation destinations like Afghanistan and South Sudan? Nobody knows or has the faintest fucking clue. Is JPOW just going to print them out of this?\n\nTLDR: If you buy anything buy puts, but honestly don't fucking play airlines, outlook is super grim, they've been shilled nonstop to \"low information traders\", nobody knows what they're worth, your DD is based on tarot cards, they're a black hole for cash, stimulus could drop tomorrow or the gov could say \"lol gl\".

Nothing I say is investment advice.\n\nAirlines are a bad business. I love them. They\u2019re great to trade in normal time where you basically bet on monthly or quarterly unit revenue.\n\nRight now though, it\u2019s about liquidity and capital structure.\n\nThink about it this way. If an airline earned a 5% pretax margin before covid and has since raised 3x 2019 EBITDA in debt such that the interest is, say 5% of revenue, that implies you need revenue back to double 2019 to earn a profit.\n\nAirlines have to buy planes on a long time horizon and reach to demand on a very short horizon. The capital assets are extremely mobile, so they all flock to demand and gut each other on pricing such that, for the most part at least for leisure travel, all but the lowest cost carrier (spirit, frontier, southwest) fly at a loss. The hub and spoke airlines look to make this up by pooling a bunch of spokes into the hub and creating connections that only have 10 pax a day for example, like Corpus Christi TX to Raleigh. A point to point low cost carrier couldn\u2019t fly that route with a full plane so legacy carriers make connections trying to get business passengers who typically buy last minute and pay higher prices.\n\nAll well and good except when the low cost carriers bleed your hub picking off single spokes and you try to price match them to keep them out. This is why basic economy was introduced and the long thesis on airlines this cycle was that dal/aal/luv/ual were so consolidated they could dog pile the low cost guys and keep them surpressed and they wouldn\u2019t discount against each other so the industry would finally make some profits.\n\nWell guess what - it\u2019s the same 8 empire-building overcompetitive CEOs running airlines and they all started price wars with each other.\n\nSo now we have covid. These guys are all on the hook for fuck load of capex in committed plane orders and they all have permission to lose money for a little due to covid, and they have too many planes.\n\nSo yeah people will start flying again. But tickets are gonna be cheap as fuck and it\u2019ll be along time before they make any money and when they do that\u2019s gonna go back to the creditors for years.\n\nYou can buy airlines if you like. You are betting on more aid and that politicians are going to come to the table for a deal even though trump just EOd the deal and the right has no incentive to work out something different.\n\nBottom line, the passengers figures are going to look a lot better than the revenue figures and the revenue figures are going to look a lot better than the earnings figures for a long time through recovery. And the earnings figures were shit before.\n\nOnly retail traders are buying these. With highly levered cyclicals especially when piling on lots of debt you really have to look at the enterprise value chart not the stock chart. Just cause the stock is down 50% doesn\u2019t imply the market thinks the company is worth 50% less. It means the market things the value of the company minus debt is worth 50% less.

That creates an incentive to issue very optimistic earnings estimates (not airline specific). And when management stops guiding and the market gives everyone a pass for 2Q the range of potential outcomes gets wider and wider and wider and the sell side anchors the absolute high end of reasonable assumptions in my view. Then because interest rates are low they/we apply sky high multiples to overoptimistic earnings. Even more so for tech companies with no EBITDA because you can use a sales multiple. Once earnings matter again they\u2019re going to come down a lot. Multiples may stay high dude to interest rates low but if your company got a high multiple from investors seeking scarce revenue growth post covid and you don\u2019t deliver, the high flyers might see negative earnings revisions and multiple contraction.\n\nThis rambling comment doesn\u2019t address your point, but anyway that\u2019s my rant", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6509203910827637}, {"body": "Doesn't this all go out the window if the government forgives all the airline loans?

It wouldn\u2019t be loan forgiveness (the bond holders aren\u2019t going to forgive the loan, they want the planes or the interest) it would be a grant probably with dilutive warrants.
