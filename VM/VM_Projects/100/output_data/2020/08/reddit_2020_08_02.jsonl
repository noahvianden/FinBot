{"title": "The rare TRIPLE EARNINGS PLAY - $1k > $10k this week guaranteed", "selftext": "Once in a lifetime, when the stars align correctly, there comes an opportunity for what some have called \"The Retards Solar Eclipse\". What am I referring to? The rare TRIPLE EARNINGS WEEK. Ladies and gentlemen, let me show you a guaranteed $1k>$10k play this week that as safe as going all in with deuce seven off suite. \n\nThis week, there are three earnings plays that I believe will all crush. Disagree? Fine I dont care. But dont downvote me until I'm red you retards. Until then follow me to Valhalla. \n\nI will be starting with $1k slightly OTM calls. Going all on Chegg calls first thing in the morning. Chegg will run up all day, then destroy earnings just like they have the past two times because any retard can see this is the perfect scenario for them.\n\nThe next day, I will be taking my gains (probably about 2.3k)  and putting it in UPWK calls slightly OTM. They went off this past eanings and will continue to. With everything moving to work from home and so many unemployed, their platform will flourish and they are still way off of their ATH. \n\nFinally, Wednesday I will put my now 5k of gains into WIX. Wix will destroy just like they did last time, because their platform is fantastic and easy for retards like you and me. They have been growing and with more businesses seeing the need for online platforms, they will go to the moon. This will leave me Friday with about 10k of gains on the rare triple earnings play.\n\n\nOnce I get this right and call my shot, I would like my flair to be \"The Babe Ruth of WSB\". \n\nThank you and enjoy the tendies.\n\nEdit 1: so it appears the run up was obviously pricing in great earnings. Lol. Gonna be tough for CHEGG (and UPWK for that matter) to go up after ER after such hard run ups. With that being said, I got in early enough on Chegg that even if it goes red this morning, I'll probably still just about break even because it gained so much yesterday. Whatever I have left I'll be pumping right into UPWK. I'll be selling pretty early this morning to change positions, as I do expect UPWK to have an early pump that I want to catch.\n\nEdit 2: I sold my Chegg position for only a 35% loss this morning and then immediately bought $640 worth of UPWK $17c for 8/21. So I'm behind but I can still make it up with a huge beat from Upwork lol. Obviously with these run ups, if I was playing with big money, i would for sure be pulling out EOD.
