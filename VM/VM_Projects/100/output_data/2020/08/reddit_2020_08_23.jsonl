You will see the most gains in picking an individual stock that grows over time. For example, $AAPL Apple has had returns of over 100% this year. $tsla Tesla has had 390% gains. $AMD has see huge gains and was the largest winner percent wise last year. It traded last year for around $35 a share and now around $83. Remember buying a cheaper stock too obtain more shares is a bad strategy. 1 share of a company that has returns of 30% is better then owning 10 shares of a company that only returns 5% all things be equal if investing ~500. Sometimes you can\u2019t buy 1 share because it costs too much. Take $AMZN for example or $TSLA. So you could see if your broker offers fractional shares as a service. If not you have several options. You could invest in a quality stock while you accumulate the cash to buy a higher price stock you have researched and expect to go up. Another opportunity would be to invest in options via simple calls. Options allow you too leverage a smaller amount of cash to control the right not obligation to buy shares at a future date. For example, if you think $AMZN will continue to increase in price you can buy a call option 3-4 months from now with a higher strike price or price you think it could be at. 1 contract controls 100 shares. If $AMZN rises the value of your option also rises. You can then sell it back. You will want too research this strategy and make sure you understand it before doing it. \nIf you are just looking for returns and do not want to invest the time building a diversified portfolio then buying a ETF that represents segments of the overall market is your best bet. I would buy $QQQ which is the Nasdaq 100 . Technology stocks have performed the best in the last 10 years and I believe will continue fir a long time.

This line of thinking will back yourself into a filter bubble. Its the same way arguments for homeopathy work (just to give an example): \"If you dont believe in homeopathy, you just dont know the truth\". Its a dangerous allay, please dont go that path. It does many bad things to yourself and your audience. If you want to say that you believe Tesla will win Level 5 and you have good arguments for that, thats much better and gives grounds for discussion. Meaning you are open to other people and willing to defend your line of thoughts. The way you stated it, doesnt do that, it pushes everyone with a different opinion away.m\n\nMore specifically, you state that Teslas data lead cannot be surpassed. Let me tell you something. I studied intelligent systems, not just neural networks, but many different systems. I would say I am a professional. I dont know everything, true, but I had lots of exposure to the math behind these systems and their application in my day job. It seems counter intuitive, but more data sometimes isnt the deciding factor to produce better results. It can reinforce you into a local optimum among other things. Much more relevant is the approach to the problem. You can easily make simple mistakes that lead you to a bad result and you dont know why. For example you train a NN on too many nodes. Then the NN becomes overadabted to the training data and looses generality. If the data is good, this can be fixed to some extend with more data, but the data requirements grow exponentially with the complexity of the NN in any case. In other words, if you add one more (output) neuron, or increase the number of connections between neurons by one, you suddenly need twice as much data as before. Its not quite that ratio but it often is an exponential function. You can easily scale the complexity of the network beyond its training capabilities without noticing it for quite some time.\n\nI dont think that Tesla will do this specific mistake, they are professionals too, but there are many other fallpits and slippery slopes and you dont always see them coming. Its entirely possible that a different company, whether with a camera based or LIDAR based system, can surpass Tesla with a better network and 1/1000th the training data. I agree that its unlikely that this happens, but its not impossible.\n\nSo, in summary, please dont dismiss other peoples capabilities off hand like that.

HW3 massively increasing compute is an indication that this has happened before and HW4 will come too, being able to increase size even further. \n\nAnother scenario/issue, which I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re addressing here, is that of imbalanced data sets.

One issue is, as you said and that I faced repeatedly is that the number of different corner cases rises exponentially with problem complexity. Say you model problem complexity with the number of open parameters, lets call it n. Then a data object of that model is a vector with n elements, each representing an independent variable, usually bound between a min and a max value. This defines a hyper-cubus in n-dimensional space. This hyper-cubus has 2^n corners, and the likelihood that at least one of the parameters is close to one of the extremes approaches 1. i.e. the likelihood that a data point sits on one of the faces of the cube approaches 1. So you always get a very disjoint data set and normal methods to find groups (or in terms of the NN, training cases that are similar) break down.\nAn example: Lets say we are adding some mundane information to autopilot, like the outside temperature for instance. This may lead to the need of waaaay more data points because suddenly data that was similar before is not similar any more. Simply because some cases were done on a cold day while others were done on a hot day.\n\nThe solution is to cut away unimportant information. But how do you know what is important and what is not? How does the NN know that? More training cases! Of course. Many, many more training cases.\n\nThese are problems that ALL auto pilot systems face. Not just Tesla. My point is, that you can gain more traction on the problem by having a smart cut on the data, or a smart reduction of the data volume and complexity than by brute force more data in general. Of course, the NN has to consider all relevant information, otherwise its too simplistic. The trick is to get that right. Its more an art than a science. I think this is part of what Dojo is about. To generate the test data for the NN to prime it for the complexity it needs to face in reality. And for the developers to find the relevant information. Once they know where the cut is, once they know what is truly relevant, they have a better handle.\n\nCan Tesla do it with their current approach? Absolutely yes. Will they be the first? I dont know.
