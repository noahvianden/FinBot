Amazon with a valuation of over 100 is nuts even with AWS--even under the most optimistic estimations they can't meet that sort of earnings target even with no competition in the cloud or online retail space (which they have in Walmart, Target and Alibaba more and more).

Even Apple's valuation is just sheer lunacy, it can't grow its earnings that fast (it's earnings have been nearly flat compared to 2 years ago when its stock began to shot up) and now thanks to the dumb Executive Order against TikTok and WeChat, China is losing the lion's share of its business in Asia and many other key overseas markets because people actually do essential business with those apps.
