But its entirely possible that the company uses their capital to continue to grow. Maybe in the future the share price hits $400. The person who bought at $200 and sold at $400 also made profit. And this may continue. Where do these profits come from? Wealth creation from the growth of the company. Everyone can profit in this model. \nNow lets look at options: you bought an options contract for $100 and sold for $200. You profited, but where did this profit come from? It came from someone else's pocket. And when you add up all the gains, and all the loses on options, it adds up to 0. Zero sum game - be the smartest and you can win.

{"title": "Buying the RKT Dip is an Absolute No-Brainer", "selftext": "All you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow & Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to >9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this?
