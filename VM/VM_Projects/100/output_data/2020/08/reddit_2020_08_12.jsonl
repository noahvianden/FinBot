You cannot worry about the exotic strategies until you understand the fundamental concepts that you are dealing with. \nHere is what the \"zero sum game\" means, and why it is different than stocks: If a stock goes from $100 to $200, the person who held the shares profited $100 on each share they owned. But its entirely possible that the company uses their capital to continue to grow. Maybe in the future the share price hits $400. The person who bought at $200 and sold at $400 also made profit. And this may continue. Where do these profits come from? Wealth creation from the growth of the company. Everyone can profit in this model. \nNow lets look at options: you bought an options contract for $100 and sold for $200. You profited, but where did this profit come from? It came from someone else's pocket. And when you add up all the gains, and all the loses on options, it adds up to 0. Zero sum game - be the smartest and you can win.
