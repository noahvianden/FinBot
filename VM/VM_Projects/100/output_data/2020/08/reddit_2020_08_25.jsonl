ETFs have multiple holdings as you have probably already done your research. There are some focused primarily on the Technology sector, others on real estate, space, agriculture, mixed ones, and even combinations of every business. The combinations are endless.

It deals almost exclusively with precious metals and energy. Futures contracts are like paper (contract) buying physical items through an agreement. Their purpose is to control supply/demand and price fluctuations. All those Silver Eagles people are buying and selling come from a distributor, but that distributor must get the raw materials from a miner or bank (like JPM). If they get it from a miner, it's usually done through a futures contract on a commodities exchange like COMEX.  In order for JPM or COMEX to sell  a contract they theoretically , **actually** are supposed to have the quantities stored somewhere in storage. \n\nIf they cannot meet the demand silver goes up because admitting to a shortage automatically  increases the cost b/c of supply and demand. They would also be guilty of fraud, so that's even worse since they are international. They'd face lawsuits from the entire world that buys through them which adds incentive for them to either renegotiate terms or deliver the silver. When terms are renegotiated they have to pay for time value that was lost . In other words, they must compensate a buyer for what that buyer would have made. They must also compensate the supplier (miners), but this is usually done by promising a higher payout at a later date, dividends, or some other asset.  This increases premiums . Again, this is win-win for us :D! You can talk shit all you want to China, within reason, but you don't fuck with their money . No, Sir ! It won't be a Kodak situation.\n\nJPM is the custodian of the SLV ETF, meaning they are similar to COMEX in that they theoretically have the assets (physical silver) to cover the contracts/stock they sell with one exception being you and I are not actually buying physical metal. With a futures contract on COMEX some distributor of silver is paying for actual physical silver to be delivered to them. If you notice on the ETF it has a settlement date of 1 Sep. Anytime you see settlement in securities it means \"actual date something (stock, funds, items) arrives\". On Sept 1 , JPM has to deliver silver to whomever placed an order to buy actual silver. \n\nAs this relates to JPow, he is in a tough pickle. He either must let deflation (weakening dollar) run rampant, or try to convince people inflation is good. Both scenarios aid GLD and SLV as that  their actual purpose is to  hedge against global currency depreciation.  Silver has industrial uses that aren't relevant per se to the upcoming speech, but b/c GLD and SLV are married to one another in that if gold goes up, silver must follow. Thus, JPow's speech is a Gold and Silver catalyst :D! \n\n**TL'DR** Silver goes up b/c of demand and JPow admitting to a weakening economy.\n\nEDIT: Fixing a few grammar errors and adding lines I left off.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "my goddd.

While it is true lowered costs on commodities strengthens a dollar , it does not operate in a vacuum. You cannot have China own a sizeable portion of your debt and also still operate as as a true free market. If our Fed had not passed all those random bailouts over the past few years ( soybean farmers, cruise lines, airlines, and etc.) and THEN recently passed that stimulus bill I would agree! However, they did .\n\nAs, I stated in a comment a long time ago not all commodities are treated by the same rules. When demand for metals is as high as it is , lowered  costs would only delay the inevitable. Gold is  currency insurance. You can't simultaneously debase your currency and keep your commodities low. One side of the pendulum must win. Lowering our production value would lower wages in a country currently facing increased unemployment is absurd.\n\nMy point about deflation was that if JPow attempts to make that argument the other top world economies would immediately call B.S.  He knows he can't in the current situation not with as much printing we did. World banks won't allow it. Money talks, and bullshit walks.\n\nEDIT: I just want to be clear , you're right in normal circumstances, but this clown fiesta of an economy we have now + the pandemic breaks so many rules.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["deflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["deflation", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["deflation", "jpm", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11815819889307022}, {"body": "My 29C 8/28 is down 96% so im praying to JPow rn", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "you're prayers shall be answered.
