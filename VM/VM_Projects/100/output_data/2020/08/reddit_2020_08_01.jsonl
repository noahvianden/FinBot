I have now made a profit of 25%, with \u00a325 in stow (\u00a320 original amount + \u00a35 earned) (My dad is acting as a buyer on my behalf, he is investing larger amounts of his own money for long-term investments).

That\u2019s fairly easy to do in Argentina and quite easy to do in the high, arid plateau in Chile. In Bolivia, in contrast, the main lithium formations are on lower, wetter ground. That means that evaporation takes a lot longer than in any of its neighbors\u2014which adds greatly to the cost of production.\n\nBolivia faces two other obstacles. Its salt flats have low concentrations of lithium, which means it takes more investment to get the same amount of mineral out of the ground.\n\nA bigger problem is the extremely high concentration of magnesium\u2014about 20 times as much as in Argentina, and three times as much as in Chile. Current technology requires miners to get rid of magnesium salts by using lime, but that adds to the cost of extraction. Bolivia\u2019s magnesium concentrations are about double the maximum acceptable for cost-competitive extraction, with no easy fix in sight.

Horse racing, sports betting, poker, stocks. The decision to place a bet, play a hand, buy a stock/option is just an analysis of how much are you risking and what is the reward if u take that risk and  win? For example, if you are on a nut flush draw after the turn and it costs pot size to call and see the river you should be folding, 1/3 pot size bet you should call to see the river. Add in some other factors like your position with respect to the opponent, is the opponent a fish or a shark, etc. For horse racing, you analyze that a horse has a 20% chance of winning and it's going off at 10:1. You bet to win. If the horse goes off at 3:1 you pass. Same thing with stocks/options. How much are you risking, what is the reward and the probability of the reward. \n\nLearn to take your emotions out of betting. You would not know if I made $200k this week or lost $200k, I would behave the same way if u saw me, I would still get a good nights sleep either way. \n\nAnalyze the past to improve on ur mistakes. Stop analyzing the past based on outcomes. For example, I paid too much to see the river and I hit my nut flush. I would analyze this hand as it is a mistake and I shud have folded even though I won the hand. I buy calls on amzn for earnings play.

{"title": "PPL, $4,875 risk - $43,875 reward + an introduction", "selftext": "# Happy Saturday r/wallstreetbets\n\n**Introduction**: This is my first options trade. I know that none of you know who I am here yet, but you can check my post history if you need to see credentials. I started trading with my friend from gifted class back in the day and we found PPL due to my pennystocks screener that i expanded the price parameters on. My friend is very talented at fundamental analysis, so we'll start with him first. I also want to say thank you to this sub, I have learned how to trade options in about a month, and I appreciate all of you autistic traders who have helped me out. Some of you have recognized me in the webull comments of the S&P500 as I've started trading those weeklies. I use an algorithmic prediction based on 140,000+ analysts filtered through machine learning. But I might start making posts on Sunday Evenings for that soon, after i have proof of its efficacy.\n\nEDIT: thank you for pointing out the discrepancies. there are things that seem to be inaccurate here. ive tried to strike through stuff thats wrong or doesnt matter\n\n*I assume no responsibility if this becomes a losing trade, and you agree to hold harmless if you decide to take any trades based off of any info contained within this post. These are not recommendations to buy or sell anything.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PPL DD from the bro\n\nIm still looking at PPL, but so far: Gas and Electric utility company with 10 million customers and 7B+ in revenue. ~~Quick reference, \\[ \\] is at \\~$32/share with 300mil in income. PPL is $26 with 500mil in income.They have~~ **~~9 seperate filings of insider buys~~** ~~on~~ *~~July 2nd~~*~~. Also on~~ *~~April 3rd~~*~~,~~ *~~Feb 18th~~*~~,~~ *~~Jan 18th~~* ~~and~~ *~~Jan 2nd~~*~~. I havent yet verified if they were all the same people every time. Again, still looking~~.\n\nThey promoted a new President in the last couple months, amd the outgoing President ALSO placed an insider buy on his way out.Financials look good. They have plenty of capital, were barely affected by coronavirus from what it looks like, but that will be confirmed on Aug 10th, when they report 2nd Q earnings.Overall it looks strong. Looks weird to most the fundamental research ive done because of the amount of insider buys. \n\nIt looks like they had some small share dilution since 2q 2019 but I havent found it yet. Suffice to say it wasnt much, as it only dropped earnings/share a couple pennies Q over Q. Im not sure what to make of it other than ~~the company's executives are buying more and more at every opportunity, their share price is less than \\[ \\]'s, while all financial indicators say it should be higher. Even pre-covid levels are lower than \\[ \\]'s pre-covid levels~~.It is a utility company, so they arent known for volatility in share price. It did jump up to $30 briefly in June. It was on a nice rise before the covid collapse\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack to me, trevandezz. They also have earnings August 10. Someone told me one time that when analysts raise their price targets before earnings, its a good sign. Idk how valid it is lol, but I saw this on the News tab of Webull. If you can explain the other stuff in here please do:  [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How to Trade These Options\n\nPlease understand that I started learning how to trade options about a month ago, if I have screwed up any info, let me know. This is the part, where if you can't read charts you're gonna have a bad time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Firstly, here is a key for my charts*\n\n[Also, red candles are bearish, white are bullish](https://preview.redd.it/lw1cfbgbobe51.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcea744bf8a5a2406ad598629beacf2734201e36)\n\nHere is the monthly chart for PPL. The end of the month is always a great time to check the monthly chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dq992a1qbe51.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=9236cec3dd70cb980c29a4f79ed37c45dba6eb78\n\nFrom the Monthly chart, it looks like the bearish trend has reversed, as the June candle didn't engulf the previous candle, and July just completed a bullish hammer reversal candle. When we use the fibonacci tool to measure this current bullish trend, we can see that this retracement dipped into the 50% fib area (pink box), which is cool for me. The 127 fibonacci extension gives us a monthly (long term) target of $33.58, which is also confluence with weekly resistance in that area. And honestly that seems like a better valuation of this company. The price was actually at $36 in January before the beer flu hit. Do with that info what you will\n\n# As we zoom into the weekly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u04dmef1sbe51.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7ed380244876e84428f6f1302bda78e4a99989c\n\nThe weekly chart has broken out of this range that it's been trading in. Great sign. The daily chart is basically the same info, if it can break through this next resistance, our short term target is $27.20\n\nNow, on to the options.\n\nI don't know how you bros do it, but I always just assume the contract will expire worthless and use that as my risk for the trade. You only want to lose $5,000 on this trade if we're wrong? Buy qty 75: 27c 8/21 [Options Profit Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)\n\nThe price has to drop $3.67 for these contracts to be worthless next week before earnings. If the price moves in the upwards direction $3.67, your contracts are worth $18,000. If the price hits our final target of $33.58, you'll have $43,875. To me, I think we could hit $30.79 this upcoming week. Previous weeks have spiked in that same percentage, putting those contracts value at $25,200.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe IV charts look dope too, it's below the 252MA which is a buy sign to me. You never want to buy options when IV is over extended, pretty sure that's how people get IV crushed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1c3dg2zwbe51.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc1111b5a5c7906101478718aaa2285714bb46f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheta is literally $1.50 per day on each contract. Delta is $33, which is good right? Heres the option chart. Notice how these contracts hold their value quite perfectly til expiration. Hitting our target at $33.58 is a $43,000 profit.
