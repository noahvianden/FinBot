ChromeOS is trash.  You went away to a bad OS designed for absolute minimalism and cheapness.\n\n\nMy preferred OS is MacOS, I think it's leaps and bounds better than Windows on most metrics. (Stability, RAM usage, required maintenance, safety, battery usage, consistency and polish in UI, multicore usage, etc.)   The only area Windows wins is gaming performance (by roughly 10-15%), but it's hard to tell how much of that is Metal vs DirectX 12 and how much of it is just better Windows drivers for GPUs.\n\nOnly problem with MacOS is being locked to Apple's hardware choice, and Apple doesn't always make the tradeoffs I want. (For example, you have to buy a Mac with a super high end CPU to get a midrange GPU, and while I'd rather reverse those, there's no option for that.)  But Macs are likely about to get a lot more competitive on price with the ARM switch.\n\n\nI'd like to see a MacOS-like general purpose OS hit the scene that can actually compete with Windows for desktops.  Right now, I don't think there is a great choice besides MacOS and that requires buying into a whole new ecosystem.  Linux is stable but just has clunky UI and difficult maintenance, ChromeOS is just too limited and underdeveloped.   [Google Fuchsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia) looks promising.\n\nBut the thing is, tools like Citrix are making *dependence* on Windows go away.  Need to use a Windows specific tool for work?  You can access it via Citrix and run it on an *iPad* if you want.

I'll try and do it tonight.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Cool man, pick this back up later on so.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Alright. Microsoft is at $212 this morning. So we're looking at $350-$400 in 5 years. This is all rough numbers. Trying to get uber precise with any of this is nonsense.\n\n$350 is a 10.5% CAGR, $400 is a 13.5% CAGR.\n\nSetting the stage.\n\nCurrent P/E is 37x on TTM EPS of $5.76. Since 2006, roughly speaking, Microsoft's P/E has ranged between 10x and 20x. There have been some outliers from write-offs and such, but that's the general range. So currently it's 17 points above the high end of the range. TTM net income is $44.281 billion with a margin of 31%. TTM EBITDA is around $65.5 billion with a margin of 46%. TTM revenue is $143.015 billion. Shares outstanding are 7.65 billion and Microsoft has had no material buybacks in recent years.\n\nLet's grow earnings 10.5% and 13.5% to match stock price growth. At 10.5%, EPS would be $9.50, at 13.5% it would be $10.85. That would put earnings at $72.7 billion to $83 billion. With constant margins that would mean revenue of $235 billion to $268 billion. This shouldn't be surprising, because the growth rates carry through all the numbers. The big assumption here is that a 37x P/E is maintained.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue CAGR from 2005 to 2016 was 7.8%. Since 2016 it's been 11.9%, which is in the range of your price growth forecast. For me 2016 is a defining year because Trump took office the next year and that's when the markets went crazy to the upside. Microsoft's stock price is up 3.4x since the beginning of 2017, $62.58 to $212.68 as I type this. Over that same period revenue is up 57% and net income is up 116%. So the stock price obviously has run ahead of fundamentals. Over those same periods, net income CAGR was 4.8% and 21.2%, respectively. Obviously the last 4 years have been much better than the 11 years before that.\n\nSo the question you have to ask yourself is do you think the P/E multiple (and other multiples) will remain constant? Obviously no one knows, we can only guess, hope, whatever. If the P/E multiple as a proxy remains constant at 37x, even though growth would be roughly one-third of that, then a $350-$400 price target doesn't seem out of line. But I question why anyone would put a 37x multiple on sub 15% growth. Or can the 20% net income growth over the last 4 years continue?\n\nIf we go back to its history, with a revenue CAGR of 7.8% and a P/E range of 10x-20x, we can do some scaling. Let's pick 15x average on a CAGR of 7.8%. 13.5 over 7.8 is +73%, 15 +73% is a 26x P/E ratio. This assumes some linear relationship between P/E and revenue growth.\n\nIf we put a 26x P/E on the same earnings we calculated earlier in 5 years, that'd put the stock price at $247 to $282, which would be about 30% below your target range given 26x is 30% below 37x.\n\nNow if we go back to a 20x P/E because maybe the exuberance calms down, then we'd be looking at a price target of $190 to $217, which is pretty much where it is today. At a 15x P/E, the long-term average, it'd be $143 to $163.\n\nSo I think in order for Microsoft to hit a $350 to $400 price in 5 years, the only way that can happen is either they somehow find extraordinary growth they've never before been able to achieve, at least not in the last 15 or so years, and/or price multiples remain where they are today. Personally I don't think that's a good assumption given the recent multiple expansion, but to each their own.\n\nWe can also look at it another way. Let's say it can grow earnings 20% a year for the next 5 years. That would put EPS at about $14. Of course that would also assume 20% revenue growth with constant margins, which is pretty stout given its size. $14 at a 37x P/E would be $518. At a 26x P/E $364. At a 20x P/E $280. At a 15x P/E $210. The CAGRs (rounding) on those prices from today are 20%, 11%, 6%, 0%, respectively. This compares to a CAGR of 41% over the last 3.5 years.\n\nI think a lot of people are expecting that 41% to continue. That's always what happens during run-ups like this. Personally, I would expect some multiple compression even if fundamentals do remain strong, just because they can't grow at the rate needed to justify a 37x P/E long-term. I think a realistic assumption is getting back to around a 15x-20x P/E, which would put us roughly in a range of $200-$250.\n\nOf course, we also have to assume we don't enter a bear market, the Fed keeps pumping, and all that fun stuff. Because if the market corrects again then everything drops.\n\nThis is the kind of thing I do for any company I am seriously looking at buying into. What are multiples now versus historical? What are growth rates versus multiples? Do they align? If not, why not? And if things have changed then why and is that sustainable long-term?\n\nI am not good at trend investing. My brain doesn't work that way. I have to have fundamentals to fall back on, something to ground me in the price expectation. When prices get out of line with what I think is a reasonable range, I can't help but think this isn't sustainable and things will correct at some point.

{"title": "$PTON - Why Peloton Is Going To The Moon Pt. 2", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\n[I posted my first deep dive here about why Peloton ($PTON) is going to the moon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hm22dp/pton_potential_to_be_the_next_big_company/) At the time, the stock was at \\~$55, we are now at $72. \n\n.Here are a few more reasons why this stock truly has the potential to become the new \"meme\" stock, the new PRPL stock, and the new stock to finally make you some fucking money.\n\n1. Traffic to Peloton's site continues to skyrocket to historic levels. Here's a snapshot of their August 2019 traffic numbers (<1M visitors per month). Now, they are projected to do (>2M visitors per month). This means that demand and traffic HAS NOT slowed in Q3 and they should continue to see meteoric growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[August 2019 Traffic](https://preview.redd.it/jlhscs5quwe51.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=9764264f71333e6afed4e218d86ecbe40e80515d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[August 2020 Traffic](https://preview.redd.it/d7hgcmoruwe51.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=a362ef14c955dc40bb5eed08c0cb37c2c22f6372)\n\n2. You'll also notice the paid traffic numbers in August 2019 vs. August 2020. No advertising means they can't supply all the bikes to customers fast enough. More importantly, it means Peloton is going to post absurdly profitable metrics when they report in Q2 and Q3. Even though Peloton has healthy gross margins (>60%), investors will begin to salivate once they see huge EBIDTA margins driven by a huge pull-back in advertising.\n\n3. As our good PRPL friends have been also talking about, job openings/postings have also been sky-rocketing. As evidenced by the chart below, their effective job openings (I'm going to assume much of that is manufacturing capability) has grown 2.5x YoY, matching winter capacity which is usually their biggest months. This means that they are forecasting Christmas like demand for the rest of the year in order to fulfill all the backlog of orders and future orders. This is a good sign of a company that has high confidence of sustained demand. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dd6xzwjdvwe51.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa0a87090c28319bca66bc35ec29f6d78ae9d82a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. When COVID hit, Peloton announced a free 90 day trial of their $12 digital fitness subscription (no bike required). They also publicly disclosed that 1,000,000 people signed up for that subscription. Prior to that, Peloton announced they had 850K subscribers (most through the bike). If they can maintain a good retention rate (TBD), Peloton could effectively double the # of subscribers in their customer base. Although these customers will be on the $12 plan, Wall Street will LOVE to see this progress as it pushes Peloton more into the tech/saas valuation vs. hardware valuation where multiples are much less attractive.\n\n5. If Peloton announces any sort of cheaper treadmill, bike, rower, or any new product developments in their next earnings report, the stock will soar. One of the biggest \"drawbacks\" of Peloton stock is the Total Addressable Market is too small. By introducing a low cost option, Peloton will not only increase their customer base, they will increase their effective margin per customer as more customers on the $40 subscription plan will increase LTV (lower CAC etc) and they can leverage their fixed costs more effectively.\n\n6. COVID. I don't know if you guys have been following the news, but COVID is still ravaging the country. Most of the tech-liberal elites refuse to go out  and not that this matters at all, I've personally met over 6 people in the last 2 weeks that have recently purchased a Peloton. At best case scenario, even if we get a vaccine by EOY, it would still take months to deploy the vaccine and then get people to actually take the vaccine. Factor in another few months for gyms to get back to full capacity and people still being scared and it could be another 12-18 months before people are back to \"normal.\" If Peloton is right at at-home fitness is here to stay for the long-run, they have the largest moat and are well positioned to dominate the market. \n\nWorst case scenario, they are a very attractive acquisition target for a Nike or even Apple. \n\nPosition: 1000 shares, $60c 1/21, $65c 1/21, $70c, 1/21.

{"title": "INTC BUY BUY BUY", "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI\u2019m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel \u2018Stunning Failure\u2019 Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance ~~chip~~ processor market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an Apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - **we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance**. Whether that\u2019s two months from now, or two years from now, INTC is gonna come back.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. And then once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. Bears r fuk.\n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP. Buy shares. Buy long calls.
