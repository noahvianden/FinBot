{"title": "Since the stock split announcement, every minute you spend asking reddit if you should buy TSLA, you lose $0.17.", "selftext": "On average TSLA has gone up $67.1/day since the announcement of the stock split. Market hours are open 6.5 hours each day. Each hour is about $10.32 so for every minute you spend asking reddit if you should buy, you\u2019ve lost $0.17/share. Don\u2019t question the meme stock. It actually has a product that is in high demand and the stock went nowhere in the previous 10 years (floated around $100-400) and at the time, it was undervalued because 99% of people didn\u2019t understand it.\n\nEdit: this post is NOT suggesting to buy now. But it\u2019s also not suggesting to sell or wait for the dip to buy either. Make your own decisions. The risk is very high. If you invest now, it could go up another 5-10% to only drop 30%. No one knows at this point. There\u2019s a lot of catalysts coming up in September like battery day and Q3 earnings. Don\u2019t be surprised if we see a sell off before or immediately after. There\u2019s very high expectations for the million mile battery. \n\nAs always, do your own research and invest based on your own risk tolerance.

Trading at nearly 33x forward earnings with Azure growth now under 50% means that they will likely need to identify a new leg of growth to keep commanding such a premium valuation. Azure has been the main driver of the margin and EPS expansion story the past 3-4 years, so as it matures to AWS type growth (30s %), it will be tough for MSFT to keep up the same level of relative outperformance as we have seen. \n\nI would also say it\u2019s a wait-and-see as far as the TikTok acquisition (or not). Nadella did a great job overseeing the LinkedIn integration and allowing the site to maintain autonomy and therefore brand strength. TikTok at a $50bn valuation could be a high risk-high reward play. Yes, it\u2019s currently the platform of choice for Gen Z. But even still, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger all have higher DAUs.
