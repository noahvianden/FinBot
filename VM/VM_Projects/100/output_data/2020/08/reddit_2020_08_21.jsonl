This trend is likely true for the entire recovery. The market modestly punished wmt for a day but mostly brushes it off.\n\nWednesday the Fed does not say anything supporting the yield control that these crazy bulls keep talking about, they also remind us that the economy is not good and we need stimulus.

Thats right **over 1000!** Say what you want about p/e not being important but when it gets to these levels it matters. Its like people expect teslas to be in everyones driveway within 5 years. Like gas cars will disappear and Toyota, GM, and VW are entirely are incapable of making an EV. It is retarded.\n\nMeanwhile, Footlocker has very impressive earnings, reinstates their dividend, and it goes up only 1 percent. How does that make any sense? \n\nHow long can the idiots run this market? It has become spiteful to reality. Its just, take what makes sense and do the exact opposite. Seriously wtf is happening? Its not just the fed, there has to be some serious manipulation going on behind the scenes. If we're going to say its inflation, then why is gold continuing to fall?

The economy and the stock market are not the same thing. Rational behavior is predictable. The market is composed of nothing more than buyers and sellers and so really I'm only saying that the behavior of buyers and sellers would become predictable if it were rational. Unexpected macro events would cause rational buyers and sellers to change their behavior in reaction. And it would be a predictable change because it would conform to rational principles. Sellers would sell if the macro event caused economic harm that would cause buyers and holders of stock to lose interest in buying and holding and vice versa. But rational behavior is like chess at a certain point or even mathematics... there is a rationally optimal or logically deducible action. This action is calculable and therefore predictable. Conversely, irrational behavior is generally not predictable.  \n\n\nLastly, there can be degrees of predictability. If you can reduce possibilities down to a minimum of outcomes then it is 'more' predictable. I actually don't know if perfectly rational market participants would be perfectly predictable but they certainly would be more predictable. The economy, since it is the origin of things, will always introduce novelty - or newness - and novelty is unpredictable (like the weather) mostly. Game theory could predict the behavior of perfectly rational actors responding to a novel economy pretty well... but this is my speculation as I don't work with game theory much. Thanks for replying. Sorry if I wrote too much - 3 years in grad school had me writing a lot lol.\n\nEdit: About the risk: So when a company underperforms expectations or when companies change due to unexpected macro events would you know how rational buyers and sellers would respond to the realities as they occur? If you would then they are predictable and you could probably avoid much of the risk of loss if you knew how they would respond... Maybe a stock market composed of perfectly rational buyers and sellers wouldn't be perfectly predictable and therefore zero risk but the risk would be much, much lower than what we have. The risk-free interest rate refers to the interest rate on US treasuries bills. Lending money to the US government in effect is considered risk free. The US government could default in principle though. We call it risk free because that has always just been so improbable. So when I said the stock market would become risk-free I didn't mean it in an absolute sense. It would be much lower risk like government bonds though. For the most part, the low risk of govt bonds is a big reason (but not the only one) that they are low reward.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "no, the stock market being rational would not make it predictable. only its reactions would be predictable.

The people who already owned the stock would benefit, and a small amount of the very first people to respond to the new information would benefit in decreasing amounts until it found its new price. At the new price there would be no more rational reaction to exploit so no predictible profit. A rational market doesnt mean theres no speculation or difference of opinion.

I could see them raising $5-10B from this S&P 500 inclusion which gives them a ridiculously large war chest to invest in expanding production across all segments. They also might not. \n\nIf you assume a Gigafactory costs \\~$1B per 200k capacity, they need roughly to invest $10B over the next \\~30 months (2.5 years aka 10 quarters). This comes to \\~1B per Q. Tesla has generated \\~700m in cash flow from operations averaged over the last 8 quarters. This will rise dramatically over the next 2-3 years. They don't really need more capital, but considering how cheap equity capital is for them (1% dilution would be $3.82B), it might make sense to dilute.\n\nOne reason why they might not raise capital is that all of these convertible bonds (\\~10M shares over the next \\~ 4 years) will bring in \\~$200-300 per share from the call/warrant spread that Tesla put on. Also, if Elon exercises his options he must pay \\~$350 per share.

{"title": "Love you guys - more than you will ever know - hence the warning. The market is dying.", "selftext": "# \"This Is NOT Normal\": A Stunned Morgan Stanley Says Volumes Are \"Way Beyond Just Low\"\n\nWhile stocks have soared to new all time highs, there has been one aspect about this latest meltup that suggests the rally is built on nothing but hot air (and trillions in Fed liquidity injections of course): the complete lack of volume, prompting some to wonder if the Fed has finally succeeded in 'killing' the market. And sure enough, as Morgan Stanley's Rob Cronin writes in an overnight note, \"**this is NOT a typical August lull in liquidity.\"** \n\n### The Market Has Died\n\nThe MS team points out that **volumes across almost all products are way below historic seasonal averages.** Which is bizarre because this is on the back of the highest volume Jan-to-July we have seen since 2010 (except single name options where volumes were the worst Jan-July since 2010). As the bank explains, the exaggerated August drop in liquidity (leading to higher impact costs) is driven by:\n\n1. large amounts of trading behind us in 2020\n2. spot level in equities \\~65% recovered\n3. in options, vol levels are still too high for many directional funds.\n\nThe exception is cash equities where volumes are only slightly below August norms, bid/offer spreads are not wide and data shows more intraday trading vs. closing auction use than normal - indicative of more active trading in single names, which in turn suggests that retail trading remains solid. The rest of August is likely to remain subdued as seasonally volumes are unlikely to pick up until the first week of September.\n\n*Below we republish key excerpts from the MS note:*\n\nWe look at liquidity across 6 products and compare average volumes traded from Aug 1st to 18th from 2010 to now.\n\n* Over the last 10Y, SX5E futures would typically have traded an average \\~$41bn a day so far in August. This year it\u2019s just $29bn (-**28% lower than normal August levels**).\n* SX5E index options traded an average of just 639k contracts/day so far in August, -**48% below normal levels.** 20d volumes this low were last seen in 2013.\n* From 1st to 18th August 2019, SX5E dividend futures traded $380m/day \u2013 this year it\u2019s just $84m **(-62% vs. normal Aug levels).**\n\nCash equities stands out as being more \u2018normal\u2019, registering volumes that are only slightly below historic norms for this time of year. SX5E traded on average $12bn/day in August (-10% below seasonal norms) and SXXP traded $39bn (-4% below seasonal norms).\n\nChart on the left breaks out SX5E futs vs. cash volumes (the cash volumes include data across all execution venues). We can see the drop in futures volumes is more pronounced as cash. Chart on the right shows the volume difference from Aug 1st to 18th of 2020 vs. the average of the same period of the last 10Y. The actual ADV for this year is marked on each bar. Again, you can see here the relatively better cash volumes vs. other products for this timeWith the exception of dividend futures (where notional traded is typically <0.5% of equity futs), **the biggest seasonal drop in volumes has come in SX5E index options where 20d MA volumes just hit levels last seen in 2013** (left chart below). In the last 5 days, we traded $5bn of combined put/call delta per day vs. \\~$12bn/day 5Y average. Over-writing programs appear as active as ever, but non-directional volatility selling strategies (var sellers) and directional option users are less active.\n\nSingle name options had the WORST Jan-July of volumes since 2010 \u2013 totally at odds with other asset classes. In March, the ratio of notional SX5E index option notional volume traded vs. notional traded in SX5E single names reached 37x \u2013 a 10Y high (we have adjusted the SX5E single name basket to allow for index rebals through time). The ratio has since fallen to 15x (right chart below) driven by the drop in index. Both SNO and index option volumes are <1st %-ile vs. 2010.\n\nSeparately, MS also notes that in Q1 2020, **bid offer spreads in cash hit new highs.** The average SX5E name traded \\~12bps wide at their worst (vs. Jan 1st level of 3bps) while the Small Cap SCXP index names traded as high as 32bps wide (vs. Jan 1st level of 12bps). The good news is that spreads have tightened by \\~80% since with the indices now trading 4bps and 15bps wide respectively, which is a \"sign of normality in cash\", at least until the next time the market goes bidless.\n\nFinally, at the SX5E/SXXP level, use of the closing auction has fallen sharply in the last month. It\u2019s likely that those trading cash equities are more active/intraday players. This is supported further by the fact that key cyclical sectors are seeing the least use of the auction over the last week (Banks use is just 13%, 1st percentile vs. 2012).  \n\n\nSummary - The \u2018market\u2019 is an illusion. Lots of option trading but no one buying stonks with cash. I.e. putting their dicks on the table. Prices being driven up daily to fantastic new highs. No one is selling. Part is FOMO paralysis, but much is institutional investors whose behaviour is formulaic, not knowing what the hell to do. So doing nothing.   \n\n\nLook, a \u2018normal, healthy\u2018  market has bulls and gay bears. Ying and Yang. Real money going in to buy and hold, real money flowing out to other things. Right now is a terribly easy market to pump and dump. No depth. A purple market. A corn market. Corn!!!?   \n\n\nThe market right now is vapour. The Fed IS the market. Do you trust the Fed? Sure, the merry go round could continue for some time. Who knows?   \n\n\nTLDR: The party is over. Like many I lost the window of opportunity between March and July. Could kick myself.

I've seen many others say that most of the time you should sell the options contract rather than exercising it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Correct, you would just sell the options contract to the open market. It will get exercised eventually, by the institution or person who is holding it, if it is in the money enough for it to be profitable. The only reason you may not make as much by selling the contract is if the underlying stock keeps going up after you sold. So if you had a call expiring Friday, that is currently in the money and you sold it to the market at a profit at 3:50pm, the stock could surge up at 3:55 and you missed out on those profits. But it\u2019s a good idea to sell and get out of the position. \n\nIf you had a call that was ITM that expires on Friday, and you forgot to sell before market close, your broker would probably auto-exercise the contract after hours before the contract officially expires. So let\u2019s say you had a 35C contract expiring Friday and the stock closed at 40 on Friday. If you still hold the contract, your broker will auto exercise meaning you will pay $3500 and gain possession of 100 shares of the company. Even if you don\u2019t have $3500 cash in your account, they could exercise it and put you in the negative. Then on Monday you could sell the 100 shares for $4000 and you would reimburse the $3500 in the negative your account was. \n\nBut what if something happens over the weekend and that stock opened Monday morning at $20 a share? You would have paid $3500 for shares Friday that are now only worth $2000. It\u2019s safer to sell the contract to the open market. Of course, on the flip side, the stock could open up at $50 on Monday and you\u2019ll be glad you exercised and didn\u2019t sell the contract off. I wouldn\u2019t recommend exercising a contract if you don\u2019t have the capital to pay for the shares, because you\u2019re still on the hook for the exercise price no matter what the shares do by Monday.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re long term bullish on the company anyways, and you\u2019re okay buying at $35 by exercising, and you have the capital available, you could exercise and hold onto those 100 shares as long as you want to. If you sold the option back to the market the day of expiration, you locked in your profits, and limited any risk/reward associated with the stock going forward. If you had $3500 available and exercised the option, and held those shares, you are staying invested in the price action of that stock, but in this case it would become a basic equity investment.\n\nIf we are to ignore this strategy, there is no circumstance where exercising an option and immediately selling the shares on the open market would be **more** or **less** profitable than selling the contract off. If it momentarily became more profitable to exercise, then trading algorithms would immediately detect an arbitrage opportunity, and would buy contracts on the open market, instantaneously exercising them and selling the shares at a profit. This action itself would drive the option\u2019s price up and would eliminate the arbitrage opportunity.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "ahh ok this is all really helpful, so the only cost would be the premium in beginning which in this case is 100 times the bid price?
