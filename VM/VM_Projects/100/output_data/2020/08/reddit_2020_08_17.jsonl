I am big on Tesla's FSD potential.  But I do think it will be quite a while before FSD is a complete analogy to airbags.

You don't get a choice as a consumer unless the seller is willing to commit a felony, though I'm not sure about the legality of removing them yourself on your own vehicle.  There will be a time in the future where it is mandatory, but I think it will take a long time for government regulations and market turnover to get to the point where airbags are now.  Producing enough vehicles that everyone in the country will be able to have one will take quite a while already, many cars still in use 10 years from now will not be capable of an FSD upgrade and you can't very well just make it illegal to own those in this kind of timeframe\n\nWhenever the law is made that new cars will require FSD, manufacturers will likely be given no less than 5 years to comply with it.

Base on miles driven per accident. Once these claims have been verified over bigger data sets, the want/need for FSD will only exponentially increase. This point might only take a year to reach.  \n\nMy question is still the same what is the value added to Tesla stock with only accounting for the safety factor, cool tech product factor, and or better driving experience factor?

Let's say the M3 SR in two years will take about $27k to build and sell it for $33k or some ridiculous value proposition and use it as a platform to push the software which adds $5k/car on average. Now you're pushing revenue of $38k/car average which means you're pushing the gross margins to nearly 30% while MASSIVELY increasing your potential market. \n\nElon has always said he wants to push for affordability and with the new castings, the wiring structure, battery advances and general factory efficiencies I think the production costs can really come down significantly.

Children work in mines at risk of collapse, use sharp tools, and lack safety equipment. Tesla is among five companies facing a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of 14 children and parents from the DRC, which includes allegations of \u201caiding and abetting in the death and serious injury of children who claim they were working in cobalt mines in their supply chain.\u201d3 While Tesla reports on cobalt sourcing procedures and indicates it is looking for ways to reduce the cobalt in its batteries, the company does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate its cobalt supply chain is free of child labor. Conflict minerals, steel, lithium, rubber, mica, and electronics may also present human rights risks for Tesla.\n\nIn Tesla's operations, a federal judge ruled in 2019 that Tesla violated labor laws on 12 different occasions for preventing employees from exercising their right to unionize, including disciplining and firing employees for union activity.\n\nWorking conditions and high injury rates in Tesla's factories may violate the human right to safe and healthy working conditions. From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont, CA plant had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as 10 major U.S. auto plants combined, resulting in fines.6 Insufficient safety trainings, noncompliant safety markings, exposure to toxins, and undercounting or mislabeling of injuries, which may falsely signal an improvement in conditions, have been documented at Tesla's plants.\n\nWhile Tesla has a Supplier Code of Conduct, a \u201cHuman Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy,\u201d and says it commits to \u201conly sourcing responsibly produced materials,\u201d these guidelines only apply to suppliers.

If it's so complicated, why can every human do it?  The hardest parts of learning how to drive are getting used to how much pressure to put on the gas and break to make the drive comfortable.  How much gap is required to safely left turn across traffic, things like that. Most accidents aren't caused by an inability to drive properly, but by a lack of attention in the moment, or something happening where 1-2 drivers aren't currently looking.  Driving in general is pretty easy.  Roads are a REASONABLY controlled environment.\n\nYou can think of the randomness of driving and the weird rare actions as a brand new strategy in a game like Go, or Chess.  Brand new, out of the box, never seen before.  Yet the computer rolls with it and crushes the opponent anyway, because to a computer, it's only very very slightly different than normal, all it has to do is avoid the weirdness and continue on its merry way.\n\nFor now, the learning is supervised.  Keep in mind, humans drive Tesla's.  Even when their software is not driving, the software runs in shadow mode comparing itself to what the human driver does and learning from the differences.  I do something it doesn't expect or wouldn't have done, it immediately sends that to the mothership as an \"interesting\" occurrence, which can then be used to train for the situation.\n\nSoon(ish), self supervised learning will happen via Tesla's DOJO project.  Once NNs get to self-supervised learning is when they never lose to a human again in any context.  Up until that point, they will only win 99.9% of the time.  That's probably enough for level 5 driving.\n\nKeep in mind, humans are not even close to perfect drivers.  Even the level 2.5 stuff Tesla's do now is unquestionably safer on highway drives than a human driver.  Statistics show this very very clearly already.  Level 5 doe snot mean there are never mistakes and never issues.  It means that in all cases it does a better job than humans by a significant margin.

{"title": "TD Ameritrade Almost Infinite Buying Power", "selftext": "Disclaimer: you really shouldn\u2019t do this, especially if you are not 95% sure the direction the stock will go within a short timeframe\n\nI discovered this completely by accident but on think or swim, if you create an OCO (on cancel order) order with very little price incriminates, multiple orders can get filled regardless of whether or not you actually have the money in you\u2019re account. You still need the money to cover the first order but in the event subsequent orders get filled before the system can cancel, the contracts are yours. For whatever reason, TD Ameritrade lets the trade play out despite the lack of funds which is somewhat impressive. One response I got was, you\u2019re a grown up, it\u2019s you\u2019re account. If things go wrong it\u2019s on you but if it works out, we won\u2019t take you\u2019re gains. \n\nFirst time \nI was trying to get rid of my spy call at open back in June. They were worth maybe $1200 according to the profit option calculator but I didn\u2019t know for sure so I set sell orders for $12, $12.05, $12.10, etc up to maybe $12.30. $12 got filled, but I guess $12.05 got filled also so I was now naked the call despite my account not being approved for it. I called them up crying, begging to get out the trade, the agents like man calm down, you\u2019re up $50 on the trade, leg up or down to create a spread and you\u2019re guaranteed to win no matter what. \n\nSecond \nLam research a week before earnings. I had a good idea lam would beat but wasn\u2019t willing to bet my life on it. My account balance got wiped out maybe 95% and only shot up after lam beat and the stock rose long enough for me to unload down some poor kids throat at the high. \n\nThird time\nNvda this Friday. Nvda will hit $500 and maybe $520. I had Oco to get $500c exp sep 4 ($932 each) I got filled multiple times against my account value. Unloaded this morning for 100% gain.... Kinda hoping the stock drops so I can get back in. The dumbest thing I did was hedge by selling $520c friday instead of manning up and waiting until Monday.\n\n\nThis usually happens to me on accident. But let\u2019s say you are bullish and just know a stock will jump, theoretically you could max out you\u2019re buying power with a single order, and hope you\u2019re other orders get filled before the system can cancel them. \n\nIf you are wrong, god help you!

{"title": "DD - RXT, Amazon and Microsoft's Service Provider (Long Play)", "selftext": "Alright, listen up retards - this is some potentially good shit that you may be ignoring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRackspace Technology (RXT) IPO'd August 5th at $16.85 to a lukewarm reception, mainly due to the fact that much more formidable companies were IPO'ing the same day or week (BIGC, RKT). Since then the shares have popped a bit - most likely closing today around 18.00.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is Rackspace?\n\nRackspace is a cloud computing service provider. Since most of you can barely use a keyboard, I'll explain further.\n\nTheir primary business comes from developing cloud solutions for clients utilizing third-party cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, etc.). In addition, Rackspace also provides long-term service for the systems that they develop. The industries that they are involved in is extremely diverse - from automotive maintenance to energy/government services.\n\nRackspace also maintains partnerships with almost all of the aforementioned major cloud computing providers present in the industry. This allows them to more effectively bargain with the providers whose platforms they are using - granting them a more advantageous price point than other competitors. These partnerships also help to retain their customer base as it allows for more complex solutions to be developed for changing circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ok, so what?\n\nI believe that the major mistake individual investors are making when it comes to evaluating RXT is that they believe that they are *competing* instead of *cooperating* with the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Rackspace's goal when it comes to dealing with these giants is to leverage their service's potential to obtain a better price point for their use of large provider's cloud platforms. This allows Rackspace to generate income not only on the service contracts they provide - but also on the margin that is created from the reduced costs of infrastructure.\n\nBecause Rackspace is good at what they do, managing cloud infrastructure, these larger cloud providers see the potential to offload a part of their managed services to them at a better price - saving the cloud providers money and providing Rackspace with additional revenue. The truth of the matter, however, is that the more managed cloud business that these providers handoff to decrease costs, the more leverage and bargaining power Rackspace gains - further allowing Rackspace to reduce costs for the infrastructure they build.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ok, fine. So what happens when Amazon and Microsoft start providing the service instead?\n\nFair question, you fucking retard.\n\nIn short, they won't. It's far too costly for the meager payoff that they would get from it. Also, because of the fact that Rackspace is generating revenue from the reduced costs to build their systems, it may not be economically feasible for a larger cloud provider to get into this market. Amazon AWS cannot create a leverageable position in the market by utilizing all platforms simultaneously as they can only provide AWS - the same goes for Microsoft Azure, etc.\n\nThe most likely way that one of these larger players would get into this market is buying out RXT, not forming a competitor from scratch. This seems likely as RXT is currently owned by Apollo Global Management (who took the company private in 2016). Apollo most likely took RXT public to recoup some of their initial investment, however, the company going public once again signals that the firm is willing to accept a buyout from another major player.\n\nAlso, an additional note, RXT's current market cap is low - about 3.7 billion. For a company like Microsoft or Amazon, this is a drop in the bucket. If Rackspace continues to do what they do well and there is growth in the market they exist in - one of these larger players will absolutely buy out the firm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions or ban faggot\n\nI suggest going long on shares for this one. I know you autists like options plays and have the long term horizons of an onlyfans e-girl, but there's far too much potential long-term on this one to miss out on getting shares when they're cheap. If you have some real balls you can look into February 2021 options (2/19 25c) but they're currently not trading normally due to options being introduced recently for the stock. If you can get them cheap it might be worth it, but I would suggest just dumping money into shares.\n\nMy suggestion would be to try to get in on shares at anywhere around 17.50 - 17.75, increasing position steadily up to 19.00 - 19.50. This stock has too much potential to ignore, and with only about 200M shares outstanding any good news / high profit will throw this thing to the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR ; Buy the dips on RXT and increase position over time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards you fucking idiots", "id": "iblsbp", "created_utc": 1597694890.0, "score": 82, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Does she have Rackspace though?

If you're a medium-sized construction company and want to create a comprehensive cloud-based solution to manage supply, inventory, new sales, and customer relationship management, AWS or Azure won't build that for you -- they are mostly self-service. But Rackspace will.

Sure, Amazon or a smaller competitor might be able to replicate this experience for clients but the cost is so astronomical that it may not be a viable strategy. What is a viable strategy, however, is acquiring a stake in RXT and using it to leverage their support structure to their advantage.\n\nI feel as though this article also misses, or overlooks, a big fact about RXT as well: the value added by their services outweighs the cost of doing business with them in the modern world. Medium sized firms in today's market NEED cloud solutions to survive (along with most smaller firms as well) and paying Rackspace to build and service these platforms is a no brainer from a cost perspective.

Communism is the end goal of Socialism and can be described as a moneyless, classless, stateless society. This end goal will take a long time to reach and requires many societal changes. If you do the research you'll see that essentially all existing and past Socialist states exist in countries that were plagued by feudal, Capitalist or imperial control, and the workers of these countries decided to overthrow their oppressors.

This term means a task that can be split for parallel computation practically infinitely (not really infinitely, but as far as to utilize all discrete compute units).\n\nFor example a rendering engine, where every single pixel on your screen can be computed independently is \"embarrassingly parallel\". Because you can split it off to 2 million+ independent machines for every pixel you have.\n\nOf course, it's more practical to gather significant compute power in one place, with one set of APIs, so it's convenient to use. Supercomputers also have high-speed interconnect to facilitate quick exchange of data between units. But it can also be split up, it doesn't matter much for the vast majority of tasks you run, especially if they're so theoretically large, that they exceed an entire supercomputer (which most tasks don't).\n\nA super computer is inherently parallel. It's not just one super-fast serial execution core. The languages used for utilizing super-computers focus on vector and array processing, which is parallel processing, not serial.\n\nYou can split such workloads across different networks and supercomputers, but usually you don't have to because it's not as if any particular task takes up THE ENTIRE SUPERCOMPUTER.
