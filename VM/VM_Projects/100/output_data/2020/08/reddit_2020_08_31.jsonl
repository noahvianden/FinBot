Well, no, it reflects the earnings of the companies that are part of the stock market. The vast majority of businesses in America are not publicly traded. They're not in the Dow 30; they're not even in the S&P 500 or the Wilshire 5000. They're privately held companies, so they're not part of it.  \n>  \n>So, if you look at the makeup of the publicly traded companies especially on a market cap basis, which companies are doing the best? Amazon, Netflix, those type of companies. \\[...\\] What's happening today is heavily impacting smaller companies, mom-and-pop type companies. These are the ones that are struggling, and so, since these big companies now have less competition from smaller companies, that benefits the stock market.  \n>  \n>So to say, oh look, the stock market is booming, that means we have a strong economy. We don't. It is the weakness in the economy that is benefiting the stock market, and the weaker the economy gets, the better it's going to be for the stock market. Because what happens when the economy is weak? The Fed prints even more money, we get bigger stimulus. It does nothing for Main Street, it *sedates* Main Street, but it continues to pump air into the stock market bubble.\n\n**TL;DR** Most companies are not listed on any major stock exchange. When you see the S&P 500 up on the year, it's not the economy that's roaring. It's the mega cap FANG stocks, large-cap multinational retailers like Walmart and Target, big pharma, fintech, etc. None of the stock indexes reflect small businesses or even the overall economy.

Now that's an attitude that's changing (I think for the worse, but I understand the counter argument), but half the country at least still feels this way. Also we're fat and old and have a lot of nursing homes. 94% of all covid deaths had 2.6 co-morbities. So only 6% of covid deaths were just healthy people randomly dying of covid. That's a pretty small number when we compare covid to all cause mortalities and things like driving which is a right we'd never give up for safety.

{"title": "Slack ($WORK) - Discord for grown-ups and why this SaaS company could be a solid tendie safehouse", "selftext": "Slack, traded publicly as $WORK, is a cloud-hosted software company specializing in IRC-style features, including Discord-like channels organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging.  \n\nSlack offers mostly B2B (business-to-business) services in the financial, healthcare, government,manufacturing, tech and other industries. These same industries have been transitioning employees from in-office working conditions to virtual and work-from-home arrangements. Slack killed it in Q1, seeing over 12,000 new customers, $201.7 million total, and 50% revenue growth year-over-year.   \n\nSlack released guidance during their Q1 call, expecting total revenue of $206 million to $209 million, representing year-over-year growth of 42% to 44%, respectively.  \n\nMore importantly, Slack is growing away from just IRC and into corporate directory business. On July 8th, Slack announced that it is acquiring Rimeto, a startup that provides customers with more detailed employee directories and profiles. Additionally, Slack is adding several hundred employees to its workforce, with over 100 career openings as of the writing of this post.  \n\nNow, let's get to the stonks.  \n\nSlack announced earnings for September 8th, which is 5 business days from now. Investors expect a run-up, as we finally broke through the trading wedge on August 25th: (https://imgur.com/jWmDSgl). Slack saw weak movement from July 31st through August 25th, clocking an aggregate 3.3% loss down to $28. However, since August 25th, Slack is up 12% to $32.\n\nDuring Q1's earning run-up for the same 5-day run-up period from May 28th to June 3rd we saw a 22% increase in the stock price, from $32.5 to $39. We have already seen a 12% run-up since August 25th, with more room to go. Based on trend forecasts, we could see a run-up to $38.90 again, just like last earnings season.  \n\nGoing forward, Slack has a LOT of potential as the go-to IRC-style chatroom, with room to innovate in the work-from-home world. It's not going to replace Zoom, Teams, etc., but will act as a staple supplement for corporate communications, and playing this earning season and beyond could easily bag you some good tendies.  \n\nPositions - 9/11 36.5c (solid) and 10/2 34c (conservative).  \n\nEdit - to be sure, I don't really recommend holding these through earnings.

Microsoft Teams always shows large gains for the same keywords, one spike during the lockdowns and then another beginning in summer and continuing to now.\n\nOne exception as you can see is \"Slack login\", which has seen a large and consistent steady growth. \n\nI think what you could interpret this as people all installed Slack in April, or that there has been a steady-state amount of new people installing Slack, but that active users have continued to accumulate (as evidenced by more people googling for the login). So that does point to user growth even if trends results for \"download\" don't suggest much. Basically a steady state level of new people are downloading (flat line for \"download slack\"), and then that adds to the total number of users googling \"login\" over time. So people are sticking with it.\n\nSo could this be bullish for Slack stickiness in orgs and people possibly upgrading to the paid models as they accumulate a message history/user base etc.?
