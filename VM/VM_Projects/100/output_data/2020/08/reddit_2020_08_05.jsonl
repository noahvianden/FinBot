{"title": "Take advantage of the overreaction!", "selftext": "The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend.\n\nWhile Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. \n\nThere is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia\u2019s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia\u2019s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product\u2019s architecture be. \n\nConcerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. \n\nFor investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny.\n\n**TLDR**: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

Intel chose this route as opposed to EUV, which TSMC chose (incidentally, Intel are trying to use EUV on their own 7nm, which should show you which decision was right). The structure of quad patterning means that it is inherently prone to lower yields. When you combine this with the monolithic structure of Intel's CPUs, it will be impossible for them to produce high core-count chips (i.e. server/TOTL desktop) in any volume with the margins that they've seen historically. No amount of +++++++ will change this fact. I said two years ago that 10nm would be a complete writeoff and I stand by that today.\n\nYour point about IP is very valid. In my models I forecast that AMD will have very little share in the datacentre GPUs (but AMD has their own raytracing implementation coming out with the new consoles; which imo will be more efficient than Nvidia's due to Microsoft writing DXR with AMD's hardware in mind), but their IP helps out massively in the CPU arena. It'll be very difficult for Intel to build a competitor to chiplets without infringing on patents - which is the only way 10nm could be viable.\n\nAs for taking people at face value:\n\n[https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017](https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017)\n\nIntel have announced delays to 10nm by 'a year' for every year since 2016.

It's very much in their favour to help AMD out as much as possible with wafer supply, and limit Intel's own production. AMD's long term success ensures growth for TSMC; while Intel's long term success would mean they reclaim the process crown and constrict TSMC's market share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree that AMD is highly priced right now - they're above my valuation for the first time ever, while Intel is slightly underpriced. However, in the past few years AMD have consistently executed on their roadmaps, increasing their value while Intel has constantly screwed up, decreasing theirs. It's very possible that you buy into Intel now, while its' price> value, but then value decreases as they continue to fail and your price is never realised.\n\nTLDR: The big picture is that 10nm is a total writeoff, and 7nm is looking pretty shoddy as well. They bit off more than they could chew trying to get GaaFets to work. Intel's dominance and past price has been built on its process lead, and losing that lead and having to go to TSMC who will treat them poorly justifies a large drop in price.
