And then, it looks like, all previous prices are multiplied by $9. So what looks like $900 in 2014, in real-time may only have been a price of $20, but the number is much larger looking back after several reverse splits. If that makes sense...\n\nThen of course there's constant creation of new stocks throughout the years, and/or buy backs. A company that had 10 million outstanding shares in 2010 may have 100 million shares today - and this presumably has an effect on the price.\n\nAll of the prologue above to ask: is there a place to view stock charts by market cap rather than price?
