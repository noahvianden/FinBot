{"title": "9/3 Today as of 11:20 am it is starting to look positive for Put/Call Gamma Imbalance DAY for options traders to POTENTIALLY make VERY HIGH return in the Options Market !!!!!!", "selftext": "Good Morning Traders,\n\nI just want to put this out there for all options traders. Today as of now 11:20 am it is starting to look very positive for any options traders attempting to profit on the put/call gamma imbalance trades I have highlighted in the previous post.\n\nGood Luck if you take on the mean reversion strategy today!! :)\n\nFollow Traderfirstyear - [https://stocktwits.com/traderfirstyear](https://stocktwits.com/traderfirstyear)\n\nFor Additional Traderfirstyear [https://www.reddit.com/r/Traderfirstyear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Traderfirstyear/) \\- for more analysis prohibited posting in [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) (mods let me know if i can keep this statement?)\n\nCondensed version ;\n\n(1.) Buy Puts Now on QQQ, SPY, & DIA (if you want to buy on individual equities with high betas go for it)\n\n(2.) Sell your Puts on QQQ, SPY, & DIA at 3:45pm. Be very cautious of a market rebound around 3:15pm. This rebound happens from time to time and if it does you want to exit your put positions at 3:15 if no rebound you hold the puts until 3:45 pm and sell.\n\n(3.) Buy Calls at 3:55pm today (if you are unable to do the Puts just focus on buying calls at 3:55 pm) The market will likely revert higher at the open tomorrow.\n\n(4.) Make sure to pay attention to an accelerated sell off going into the final hour of trading. Market makers should be off-balance, but following quadruple witching there may not be enough of a gamma imbalance. However, the market is free to move and is tilting to a lower faster sell off into the afternoon.\n\nIf you are looking to take on the highlighted trade here are the instructions - (watch the video) or read directions\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/bo6s0u/putcall\\_gamma\\_options\\_traders\\_make\\_100\\_return\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/bo6s0u/putcall_gamma_options_traders_make_100_return_in/)\n\nWatch the video Watch \"Synthetic Futures Mean Reversion 2 (Redo Noise Eliminated)\" on YouTube [https://youtu.be/ln29nhGPShQ](https://youtu.be/ln29nhGPShQ)\n\nTrading Revolution is here :)\n\nPrevious Post as a reference [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/dcamoj/today\\_as\\_of\\_1000\\_am\\_it\\_is\\_starting\\_to\\_look/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/dcamoj/today_as_of_1000_am_it_is_starting_to_look/)", "id": "ilvi9a", "created_utc": 1599146689.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "What kind of calls are you targeting?

{"title": "The Only Bubble Here is the TSLA FUD", "selftext": "With TSLA bout to open in Correction Territory, the paper hands gang is off longing $ROPE and the Gay Bears are busy crying tears of joy into their wives' titties cause its the first time they've seen those funbags in years.  So I'm pretty sure the only people reading this are my fellow Papa Musk Cultist who can now say Buy The Dip easier than they can breath.\n\nWhile the naysayers are distracted, I got some news for you.  This correction is ***the last stop before this rocket heads to mars.***  What's that?  You've heard this song before?  Nah... not like this.  Let me show you.\n\nSo the selloff first started when TSLA announced a 5B$ Capitol Raise.  They about to dump shares to raise money.  Makes sense right?  If TSLA themselves is cashing in, why shouldn't we.\n\n[cause that shit is optional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh4TsZRzSEs)\n\nTSLA didn't dump 5B worth of shares Tuesday at the open.  Nah, Papa Elon is one of us.  He just filed BDE paper work that says \"You'll sell when TSLA wants, if TSLA wants, at the price TSLA wants\".  Now to be fair, TSLA absolutely will make good on this.  It's no secret at this point that the money will ensure their balance sheet/cash flow/fundamentals are squeaky clean ahead of SP inclusion, which is inevitable now that [salesforce just kicked Exxon out of the DOW](https://borneobulletin.com.bn/2020/08/reshuffling-the-dow-exxon-out-salesforce-in/).  Elon wants to see the SEC cry.\n\nBut what about other investors?  The selloff turned ugly when Wednesday morning, it was announced that a massive investor dumped their position.  I guess they wanted to take profits like TSLA right?\n\n[Nope, they sold because TSLA was literally too good](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/02/teslas-largest-outside-shareholder-reduces-holding-citing-portfolio-restrictions.html)\n\nTSLA shot up so fast that this firm was forced to reduce its position because TSLA became an \"outsized influence on the firm's holdings\".  In plain english: TSLA was doing better than the entire rest of the portfolio and it freaked out the risk team at the firm.  Bless their boomer hearts.  The firm still plans to hold as much TSLA as they possibly can which is about as bullish as you can get.\n\nBut this is where it gets juicy.  I think many of you autists know that the Market loves to fuck you.  And their ain't no better way to fuck than doggy.\n\nThat's why she loves making you look at something shiny on CNBC when the real shit is about to bend you over from behind.\n\nWell this idiot turned around and you know what I saw?\n\n[The Lucid Air](https://electrek.co/2020/09/02/lucid-air-beats-tesla-model-s-9-second-quarter-mile/)  \nWith its  [record setting battery range](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/the-all-electric-lucid-air-gets-an-estimated-epa-range-of-517-miles/) of 517 miles.  \nDebuting on [September 9th](https://www.lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-air-production-reveal)\n\nThis retard firmly believes MM's are dumping because they think when the Air is revealed, it will confirm the record shattering 517 mile range estimate and that will totally deflate TSLA.  Battery day will be playing catchup and the entire idea that Elon has this massive head start will go right out the window.\n\nAnd that would warrant a massive correction.  Here is the Catch.\n\nThe 517 Mile Range is [Not Confirmed by the EPA themselves](https://insideevs.com/reviews/438723/lucid-air-tesla-model-s-porsche-taycan-range/).  The Estimate comes from 3rd party testing.\n\nAnd when Porsche got a Third Party to give them an EPA estimate for the Taycan, [they overshot it by 40%](https://amcitesting.com/taycan/).\n\nSo in summary: I believe the correction is happening because investors think the Lucid Air is going to come out and totally wipe away Elon's \"it\" factor when some no-name startup overtakes them in battery tech.  I believe they are wrong and when the real EPA gives the Air a range around 300 miles, there is going to be a mad dash back to TSLA ahead of Battery day... and then its Q3 Earnings, SP Inclusion, Cyber Truck and Semi Sales beginning, potential of a TSLA Plane, and oh look when did TSLA go back to 2000?\n\nAlso Lucid is owned by [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Motors).

{"title": "Are we in a COVID/tech bubble? Here\u2019s how to tell (+ my thoughts)", "selftext": " We might be in a bubble. We\u2019re not at the later stages yet, but we\u2019re getting there. Here\u2019s a quick refresh on the 5 stages of a bubble and where I think we are in the stages.\n\n**1. Displacement**\n\n**A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a new paradigm, such as an innovative new technology or interest rates that are historically low. A classic example of displacement is the decline in the federal funds rate from 6.5% in July 2000, to 1.2% in June 2003. Over this three-year period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to a historic low of 5.23%, sowing the seeds for the subsequent housing bubble.**\n\nIn our case the displacement is the Coronavirus pandemic. It has completely shifted how we think about--and value--technology stocks. Everyone is talking about the \u201cpost COVID world\u201d and how that has upended tech companies.\n\n**2. Boom**\n\n**Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.**\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen record numbers of retail investors joining the ranks. Everyone is stuck at home with nothing else to do and a bit of extra money from the stimulus, so they are deciding to learn how to ~~gamble~~ invest.\n\n**3. Euphoria**\n\n**During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the \"greater fool\" theory\u2014the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more\u2014plays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.\ufeff Similarly, at the height of the internet bubble in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the Nasdaq was higher than the GDP of most nations.**\n\nIMO, we\u2019re in the early to mid stages of euphoria. Asset prices aren\u2019t skyrocketing, but they\u2019re increasing rapidly. It\u2019s not insane yet, but we\u2019re getting there. \n\n**4. Profit-Taking**\n\n**In this phase, the smart money\u2014heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point\u2014starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist John Maynard Keynes put it, \"the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\" In August 2007, for example, French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three investment funds with substantial exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages because it could not value their holdings.**\n\n\ufeff **While this development initially rattled financial markets, it was brushed aside over the next couple months, as global equity markets reached new highs. In retrospect, Paribas had the right idea, and this relatively minor event was indeed a warning sign of the turbulent times to come.**\n\nThis could be us if we\u2019re smart about it. Now, obviously we can\u2019t time the market perfectly. But we can play the odds and start hedging our bets when we get to a point where it seems likely that we\u2019re in a bubble. In the meantime we can still ride it out for a bit more gains. \n\n**5. Panic**\n\n**It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance.  In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.**\n\nDon\u2019t let this be you, but if it is, just sit tight and buy once prices drop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally**, a good warning sign that the market is entering bubble territory is the widespread use of the following expressions by supposed experts:\n\n* \u201cOur only problems are the problems of success\u201d\n* \u201cPrices have adjusted to a new paradigm in which higher valuations will be the norm\u201d\n* \u201cGlobalization/communications technology/freer trade/wealthy investors from some part of the world you\u2019ve never heard of justify these higher prices\u201d\n* And, of course, \u201cthis time, it\u2019s different\u201d.\n\nIt won\u2019t be.\n\n**What you should do:**\n\n* Watch out for these warning signs\n* When we start seeing mass hysteria and even more inflated prices, start hedging your bets with shorts or put options\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*much of the information about the stages of bubbles was taken  from an Investopedia article.
