Because most things have a beta to SPX, banks go around buying up tiny delta puts (think .05-.15 contracts) that expire the following Friday to replace the downside hedge that's rolling off that day.

Of course options can be traded peer to peer.\n\n--\n\n> Sure the majority of trades probably involve market makers but it's not particularly unusual not to.\n\nMy post had a clear intention and given the context the intention was clear: the OP conceived of option trading as peer-2-peer driven and did not incorporate the hedging dynamics with MMs; so my post needed to steer him away from their initial conception and towards understanding MM dynamics. Judging by the number of upvotes they received, OP was not alone -- which reinforces the need for clarification.\n\nIt was clear because OP phrased the question in a particular way and I responded in a topical way.\n\nFrom your phrasing, I don't understand your intention. Is it\n\n* to dispute the general trend?\n\n* to share personal experience?\n\n* to pick hair? (<--- this seems most likely to me)\n\n> When that happens, it's **almost certainly not** a MM, it's another trader or institution.\n\nRather, when that happens, it is still likely an MM. You can see this meet-you-at-the-middle type of trades frequently 10min before 4pm ET. What's the odds that you get a peer to match the opposite of your *combo* trade? (ie. if you don't sell combo, just take my words that combo trades get met in the middle as well.) MM has hedging needs that can be partially fulfilled by buying a net sell order.\n\nAnother way to see it is by noting the response time. BID/ASK starts off with its usual spread and the center moves with underlying in the usual way. Often, the moment you submit an order in between the spread -- ie. either moving BID up or moving ASK down -- your order is filled. That means, in the former case, ASK moved down, and in the latter, BID moved up. In other words, someone responded to the change in order book. When that response is near instantaneous, what's the odds of it being peer trader in a low volume environment? And indeed option trading on most assets are low volume.\n\nAll that is of course balanced against the much more frequent situations when you post orders in between BID/ASK and there is no taker.\n\n> This sub acts like market makers have some secret keys to the kingdom.\n\nNeither of the explanations as of the time of your posting said that.
