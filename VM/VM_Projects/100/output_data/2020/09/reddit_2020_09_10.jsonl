{"title": "IMPORTANT FOR NEW TRADERS: UNDERSTANDING HOW MARKET MAKERS WORK", "selftext": "Given that there seems to be a large misconception of what market makers are, I felt it prudent to share some information. I often here the phrase \"the market makers just want to take your money and keep the stock away from $X price.\" This is inherently incorrect.\n\nMarket making is the identification of buyers and sellers with the intention of allowing them to consummate transactions. It is all done algorithmically.\n\nExchanges offer rebates to market makers in exchange for those market makers providing liquidity in different markets \u2013 they will pay MMs to hold short or long positions that provide liquidity in the market\n\n**Example:** A person wants to sell her stock for $51.00, but the current best offer (bid) is $49.00. If another market participant was desperate enough to purchase the stock, they would just move the bid to the ask. In this case, the liquidity provider is the participant who posted the $51.00 ask, meaning that they provided supply of that stock, which was sold.\n\nIf the algorithm decided that the fair price was $50.75 and the buyer was satisfied enough to purchase the asset at $50.75, the transaction would be consummated, and the seller would receive a rebate (in the form of a payment for their order flow)\n\nSome of this fee would come from the buyer (in the form of commissions, hence why when you hit the bid or ask, you are charged a higher fee with most brokerages, but when you leave your order open at the bid or ask and it is taken up on, you pay a lower commissions since you helped to provide liquidity)\n\nThere is essentially an algorithmic hunt for rebates occurring.\n\n[Diagram depicting Market Maker activity in a transaction](https://preview.redd.it/h7mh5rifjem51.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f810d26d65dcf94e103e0d31cf86d90edb5bff0)\n\nIn the options markets, for instance, MMs are now holding the majority of the positions that buyers and sellers are trying to either accumulate or offload.\n\nThese market makers are much more important because of their size and due to their large positions, which they are required to hedge to maintain delta neutrality.\n\nGiven the institutional mindset, which is to generate income passively by selling call options or buying puts on SPY, for instance, a situation is created whereby market makers who are hedging are compressing volatility as markets move higher (hence why the VIX declines steadily into market rallies).\n\nConversely, **market makers cause exaggerated selloffs when the market declines, which is why markets fall so much faster than they tend to rise, because they rapidly attempt to hedge their positions that they are short on the way down.**\n\nMarket makers basically create pressure points in the market through their activities and they exert the most pressure when rapid moves occur, further amplifying these moves.\n\nSome of the largest market makers are: Virtu Financial, Citadel Securities, Two Sigma Securities, Susquehanna, Tower Research Capital, Jump Trading, DRW, Hudson River Trading, among others.\n\nHope you found this useful and Godspeed.", "id": "iqemik", "created_utc": 1599779383.0, "score": 693, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "So I work for one of the biggest market makers on the street.\n\n\\>  Given the institutional mindset, which is to generate income passively  by selling call options or buying puts on SPY, for instance, a situation  is created whereby market makers who are hedging are compressing  volatility as markets move higher (hence why the VIX declines steadily  into market rallies). \n\nThis is wrong.

If you look at the historical distribution of daily returns, you will find that it is statistically more like for the SP500 to move violently to the downside than the upside, that's why the skew is there. In other products, the skew could be priced to the call (like Gold), or symmetric (like Treasuries). This does not cost market makers any more to hedge. The only factor that would accelerate or dampen a move is whether market makers are long gamma or short gamma.

Nikola  did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch email and telephone request  for comment.  \n>  \n>[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/short-seller-hindenburg-alleges-that-electric-truck-maker-nikola-is-an-intricate-fraud-in-new-report-2020-09-10](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/short-seller-hindenburg-alleges-that-electric-truck-maker-nikola-is-an-intricate-fraud-in-new-report-2020-09-10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Today, we reveal why we believe Nikola is an intricate fraud built  on dozens of lies over the course of its Founder and Executive Chairman  Trevor Milton\u2019s career.\n* We have gathered extensive  evidence\u2014including recorded phone calls, text messages, private emails  and behind-the-scenes photographs\u2014detailing dozens of false statements  by Nikola Founder Trevor Milton. We have never seen this level of  deception at a public company, especially of this size.\n* Trevor  has managed to parlay these false statements made over the course of a  decade into a \\~$20 billion public company. He has inked partnerships  with some of the top auto companies in the world, all desperate to catch  up to Tesla and to harness the EV wave.\n* We examine how Nikola  got its early start and show how Trevor misled partners into signing  agreements by falsely claiming to have extensive proprietary technology.\n* We  reveal how, in the face of growing skepticism over the functionality of  its truck, Nikola staged a video called \u201cNikola One in Motion\u201d which  showed the semi-truck cruising on a road at a high rate of speed. Our  investigation of the site and text messages from a former employee  reveal that the video was an elaborate ruse\u2014Nikola had the truck towed  to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and simply filmed it  rolling down the hill.\n* In October 2019, Nikola announced it  would revolutionize the battery industry. This was to be done through a  pending acquisition, but the deal fell through when Nikola realized (a)  the technology was vaporware and (b) the President of the battery  company had been indicted months earlier over allegations that he conned  NASA by using his expense account to procure numerous prostitutes.\n* Nikola  has never walked back claims relating to its battery technology.  Instead, Trevor continued to publicly hype the technology even after  becoming aware of the above issues. The revolutionary battery technology  never existed \u2013 now, Nikola plans to use GM\u2019s battery technology  instead.\n* A spokesman for Volvo spin-off Powercell AB, a hydrogen  fuel cell technology company that formerly partnered with Nikola,  called Nikola\u2019s battery and hydrogen fuel cell claims \u201chot air\u201d.\n* In  addition to now using GM\u2019s battery technology, Nikola seeks to use the  automaker\u2019s production and fuel cell capabilities. Nikola seems to be  bringing nothing to the partnership but concept designs, their brand  name and up to $700 million they will be paying GM for costs related to  production.\n* Inexpensive hydrogen is fundamental to the success  of Nikola\u2019s business model. Trevor has claimed in a presentation to  hundreds of people and in multiple interviews to have succeeded at  cutting the cost of hydrogen by \\~81% compared to peers and to *already be producing hydrogen*. Nikola has not produced hydrogen at this price or at *any* price as he later admitted when pressed by media.\n* Trevor  has appointed his brother, Travis, as \u201cDirector of Hydrogen  Production/Infrastructure\u201d to oversee this critical part of the  business. Travis\u2019s prior experience looks to have largely consisted of  pouring concrete driveways and doing subcontractor work on home  renovations in Hawaii.\n* Claims of owning energy producing assets  is not new for Nikola. Trevor claimed that Nikola\u2019s headquarters has 3.5  megawatts of solar panels on its roof producing energy. Aerial photos  of the roof and later media reports show that the supposed panels don\u2019t  exist.\n* At one point Nikola claimed to own its own natural gas  wells. There is no evidence in company filings to support this. The  claims were eventually quietly removed from Nikola\u2019s website.\n* Trevor  claims Nikola designs all key components in house, but they appear to  simply be buying or licensing them from third-parties. One example: we  found that Nikola actually buys inverters from a company called  Cascadia. In a video showing off its \u201cin-house\u201d inverters, Nikola  concealed the Cascadia label with a piece of masking tape.\n* In a  July 2020 podcast, Trevor said of Nikola\u2019s \u201cTre\u201d truck: \u201cWe have five of  them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm Germany.\u201d A  spokesperson for Bosch, the manufacturing partner building the trucks,  confirmed this month that they haven\u2019t made any trucks yet.\n* The  company\u2019s Nikola One \u201creveal\u201d was a total farce. We corroborate  Bloomberg\u2019s earlier work debunking Trevor\u2019s claims regarding its  semi-truck that \u201cthis thing fully functions and works\u2026this is a real  truck\u201d and provide new evidence.\n* We present behind-the-scenes  photos showing that Nikola had an electricity cable snaked up from  underneath the stage into the truck in order to falsely claim the Nikola  One\u2019s electrical systems fully functioned.\n* We learned through  emails and interviews with former partners that Trevor had an artist  stencil \u201cH2\u201d and \u201cZero Emission Hydrogen Electric\u201d on the side of the  Nikola One despite it having no hydrogen capabilities whatsoever; it was  built with natural gas components.\n* We also present evidence  that subsequent \u201creveals\u201d were fictitious. In 2019, Nikola revealed a  \u201cnext generation\u201d version of its off-road vehicle. We learned that it  was scrapped within weeks of the unveiling due to manufacturing  challenges. The redesign work was then quietly outsourced.\n* Nikola\u2019s  much-touted multi-billion dollar order book is filled with fluff. U.S.  Xpress reportedly accounts for a third of its reservations, representing  \\~$3.5 billion in orders. U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on  hand last quarter.\n* Nikola\u2019s key partners and backers have been  cashing out aggressively. Worthington, Bosch and ValueAct have all sold  shares. Worthington sold $237 million shares over a 2-day span in July  and another $250 million in August. We think they know exactly what type  of company Nikola is, and we expect that as Nikola\u2019s GM \u201cpartnership\u201d  boosts the stock price, key holders will continue to exit.\n* We  think Trevor Milton, through dozens of outright lies, was able to form  partnerships with some of the largest legacy auto companies in the world  in their desperation to catch up to Tesla\u2019s EV leadership status.\n* Trevor  has ensured he is not going down with the ship. \u00a0He cashed out $70  million around the IPO and amended his share lock-up from 1-year to 180  days. If he is fired, his equity awards immediately vest and he is  entitled to collect $20 million over two years. Milton has laid the  groundwork to extract hundreds of millions from Nikola years before ever  delivering on his promises.\n* Every now and then a story comes  around that exposes how little the \u201cexperts\u201d really know. Theranos inked  partnerships with Walgreens, Safeway, and Cleveland Clinic and staffed  its board with luminaries. We think Nikola\u2019s partners did not do their homework\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch more info here:\n\n[https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)", "id": "iq338g", "created_utc": 1599743837.0, "score": 234, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "If you don't want people to believe you're a Tesla wannabe and trying to capitalize on the EV bubble, he should have named his company something other than Nikola...", "score": 111, "replies": [{"body": "BTW, about a month ago there was a thread out about compiling all of the misdeeds by the company\u2019s management, and foretold this report coming out\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RealNikola/comments/i5q0xb/nikola_insider/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I said the same thing about Tesla back when they were making cars with shitty QC in a tent.

I order a pumpkin spice latte and the nice young woman presses some buttons to inform the barista of my order. I then stick my card in a machine and press some buttons to pay for it.\n\nOn the way back up to my condo, I press some more buttons on my pocket screen to check up on my earlier button pressing. It's worse now. I press some more buttons to make the bleeding stop.\n\nI logon to my work screen and press some buttons to dial into a teleconference committee of like 30 people. Half of us discuss process and procedures for button pressing that will impact several thousand peoples' button pushing activities. The other half (myself included) are distracted with other button pressing.\n\nMy boss messages me asking why the numbers are down. He seems angry. I grab some data, press some buttons, and explain to him what happened. I then tell him which people should press what buttons to make the numbers go back up. He is now happy. They pay me 6 figures a year to do this. I look at my non-work screen and get angry as I see where that money is going.\n\nLater today, when I am done pressing the buttons on my work screen, my non-work screen, and my pocket screen, I'll head to my microwave and push some more buttons, then to the couch and push different buttons. Once the sun has set and I am tired, I will push the button that makes the big screen stop. Before going to sleep, I will check my pocket screen one last time and gaze into the future. The numbers will still be down.\n\nI never know which buttons to push to make them go back up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I am not even joking.

{"title": "SPY WILL NOT HIT $300 RETARDS", "selftext": "Just as the title says the market will not tank. This is a healthy correction but of course when we're so fucking leveraged with short exp calls it feels like the apocalypse. \n\nLet's take a quick look at June 8th. SPY had a face ripping rally of roughly 30% from the previous 3 months. It was a steady climb up with a few dips a long the way. The drop off from June 8th was about 8% over a week. This is widely considered as a healthy correction. This wasn't followed by another rally. No, this is where the Kangaroo market was formed. AMD was trading like KO hovering in the $50's and theta gang was taking Bulls and Bears lunch. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks of this consolidation we started the bull run that was more rigged than Tim Donaghy officiating NBA games. SPY went up 18% in about 2 months with almost no dips along the way. Similar to June 8th, SPY drops about 8% in a week. Again, a healthy correction. Will this be followed by another 18% rally? Probably not. We'll have some big green and red days sprinkled in here and there in the next week or so. But theta is coming from the top ropes to kick our ass. \n\nThere was no major catalyst for this sell off that points to another market crash. Soft bank, tech bubble, elections, etc. All valid arguments but this is still normal compared to a sell off caused by a pandemic. Everyone one wants to be the next Michael Burry, Bill Ackman, and Bobby Axelrod. So keep buying those far OTM puts if you'd like, but the fed will not let SPY drop to $300. Mr. Pump won't let it either. \n\nWe've all gotten bear raped this last week and it hurts. Now's the time to learn to play both sides and start hedging. Having your account wiped out fucking sucks. I'm down 50% this month and I'm sure not letting myself get to 100%.

And they could put a floor around 300 here too.\n\nDetails in the wall of text below.\n\nMost of the value in the market, say 75%, is institutional money managed with fixed % allocations. Say 50/50 equity/bonds. QE pushed the value of bonds up (and promises to keep them there); together with the drop in equity values, that mechanically caused a massive flood of cash into equities. The equity portfolio managers then have to pick stocks. They may think everything is a Sell, but they have no choice. So they hold their nose and put the cash where it seems safest - tech, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Or they're following their benchmark index to a T, to reduce the chance they'll get fired.\n\nIf stocks go down, institutions will sell bonds to top up equities. Bonds can't go down, because of the Fed they're a bottomless pool of money. So if stocks drop 30%, the overall portfolio is down 15%, so stocks will get topped up until they're only down 15%. Traders frontrun the reallocation trade (either as an intentional strategy or because they're BTFD'ing), so even before the institutions do anything, stocks' losses are trimmed to 15%. Which means they should only be down 7.5%....then 3.75%...\n\nThe same mechanism could limit how much stocks can go up, but with bonds as expensive as they are, institutions might be more inclined to let the \"house money\" stay in equities. And no one is rushing in to short the market to correct prices (that strategy hasn't worked very well this year).\n\nStocks haven't crashed *because they can't*.\n\nThere are a bunch of side plots going on at the same time, e.g. the options feedback loop. And one way the above could fail is this: the Fed corporate debt programs have about $1 trillion. If and when the market starts exercising this put, the $1T will be gone in a day. The Fed doesn't have enough ammo. They can reload but that may take time, and it would lead to some awful outcomes like the Fed owning worthless defaulted bonds issued in August 2020, where the proceeds were immediately dividend'ed out to the PE company that controls the issuer.\n\nCMBS are another potential hole. Last I heard the market is still essentially frozen, so as not to look down. But as more CMBS defaults it will get harder to pretend they're worth the same as they used to be.\n\nA couple other theories supportive of the market:\n\n* the Fed created so much cash that cash is now worth less (in terms of asset purchasing power, not CPI purchasing power, which are pretty loosely linked these days); so companies are worth less, but so is money;\n* most of the S&P 500 will survive; many of their competitors won't.

Seriously tho, if you want some free bear erotica, and want to know about a real trigger related to VIX and /VX: the spike in 1m realized vol that came about as a result of the spot VIX moving up to 30+ (peak ~38) puts us right on the edge of 1m realized vol flipping above 3m realized.

There are several good points at the end. Efficent people survive. I've only survived because I've lived below my means while all the other dopes around me played with their parents money and now are facing the music.\n\nThe only caveat I would add is that in the last few decades the top has been squeezing hard frugal efficent workers out of the force. Either through consolidation or attrition. In the 1990's the honest man who worked his 40 hours and contributed 75 percent of his post tax income to a high yield savings did well. Today that same man has to dance for more money and gamble to stay afloat.\n\nAnd I think that hopelessness is what causes people to live la vida loco. If you know that the next 60 years are going to be shit and that there's no debtors prision then you'll yolo and vote for whoever gives you what you want (or promises).\n\nIf america wants to be fixed you need to separate the workers and savers and force the non working masses and privileged to carry the labor burden.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "This is a long one so sorry if you weren't intending on reading a novel today you can just ignore the whole thing if you want.\n\nWhat do you mean by separate the workers and savers? I don't understand the logistics of the idea.\n\nI'd say a lot of this is just over population. Earths population has gone from less than 2 billion in 1920 to over 8 billion in just 100 years. The same saving tactics that worked 40 years ago couldn't possibly work as well now. \n\nAbsolutely insane and unsustainable exponential growth made possible by how privileged and capable almost every person alive no matter how poor or bad off is compared to the average person from 200+ years ago and it's only going to get worse.\n\nI think the average man has trouble staying afloat by the old pre 90s method because they have unreasonable standards when considering the situation we're in. Everyone wants to be white picket fence living like everyone else they know, without thinking about how much debt those people they know actually are in. So they just hop on board the debt train thinking it's normal. \n\nOr the other commonality is they live in dense, overpopulated expensive inner cities, pay rent instead of paying to own, while working either one or multiple near minimum wage jobs and think that since they work multiple jobs their life should be as good as if they were working 1 high paying job that they had to put in much more effort to obtain. \n\nA lot of people who work low paying jobs will do something like have a kid, then instead of convincing themselves they need a higher paying job to afford the kid will convince themselves they're just not being paid enough for the job they have and that it's all the rich peoples fault.\n\nI dont think they \"know\" the next 60 years will be shit, i think they play victim and assume so to be true by telling themselves the top has all the money already when it's just not true. I certainly never convinced myself of such and I'm quite young. If you're alive and not in crippling debt and are putting money aside to go towards things that retain value or produce income for you like rental property or a small business then life is pretty great, but they screwed up one of those steps somewhere.\n\nShit now people are openly advocating against property rights and they ironically call landlords leeches so I'd imagine long term income from rental property isn't exactly in their playbook anyway.\n\nI'd rather live in a $5,000 5th wheel on $10,000 worth of land while making 35-70k depending on the years weather and buy a 80k house not even to live in but to rent out to someone else before doing what most people do which is making a steady annual 35kish while living in a $165k house with a $24k car that will break before or just after i pay it off. I could work at walmart and still live as I do at least as far as shelter goes.\n\nI know so many people my age who get a 35-50k a year job then immediately buy a house well above what they can reasonably afford or pay off in a reasonable amount of time just because the bank will let them and immediately also buys a $30k car because they want to \"look\" the part whether they actually play the part or not with no regard for life changing events like what is happening this year.\n\nIf I make more money than someone, am relatively the same age as them, and I drive a paid for 2002 dodge ram and live on land i paid off in a 5th wheel trailer while they're driving a 2019 Altima they still owe 22k on and live in a house they still owe 15+ years on based on their wage and have dreams of sending their kid to college, there is an issue... on top of that they'd be the ones to call me trailer trash while they are at it too just because they scoff at the idea of living in one. But when the economy collapses for one reason or another and they still have bills to pay while I essentially have next to none and my income is unchanged because of what I chose to do who's living trashy?\n\nI dunno i could just be an asshole but I swear I saw something like this coming and have been setting myself up for success in the event of a collapse while im still at a young age so It's difficult for me to see or sympathize with any healthy, perfectly capable individuals who weren't prepared for this or have been complaining for the past decade about wealth inequality because it seemed pretty obvious to me it was coming. Obviously some people are actually in a tight spot not of their own doing but I definitely don't believe it's the majority and maybe we'dbe in a better position to help those who actually need it if the system hadn't been absued by so many for so long. \n\nIt had been far to long since the world had seen real hardship and I knew something was coming eventually in this modern age, everything has been too quiet for years.\n\nThough through my experience it seems most people who are down and out just make bad decisions and don't want to recognize, live with, or change because of them. It's easier to blame whoever they possibly can for it and demand change weather they can precisely articulate what that change is or not.\n\nIt's not any one individuals fault we're overpopulated or that prices law rules supreme in the end so that they absolutely must recognize their situation but I believe it's everyone's own job to recognize the reality of the world today and learn to adapt to it for their own sake however they can because that's just simple darwinisim and we cannot just violently change the way life is. Those who do not adapt will be left behind and I can't say that I believe the burden of saving them should be on anyone but themselves. \n\nThat or they can just keep on keeping on, complaining about wealth inequality without a real sense of direction or plan but man we've tried that before, we keep trying it every few decades in different countries and it hasn't worked out very well for any common man or woman yet, we have pretty well documented events of it causing massive harm and death but we keep doing it.\n\nEdit: I recognize what I've said doesn't eliminate the problem or indefinitely refute the idea wealth inequality is a problem to at least some degree regardless if I think a lot of it is just bad decision making at the bottom/simply prices law at work, but what im getting at is i dont think this will work, I dont think this can work, I dont think it's even supposed to work perfectly. We don't have anything to prove any economic system will work in the long term. We either have economic freedom which entails inequality inherently which isn't necessarily a bad thing, or we have totalitarian forced equality. \n\nThe whole world has been on a debt train to one another for many years now. Who's to say there's a correct way to do this that will solve most of the problems without creating new ones or sacrificing vital freedoms? Countries that our youth talk of as if they've got it figured out like the UK most definitely do not have it figured out at all.. We would need to see hundreds of years into the future to determine the validity of any system, we may have been doing this for a few generations now but we are still in the infancy stage considering this has all been accomplished in a very short span of time relative to our existence. All i can really say for anyone is recognize it is what it is and adapt or become a victim of circumstance because even the economists haven't a clue wtf they are talking about long term because most civilizations have collapsed long before that can be determined and this train is going to keep on chugging forward pending any major world wide war/event that resets the economy again.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["wmt"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5488923192024231}], "tickers": ["wmt"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25916171073913574}, {"body": "*Most* people *are* \"workin\".
