It makes no sense to sell a +10% away Covered Call BOTH on MSFT (a low volatility stock) and TSLA (a very high volatility stock with a LOT of uncertainty). Using the std dev helps normalize moves.

I lost a shit ton on SPY puts in March. I was retardedly bearish during the entire recovery and flipped a few weeks ago. Finally started seeing some green and was getting back to where I was before March. And then the market tanked again and I was expecting at least modest green today recovering from the dramatic drop. Of course I was wrong and lost $7k. I'm just always late on the trend and overconfident. I can't imagine how I recover from this aside from years of saving and just never touching options again. You know, maybe that's just the way to go. There is no guaranteed get-rich-quick scheme. Please help me, and thanks in advance for anything you guys have to offer. Also fuck you and fuck me for trying to buy the dip without any sign of momentum change. And fuck SPY for continuing to drop after hours. I've been bag holding SPY $347c 9/11 NFLX $530c 9/11 and NVDA $495c 9/11. Should I just sell tomorrow and walk out with the $2k I'll have left?\n\nAt least it was money I could afford to lose and I'm still young, but damn... I really messed up.\n\n[https://imgur.com/W7Wpac3](https://imgur.com/W7Wpac3)", "id": "ip2w12", "created_utc": 1599601440.0, "score": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 296, "comments": [{"body": "70 percent down ain\u2019t that bad", "score": 538, "replies": [{"body": "LOL love this sub", "score": 279, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.

You\u2019ve just been suckered in by the glamour of getting rich quick.\n\nI\u2019m guessing nobody is going to read this and/or take this seriously, but because I\u2019m bored, here\u2019s an idea of what\u2019s happening, in essence:\n\n- Pretend I\u2019m going to roll a fair, 6-sided die\n- Every time you roll the die, I charge you $1 (this is your initial investment)\n- If you roll a \u20186\u2019, I pay you $5, or 5x your initial investment. \n- Winning 5x your investment feels amazing, and of course, when you win 5x your investment, you have to share with the world on Reddit to show how amazing you are at making money\u2014thus attracting others to the game.\n\nThe problem is, however:\n\n- Pretend you roll the die 6 times\n- Probability states that on average you will land on each number once (though this is unlikely to be the actual case).\n- By adding up the net profit/loss from each expected roll (\u20181\u2019=-$1... etc) and then dividing by the number of rolls, we get our overall expected value per roll (EV).\n- EV = ((-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1 + $5))/6 = $-1/6\n- In other words, we are losing about $0.16 per roll.\n\nNow, because of the way probabilities work, you might roll a \u20186\u2019 a bunch of times in a row and become rich. Or, you might roll the other numbers and lose your house\u2014all short term, of course. If you roll the die a ton of times, you\u2019re basically guaranteed to lose just about $0.16 per roll.\n\nAnd finally, imagine, say, a billion sided die, with much more complicated payout rules\u2014this is akin to what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re investing uneducated.

The difference is, of course, that, in skill games such as poker, you\u2019re playing against other opponents. If your strategies are stronger than your opponents\u2019 on average (hint, they\u2019re not) you can effectively take their money. \n\nThe only way to correctly invest is to make trades with a positive EV. And even then, you might still lose a ton of money short term. This is exactly the way poker works and is why, if you\u2019ve ever played, sometimes you feel super lucky while other times you can\u2019t win anything.
