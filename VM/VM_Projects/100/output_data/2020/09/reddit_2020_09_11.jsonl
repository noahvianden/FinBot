{"title": "Options Calculator", "selftext": "[Options Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)\n\nIf you like options, this is such a useful tool. Let's say you want to get on the TSLA hype and buy some short term calls. You enter the ticker symbol, select the date, and the option you want to buy. It'll tell you when you start making/losing money. For this one I selected a long call that expires 10/30 and is just barely under the stock price.\n\nAs you can see, the window for you to make money is very, very small. Different options have much bigger green areas, but this tells you that if you don't hit the prices (left) by the dates (top) that are in the green you will most likely lose your money. \n\nOptions aren't bad, although they are a riskier. You just have to make a smart decision. Use this tool, click on the price/date you're shooting for and it will tell you how much you'll make if it hits by that date (obviously this is a snapshot in time, so numbers may get a little squishy if stock velocity changes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1obdjpkecjm51.jpg?width=825&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa7035af4d746bf5103b46a73712cf735b10930c", "id": "iqsfo1", "created_utc": 1599837393.0, "score": 347, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019ve always been a long term investor but got interested in options recently due to the COVID boom.

On the matter of the 501(k) I found this (bold emphasis mine):\n\n> We expect to take a multi-step approach to the regulatory clearance process. As a first step, we submitted a 510(k) application **to an accredited Review Organization** under the Third Party Review Program for a single-source version of the Nanox.ARC in January 2020. In response to the feedback we received from the reviewer, we are conducting standard functional and safety tests to support the 510(k) application and **expect to submit the results from these tests in the third quarter of 2020**.\n\nSo it sounds like they are in the process of developing the 501(k) to submit it to the FDA and part of that process was submitting it to a review organization for feedback.\n\nFor anyone interested in this company I'd recommend checking out the risks section of the SEC filing linked above. Warning: it's 45 pages long, but just reading the first few sections gives a great overview of where the company stands currently.\n\n> We are a development-stage company with limited operating history. We may never be able to effectuate our business plan or achieve any revenue or reach profitability. **Therefore, at this stage of our business, potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment.**\n\nThe risks section gives some hints as to the current status of their tech:\n\n>*Our efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our digital X-ray source technology for commercial applications.*\n\n>We have developed our X-ray source technology and a prototype of the Nanox.ARC. Even though we believe our X-ray source has achieved commercial applicability, our technology has not been tested over extended periods of time and therefore no meaningful data exists regarding the durability, safety and effectiveness of our X-ray source over extended periods. **Although we have produced a working prototype of the Nanox.ARC, we may not be able to successfully integrate our X-ray source into the Nanox.ARC or any medical imaging system.**\n\nNote their wording: they have developed an x-ray source, and they have also developed a Nano.ARC prototype, but it sounds like they haven't yet integrated their X-ray source into the Nano.ARC and so have not yet built an actual medical imaging system.\n\n**So let's be clear:** this is a highly speculative play on a development / proof-of-concept stage startup that may never even reach the stage of having a working prototype. Still potentially worth a small position but with a play like this you expect that the most likely outcome in the long term is losing the whole investment. If they can get their tech working and get the cost of manufacturing low enough, their MSaaS business model with Nanox.CLOUD could be hugely profitable.

While having in house fabrication has its benefits, it is hurting intel much more than helping. TSMC is full 2 generations ahead of intel. They spend even more than intel does (i mean, it is their business). \n\nIntel was accelerating their 7nm because 10nm failed (poor yields).

Thats just in 2 years when the *supply is tight* and considering servers take months to transition. But in 2022, when amd shifts desktop and laptops to 5nm, they can use their entire 7nm wafer orders for epycs on top of 5nm epycs. Now 7nm is equil of intel 10nm but 10nm has lower yields.  \n\nIf intel wants to maintain dominance, their node must achieve 1 generation advantage with tsmc.

By all means, AMD is liable to grow faster in the near-term. What I\u2019m trying to convey by comparing revenue is just how dominant INTC has actually been in the semiconductor market. Even if we assumed that AMD\u2019s revenue would grow at 20% a year perpetually, and Intel\u2019s at 0%, AMD wouldn\u2019t surpass Intel in revenue for 13 years. That, in addition to their phenomenal balance sheet and high profit margins, gives Intel a significant time buffer to modernize their product line and become competitive again.\n\nAMD being fabless is a competitive disadvantage for them, not the other way around. Intel spending more on production each quarter than AMD earns in a year goes to show, again, just how massive Intel is in comparison to the competition. While INTC\u2019s foundries have been a source of problems recently, they\u2019re a major competitive advantage in the long-term. AMD will have much higher operating costs per unit sold than Intel, and as such, a much lower profit margin (and probably higher unit costs, so there\u2019s that). Lower profit margins mean less flexibility in poor markets, less excess cash to invest in growth, R&D, share buybacks, dividends, etc., and higher entry costs when expanding your product line. Intel is currently entering the dedicated GPU market, and already having access to foundries at a low cost will give them a strong competitive advantage in this market segment (and should they burn out in the GPU market, it at least won\u2019t cost them too much).\n\nAs for the server market, AMD did not jump from a 1% to 8% market share in a single quarter. They\u2019ve grown from 1.4% to 5.8% in 2 years. As an INTC investor, this doesn\u2019t concern me. It wasn\u2019t likely that Intel would hold a true monopoly in a fast-growing market segment forever, but they still have first-mover advantages, and over 90% of the market is controlled by Intel. A little bit of competition is healthy.\n\nI agree that Intel should modernize their products ASAP, and seeing them play catch-up with AMD in that regard is disconcerting.

It costs them much more per chip than amd despite being having poor performance.

Intel catching up to amd is never happening for 3 years at least let alone surpass them. Only advantage they have rn is much high supply, which again would be decreasing for intel as their yields are lower, and increasing for amd.\n\nAnd server share went over 10% according to IDC numbers and 5.8% according to mercury research. Even if we use mercury research numbers, 1% to 5.8% of *entire market share* is still huge. Its not 5.8% per quarter, its for entire market. 60-80% of that market share was gained by intel before amd even entered. So per quarter they had more like 15-18% adoption rate over just 2 years.

Intel has made efforts to mitigate security threats which have so far been reasonably effective, and having identified these issues should cause management to be more proactive in preventing these scandals in the future.\n\nI refuse to believe having fabs is a liability in and of itself. While Intel has certainly had its fair share of well-documented manufacturing issues, having ownership of their own foundries contributes to a very high-margin business model, giving them a significant buffer against poor market conditions as well as the flexibility to invest heavily in growth and R&D, which they\u2019ve been doing.

It pains me to see major corporations treating their consumers like idiots, but it feels like that\u2019s what Intel is doing. Pointing to blatantly rigged benchmark data in a last-ditch effort to convince your consumers that you still have a superior product is poor practice, especially in an era where reliable independent information is only a few clicks away. The first step to marketing is having something decent to market, and right now Intel is stuck marketing an inferior product line due to their aforementioned manufacturing issues. Even still, it makes more sense in my eyes to be candid about what your product actually is, as opposed to getting a reputation for dishonesty and sleaziness through practices that border on false advertising. Here\u2019s hoping a new CCO can fix this.\n\nWhile entering the dedicated GPU market is a risky move, it\u2019s also a synergistic one, which is the hallmark of quality company expansion. Intel\u2019s integrated GPU\u2019s have long had a reputation for being, well, shit, and there\u2019s tremendous upside if they can claw their way to a real foothold in the GPU market.

In the post-Covid monetary policy regime, interest rates are so low that there is very little discount to future earnings due to the lack of good safe alternatives, so stocks are now being priced a lot more on their earnings 10-20 years out than earnings 5 years out.
