I think we\u2019d see a drop in price but not a collapse because they have a lot of companies seeing potential in them and they are in a great market. People correctly correlate workhorse with Tesla but incorrectly correlate battery day with workhorse - hence the confusion on why the stock is going up.\nAnother idea would be to throw an option on it now that expire in October and then buy shares if it falls. Options are exponential in value obviously while using less liquidity and I believe workhorses option value has a lot of room to grow due to the same volatility price fluctuation if it drops making it worth the risk. This stock was $.35 a share company at one point and is now a potential $7billion company due to a current fair market cap and massive potential. If the stock drops it\u2019s because people were wrong about the timing. While there is still question if usps gives the contract up in December Due to potentially going bankrupt or making huge budget cuts, usps has claimed the money has already been set aside for the ev upgrade which would mean EOY for usps hasn\u2019t happened yet and I\u2019d assume December is the next potential announcement timeframe.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5390620231628418}, {"body": "Workhorse is garbage.

Tesla's share price was terribly depressed and we were losing many long time supporters.  Contributions to this sub were overwhelmingly negative with a disproportionate amount coming from short propaganda pushers from r/RealTesla and the tslaq community in general.\n\nPrior to the above post i posted the following comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/bgsd67/tsla\\_daily\\_investor\\_discussion\\_april\\_24\\_2019/elo9tuo?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/bgsd67/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_24_2019/elo9tuo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) expressing how much I believed in Tesla during the lowest time in a 2 year period for the company.\n\nWell what a 12 months it's bee!  I was greatly relieved to recover my original investment and make many times that eventually.  But here's the thing: **My bullish thesis from 12 months ago has not come to pass.**  I believed Tesla would demonstrate an overwhelming lead in automation.  Autopilot currently is so bad my wife and daughter won't let me use it because the phantom breaking scares them.  Advanced summon is not worth using.  The FSD beta is novelty functionality.  I've found I have to turn it off for real use of he car.  Having Elon re-promise robot-axies by the end of the year adds insult to injury.  How bout you instead make autopilot better and safer ?\n\nTwelve months ago we had \"the most amazing product backlog of any company\" according to Elon.  We had the Semi, Roadster, Model Y, Cyber truck.  Maybe even a sub  compact.  The Model Y turned out to be a vertically stretched model 3.  The Semi and Cyber truck will go  into production when?  I *think* my wife and I are about to purchase a Y but its a bit underwhelming to me and I don't trust Tesla to take  care of me the purchaser they way I used to.  It's not as clear where their priorities are.\n\nThe fundamentals of the company have stayed flat or gotten worse during the time stock has gone up 10 fold.  They were targeting production of over 1 million vehicles a year (or 20k a week)  from Fremont alone back in 2018 when I pre-ordered my P3D.  Now we are excited about 500k total in sales for 2020 from Fremont and China combined?  Yikes.\n\nI didn't buy Tesla as a meme stock.  I believe fundamentals based long term buy and hold investing.  I am deeply disturbed by the kangaroo market in general that we find ourselves in.  I believe one day Tesla will be worth its current share price.  I think that time frame for that though, considering their slower  than expected progress, is probably at least  5 years out.  Thus I have sold my shares and will stay on the sideline until I feel the company is a better investment.", "id": "iw43om", "created_utc": 1600562415.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "Tesla failure to grow 300%  a year truly disappointing", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Here's an attempt to counter key points of the rather negative thesis outlined by /u/Soooohatemods. I'll post my replies to key points as individual replies, to not create a 'wall of text' with a single huge reply.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to thank our kind mod for outlining a thesis I'm sure he knew would be received poorly by the bulls and hyperbulls here. While I disagree with key points of the thesis, I appreciate the honesty. \ud83e\udd20\n\nI also think it's time to spend a bit of time on re-examining the Tesla bull thesis. I assumed these points are well-known, but apparently it's not, and various sorts of doubts have crept in.\n\n# **(1) The \"no Tesla growth\" thesis**\n\n> \"They haven\u2019t grown in the last 18 months.\"\n\nThis is false in terms of deliveries, Tesla reported record 112,095 deliveries for Q4'2019, which was two quarters ago - i.e. the true figure of \"no growth\" is 6 months. (You can add another 2.5 months if you will, but that's just reporting delay.)\n\nBut even the \"no growth for 6 months\" thesis is effectively false, because it's measured in absolute numbers & naively compared between dissimilar quarters in a highly misleading fashion.\n\nFor businesses with with heavy seasonality of sales (which Tesla certainly shows) it's not valid to compare absolute quarterly figures - i.e. expect Tesla Q2'2020 sales (second weakest quarter) to beat Q4'2019 (strongest quarter).\n\nInstead what analysts that want to value Tesla fairly will do a quarterly comparison, year over year, to eliminate the seasonal factor.\n\nIf we do that, we get the following seasonal pattern aware growth table:\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2018:** |              | 29,980 | 40,740 | 83,775 |  90,966\n **2019:** |              | 63,019 | 95,356 | 97,186 | 112,095\n **2020:** |              | 88,400 | 90,891 |      ? |       ?\n\nIf we calculate the percentage of growth compared to the seasonally comparable quarter from last year, we get this table:\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2019:** |              |  +110% |  +134% |   +16% |    +23%\n **2020:** |              |   +40% |    -4% |      ? |       ?\n\nAs you can see the \"growth story\" was alive, well and kicking up to Q1'2020, when a ~~Plague~~ Covid Year forced Tesla into an unprecedented 80-day shutdown, disrupting production.\n\nTesla still sold every car they made, and they have insane waiting lists in some places: in Norway there are documented cases of orders going in May and delivery being scheduled for August-September ... a 3-4 months long wait.\n\nAnd **despite** this huge interruption to supply, Tesla still managed to eke out only a -4% drop in deliveries, while sales of automakers all around the globe shrunk by around 30%.\n\nI.e. the Covid disruption was actually a really good natural experiment to \"measure\" Tesla's demand ceiling.\n\nBut it gets better. If we consider TroyTeslike's latest estimates - which are usually better than 5% accurate, in Q3 Tesla might deliver in excess of 140k units, with >180k expected by him for Q4. [Here are his latest estimates.](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike/status/1305998283580551168)\n\nTroyTeslike's (/u/Teslike) methodology is data driven, and so close to the end of the quarter his estimates were historically very reliable, even in \"surprise\" quarters that generated surprisingly high or surprisingly low sales.\n\nHis track record is very good:\n\nquarter | @TroyTeslike deliveries prediction accuracy\n---|---\nQ3'2019 | 96.1%\nQ4'2019 | 96.7%\nQ1'2020 | 93.9%\nQ2'2020 | 98.6%\n\nLet's plug in those numbers into our \"seasonally fair\" growth table:\n\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3         |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2018:** |              | 29,980 | 40,740 |  83,775        |  90,966\n **2019:** |              | 63,019 | 95,356 |  97,186        | 112,095\n **2020:** |              | 88,400 | 90,891 | 144,000 (e) | 187,000 (e)    \n\nWe get:\n\n **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2019:** |              |  +110% |  +134% |   +16% |    +23%\n **2020:** |              |   **+40%** |    **-4%** |   **+48%** (e) |    **+67%** (e)   \n\nI.e. not only is Tesla expected to meet FY 2020 growth guidance, the current data is projecting that they'll show \"explosive\" growth in the second half of the year.\n\nFinally, about the \"18 months no growth\" figure, which is the time measured since Tesla's last revenue record on Q4'2018 ($7.2b).\n\nThat comparison is unfair and inaccurate for several reasons:\n\n- it doesn't perform seasonal correction\n- it doesn't take into account the almost 3 months reporting delay: Q3 is probably going to post record revenue, we just don't know it yet.\n- it doesn't take into account that Tesla has reduced prices aggressively to grow faster in unit sales - the most useful metric of growth stories.\n- it doesn't take into account that each business segment has its primary metric, which is very often not revenue:\n - for video streaming (Netflix) it's \"subscriptions\"\n - for the videocard/GPU business (Nvidia) it's \"cards sold\" \n - for the software business it's \"subscribers/licenses sold\"\n - for the smartphone industry it's \"handsets delivered\"\n - for the car business it's \"cars delivered\". Tesla might be a tech company, but its growth performance is still unit based.\n- it doesn't take into account that Tesla managed this explosive growth episode with a **sedan** (the Model 3), while the Model Y, a globally more popular SUV form factor (with a 200-300% bigger addressable market, maybe more), is ramping up right now with several factories coming online (Fremont Model Y expansion: probably done, Shanghai Model Y expansion: almost done, Berlin Model Y expansion: a few months from done, GigaTexas: Tesla's fastest construction project so far), will significantly increase both the ASP and the unit sales.\n\nFinally, we are just ~12 days away from the Q3 deliveries report, which will IMO powerfully falsify the \"no growth\" thesis via an actual official report. Why have these doubts so close to the falsification event? Why give in to backward looking arguments in a moment that is arguably the 'most doubtful' time period due to reporting delays and due to Covid?\n\nHopefully I have not earned myself a ban with this reply. \ud83e\udd14\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** If we are willing to project just 2 weeks into the future, with the Q3 deliveries report the \"no growth\" thesis is fundamentally false both in terms of deliveries and in terms of revenue.", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "### **(6) Tesla fundamentals**\n\n> \"The fundamentals of the company have stayed flat or gotten worse during the time stock has gone up 10 fold.

These will dramatically improve EPS figures for 1-2 quarters and I believe the market will *not* discount it - these are real tax benefits Tesla is forced (by GAAP) to turn into GAAP profits.\n- Convertible notes:\n - As most investors know, Tesla has entered into a complex set of convertible notes agreements over the years, which are dilution-hedged with an even more complicated set of call options.\n - What few investors realize I believe is that Tesla will gain a steady income of cash from these convertibles, starting next March with a $400m cash benefit. The total cash benefit is around $2.7b. These hedges are basically bullish call option spreads with a neat income for Tesla.\n - What even fewer investors are aware of is that Tesla could turn these hedges into GAAP income, with a simple board decision. This means both cash flow and GAAP income gets improved by about $2.7b over the next ~3 years.\n- Tesla Network could arrive anytime, and will arrive with a bang I believe.\n- S&P 500 inclusion is being discounted here due to the ~1 month delay the index committee decided, but it's still a **~$80b forced diversification from other sectors and investment into Tesla**.

Yikes.\"\n\nWhile historically you are right, Tesla indeed overestimated their ability to ramp up and grow Model 3 production, it is a fundamentally backward looking argument.\n\nIndeed Tesla over-promised, and they paid a heavy price for it, and for almost 3 years the stock not only stagnated but was cut in more than half in value from its previous peaks.\n\nBut for forward looking investors it's three main parameters that matter to the Tesla growth story:\n\n**(1)** The exponent of growth\n\nWhich, if we discount the Covid hick-up, is still fantastic:\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2019:** |              |  +110% |  +134% |   +16% |    +23%\n **2020:** |              |   +40% |    -4% |   +48% (e) |    +67%  (e)\n\n**(2)** Strength of the competition\n\nThere was an important story in the last 3 years which your thesis does not discuss, **the impending failure of the legacy ICE OEM industry**:\n\n- The I-Pace and the E-Tron were \"the king is naked\" moments,\n- that the smaller Taycan couldn't out-accelerate the 7 years old Model S design and had to resort to \"but we are better on the track!\" shenanigans was an \"oh shit\" moment,\n- the ID.3's software struggles show what an impossible gap legacy auto must bridge to catch up to Tesla.\n\nThese events, while not directly Tesla events, strengthened Tesla's perceived market position immensely. Please do not under-estimate the pricing effect of this.\n\n**(3)** Market dominance\n\nThe Covid crisis has shown the anti-cyclical resilience of Tesla sales (only 4% drop), and the fact that they managed to post profits despite various headwinds demonstrated their profit margins.\n\nMonopolies and quasi-monopolies get a very tidy valuation bonus, because they have more anti-cyclical and higher profit margin income streams. Wall Street is increasingly seeing Tesla as an \"Apple\" story, with very high potential profit margins and a resilient market position.\n\nAnd Apple's combined markets are maybe $500b per year - while Tesla is growing into markets with a combined revenue stream of trillions of dollars - maybe even beyond $10t if we include energy.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla was rightfully punished for their Model 3 optimism, but this is water down the bridge today, and the forward looking metrics are looking fantastic.", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "### **(4) Tesla's FSD lead and Robotaxis**\n\n> \"I believed Tesla would demonstrate an overwhelming lead in automation.

I.e. it's reactive, with much of the progress staying hidden.\n\nMost importantly, I believe much of Wall Street still doesn't value Tesla's FSD business - the analyst estimates I cited in my previous comments valued Tesla as an Apple-alike high-tech car company.\n\nARK comes the closest to valuing FSD, and it's an additional +$2,000-$3,000 of valuation to TSLA, **post-split**.\n\nBut then ARK doesn't value Tesla Energy at all and completely glosses over the Roadrunner project's real implications of Tesla's near 100% non-commodity supplier independence, IMO.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** Yes, Tesla's FSD progress is slower than expected, but the current Street valuation of Tesla is IMO not driven by FSD (non-)progress, at all, it's purely the automotive growth story combined with high margin income.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "The way machines learning works, is that the AI makes a decision and then learns from some sort of correction.\n\nThe advantage tesla has, is that they can send out an update, and then get relevant corrections on a weekly basis.\n\nThis is incompatible with the notion you express, that they have \"hidden progress\".

If we naively compare P/E ratios to P/E ratios back then, then we might come away with the impression that we are in a bubble.\n\nBut P/E ratios have to be compared to the P/E ratio of the 'real risk-free interest rate' - which was very high, around 6%, back in 1999.\n\nToday the real risk-free interest rate is around 0.6%, and the Fed just signaled it last week that they expect low interest rates to continue into 2023.\n\nIn practice this means that institutional investors, due to the lack of income from the normally huge bonds market, will increase their search radius in time, to the 2022-2023 time range.\n\nAnd if we extend to Tesla's expected growth in 2021 and 2022, its EBITDA based P/E becomes not just low, but the lowest of all major tech companies.\n\nFor example [here's TSLA fair value estimates by Gary Black](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1306951581838049281) (former CEO Aegon Asset Mgmt US, Co-CIO Calamos, CIO Equities Goldman Sachs Asset Mgmt, CEO/CIO Janus).\n\nHe arrives at a current TSLA fair value (risk adjusted to today) of $600, based on the automotive business alone - i.e. ignoring both Tesla Energy and Tesla Network.\n\nI.e. despite the run-up this year, TSLA is *still* trading at a discount, if these estimates are accurate.\n\nI.e. this view:\n\n> \"Tldr: I am a fan of Tesla the company but I have sold my shares and think the stock is greatly over valued.\"\n\nIs a dangerous view for retail investors if you are otherwise bullish on Tesla. You are trying to time the market. You might end up being correct - but key points of the bull thesis I have outlined would have to fail for that, or some major macro earthquake would have to occur.\n\nI.e. I'm in the exact opposite situation as /u/Soooohatemods: I wouldn't be able to sleep well if I **didn't** have a healthy stake of core TSLA shares. And no, I didn't care that it corrected by -40% two weeks ago, that's part of the Tesla story. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nInstitutional investors are doing that all around the world, for numerous businesses, and I believe this process - which, if the Fed is holding rates, will not stop anytime soon.\n\n[I'm again quoting Gary Black here, who summed it up best IMO](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1306635239326916608):\n\n> \"But this isn\u2019t 1999. 10-yr Treas are at 0.6% vs 6.0% in 1999.

With equity spreads still at +4.5% the force for funds to flow into cash and cash equivalent bonds is weak. This same force was -1.0% in 1999, accelerating the flow out of the dotcom bubble.\n\nYes, when the Fed starts the next tightening cycle it might trigger a massive correction - but unless there's some Vis Major event, expectations of the current \"bubble\" to burst anytime soon are not based in rational logic I believe.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Incredibly apt analysis. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19664302468299866}], "tickers": ["bubble", "tsla", "tsla", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This entire point-by-point response is so appreciated, thank you so much for taking the time to write this out.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12120748311281204}], "tickers": ["nflx", "tsla", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Or at all?
