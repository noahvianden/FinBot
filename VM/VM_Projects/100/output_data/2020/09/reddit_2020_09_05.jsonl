{"title": "Beware not of a good product, be terrified by a good factory!", "selftext": "The main valid criticism to Tesla value is not around the product and its profitability but about the volume of production. \n\nFor any kind of product, there is always space for a niche version of it, where smaller volume, higher quality versions with higher return per unit are profitable enterprises. I would argue that this is a general axiom.\n\nThe legitimate question for an investor would be: is Tesla a niche enterprise or not. The answer to this question is key to my personal understanding of Tesla share values. There is clearly something that is astray with the production numbers and the capitalization. \n\nI fully understand the case that Tesla is not a car company, with my financial advisor framing it as an Energy and SW company. However their most visible line of products, besides battery packs, are automotive in nature.\n\nI am also looking at evaluation of other car companies and they are following a steady or downward trend. I have to believe that there are plenty of real analyst behind many ETF that look at these numbers and do not go for the media appearance, and have moved the stocks for what seems long term investment. Bubbles are always possible with heard dynamics, but what if there is another storyline? \n\nThe only one I can think is that analyst do not see anymore Tesla as a car maker but as a factory maker. This is a much bigger deal then having just a good car or an innovative technology. Let\u2019s explore the facts and the consequences.\n\n3 Gigafactories popping up in 18 months or less, all with the same basic design would  be Impressive by itself. The capability of completing these in accelerating record time is even more impressive. Factories bring immense political power, with jobs, paychecks and economic development that quickly outpace any tax break. \n\nSuddenly the earth is shifting under the feet of the incumbent manufacturers. The social strength of their position and even their status is no longer unquestionable. With an extreme simplification, They are no longer too big to fail, because a new factory can pop up by the time two board of directors convene to ponder the situation and realize it is too late.\n\nI now believe that the terrifying product of Tesla are factories. The machine that build the machines is here and Tesla is the now swinging a huge club smashing political and social structures in place for centuries. \n\nIf Tesla, next year, has 4 gigafactories producing cars, and start 2 or 3 new ones, it will be terrifying for the incumbents... by the next board of directors they will not have anybody to talk to. \n\nOf course, I am probably grossly wrong, my wife and kids will confirm this statement anytime.

How much time will they lose in their overhaul, how much market, all for their end product to leave a lot desired for.

{"title": "Royally Screwed - Here is my story", "selftext": "Dear Tesla investors i'm sharing my story with you not to make you feel bad for me but just to open your eyes. I was an investor of tesla at 600 a share pre split ( a price that would make your mouth water at these levels right now). During COVID crash i panicked and sold at 500 and took a considerable loss (-800). I ended up investing that money in VTIQ at 17 and over 4x'ing my money on the merger with NKLA so I ended up okay, but i still have regrets to sell.\n\nI re entered Tesla at 1350 on day of stock split announcement. I gave myself a 10% target and after less than 2 days i sold at 1615 and taught i was super smart (1500 dollar gain). I watched it hit  over 2000 and had the worst fomo ever, so pissed at myself (AGAIN). I re entered the friday before the split and got stopped out, and proceeded to watch the shares go over 20% up on monday on split day and was super pissed again. I felt like this stock could only go up and got clouded by fomo, i chucked my entire portfolio in at 480 for a swing trade and the rest is history. Insider selling (including executives, Elon's brother and institutions), 5 Billion equity raise and now i'm down over 6 grand on my 55 shares at an average cost basis of 481.5 (2400 pre-split).\n\nI am stuck, refuse to sell at a loss but also realize that I could be looking at much more pain in the weeks to come if s&p inclusion doesn't materialize or battery day dissapoints.\n\nI dug deep in the rest of  my savings and the most i can scrape is 5.5k, but even with that investment the best i can get my cost basis down to is about 460-465 (still terrible). Maybe i should use the 5.5k to swing trade  other stocks instead to make some of the money back.\n\nImmagine investing for a swing trade, not setting a stop loss or selling at break even (i could have done it many times during the day) but kept telling myself that a repeat of the previous times was going to happen and the next day was a 10-20% day. Every time i played it conservatively, i missed out on 20% runs, the one time i stay  in the stock i get hit by a -20% 2 day span. Cursed.\n\nI am royally screwed now and will probably not break even for months or years but there is not much i can do. Selling at a -6k loss isn't really an option, especially not on a stock like tesla.\n\nLessons i've learned:\n\n\\- Stick with companies u love (dont sell at 600 pre-stock split adjusted)\n\n\\-Set stop losses if you want to swing\n\n\\- NEVER chase the FOMO, or u might as well get stuck near the top ( like me) and never be able to recover again.\n\nI know most u have cost basis in the 60-175 range so these drops dont matter and you guys are still up 200-700% on ur investment, and i'm happy for u all. Just wanted to share my story with this cursed stock (btw my family owns 2 tesla's and we love them).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n23 years old. Entire portfolio (26.5k) in 1 stock at the top.

I am really sorry for how you are feeling right now - I've been there too.  I tried to time the market during the April recovery. I guessed wrong and lost 83 pre-split shares.  That hurt a lot.  I had trouble sleeping for days and was beating myself up for weeks afterwards.  It took a couple months to get over it.  Eventually what helped is I realized I needed to learn that I was arrogant to think that I can time the market.  I'm not wise enough or smart enough or insightful enough to time the market.\n\nShort term trading boils down to luck, pure and simple.  You may be able to glean a slight edge here and there, and you can definitely luck into some big wins.  But it's gambling, and everyone who partakes eventually loses.  The people who do well in the markets realize this and make long term investments that appropriately balance the risk they are taking w/ the rewards.  I think you know this and I think that's the silver lining in losing like you have.  You have the opportunity right now, at 23 years old, to learn to stop trying to time the market.

Life is teaching you some harsh lessons here, and I think you're going to need to work on trying to set emotions aside and stop trying to get rich so fast.  Just go slow.

The Feds are printing money like it's the only thing we're going to have left to burn this winter.  The housing market is crazier than your uncle making moonshine out of sheep dung, with 0% interest loans and the highest prices in some places since the last housing bubble. Meanwhile landlords have to take money out of their asses to pay for their mortgages that are due now, but they can't kick people who don't pay them out till after the election, just so the powers that be don't have to deal with this clusterf-ck now.\n\nThen, among all this chaos, you hear the news, Amazon is amazing, it just keeps growing!! TESLA is over-valued, but it keeps growing!! Apple, apple is amazing, they're doing a split and they always go up after a split!\n\nSo what do you do?

I need to sell and cut my losses!\" \n\nThere's one more saying we say around here.. Bears make money, Bulls make money, but greedy pigs get slaughtered.\n\nYou're smelling a lot like bacon from here.. \n\nDo your DD, the rule is buy low and sell high, not buy quick before you miss potential growth.\n\nIf you lost money and are lamenting to everyone that will hear, I don't feel bad for you. Take your losses and learn from it.\n\nRide your losses at least till you can minimize them. Have a strategy when you buy something. \n\nFeeling is how you spell failure here.

{"title": "Why we will see SPY 400+ by the end of October", "selftext": "The past two days have been traumatic. Bulls had months of gains wiped out in mere hours, while cocky, righteous bears came out from hibernation and made 3000% returns on 2DTE puts.\n\nWhat you might not realize is that this kind of violent pullback is completely normal (and even beneficial) as we approach the top, and I'm going to give you three reasons why what we just saw on Wednesday (Nasdaq 12.4k, SPY 358) is FAR from the true top of this move:\n\n1. Many bulls will admit that we are in, or approaching, \"bubble\" territory. But consider what happened near the peak of the DotCom bubble. In January, 2000, the NDX experienced a 13% move down in 7 days, a sharp, violent correction that likely wiped out a lot of short-term longs (sound familiar?). Then, in the next 1.5 months, we saw a massive \\~35% run up to the very top. \n2. Interestingly, the peak of bullish sentiment happened around early January, 2000, while the actual index peaked in March. (Notice how bullish sentiment peaked in this sub on Wednesday? We might not get back to that euphoric sentiment ever again--but that doesn't mean the markets won't go higher.) It's often said that markets are good at \"climbing the wall of worry\", and that is precisely what we will see over the next two months as a variety of intangible fears grip investors.\n3. There was no real fundamental catalyst for the NDX dump; it was more of a technical pullback closer to the long- and medium-term moving averages. The next two months will see a lot of buzz about election fears, second wave fears, civil war fears, protest fears, trade war fears, etc etc, you name it. This is a great wall of worry to climb. None of these fears will actually be realized until November (at the earliest) which is exactly why the market will not fall until then or thereafter. Stimulus news in the next two weeks will help push this final leg up.\n\nTl;dr We will moon in the next 2 months; SPY 400-450 depending on level of delusion, NDX 14k+\n\nPositions: SPY 400c 10/16, 410c 11/20, then around the election switch to long-dated SPY puts, e.g. SPY 200p 09/17/2021", "id": "in2dch", "created_utc": 1599317426.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, take your unemployment check and let the next person come to the window.", "score": 177, "replies": [{"body": "But wait, there\u2019s more...", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15867409110069275}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13311654329299927}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "At least I know you\u2019re in deeper shit than I, if it drops again", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07740624248981476}, {"body": "Jesus dude, just buy straight stonks on a dip through a Holiday weekend.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06458114832639694}, {"body": "My god", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21345259249210358}, {"body": "Same here brother, god speed", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.030468769371509552}, {"body": "damn, we'll probably retest the highs at some point before the election so hope the expiry is long enough,,", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06604401767253876}, {"body": "Well the heavy selling looks to be done.
