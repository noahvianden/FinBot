Would also like to sell calls on easyJet but unfortunately there are no options available.\n\nNow I decided to use Credit Suisse for selling covered options because it gives medium returns with low risk; same for UBS; they both have somewhat decent fundamentals.\n\nGeneral Electric would be possible but has poor fundamentals (earnings per share negative since 2017; low Piotroski-score).\n\nBarrick Gold could be very interesting but you need 2800 $ to sell one cash secured put.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m new to the wheel.

Should the call buyer exercise, you would be responsible for buying 100 shares of TSLA at $500 each in the open market which you would only get paid $400 per share for. That's why there's larger collateral requirements for selling naked options. Because theoretically your risks are unlimited.  But if you sold that same $400c and bought a $410c as a hedge, your risk is now defined and you would receive a credit (cost of $400c minus cost of $410c)  and your max loss would be the credit received minus the width of the strikes.  For example if you received $525 in premium for the $400c sale, your max loss would be $475 if the price blew past your $410c.  This sample trade is known as a call credit spread.
