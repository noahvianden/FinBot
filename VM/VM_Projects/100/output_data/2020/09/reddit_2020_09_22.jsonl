Amazon has the most mature model with the greatest breadth of ways to implement for so many different levels. It's so easy to get set-up on AWS. Oh and Amazon makes it very easy to get stuff into their cloud. Like if you have actual hard disks that need to be stored Amazon will ship to you the stuff you need to put all that information onto to get it safely into their cloud. \n\nMicrosoft wins because so many companies also rely heavily on Microsoft to take care of so many other things. The Microsoft ecosystem is running strong. So many company's rely extremely heavily on things like AD, Exchange mail, IIS, etc. Oh and of course every computer that a company hands out is going to run Windows if they aren't a primary Apple product firm. \n\nGoogle literally hasn't innovated like Microsoft or Amazon in the cloud space. They just made a clone of what those guys did but with the Google name attached with the hope that their perceived market value will win them customers. Of course it will work, but it can only work for so long until the entire marketplace is saturated with only AWS and Azure experts. The signs show that Google is not dominating as expected and if you actually speak with Google recruiters (one reached out to me around early 2019 when they were most aggressively hiring to which I turned down and then reached back out later to learn this) they are hiring very heavily for senior SALES people because they are attempting to sell what they have. In the future they might just become like Oracle cloud, kind of there and working for their trusted partner's but maybe not a top dog. Google has tried this sort of tactic with other stuff when it comes to mimicking and selling and it hasn't worked out so hot for them in the past (thinking back to Google+). \n\nGoogle's best contribution to the infrastructure space was Kubernetes and that's pretty much opened up for the whole world to use so it's kind of lost for them. Their AI stuff only stands to get mimicked and grown by channels that are more popular, I don't think Google's infrastructure space is going to thrive but will likely remain as a niche player.\n\nGoogle Home is a solid product, but they sucked at branding it. Like you say \"Alexa\" and you say \"Siri\" and everyone knows this. They freaking made everyone say \"Google\" it's a poor job and it just doesn't have the power to be on top because of their lack of effort towards defining something that people can feel more relatable to. \n\nGoogle won when it came to making Chrome, the growth it's created on YouTube, G Suite is a decent set of applications - but frankly Outlook just looks better than any GMail interface I've seen. Google seems firm to sit in second or third place for a ton of it's entry points if it doesn't fall completely flat (see Chromebook, Pixel growth, Google+ again). Part of the problem stems from poor branding decisions, part stems from products that are not engineered properly or too thought out, and part stems from Google just wasn't going to be able to compete in that new space.\n\nGoogle has it's powerhouse which is data, it has the most powerful search engine in the world, but until some real innovation that has a direct impact in the enterprise or personal computing space makes massive waves - which hasn't happened since chrome - emerges, they are looking closer to a stagnant firm with solid growth from their core competencies and maybe a few winners, but it says a lot when their biggest winner in Chrome was lead by the guy that is their current CEO, they are well aware of what worked and now it's a question of where they can find internally the product that will meet the same level of demand.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "msft", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Also, Google is taking over education with Google classroom.

MSFT launched a connector for  FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) , which is one of the main data formats hospitals use. I think msft's enterprise expertise will better help them win big healthcare deals compared with amzn. Both will definitely do well though. \n\nHere is a quote from the article I linked,  \n\n\"She notes that the connector focuses on biometric data at the ingestion layer, \"which means it can connect at the device-to-cloud or cloud-to-cloud work streams. Health data can be sent to Event Hub, Azure IoT Hub\u00a0or Azure IoT Central, and then converted to FHIR resources, which enables care teams to view patient data captured from IoT devices in context with clinical records in FHIR.\"\n\nCartwright touts Azure IoT Connector for FHIR's capabilities, such as its ability to convert biometric data \u2013blood glucose levels, heart rate and\u00a0pulse oximeter readings \u2013 from connected devices into FHIR resources; scalability and real-time data processing; integration with Azure IoT tools and Azure Stream Analytics; role-based access control; audit log-tracking; and an array of security compliances\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/microsoft-unveils-azure-iot-connector-fhir-help-rpm-security](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/microsoft-unveils-azure-iot-connector-fhir-help-rpm-security)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting.
