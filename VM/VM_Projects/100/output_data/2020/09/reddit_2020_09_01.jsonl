He's very aware that he's gaming the system but he's not doing anything illegal (yet) and that's why he's great. He's capitalizing on opportunity. He's also different than some others who have come before him w/ similar attitudes because even though he acts like a cult leader and manipulates the system, he doesn't really do it purely for personal gain. He does it because he genuinely wants everyone to drive a fuckin TSLA and genuinely wants to shoot people into space and land them on Mars. You don't launch a fucking car into space if you're not passionate about your job. Some CEOs like him only do it to enrich themselves, but Musk is a go for broke type of person and isn't afraid to spend into the ground and declare bankruptcy if it means the best possible chance of success. He's nuts, but this is a really good trait to have when you're nuts IMO. BTW just to be clear I am not at all a Musk fanboy, just sharing my thoughts. I think he does a lot of shady shit too but I don't believe that his personal mission is to enrich himself or even to enrich his investors. I believe it's more a personal mission to see if he can do what he sets out to do.\n\nIt's also important not to forget that he has a ton of experience from his past that helps him make decisions now. He started PayPal and bankrupted SolarCity as well as growing SpaceX to what it is today even when everyone thought he was insane.

If you're a holder of 10 candybars in the candybar market, and there are 100 candybars total in the market, you own 10% of the market. If candybars, inc then goes and sells 25 more candybars into the market at $2 each, you still own 10 candybars, but there are 125 in the market. Your holdings have gone from 10% to 8%. That's a 2% dilution. Scale it up to TSLA shares now...there are currently about 150 million shares outstanding. If TSLA sells 10 million more shares to raise capital they are diluting everyone's shares by 6.67% (10/150). So theoretically, if the stock price doubles to $1k a share and TSLA decides to sell all $5 billion at 1k/share, that means they will sell 5 million shares into the market (5B/1000 = 5M) which would justify a 3.33% drop (5/150) from $1k to a new price of $966.67. If they decide to sell them all *tomorrow*, to raise the same $5 billion at $500ish they would need to sell 10 million shares which is almost a 7% dilution, so if they did that you could expect the stock to drop about 7% tomorrow.\n\nEdit: fixed numbers cause I can't math\n\nEdit2: I took the shares outstanding number from float on Finviz. It's possible that's outta date due to the split. Technically there are probably 5x as many shares now since I'm almost positive TSLA was like 140-150 million float before the split, but anyway if that's the case it just means the dilutive effect is smaller by the split factor.

{"title": "Walmart VS Amazon, the next big online retailer (Walmart DD). Why my money is on Walmart", "selftext": "**Walmart Due Dilligence**\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n\\- Partnership with Instacart\n\nRecently Walmart and Instacart have founded a partnership that will allow Walmart to use Instacart their same-day shipping service. \\[Walmart and Instacart together make up for nearly 50% of the online grocery sales.\\]( [https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)) Walmart\u2019s vast inventory and Instacart their network and experience will only strengthen their position as the dominant grocery delivery providers, and thus putting more pressure on Amazon.\n\n\\- Partnership with Shopify\n\nIn addition to Instacart Walmart has also partnered with Shopify. This new partnership will allow third-party sellers to directly sell their item\u2019s on the Walmart marketplace. This new partnership will greatly expand Walmart\u2019s inventory while giving small businesses the opportunity to reach a bigger demographic. Walmart is expecting to add 1200 Shopify sellers in 2020. Listing an item on Walmart\u2019s marketplace allows Walmart to pick up some fees and generate greater traffic to the website. Another interesting possibility to consider is the fact that Walmart could be used as a Shopify returns hub, with a Walmart being within 10 miles of 90% of the US population it is the ideal candidate for further strengthening their relation with Shopify and saving both parties a lot of money.\n\n\\- Partnership with ThredUp\n\nWalmart has also partnered with Thredup. ThredUp is basically an online thrift shop for clothes and wearable\u2019s. This brilliant partnership means Walmart can now offer both normal and high-end clothing on their marketplace for an affordable price and expose customers to nearly 750,000 pre-owned items. Who would\u2019ve ever thought you could tell someone that you bought your Michael Kors or Calvin Klein at Walmart.\n\n\\- Google\n\nWalmart has been partners with Google for over 3 years now. This partnership allowed Walmart to enter the domain of voice ordering groceries. Simply ask one of your Google devices to buy milk and it will add milk to your Shopping cart. This Partnership might just be the beginning of a strong bond between Google and Walmart as both companies are interested in competing with Amazon.\n\n\\- Microsoft (+ Possible TikTok acquisition)\n\nWalmart has been partnered with Microsoft for about 2 years with 3 more years to go.\n\nSince the partnership Walmart has been using the full range of Microsoft cloud solutions in a bid to accelerate their digital transformation, innovation and efficiency.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\n\\- Bonobos, ModCloth, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Parcel\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning, with these acquisitions Walmart stated entering the e-commerce market in 2016-2017. Sadly as is known none of these are particularly success stories with the companies being sold again, being discontinued or CEO\u2019s leaving. However Walmart learned a lot from these companies and has used this knowledge to further try to expand in the e-commerce market.\n\n\\- Jet.com\n\nThe first big step in the fight against Amazon. When amazon acquired Jet.com it was a clear signal of what its intentions were. Jet.com was one of the fastest growing U.S. e-commerce companies and Walmart acquired them in September 2016. Since then a lot has happened, Jet.com has been discontinued but the knowledge, progress and technology gained due to Jet.com is irreplaceable and has given Walmart a brilliant boost into the e-commerce with their e-commerce sales increasing 29%. Furthermore (ex)CEO of jet.com Marc Lore is now the CEO of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce.\n\n\\- Flipkart\n\nEver heard of the small startup company called Flipkart? Maybe you have not, you should though. Flipkart owns 35% of the Indian e-commerce market, a true giant. Walmart acquired Flipkart in 2018 and ever since then it has been expanding its influence in India and fighting against Amazon for market dominance. This year Flipkart took over Walmart\u2019s 28 Indian stores in order to expand its wholesale growth. Another interesting thing is that Walmart might make Flipkart public within the next 3 years.\n\n\\- TikTok acquisition\n\nSome very recent news of their Partnership with Microsoft is to potentially acquire TikTok. TikTok\u2019s enormous userbase and the current pressure in the US and India have made for an interesting situation causing the partnership to push forward in the bid to acquiring TikTok. In my opinion Walmart has a very decent chance of getting TikTok and making it work. One factor that plays a big role in this is Walmart\u2019s presence in India due to Flipkart. Flipkart is India\u2019s biggest online store for; phones, electronics, books, home appliances, etc. With Walmart having a presence in both countries where TikTok is (going to be) banned might mean some positive things for the future, but for now that is speculation. The acquisition of TikTok would allow Walmart to use its genius algorithm and massive userbase to further promote and integrate its Walmart marketplace.\n\n**Walmart PLUS**\n\nWord is finally out, in September Walmart will be launching its Amazon competitor called Walmart plus. It will give numerous benefits to the user such as; Unlimited free delivery(with 2700 stores having same day delivery), fuel discounts and scan&go a tool to make shopping faster, all for the price of $98 per year\n\n**2 Hour Delivery**\n\nWalmart recently launches its new delivery service, called Express Delivery. This new service will allow customers to place their order online and receive their groceries (for a 10$ fee) within 2 hours. Walmart express delivery is currently available in 800 stores with plans to expand to 2000 stores. In addition to 2 hour delivery Walmart also offers same-day delivery in almost the entire United States.\n\n**5000+ US stores.**\n\nThis is Walmart\u2019s biggest weapon. The thing Amazon lacks the most is physical stores. Walmart has over 5000 stores while Amazon has just over 600 (worldwide!). If Walmart can find a way to combine e-commerce with its enormous physical presence then it could give Amazon an absolute run for its money. Remember that 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart.\n\n**Some other interesting facts to consider.**\n\n\\- 90% of US population live within 10miles of a Walmart.\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales are currently up 97%\n\n\\- Walmart\u2019s expansion in Africa, India, China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nLet me first state with you that this has been my first Due Dilligence and that English is not my first language.\n\nWalmart is currently the underdog, and not many people are expecting them to properly fight Amazon. However its recent spree of partnerships and acquisitions have been a brilliant and very clear move in the direction of e-commerce. If Walmart fully utilized its massive physical network together when their growing fresh e-commerce, I see no other outcome then for Walmart to grow, grow, grow. Covid has given Walmart customers the push they needed to fully explore Walmart their marketplace, the marketplace that is now starting to fill up with thousands of sellers and endless products. Walmart VS Amazon, here we go, my money is on Walmart.\n\nSources:\n\nInstacart:\n\n[https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GroceryDelivery-chart2png-1024x631.png)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/08/12/walmart-teams-up-with-instacart-to-rival-amazons-fast-grocery-delivery/#3bde97546010)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363507/walmart-instacart-partnership-same-day-grocery-delivery-amazon-whole-foods-rivalry)\n\nShopify:\n\n[https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/06/15/walmart-expands-its-ecommerce-marketplace-to-more-small-businesses)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/15/walmarts-new-shopify-partnership-is-another-stroke-of-digital-genius/#26a4e18e3025)\n\nThredUp\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2020/06/05/walmarts-thredup-partnership-is-the-best-digital-move-walmart-has-made-in-the-last-3-years/#265d62952172)\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438\\_6272369\\_7404214](https://www.walmart.com/browse/clothing/thredup-shop-all/5438_6272369_7404214)\n\nGoogle:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/walmart-and-google-partner-on-voice-based-shopping/)\n\nMicrosoft

A couple of questions then.\n\nFirst, if there is so much supply in call options in Tesla and similar names, then that would imply that the options would be relatively cheap as a result of increased supply. Correct?\n\nSecond, if Elon is trying to leverage a split to pump his shares, what's his endgame? He would either have to do another share offering to raise captial at a high valaution or just sell stock because he knew it was overvauled. Right?  (I believe that there was an issue with convertible debt previously, but the split announcement was way beyond the price of the convertibles. So that debt issue is essentially gone I thought.)\n\nThird, if what you're saying is true, why doesn't a big fund like ARK invest sell call options and get out of the stock. If everyone knows it's a pumped bubble, why aren't they getting out?\n\nFourth, Warren Buffet has a s-ton of Apple stock but that $#@& keeps going up. Are you saying that a similar thing to Tesla is happening with that stock, and if so, why isn't Buffet selling?\n\nPersonally, when I say Robinhood traders, I mean all the new dumb money in the market. And the expectations as a result.  Small traders are WeBull, Ameritrade, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, wherever.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes said that prices in the market aren't one's expectations of the market, but rather one's expectations of the expectations of others.\n\nNobody on Fast Money today thought Zoom's valuation was justifiable. All you saw from them was comparing the valaution to other large companies and analysts being flabbergasted that a company with such anemic revenues at near its market peak could be worth so much.\n\nThose market makers are affraid of something, and it's getting caught up in the euphoria of this speculative market that is approaching the retardation of the Tulip and South Sea Bubbles (...and I'm not just talking about stocks). If people think others are going to think that others are going to pump a stock, then they'll plan accordingly. Right?\n\nSo smart money thinks other smart money will trade Zoom up because they see some quick buying after hours by dumb@$$ Robinhood traders so they start to trade the momentum and then it begins to snowball. Since it is a bigger stock, there is more more money to play it and it's tech so everyone knows it has all the momentum given have has happened to the NASDAQ.

Except for the fact that this allows him to drive forward other projects to impact humanity (and possibly save the human existence). That's why him not selling shares at such an obviously inflated price perplexes me.\n\nYou can look at Elon's history of decisions that were clearly not be beneficial from a personal wealth aspect and from a competitive advantage standpoint. Where he would give away certain proprietary things and share insights that would increase the company's competitive advantage. Those decisions seemed to come from a place of trying to make the world better and prevent the violent end that is possibly approaching. \n\nHe's also stated in the past that the company's share price isn't really a concern of his.

They offer good price-to-performance but with Nvidia competing on prices for the 3070 gamers might just buy that instead.\n\nJust to put it into perspective for those who don't know about GPUs:\n\n2080Ti is still a fucking beast even by todays standards and costs over $1,200 right now.\n\n3070 is better than the 2080Ti, for less than half the cost.\n\n3080 is better than the 3070 and *still* cheaper than the 2080Ti\n\n3090 is an absolute behemoth of a card, for a little bit more than the 2080Ti.\n\nI'll probably buy a 3080 myself, or maybe a 3090. These new GPUs are epic. I have a 2080 Super, but at these prices it's hard to find a reason not to buy the 30xx series\n\nOh and let's not forget that GPUs isn't Nvidias only source of income.
