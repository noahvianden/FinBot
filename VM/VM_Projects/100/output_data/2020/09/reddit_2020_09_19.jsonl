Also, I think a lot of the stock run up was inflation expectations and flight to safety. JPow basically took the inflation  thought away on Wed when he said no inflation until at least 2023 (and thats IF everything goes well). God help us if deflation kicks in - in that scenario the market is likely highly overvalued. So now the market needs to price in all of the above making that generous 25% valuation above a stretch.

Commercial Bonds and Treasuries giving a strong signal on this as well. If you want to understand why, look up a guy called Lacy Hunt and listen to any interview he has given in the last year.\n\nCan this change?

This lowers yields on long dated treasuries in exchange for stronger reserves but those reserves are not available as cash for the banks to just use. They sit on their reserve accounts at the fed.\n\n1. What is this signaling? Yields lower means.....lower inflation not higher (see the Fisher equation). The commercial bond market would have disagreed if untrue - that hasn't happened.\n2. It takes liquidity out of the system. Banks could have sold those treasuries privately for cash but instead the fed took them out of the system and injected reserves that aren't  getting used because....\n3. Banks aren't lending. In fact they are tightening their lending standards (August loan survey shows this). Credit lending is where the actual money supply expands - it's not at the treasury-to-reserves phase above. That had almost no impact. Unfortunately people think the fed is \"printing\" when it's not really.\n\nTo get things \"inflating\" total money and  credit has to expand and velocity of money needs to go up. Consumers and businesses aren't taking on new debt (you can look up the h.8 data from the fed each Friday to see this - it's pretty bad). \n\nSo, now the government steps in and spends. But all they do is keep the lights on - there are no productive assets or investment in the future, just more debt that has to be paid back. This just  creates a tax on future growth. Government spending used to increase gdp but estimates from Lacy Hunt suggest it is now decreasing it. In Japan it's very pronounced - and they have had deflation/anemic inflation for 30 years despite all the same tricks the fed is trying.\n\nTL;DR QE spurring inflation is just a ridiculous logical fallacy.

{"title": "Not sure if it's luck or I am gokd at this", "selftext": "Dear autists, \n\nI am a university student currently in the last year of my under grad. Last year, I took a year off to work as a software engineer for an internship position. My work term was coming to an end and I had all this money leftover that I did not know what to do with. I live with my parents as my university is only a 10 mins drive away from my house and is cheaper and less time consuming for me personally.\n\nWith all this money just sitting around with virtually no expenses, I decided to start looking into the stock market when the pandemic started back in march. In may, I finally started trading with $3000 on penny stocks and lost over half my account.\n\nDoing more research (spending over 2+ hours everyday) on how to day trade, I started making a little bit of money. I then put in $5000 more earlier August into my account. In this time, I also discovered this sexy subreddit with risk takers like yourself.\n\nAfter this, I started making around $100-$300 everyday. Since then, I haven't lost money and infact, I made all the money I had lost, back. I had heard about options but didn't know what they were. Last week, I spent a lot of my time learning it along with doing school work.\n\nThis monday, I bought 1 option for tesla and sold it the next day for a profit of $3500. The rest of the days this week, I day traded tesla making at least $1000 everyday putting every dime penny I had in my account in each transaction.\n\nAt this point, I feel like when I am trading, I am really just looking at the  support, resistance, and the momentum as well as the direction of the stock. I am not sure whether I am good at this and know what I am doing, or is it just pure luck that I have gotten this far ahead.\n\nMy account grew from $8000 to $14000 so far. A lot of that was from this week alone.\n\nPlease let me know if this is exactly how I am supposed to be trading. If it is pure luck I have gotten this far, anything I can do to develop a safe proof trading strategy?\n\nThanks", "id": "ivmkkh", "created_utc": 1600493245.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Yes, this is how you should be trading.

Plus, as a reality check: if it was just looking at support, resistance, and momentum or whatever (i.e. if it was as easy as just looking at the shapes of the curves) quants, algos, and serious pros would beat you to literally everything.\n\nThe market prefers to be random, when it behaves in predictable ways it's because an equilibrium has been unsettled. The market will always try to restore equilibrium and maximize entropy. Everything does this, but the market does it faster because you have career traders and quants obliterating taking advantage of every edge they can.\n\nThink of it like this: If there was a predictable pattern to the market, we would all know that (or at least the smart guys on wallsteet would) and therefore trade accordingly. If this happened, that pattern would get completely ironed out and the market would return to total random noise again.\n\nThis is why big companies do weird shit like buy absurd amounts of market research data or try to run everything through fiber optics. They need to be the first to find an advantage before anyone else finds out. They want to listen to the static noise in the wire, before it gets to the speakers.\n\nAnyways, my point is that you probably have some small idea what you're looking at, but a week is so short it could just be luck.\n\nMy advice is that you should very quickly stop just relying on shapes and move to actually understanding what your trading. Read up on battery tech and ev's or whatever. Attend conferences. Look around and see what people like and do and are interested in.

Why? Even if you follow your position extremely closely and make good decisions based on what is happening to the company and it\u2019s chart, you\u2019re not controlling for the possibility of an exogenous event systematically lowering the stock market. There have been several days this year where the price of stocks, not an individual stock, almost universally fell several percent. If you were all in on calls on any one of these days, your account would have gotten killed. What you\u2019re doing works at this moment, but it\u2019s extremely fragile. Why not just put a percentage of your account into each position? Surviving is more important than making max profit...\n\nYou seem reasonably intelligent, so take these lucky gains you have and spend more time learning about how options strategies work so you can get leverage without risking your entire account. You have a quantitative background, use it to actually learn about what you\u2019re doing before risking it all. Technical analysis (using chart indicators) can be helpful for timing entry and exit from a position, but they tend to lag big moves in a stock and relying on them will leave you holding the bag. \n\nLearn the Greeks and spend time using software to visualize different options strategies and how they are affected by time, volatility, and price movement. Check out some videos from TastyTrade to learn about different strategies (look at Mike and His Whiteboard). \n\nIf you use spreads AND have both long and short positions for different stocks, you\u2019re more likely to make money AND survive in the long run. Think about it, if you\u2019re both long some things and short others, you\u2019re better hedged against a large, systematic movement of the market. Benchmark your performance based on risk-adjusted return, not total return. Imagine someone who made a 100% return by playing Russian roulette, is it worth it when you consider that 1/6 times you lose everything?\n\nBooks I\u2019d recommend:\nFooled by Randomness by Nassim Taleb; just read the first couple of chapters and you\u2019ll see how what you\u2019re doing is benefitting from randomness, which also means you are a slave to it. \n\nTrading Options Greeks by Daniel Passarelli; will teach you about the intuition behind the Greeks and how options pricing is a function of price, volatility, and time. \n\nIf you\u2019re not using ThinkorSwim or Trader Work Station or equivalent software that let\u2019s you analyze option trade P/L graphs, you\u2019re just gambling and you\u2019re wasting the fact that you have the capacity to develop a quantitative understanding.\n\nCheers and good luck!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, I will try to do as you said.

{"title": "My case as a Bear | Prediction.", "selftext": "Morning guys,   \n\n\nFigure I'll try to give my two cent. I won't make it long cause I like to make things simple.   \n\\-Vaccine timeline is actually longer than you think. You can play around with the following to see an rough estimate. Anything at the end of the year is highly highly unrealistic.   \n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html)\n\n\\-On a daily chart. S&P 500 and QQQ is showing a falling wedge. Bears have been gaining ground aggressively. Although support is holding right now, I dont' believe that this would hold true in the next week. \n\n\\-Our US gov is going to dick around and not give you a stimulus for a bit. (Chances are medium here.)   \nEven if they do it would be modest at best.   \n\n\n\\-We priced in everything for when vaccines does happen. Although I think that's just a dream that we all had. I believe people are going to come into a realization that our economy are getting hit pretty hard. Once people stop living in a tech dream, which I believe already started happening on Sep 4th. Correctly it's holding together, because some people refuse to come out just yet. \n\n\\-Any grounds that tech can gain is already priced in. It will be much harder for bulls to gain ground in current condition. You want bulls to gain ground, some magical vaccine deal gotta come in.... I doubt that. Even if vaccine were to gain ground, the money will flow back into airline, oil, etc. \n\n\\-QQQ was holding ground for earnings, and random tech events. (Apple day, TSLA battery etc). Nothing holding this up next week. Sorry.   \n\n\nMy thoughts:   \n\\-Take your profit aggressively for bulls. (Daily)   \n\\-Bears, hold your shorts.   \n\n\nThis coming week: \n\n  \nMonday: Baby bull day. \n\nTuesday: Consolidation \n\nWeds: Bear \n\nThursday: Bear \n\nFriday Bear\n\nEdited: \nShorted : TSLA 420, yes I know the irony.\nThanks to you guys, I have since updated my stance on the Vaccine, and it shows that it might be possible to have it earlier. Although I still have my remarks in regarding it. \n\\-vaccine is bad for tech\n\\-hard for tech to hold current growth level with rona still in play. Since most of the users who needs it already started in Q2. Q3 earning will slow down, and Q4 would be worst. I expect a correction, then buy in.
