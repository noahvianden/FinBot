Pratt's in a world of hurt in commercial aviation for the short term.\n\nLook at which widebody(large) aircraft they power...you can buy a Pratt engine on the 767, A330, and \"classic\" 777's. (777-200/ER + 777-300 non ER. 777-200LR and 777-300ER as well as 777F are exclusively GE engines) \nOn the 777 they have 15% market share, and I don't think a 777 with Pratt engines has even been delivered in the last ten years.\n\nThe 767 is only getting engines from them for the Air Force deal, Fedex and UPS are the last two major civil customers, they've both chosen GE engines.\n\nA330's with Pratt engines are highly undesirable as is. They only makeup 15% market share on the A330-300 and 14% share on the A330-200. Compared with Rolls Royce with 68% and 58% respectively, or GE at 17% and 28%. \n\nSo, of the widebody aircraft you'll find Pratt engines on, most are older, undesirable aircraft, with low resale value. They tend to end up as scrap.\n\nThen they have the V2500 on classic Airbus narrowbodies, which is winding down production if it hasn't already, and will strictly be parts and service.\n\nThe only thing they have going for them is the geared turbofan on the A220/A32Xneo/MRJ/ERJ. All new expensive aircraft in a time when fuel is cheap and there's tons of used aircraft around. Also has had lots of teething issues with bearings and seals. Pratt focused so much on getting the gear box right that they seemingly forgot how to make the rest of the engine. \n\nDisclaimer I own RTX stock, and I like the company. Just expect to see Pratt continue to lag as a division for the foreseeable future. That said, when things turn around, the Airbus A32Xneo and A220 are perfectly positioned for many carriers. Also, even though Pratt's struggling, they're decently positioned long term. A220 is exclusively GTF, and CFM (JV between GE and SAFRAN who makes the other narrowbody engine choices) have been struggling themselves with the LEAP engine on the 737MAX and A320neo, so even though Pratt's struggling, CFM is too\n\nOnce they sort out the GTF I think they'll be well positioned, but it'll be a few years.\n\n\nEDIT: That said, their decision to not bid on newer widebodies (777X/350/330neo) will likely help them short term as there's a glut of widebody aircraft on the market. Still never good to entirely give up a market, but if they can scale the GTF to widebody thrust levels, they'll be in great shape in 10 years, seeing as both Rolls and GE are struggling too", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ups"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5819463133811951}, {"body": "Ok so people are going to downvote the hell out of me but Apple, CMO, what\u2019s the big deal with this company. \n\nWho\u2019s to say they won\u2019t go the way of Nokia.
