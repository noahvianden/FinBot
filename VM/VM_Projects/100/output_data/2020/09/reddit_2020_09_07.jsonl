Sensor without the needed computer power or software are useless input device. Tesla still has the lead on data when it comes to FSD.\n\nDrivetrain/efficiency that are stated are big improvement over an already efficiency drivetrains already in mass production. I feel as though some trade off have been made to achieve these gains like  increased cost, decrease reliability, or less than stated improvements. Time and more independent testing will provide more details. \n\nMore Frunk space-Not the top priority for most people buying  EV\u2019s especially at the $150,000 level. Any company can produce a EV with an even bigger Frunk if consumers demand it in the future. \n\nI can see it now Lucid driver pulls up next to a model S driver and points to the larger Frunk.  In turn model S driver opens his Frunk with $50,000 in cash he saved buying the Tesla over the Lucid. \n\n900 volts \u201carchitecture\u201d-can we all just call it system voltage like normal people- 300 KWs charging is crazy good and is needed to charge a large size battery pack in reasonable time frame. How many 300 KW chargers will Lucid have or have access to? Probably less than Tesla\u2019s V3 250 KW chargers. \n\nMy overall thoughts on the unveiling. The car is the nicest looking EV I\u2019ve seen and it has to be to sell in the high end luxury vehicle market. They will sell every unit they produce especially at low production rates at first. I believe Lucid will have a difficult time transition to lower cost vehicles and will probably stay in the lucrative luxury market over the long term. Lucid seems to have copied Tesla\u2019s game plan with matching products(power wall) and road map to lowering the cost of their vehicles. Although Tesla was able to transition from high end to mass market EVs over a ten years without any competition. A hard challenge for any company at this point in time.
