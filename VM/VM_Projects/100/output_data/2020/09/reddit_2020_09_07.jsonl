Sensor without the needed computer power or software are useless input device. Tesla still has the lead on data when it comes to FSD.\n\nDrivetrain/efficiency that are stated are big improvement over an already efficiency drivetrains already in mass production. I feel as though some trade off have been made to achieve these gains like  increased cost, decrease reliability, or less than stated improvements. Time and more independent testing will provide more details. \n\nMore Frunk space-Not the top priority for most people buying  EV\u2019s especially at the $150,000 level. Any company can produce a EV with an even bigger Frunk if consumers demand it in the future. \n\nI can see it now Lucid driver pulls up next to a model S driver and points to the larger Frunk.  In turn model S driver opens his Frunk with $50,000 in cash he saved buying the Tesla over the Lucid. \n\n900 volts \u201carchitecture\u201d-can we all just call it system voltage like normal people- 300 KWs charging is crazy good and is needed to charge a large size battery pack in reasonable time frame. How many 300 KW chargers will Lucid have or have access to? Probably less than Tesla\u2019s V3 250 KW chargers. \n\nMy overall thoughts on the unveiling. The car is the nicest looking EV I\u2019ve seen and it has to be to sell in the high end luxury vehicle market. They will sell every unit they produce especially at low production rates at first. I believe Lucid will have a difficult time transition to lower cost vehicles and will probably stay in the lucrative luxury market over the long term. Lucid seems to have copied Tesla\u2019s game plan with matching products(power wall) and road map to lowering the cost of their vehicles. Although Tesla was able to transition from high end to mass market EVs over a ten years without any competition. A hard challenge for any company at this point in time.

Since it takes ~10 options trades, according to Google searches, to enable spreads, should I find a handful of cheap af options ($0.01-0.05 premium) and hold for a day past the PDT rule to speed up the process? Am I being too impatient and reckless? Is there anything that can go drastically wrong with this approach? I understand I would essentially throw away $10 or more, but I figure a consistent low risk strategy opening spreads will cover that cost fairly quickly. Any thoughts and guidance is much appreciated. Thanks", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You have a life long marathon of several hundred thousand trades ahead of you.

The reason that there is no guarantee is that you need to consider the cost of closing the trade. It's a short position, so you have to cover the short. You will collect the full $1.90 up front, but you might have to pay $0.50 to close, so you'll net $1.40 when all is said and done.\n\n> If the price goes above $60, let's assume someone exercises. So now I've made $21,660 + (114 * 100 * 60) = $705,660. Question 2: Is this math right?\n\nNo, because you will have exited the trade before that happens. But let's say you fell into a coma and couldn't exit. If that scenario happened, your total P/L would be ((60 - 24.75) x 11400) + (1.90 x 114 x 100). Essentially, you get the gain on the stock put up for collateral, up to the $60 strike, and you keep the credit from the calls. \n\nIf SHLL actually goes up to $70 on expiration, you don't get the extra $10 gain. You get the gain described above for $60. This is the biggest downside to CCs when it comes to rising stock value. $60, $70, $100, you get the same amount of money no matter how high it goes above $60.\n\n> Question 3: If the price never reaches $60, I keep the premium?\n\nYes, less the cost of closing.\n\n> Question 4: the only \"risk\" here is if the price goes way above $60 and I miss out on those gains, right? Or if the stock plummets below 24.75\n\nCorrect. The latter is the big risk. If SHLL falls to $2, the credit you earned on the calls won't make up for the loss on the stock.\n\n> How the fuck is this not free money? $60's goddamn fine by me. In order to find the strikes with the highest probability of getting picked up, should I be looking at just straight volume/OI, or should I factor any Greeks into the planning?\n\nIt's not free money for the reasons already mentioned: capped gains, all the downside risk of the shares by themselves.\n\nDon't worry about \"getting picked up\". It's an auction. You'll get a fill if you offer a price that someone else is willing to pay. You'll just need to make sure you have a broker that can handle trades of that size and not charge you an arm and a leg to do it.\n\nYou should indeed consider the expiration date (9/18 is too close to today, IMO -- try 30 to 45 days out, you'll get more premium that way and will have more time to adjust if bad shit happens), volume/OI and greeks. They are all important. You want high volume, narrow bid/ask on the strike, just like trading stocks. You want IV to be as high as possible, without taking on too much risk -- IV is usually higher closer to the money, but closer to the money is higher risk for a short call.\n\nDoes SHLL pay a dividend? If it does, some additional care is needed around the exdiv data. Google \"options dividend risk\" if needed.\n\nI would recommend doing a trial run first, with just one contract. Get a feel for how CCs work before committing that much money. As already mentioned, plan on exiting early, don't hold until expiration. It's not as much of an issue for a covered call, since you are okay with getting called away, but say at expiration SHLL is $59.80 and you think you are going to squeeze by with max credit and keep your shares, but after hours SHLL jumps up to $80 and your calls are assigned and you only get $60 a share. You're going to be crying that you didn't close the calls before expiration, to make the most of the big jump up in the share price.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your long and thoughtful reply! And yes, I'll be trying this out next week shortly before the 9/18 options expire, with just a 100 shares.\n\nI think the only part I didn't understand was \"closing the trade\" or \"exiting early.\" If I offer up my 100 shares, and someone else pays the premium for the option, I can't do anything anymore, no?

You can close the call at any time by \"buying it back.\" Ideally, for a lower price than you sold it for. This is how I've profited on every CC I've ever done so far. I've never let one expire.\n\n> Doesn't the option buyer still expect my 100 shares to be available until expiry?\n\nIf they don't own the contract any more, because you bought it back, they have no say in the matter. Remember, if you are buying back for a lower price, *they* lost money on the deal. So they might be very happy to unload a losing contract for whatever they can get for it.\n\nThe above is an oversimplification -- you never interact with an individual on the other side of the trade. Who you sell to and who you \"buy back\" from could be two different people/institutions. But those details don't really matter. All that matters is that you can close the trade at any time before expiration, as long as you can do it for a price you find acceptable.

Well, apart from X=0, in which case you should always close before expiration.\n\nSo your current Open P/L is -75%. That's pretty rough, but we are talking about AAPL here, one of the bluest of the blue chips.

You can estimate that by looking up your current delta. Relative to the ATM strike at that expiration, your position has a current delta of around 43. You can estimate your probability of getting ITM by expiration as same as delta, 43%. Since ATM is 50%, that's not actually that bad.

Arguably if you want the best experience for your customers you wouldn't want people to be able to build 3rd party payment systems \u2013 that could potentially be confusing and unsafe. I think they should have to right to control the experience of 3rd party apps within their own app store, they can even charge a tax for using it, but there should be alternatives allowed.\n\nWhy can't we have 3rd party app stores on iOS for example? In such a scenario your logic would make sense \u2013 Apple provides great tools and services, but they come at a cost, and if you don't like them you can go elsewhere. The problem is neither developers or end users can go elsewhere. You can't even install a 3rd party browser without Apple forcing apps like Chrome to use their own rendering engine. Why? To prevent people building browsers that support web APIs that allow developers to create experiences similar to what an app could provide. They lock down your experience and force you to use their app store.\n\nI don't hate Apple, I'm typing this from a MacBook, but the people on Apple's side of this argument are just wrong.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You do not have to buy a Mac btw. virtual machines work fine", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "They work, working fine is a bit of an exaggeration though.\n\nVirtual machines are slow and not ideal developer environments, and in my experience some things just don't work such as USB3.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3625491261482239}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1608312875032425}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04731675609946251}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "They can have the game back on the App Store if they just update it to be compliant.
