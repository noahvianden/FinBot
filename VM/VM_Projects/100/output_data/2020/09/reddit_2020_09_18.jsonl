I didn't know enough about cars, so I did my usual DD in researching recent reliability reports, consulting carfax, and having my mechanic friend give it the full lookover. For non-car geeks like me, it's the safe way to go. I keep my risk level low and still come out doing pretty good.  \n\nBuying Apple and treating it like a get-rich-quick scheme which OP admits to doing is like buying a used car from a make/model that has a questionable quality history, but had high horsepower and low 0-60. A mechanic inspection later shows said car was likely used by the last owner for drag racing, wasn't taken care of. All this could've been avoided if the buyer had simply done his research.  \n\nBottom line--DYOR and don't gamble with your money.

It may take upwards of 3 years, but again--this ain't normal.  \n\nAnd the other thing you have to remember. It's possible to overpay. This low interest environment makes it almost inevitable. But buying at these valuations is just sheer stupidity. After this kind of run-up, my investing buds agreed there was going to be a sell-off by institutions to take profits.

Sell a 45 days to expiry call option at a strike of $200.\n\nPossible scenarios at the expiry of the option:\n\n**Scenario 1 - Apple is trading at a price below the strike price of the option (let's say $130 as an example)**\n\nYou get to keep the premium received on selling the call option (minus the brokerage charges) and nothing to lose.\n\n**Scenario 2 - Apple is trading at a price above the strike price of the option (let's say $210 as an example)**\n\nProfit made = $200 (strike price) - $118 (price at which you bought) + **premium received by selling the option** \\- brokerage charges\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only lost opportunity in this trade setup is that if Apple really shoots up a lot more than the call option strike price, you lose out on the extra profit that could have been made by selling it at that price.

In the above example, Apple reaching $200 in the next 45 days has very little probability.

After a few years of legal help and investing towards it, I do I have higher credit than my wife in my relationship but younger me, full of retardation and dreams caused her to miss a ton of good opportunities.\n\nOutside of that, if you decide to stay in or when you dive back in, good luck and godspeed.

{"title": "Costco (COST) will rain tendies and hit 360 at least by Friday", "selftext": "Alright everyone, a lot of us are looking forward to battery day coming up on Tuesday. But what do we do after? Well it\u2019s fucking Costco (COST) of all things. I know, I know I\u2019m a boomer but hear me out:\nCostco is a wholesale corporation like its competitors it makes money off of memberships while barely making a profit off of its low margin on goods. They may sell a 5lb jar of peanut butter for $10 dollars and produce that jar for $9. This is a very low profit markup and on its own there is no way that Costco could compete. However, here is the kicker: the membership. With the lowest tier of membership running only $60 a year or $5 monthly (120 for \u201cexecutive\u201d) Costco can afford to sell this low profit markup.\n\nCostco reported that their gross margin (net sales less merchandise cost) was 11% while their operating costs as a percentage of net sales was 10%\u00a0 -[Annual report](https://investor.costco.com/static-files/05c62fe6-6c09-4e16-8d8b-5e456e5a0f7e)\nThe business model looks something like this:\nBuy no-name branded products at wholesale discount -> slap the Kirkland logo on it -> sell for small profit 11% -> utilize 10% profit to pay for operating costs = profit (albeit only 1% of their sales) \u2013source(annual report)--\nSmall profit markup means cheaper prices for consumer -> consumer wants to return -> customer pays almost nothing ($60) for the right to shop there -> customer goes to Costco maaaaybe 10-20 times a year, because everything is cheap and sold in bulk middle class/upper middle class stock up on everything = large customer base.\u00a0\nIn addition the Kirkland brand has become a household name helping them increase their membership numbers (detailed below)\n\n\nSo how can I prove that Costco is undervalued?\nCostco is currently trading at $336 is with a peak this year before the recent downturn (see: last two weeks) of $363.\nLast year at the beginning of September Costco was trading at roughly $300.\nWe are currently trading about 11.5% over last year.\n\n***\nCostco reported an increase in sales in all terms:\n\u201cNet sales of $13.56 billion for the retail month of August, the four weeks ended August 30, 2020, an increase of 15.0 percent from $11.79 billion last year.\nFor the 16-week fourth quarter ended August 30, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $52.3 billion, an increase of 12.7 percent compared to net sales of $46.4 billion during the similar period last year.\nFor the 52-week fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $163.2 billion, an increase of 9.2 percent from the $149.4 billion during the similar period last year.\u201d\n-(august report)-\u00a0[August report](https://investor.costco.com/news-releases/news-release-details/costco-wholesale-corporation-reports-august-sales-results-7)\n\n***\nCostco has had around 4 million new memberships a year. 2016: 86.7 million -> 2017: 90.3 million -> 2018: 94.3 million -> 2019: 98.5 million -> 2020: Unknown but around 102 million\nHowever around half of those aren\u2019t payed memberships like you would think. 53.9 million are directly paid memberships with 20.8 million of that the Executive and the rest just regular.\nThe other 49 million are under business memberships (the same price, but it allows these people to place even more people under the membership for an extra $60 a year per person) this is a good thing because what might be reported as one membership business membership could in reality be 3 or 4. \n[The website](https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html-)\n\nCostco membership renewal is around 91%. \u2013annual report\n\n\n\nThis means that Costco has actually been doing better this year than last with the pandemic by more than 11%\n\nIn fact, on their lowest impacting thing (their sales) Costco is doing almost 10% better than last year. $13 billion actually.\nTheir memberships make up the difference\n\n2019: 98,500,000 x $71 (19% are the 120 a year plan) = $6.9 Billion\n2020: 102,000,000 x $72 (20% are the 120 a year plan) = $7.14 Billion\n$2.4b dollar difference in memberships + $13 billion dollar difference in sales = $15.4 billion new profit vs last August.\n\nSo with the sales and the member ships combined we are up around 13-14% of profit.\nThe estimated EPS is 2.81 vs 2.69 last year. Or roughly a 4% gain. (This isn\u2019t a measure of growth but a measure of growth compared to profit)\nCostco (on average builds/acquires 5-20 new warehouses a year) at the end of august 2019 they had 785.\nBasically not only should the stock be at least 14% over 300 but we also have the increase of growth 2-5%.\nWith a total stock increase of anywhere between 14-19% of last year. Basically 636!!\n\nTLDR: BUY COSTCO CUZ THEY KILLIN IT AND THE PANDEMIC DIDN\u2019T STOP THEM FROM MAKIN MONEY OFF YOUR MEMBERSHIP THAT YOU DIDN\u2019T CANCELL BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU ITS $5 A MONTH TO GET CHEAP ASS BULK GOODS.\n\nPos: COST 30 x 350c 9/25 sell around $7, COST 25 x 355C 9/25 selling around 5, 17 COST SHARES selling at 350 and plan to get more once I sell these 7 x TSLA 550c 9/25", "id": "ivhk7r", "created_utc": 1600473209.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "My calls, which are absolutely fucked right now are hoping you're right", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah... um when did you buy your calls?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Literally the day before the market went to shit", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Oh fuck you fucked-fucked.

Sell a 45 days to expiry call option at a strike of $200.\n\nPossible scenarios at the expiry of the option:\n\n**Scenario 1 - Apple is trading at a price below the strike price of the option (let's say $130 as an example)**\n\nYou get to keep the premium received on selling the call option (minus the brokerage charges) and nothing to lose.\n\n**Scenario 2 - Apple is trading at a price above the strike price of the option (let's say $210 as an example)**\n\nProfit made = $200 (strike price) - $118 (price at which you bought) + **premium received by selling the option** \\- brokerage charges\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only lost opportunity in this trade setup is that if Apple really shoots up a lot more than the call option strike price, you lose out on the extra profit that could have been made by selling it at that price. To increase your odds of such a thing not happening, you could select a strike price that you think Apple stock most probably cannot reach till the expiry. In the above example, Apple reaching $200 in the next 45 days has very little probability.

The idea of \u201cunlimited\u201d profit from a call is alluring, but if you want to actually make money then you should research a stock and have a price target in mind. Make the call spread by buying a call below your target and then sell a call at your target. Use the computer version of ToS (even to inform your Robinhood trades) figure out which interval of money between the long (buy) and short (sold) call has the most favorable risk to reward for your projection. For instance, you think TSLA will be 450, if you can buy the 440C and sell the 450C for $5, then you would make a maximum profit of 100% if the stock is at or above $450 at expiry (distance between the strikes - the cost of the contract). The cost of the spread can not be more than the distance of the strikes, so this allows for not having to risk so much to buy options on a high dollar stock. Because the cost of the spread is so much less than the call alone, you can get the same amount of leverage for less $ if you can get the price movement right. If you\u2019re wrong, then you\u2019ve lost less than on a naked call. If you can\u2019t feel excited about a potential 100% profit (with some stocks you could get even more, but TSLA...), you should sell your positions and recalibrate before managing your money. \n\nI would recommend taking on less positions and trying to drill down into a few situations that you think you actually understand and trade those. Use stop losses and limit orders to limit loss and lock in profits once you get to your target. It\u2019s better to drill down into a few positions and understand the stocks and price movement extremely well rather than just following trends on social media. You want to be ahead of the majority of people when you buy, otherwise you set yourself up for failure. One way to make money at this is to identify situations where something has been hyped, but the hype subsided and the stock pulled back too much and will pop again within a few months. Look at whether the stock is oversold (in terms of RSI) and see if the implied volatility is higher than normal, then only buy the contracts when you see that these metrics make the trade favorable. If you\u2019re not saying no to some trades that you\u2019re researching deeply, you\u2019re probably fomoing and need to focus on good entry points. \n\nHope this helps some. If you don\u2019t feel like you have the energy to spend the time researching and understanding each stock and figuring out a reasonable price target in each trade you will always lose money in the mid-long term, and will likely go to zero in your account. Risk management is everything if you want to keep playing this game. \n\nCheers!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Get out of amc lmao", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24739579856395721}, {"body": "He'll give it back", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11884546279907227}, {"body": "Damn that's lots of calls lol", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "you dont wanna look at my td ameritrade either", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Plan B if market tank 3% between on Monday and Tuesday???", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Kill myself rofl", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Lol", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28391700983047485}, {"body": "Calls on $ROPE", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1390199363231659}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30454209446907043}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30448779463768005}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06476457417011261}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12850545346736908}, {"body": "More than I\u2019ve made the past few trading sessions", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.395378053188324}, {"body": "At least yours green on PTON", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19034616649150848}, {"body": "I feel this title so bad.
