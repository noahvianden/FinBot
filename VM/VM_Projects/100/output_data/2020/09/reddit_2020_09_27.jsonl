{"title": "Take advantage of the EV goldrush by completing the EV Trifecta", "selftext": "As you may already know, we are currently in the midst of an EV goldrush. Early adopters, investors, and gamblers will be rewarded for identifying these opportunities and capitalizing on them. \n\nOne way to ensure that you gain enough exposure to capitalize on this this gold rush is by completing the EV Trifecta, which are:\n\n1. EV Manufacturers \n2. Raw materials for batteries\n3. EV charging stations\n\nI will go into a bit more detail on each component of the trifecta:\n\n \n\n1. EV Manufacturers - These are companies that develop and manufacturer EV for the public to newly purchase. There is a lot of EV manufacturers that are going public, some of them will be achieve market dominance, while others will dwindle away \\*cough\\* NKL(A). These are some of the EV manufacturers that are available for the public to invest in: TSLA, NI(O), XPE(V), KND(I), L(I), SHL(L), PI(C), HCA(C), SPA(Q). Currently, TSLA is the market leader in this industry and also have the first mover advantage, and this is clearly reflected in their stock price. All the other EV manufacturers are up and coming and will have lots of run room as EVs become more prevalent in our day to day lives.\n\n\n2. Raw materials for batteries - The logic here is that as demand for EV increase, so will the demand for the raw materials used to create the batteries for the EVs. Simple economics 101 states that as demand increase and supply decreases, price should increase accordingly. These are the current raw materials companies that have a spotlight on them: LA(C), VAL(E), PL(L). PL(L) is the only raw materials company that have a public contract with TSL(A) and has been halted for weeks because of this news. PL(L) will definitely be a hot buy once it unhalts. \n\n\n3. EV charging stations - In order for EVs to be come more prominent in our day to day lives, there needs to be a proper infrastructure that will enable that. One of the biggest concerns in regards to EV is range anxiety - drivers don't want to be left stranded if they forget to charge their vehicles overnight at home. Having charging stations that are widely available will help combat this risk. The EV charging station market is relatively untapped, and this market will grow along side the EV market. The key players in the EV Charging station are SB(E), BLN(K), SP(I). SP(I) had an insane run up last week when they announced their EV initiative, their share price increased over 3000% from $1.50 to over $40 (this was short lived though). BLN(K) is a mixed bag, there are some complaints in regards to the quality of their charging stations, but hopefully they'll improve over time. SB(E) is a SP@(C) merger to bring Chargepoint public. Similar to TSL(A), Chargepoint is the market leader in the charging station space and also have the first mover advantage. Chargepoint currently has hundred of thousands of charging stations across North America (US and Canada) and is expanding into Europe. Their products can be purchased via their home website or Amazon and have great reviews online. \n\nBy completing the EV Trifecta you'll ensure you have proper exposure to the EV goldrush. I'm sure I missed a few companies, so please feel free to mention them and add any additional details that I might have missed.\n\nEdit: holy crap, you would not believe how many times I had to edit/post this in order for this work.
