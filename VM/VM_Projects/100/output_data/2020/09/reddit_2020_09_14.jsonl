Manufacturing cost effectively at scale was always the major barrier between Tesla being \"squishable\" by the competition, and them become a force. They can unquestionably do that now, and the upside for FSD and utility services is looking more and more likely to materialize.\n\nBottom line - this year's share price action is because TSLA was undervalued last year (due to failure risk) and has swung to pricing in expectations of success through 2024-2025.

Get return the same as (or very close to) 100 shares for a much lesser cost. However, with TSLA, options are also pretty high priced, so I would have to see if the risk/reward is worth it for me to hold LEAPS instead of 100 shares.\n\nFor example, a TSLA Jan 2023 450 call is going for about $210 as of Friday\u2019s close. That\u2019s $21k, which is almost half the cost of 100 shares. So in this case I may think if it\u2019s worth it for me to get these LEAPS, or buy 100 shares, or even buy  50 shares for about the same cost and get half the return but have the peace of mind knowing my options aren\u2019t going to die due to some short term fluctuation/bad news in the stock or the overall market. In some other stocks, you may be able to get LEAPS for considerably less than the price of 100 shares, and in those cases the leverage could be much more appealing.\n\nAlso, I used $450 strike in my example above, which is right at the money and would be a safer bet than a strike way out of the money. If TSLA continues to move beyond 450 over the next year, my call is now becoming deeper in the money, and returns are increasing accordingly, intrinsic value is increasing and extrinsic is going down, all of these are ideal factors for a long call holder. But this of course costs more. If I was to look at way otm options, and let\u2019s say I got the furthest available strike for the furthest available expiration, that becomes a much higher risk / higher reward play. Because now if the stock happens to rocket much further over the next year, I will get exponential returns on lesser capital. But if it stays sideways or goes down, I will lose that entire capital.\n\nAt the end of the day, it should always be remembered that options, even LEAPS, are frail, decaying assets, and the safest game in any stock is to accumulate shares longer term. One bad downturn in the stock or overall market, and even deeper itm LEAPS can get wiped out. Let\u2019s say some bad news/economic issues keep the markets down/sideways for next several months or a year or two, which is entirely possible at any given point in time, well there go all those LEAPS.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to have a profit target and hit the sell button. When things are going up and your LEAPS continue to go deeper and deeper itm, you will see exponential returns, and you will be tempted to continue letting it run. But then, as I explained above, a few bad days in the market and boom, there go all those profits, and now you\u2019re thinking \u201conly if I would\u2019ve sold when I was $50k up.\u201d Sure, things can keep running in your direction also, but it\u2019s not guaranteed, and profits can be lost very easily in those situations. It happened with many people who held TSLA options through the split and then the stock dipped. So my point is, just because one is holding LEAPS, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re required to be held until expiration. If a couple of months down the line things look really good and you feel the stock\u2019s has a good run, take profits & reassess.

If they get the price down to $70/kWh  they can get a 120 kWh battery pack for 24% less cost than current Model  S/X packs. More importantly, the pilot line allows the cost to be  slightly higher initially and not turn a loss because of the high ASP of  let's say the Model S plaid. Also 12.8 GWh/year divided by 120 kWh/pack  leaves us 106k units per year, which when compensated for a slightly  slower rate in the beginning, should perfectly cover the unit sales of  S/X that have a max production rate of 90k/year. Also S/X are made in Fremont, which compliments the location.\n\nAt  the same weight or slightly lower weight of the 100 kWh pack, this  basically gives a range boost of 20% while lowering the manufacturing  cost.
