The dominant issues were cultural (especially regarding prohibition, education, and ethnic or racial groups) and economic (tariffs and money supply). With the rapid growth of cities, political machines increasingly took control of urban politics. In business, powerful nationwide trusts formed in some industries. Unions crusaded for the eight-hour working day, and the abolition of child labor; middle class reformers demanded civil service reform, prohibition of liquor and beer, and women's suffrage.\n\nI think Elon Musk's proper comparison is Henry Ford.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_River_Rouge_Complex\n\n&gt;The Ford River Rouge Complex (commonly known as the Rouge Complex or just The Rouge) is a Ford Motor Company automobile factory complex located in Dearborn, Michigan, along the River Rouge, upstream from its confluence with the Detroit River at Zug Island.

{"title": "To what extent is Tesla really \"overvalued\"?", "selftext": "### Disclaimer\n\nI do not have a financial position in any of the companies mentioned here, and have no intention to initiate one within the next 72 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Introduction\n\nA common belief is that Tesla is grossly comically overvalued. Most people who express that belief point to Tesla's insanely high price to earnings ratio (P/E) to make the argument.\n\nTesla's current P/E is (1038). A P/E of 1000+ is patently absurd. To compare with high growth technology companies (FAANG):\n\n* Facebook: 32.31\n* Apple: 36.42\n* Amazon: 131.34\n* Netflix: 122.87\n* Google: 27.75\n* Average: 70.138\n\n[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\nDespite not enjoying the massive margins of the tech companies, Tesla has a P/E ratio 14.7 times greater than their average. This is simply ludicrous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Caveats\n\nWhile Tesla's P/E ratio is Prima Facie outrageous, I am of the opinion that it doesn't paint the full picture:\n\n* Tesla's margins per car are around 20%.\n* Tesla's profit margins were 1 - 2%.\n   * This is a very low profit margin that leads to a relatively tiny denominator. Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit, and the margin is expected to grow significantly in future.\n* Tesla's revenue growth over the last 5 years is > 50%.\n   * Tesla's growth is one of the causes of their low profit margins as they're investing a lot in new factories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe below excerpt sums up my take pretty well:\n\n>Alphabet in 2007 was clearly cheaper than Tesla is today. Alphabet\u2019s price/sales ratio was only moderately below Tesla\u2019s level, but its price/book ratio was much lower. In addition, Alphabet had meaningful profits, which traded at a relatively modest P/E ratio of 50 \u2013 a steep multiple for most companies but not for one growing as rapidly as Alphabet. In contrast, **Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit.**  \n>  \n>**(Morningstar calculates Tesla\u2019s trailing P/E ratio as 1,111. I report that amount as \u201cnot applicable\u201d because price/earnings multiples that are derived from tiny denominators are misleading. The company\u2019s forward P/E ratio, generated by using its expected profits over the next four quarters, is a more realistic 125.)**\n\n[Source](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/205727/is-teslas-share-price-bonkers.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's forward P/E ratio of 125 seems more appropriate as a metric of how overvalued (if at all) it is. In that case Tesla's P/E would only be 1.8x the FAANG average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Growth\n\nSomething I do find interesting though is the revenue growth rates (over the last five years) of the companies involved:\n\n* Facebook: 41.49%\n* Apple: 7.31%\n* Amazon: 25.81%\n* Netflix: 29.64%\n* Google: 19.65%\n* Average: 24.78%\n* TSLA: 50.36%\n\n[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTSLA's CAGR (5y) is two times the CAGR average of FAANG stocks. If the higher P/E ratios of FAANG companies represents their growth rate, then Tesla's 2x higher growth rate seems to fit perfectly with their 1.8x higher forward P/E.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Is a Comparison With FAANG Accurate?\n\nShould Tesla be valued comparatively to FAANG companies? That's up for debate. Some people insist that Tesla is just a car company. I don't think that's really true short term, and I doubt it'll be appropriate (from a financial standpoint at least) long term.

[Furthermore, it appears that Tesla plans to roll out subscription services for at least its Full Self Driving feature](https://electrek.co/2020/09/20/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-deadline-enhanced-autopilot/).\n\nIt goes without saying that all the above software upgrades are extremely high margin. They would represent nearly pure profit.\n\nThe above features suggests Tesla already has a fledgling SaaS business model, and that model is likely to grow to become a much larger share of their bottom line going forward.\n\nOf the FAANG companies, I think Tesla is most comparable to Apple (both manufacture and sell hardware for most of their revenue. They sell software services on top of said hardware for better profit margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Using Tesla's forward P/E, Tesla's P/E is 3.6 times higher than Apple.\n* Using their CAGR (5y), Tesla's growth rate is 6.9 times higher than Apple.\n\nIf high P/Es are accounting for impressive growth, then Tesla appears to not be overvalued compared to say Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI don't think Tesla is really all that over valued. Not if you think a comparison between Tesla and FAANG companies (especially Apple) is appropriate.\n\nIf you compare Tesla to the FAANG average or to Apple in particular, Tesla does not appear overvalued relative to them. While Tesla's Forward P/E is greater, Tesla's growth rate is *at least* comparatively greater.\n\n* Tesla's forward P/E is 1.8x FAANG average, but Tesla's growth rate is 2x FAANG average.\n* Tesla's forward P/E is 3.6x Apple's, but Tesla's growth rate is 6.9x Apple.", "id": "j1z2f8", "created_utc": 1601385645.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "For any good growth stock you don't look at P/E or profits.

{"title": "Disney is going to the god damn moon", "selftext": "It's like... Imagine Netflix, but you have the best IP in the world and have been making the best content, profitably, for decades\n\nAnd you can use the data about what people are streaming to cross-sell them on baby yoda dolls, theme park visits, cruises, etc etc\n\nIt's a company with some of, if not THE most valuable cinematic IP in the world, turning on a brand new revenue stream which simultaneously makes every other one of their revenue channels more valuable (due to targeted cross-selling based on streaming viewership) AND better informs them of the type of content to produce in the future\n\nApparently they told people they could stream Mulan for 29.99 and it increased subscribers by 68% over Labor Day weekend.\n\nIf Netflix told me I could stream a movie for 5 bucks I'd tell them to pound sand. And Netflix is losing some of Disney's IP soon\n\nSo let's look at market caps\n\nDisney = 227B - https://ycharts.com/companies/DIS/market_cap\n\nNetflix = 216B - https://ycharts.com/companies/NFLX/market_cap\n\nSure Disney's parks, cruises, etc, took a big hit from covid. but let's look at Disney+ again with 60 million subscribers, compared to Netflix's 180 million.\n\nNow I think the average Disney+ subscriber (long term, they're practically giving it away ATM to drive growth) is more valuable than a Netflix subscriber, because of the cross-selling potential. But let's say they have the same value as a Netflix customer.\n\nThat would mean that, if Disney+ is valued the same way Netflix is (recurring revenue multiple, and even stickier due to kids programming IMO) it would account for almost 30% of Disney's market cap. Given that Disney is down about 15% still from pre-covid highs, that means that the rest of their legacy media business is only (roughly) 55% as valuable as before covid.\n\nSo you tell me, on a discounted cash flow basis, are all of Disney's combined legacy businesses worth about half of what they used to be? Or are people overlooking the insane firehose of money Disney+ is going to be, as well as the gross margins associated with it\n\nConsidering Disney normally profits from making this content already, the streaming revenue is just extra profit compared Netflix has to use debt to fund its content creation. And we know the types of gross margins are associated with streaming, and the multiples that wallstreet assigns to recurring revenue streams\n\nPositions: stocks because I'm not a degenerate\n\nEdit for the especially autistic amongst us talking about the layoffs - \n\nLayoffs in their theme parks? After peak season is over, during covid, moving into the cold and flu season? I think everyone with more than 10 brain cells saw this coming\n\nI expect short term volatility, hence why I'm holding stock not buying options you mouth breathers. This stock is still a great long term investment. This doesn't change my 2-year outlook even a little, I'll only buy more if it dips\n\nAlso, currently (this may change as the evening drags on) Disney is just right back to where it was last Friday when I bought.

I suppose my only remaining concern would be PM intentionally trying to put them under. \n\nThe general populous doesn't realize Philip Morgan even belongs to Altria; And that's what allowed them to basically ride in the boat with JUUL (Altria had 35% stake at the time) then drop them like hot garbage when shit went south. (They were sued by the FTC for this in April, also that was a 12.8b investment on their part).\n\nSo I definitely would be wary of them basically pumping and dumping iQOS too. It's only speculation as I can't prove anything but I felt like the devaluation of JUUL was intentionally-influenced to restore value into their traditional tobacco products as they probably want that to remain more valuable to them.\n\nIf calls are cheap enough I may get a couple still and eat the negligible loss; Since even if things do go the same way there is, as you mentioned a high potential of an insane short squeeze.
