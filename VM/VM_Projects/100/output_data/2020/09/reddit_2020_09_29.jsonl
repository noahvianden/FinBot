The dominant issues were cultural (especially regarding prohibition, education, and ethnic or racial groups) and economic (tariffs and money supply). With the rapid growth of cities, political machines increasingly took control of urban politics. In business, powerful nationwide trusts formed in some industries. Unions crusaded for the eight-hour working day, and the abolition of child labor; middle class reformers demanded civil service reform, prohibition of liquor and beer, and women's suffrage.\n\nI think Elon Musk's proper comparison is Henry Ford.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_River_Rouge_Complex\n\n&gt;The Ford River Rouge Complex (commonly known as the Rouge Complex or just The Rouge) is a Ford Motor Company automobile factory complex located in Dearborn, Michigan, along the River Rouge, upstream from its confluence with the Detroit River at Zug Island.

{"title": "To what extent is Tesla really \"overvalued\"?", "selftext": "### Disclaimer\n\nI do not have a financial position in any of the companies mentioned here, and have no intention to initiate one within the next 72 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Introduction\n\nA common belief is that Tesla is grossly comically overvalued. Most people who express that belief point to Tesla's insanely high price to earnings ratio (P/E) to make the argument.\n\nTesla's current P/E is (1038). A P/E of 1000+ is patently absurd. To compare with high growth technology companies (FAANG):\n\n* Facebook: 32.31\n* Apple: 36.42\n* Amazon: 131.34\n* Netflix: 122.87\n* Google: 27.75\n* Average: 70.138\n\n[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\nDespite not enjoying the massive margins of the tech companies, Tesla has a P/E ratio 14.7 times greater than their average. This is simply ludicrous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Caveats\n\nWhile Tesla's P/E ratio is Prima Facie outrageous, I am of the opinion that it doesn't paint the full picture:\n\n* Tesla's margins per car are around 20%.\n* Tesla's profit margins were 1 - 2%.\n   * This is a very low profit margin that leads to a relatively tiny denominator. Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit, and the margin is expected to grow significantly in future.\n* Tesla's revenue growth over the last 5 years is > 50%.\n   * Tesla's growth is one of the causes of their low profit margins as they're investing a lot in new factories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe below excerpt sums up my take pretty well:\n\n>Alphabet in 2007 was clearly cheaper than Tesla is today. Alphabet\u2019s price/sales ratio was only moderately below Tesla\u2019s level, but its price/book ratio was much lower. In addition, Alphabet had meaningful profits, which traded at a relatively modest P/E ratio of 50 \u2013 a steep multiple for most companies but not for one growing as rapidly as Alphabet. In contrast, **Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit.**  \n>  \n>**(Morningstar calculates Tesla\u2019s trailing P/E ratio as 1,111. I report that amount as \u201cnot applicable\u201d because price/earnings multiples that are derived from tiny denominators are misleading. The company\u2019s forward P/E ratio, generated by using its expected profits over the next four quarters, is a more realistic 125.)**\n\n[Source](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/205727/is-teslas-share-price-bonkers.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's forward P/E ratio of 125 seems more appropriate as a metric of how overvalued (if at all) it is. In that case Tesla's P/E would only be 1.8x the FAANG average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Growth\n\nSomething I do find interesting though is the revenue growth rates (over the last five years) of the companies involved:\n\n* Facebook: 41.49%\n* Apple: 7.31%\n* Amazon: 25.81%\n* Netflix: 29.64%\n* Google: 19.65%\n* Average: 24.78%\n* TSLA: 50.36%\n\n[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTSLA's CAGR (5y) is two times the CAGR average of FAANG stocks. If the higher P/E ratios of FAANG companies represents their growth rate, then Tesla's 2x higher growth rate seems to fit perfectly with their 1.8x higher forward P/E.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Is a Comparison With FAANG Accurate?\n\nShould Tesla be valued comparatively to FAANG companies? That's up for debate. Some people insist that Tesla is just a car company. I don't think that's really true short term, and I doubt it'll be appropriate (from a financial standpoint at least) long term.

[Furthermore, it appears that Tesla plans to roll out subscription services for at least its Full Self Driving feature](https://electrek.co/2020/09/20/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-deadline-enhanced-autopilot/).\n\nIt goes without saying that all the above software upgrades are extremely high margin. They would represent nearly pure profit.\n\nThe above features suggests Tesla already has a fledgling SaaS business model, and that model is likely to grow to become a much larger share of their bottom line going forward.\n\nOf the FAANG companies, I think Tesla is most comparable to Apple (both manufacture and sell hardware for most of their revenue. They sell software services on top of said hardware for better profit margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Using Tesla's forward P/E, Tesla's P/E is 3.6 times higher than Apple.\n* Using their CAGR (5y), Tesla's growth rate is 6.9 times higher than Apple.\n\nIf high P/Es are accounting for impressive growth, then Tesla appears to not be overvalued compared to say Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI don't think Tesla is really all that over valued. Not if you think a comparison between Tesla and FAANG companies (especially Apple) is appropriate.\n\nIf you compare Tesla to the FAANG average or to Apple in particular, Tesla does not appear overvalued relative to them. While Tesla's Forward P/E is greater, Tesla's growth rate is *at least* comparatively greater.\n\n* Tesla's forward P/E is 1.8x FAANG average, but Tesla's growth rate is 2x FAANG average.\n* Tesla's forward P/E is 3.6x Apple's, but Tesla's growth rate is 6.9x Apple.", "id": "j1z2f8", "created_utc": 1601385645.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "For any good growth stock you don't look at P/E or profits.

{"title": "Disney is going to the god damn moon", "selftext": "It's like... Imagine Netflix, but you have the best IP in the world and have been making the best content, profitably, for decades\n\nAnd you can use the data about what people are streaming to cross-sell them on baby yoda dolls, theme park visits, cruises, etc etc\n\nIt's a company with some of, if not THE most valuable cinematic IP in the world, turning on a brand new revenue stream which simultaneously makes every other one of their revenue channels more valuable (due to targeted cross-selling based on streaming viewership) AND better informs them of the type of content to produce in the future\n\nApparently they told people they could stream Mulan for 29.99 and it increased subscribers by 68% over Labor Day weekend.\n\nIf Netflix told me I could stream a movie for 5 bucks I'd tell them to pound sand. And Netflix is losing some of Disney's IP soon\n\nSo let's look at market caps\n\nDisney = 227B - https://ycharts.com/companies/DIS/market_cap\n\nNetflix = 216B - https://ycharts.com/companies/NFLX/market_cap\n\nSure Disney's parks, cruises, etc, took a big hit from covid. but let's look at Disney+ again with 60 million subscribers, compared to Netflix's 180 million.\n\nNow I think the average Disney+ subscriber (long term, they're practically giving it away ATM to drive growth) is more valuable than a Netflix subscriber, because of the cross-selling potential. But let's say they have the same value as a Netflix customer.\n\nThat would mean that, if Disney+ is valued the same way Netflix is (recurring revenue multiple, and even stickier due to kids programming IMO) it would account for almost 30% of Disney's market cap. Given that Disney is down about 15% still from pre-covid highs, that means that the rest of their legacy media business is only (roughly) 55% as valuable as before covid.\n\nSo you tell me, on a discounted cash flow basis, are all of Disney's combined legacy businesses worth about half of what they used to be? Or are people overlooking the insane firehose of money Disney+ is going to be, as well as the gross margins associated with it\n\nConsidering Disney normally profits from making this content already, the streaming revenue is just extra profit compared Netflix has to use debt to fund its content creation. And we know the types of gross margins are associated with streaming, and the multiples that wallstreet assigns to recurring revenue streams\n\nPositions: stocks because I'm not a degenerate\n\nEdit for the especially autistic amongst us talking about the layoffs - \n\nLayoffs in their theme parks? After peak season is over, during covid, moving into the cold and flu season? I think everyone with more than 10 brain cells saw this coming\n\nI expect short term volatility, hence why I'm holding stock not buying options you mouth breathers. This stock is still a great long term investment. This doesn't change my 2-year outlook even a little, I'll only buy more if it dips\n\nAlso, currently (this may change as the evening drags on) Disney is just right back to where it was last Friday when I bought.

You're talking about a minimal amount of paperwork for the bank and your accountant, if not just having a loan structure that automatically pays itself through refinancing.  In that case the bank is just paying themselves with their own money, then tacking on the payment amount to your principle.\n\nFor a normal person this would be like owing $2,000 on a car that's worth $10,000.  If you couldn't make your payment the bank will happily refinance the loan for $3,000, or whatever, instead of $2,000, leaving you with $1,000 to make future payments with.  When that runs out you can refinance again from $3,000 minus your payments, plus interest, to something like $4,000.  This can continue to go on until the value of your loan reaches the cars value.\n\nNow imagine instead of a car the collateral is stock, and the amounts you're borrowing will never reach the amount of collateral you can put up, because your living expenses are a tiny fraction of your available collateral (wealth). \n\nSo instead of living off income like a pleb (and having to pay tax), you simply live off of rolling debt.  On a secured loan like this you're only paying a couple of percent in interest.  This is absolutely nothing compared to income tax or capital gains tax rates, especially in the amounts required to finance a millionaire/billionaire's lifestyle.\n\nYou're also not having to sell that stock, so you're benefiting from any gains it makes, which is going to be more than the interest you're paying (probably).  So in that way it's almost like you're borrowing money at negative interest rates if your options are selling or taking a loan out against it.  You also maintain the voting rights of the collateralized stock.  There isn't any downside if you never planned on selling those shares.\n\nIf you're making the payments with taxed money you're defeating the entire purpose of avoiding the taxes to begin with.

{"title": "Investing in ETFs", "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than that.  Several people suggested that it be \"pinned.\"  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**EEM** \\- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\n**EFA** \\- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.\n\n**S*****ector fund ETFs:***\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* **ARKG** \\- Genomic Revolution\n* **ARKF** \\- Fintech\n* **ARKK** \\- Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* **ARKW** \\- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)\n* **ARKQ** \\- Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* **PRNT** \\- 3D printing technology\n* **IZRL** \\- disruptive companies based in Israel\n\n**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n* **XLE** \\- Energy\n* **XLB** \\- Materials\n* **XLC** \\- Communications\n* **XLG** \\- S&P Top 50\n* **XLI** \\- Industrial\n* **XLP** \\- Consumer Staples\n* **XLRE** \\- Real Estate\n\n**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\n**Aerospace and Defense:** XAR, ITA, PPA\n\n**Real Estate:**  VNQ, FREL, SCHH, IYR, PSR, BBRE\n\n**Transportation:**  FTXR, XTN, IYT, RGI, JETS\n\n**Oil/Energy:** IYE, FENY, VDE\n\n**Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS\n\n**Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC\n\n**Robotics, AI, Innovative Technologies:**  THNQ, ROBO, XITK, SKYY, GDAT\n\n**Semiconductors:**  SOXX, QTEC, QTUM, SMH, FTXL\n\n**IT:** FTEC, VGT, IWY, IGM, FDN\n\n**Cyber Security:** HACK, CIBR, IHAK, BUG, FITE\n\n**Consumer Discretionary:**  FDIS, VCR, IEDI, JHMC, IYC\n\n**5G, Connectivity:** FIVG, NXTG, WUGI\n\n**Self Driving EV:** IDRV, DRIV, MOTO\n\n**Gaming/Esports:**  NERD, HERO, ESPO, GAMR, SOCL\n\n**Casinos/Gambling:**  BETZ, BJK\n\n**Online Retail:**  IBUY, EBIZ, ONLN, CLIX, GBUY, BUYZ\n\n**Utilities:** IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU\n\n**Health Care:** FHLC, VHT, IYH\n\n**Medical Devices and Equipment:**  IHI, IEHS, XHE\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other Unique ETFs, non-sector based:**\n\n**CHGX:**  US Large Cap Fossil Fuel Free ETF\n\n**VIRS:**  Biothreat Strategy ETF\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n**20% -** Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n**20%** \\- VXUS - International\n\n**20%** \\- IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n**10%** each in four sector funds of your choice\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

But lets not forget fixed income ETFs - I know they are extremely unpopular in these parts, but they are the cornerstone of many portfolios, and this year has shown why it pays to have fixed income exposure.\n\n**ZROZ** is a long term zero coupon bond ETF - definitely has the greatest amount of interest rate risk of all of these.\n\n**TLT/VGLT** are two long term treasury ETF's. The Vanguard fund has the lower expense ratio, but the iShares fund has a very deep and active options market. \n\n**IEF/VCIT** are two intermediate treasury ETF's with the same characteristics as above.\n\n**SHV** is only short term treasuries, and so while it provides the lowest yield of them, it also has next to no interest rate risk.\n\nOnce you step outside of Treasury ETFs, you begin to have to worry about default risk of various bond fund holdings - therefore you start to see correlation with the stock market. But for people who want a slight bit more in terms of distributions in exchange for more risk, there are:\n\n**IGLB/VCLT** \\-  ishares/vanguard long term corporate bond etf\n\n**IGIB/VCIT** \\- Intermediate corporate bond ETF\n\nGenerally for all of these, if your intent is to buy and hold and (possibly) reinvest distributions, your best bet is probably the Vanguard offering, whereas if you want to take on additional risk and sell calls, etc, you might be better off using iShares products.\n\nWith that said, if you don't want to worry as much about specific durations, you can just buy the entire bond market:\n\n**BND** \\- Vanguard Bond Market Fund\n\n**BNDX** \\- Vanguard Total Internation Bonds\n\n**BNDW** \\- Vanguard Total World Bond Market\n\nI think those are the cornerstones. From there, people can investigate other bond funds that have their own sets of risks/rewards including muni bonds, target date ETFs, high yield,  mortgage backed bonds, senior loans, and so forth.\n\nIt also might be heresy to suggest, but active management is something else to consider.

And that's the reason I think that other redditors who also aren't near retirement age could benefit by adding them to their portfolios.\n\nI did mention muni's existance, but those have a lot more complexity than Treasuries. For one, if you live in a state with a state income tax, you get less benefit from owning a broad ETF like MUB, as you'll still pay state tax on the earnings of other states bonds in your fund. Still often exempt from Federal income tax though, although could trigger AMT, which is probably not a concern to nearly all of us. And until recently, they were fairly stable - I do think that the strain that COVID is having on many states finances could be a source uncertainty in the muni space, though.\n\nSo, MUB is a thing. High yield is a thing (HYG, JNK), but again, people need to understand that those correlate with equities - in dislocations those will tank with the market, albeit maybe not as much. \n\nThere are also preferred shares, which usually pay a fixed income stream greater than bonds, though are much more risky if a company is on shaky ground.\n\nSo for the sake of suggesting, I was just mentioning the most straight forward ways to gain exposure.

This in particular:\n\n> 20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\nThose aren't broad-market funds! These are all _large-cap_ funds.\n\nA [broad-market-fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broad-basedindex.asp) would be something like a Russell 3000 or the CRSP U.S. Total Market fund. Great, low-cost broad-market funds include:\n\n* VTI (CRSP US Total Market Index; 3,500 stocks)\n* ITOT (S&P Total Market index; 3,500 stocks)\n* IWV or VTHR (Vanguard Russell 3000; 3,000 stocks)\n* SCHB (Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index; 2,500 stocks)\n\nInstead of doing a large-cap fund replenished with an arbitrary amount of small/mid-cap, consider a total market fund backed with small-cap and small-cap value, which are factors that are known to provide returns. For example:\n\n* 60% VTI\n* 25% VXUS\n* 5% VB (small cap)\n* 5% VBR (small cap value)\n* 5% speculative stuff like ARK funds\n\nA 60/25 split between VTI and VXUS gives you more or less the world market cap proportion (e.g. see MSCI ACWI Index), and you could simplify this with just VT.\n\n**Regarding QQQ**: QQQ tracks just 100 stocks, and can't possibly be called diversified. VOO is definitely better, but, on the other hand, is made up of almost entirely large-cap stocks. QQQ is about 50% tech, the rest divided between telecoms and consumer cyclicals. For all intents and purposes it's a tech growth fund. I always tell people that with such a tech-heavy fund, you're better off just doing a pure tech fund like VGT, because then at least you know what you're overweighting. I would definitely not put as much as 20% in QQQ unless the core is beefed up with something like VTI.\n\n**Rant about growth funds**: IWF (Russell 3000 Growth) _is_ pretty well diversified, true, but the growth selectivity makes me wary of recommending it as a core holding in a portfolio. \"Growth\" is often misunderstood as being synonymous \"aggressive\", and certainly sounds aggressive, but growth stocks paradoxically often lag the market; remember, you're optimizing for revenue growth, which hasn't been shown to be an independent factor. Don't believe me? Look at [growth vs. total market 1993-2010](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2010&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=false&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=Growth&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VIGRX&allocation1_1=100). I'm picking 2010 to avoid recency bias around FAANG/FANMAG stocks. If you started with VUG in 1993, you'd have less money now than if you'd just stayed with the S&P. VUG did great in 1998-1999 thanks to the dot-com boom. If you change the end date to 2019, you're _basically even_! Keep mind that only about 22% of US stocks by market cap are pure \"growth\".\n\n(As an aside, want to know what portfolio could have made you rich? Small cap and small cap value!

{"title": "ONE OF US: From $330 million to $9 million - German Hedge Fund Allianz YOLOs the NYC subway pension fund", "selftext": "https://nypost.com/2020/09/28/allianz-accused-of-wiping-out-mta-pension-funds-amid-covid-crash/\n\n> Allianz increased risky investment positions in its Structured Alpha family of funds instead of exiting them \u2014 a \u201cnegligent and imprudent bet\u201d that \u201cproved to be disastrous\u201d as stocks continued to plunge, the complaint says.\n\n> As a result, its Structured Alpha 1000 fund \u2014 where MTA pensions had an account balance of more than $330 million at the end of last year \u2014 dropped nearly 87 percent for the year by mid-March, according to the suit.\n\n> After Allianz was forced to liquidate that fund in late March, the MTA pension funds were left with just about $9 million \u2014 an investment value loss of than 97 percent in a single quarter, the complaint alleges.\n\n[Allianz on their losses:](https://us.allianzgi.com/en-us/institutional/strategies-and-solutions/alternatives/liquid-alternative-investments/structured-alpha-march-2020-performance)\n\n> The recent market downturn\nRestructuring had historically been relatively limited as a percentage of total Portfolio positions. However, as equity markets declined and volatility increased into March 2020, per the strategy\u2019s design, the portfolio managers implemented multiple rounds of restructuring trades. For example, as markets declined the Portfolio Management team replaced near-to-the-money short S&P 500 puts and short NASDAQ puts with new short puts struck at prices further away from then-current market levels. While re-establishing alpha-generating positions at lower strike prices, this resulted in realized losses on the near-to-the-money short puts.\n\n> Similarly, the portfolio managers replaced short-term short VIX calls with new longer-term short VIX calls at more distant strike prices. An analogous process occurred for short VXX calls. In some instances, this restructuring was repeated on subsequent days on legacy positions and on positions that represented the new restructured legs. Despite these steps, the Portfolio ultimately could not be restructured quickly enough to keep pace with the market decline, resulting in additional losses.\n\n> The below graphic provides an example of the restructuring efforts in the Portfolio for a set of SPX short put options expiring on March 20, 2020 that were held by the Structured Alpha 1000 fund. During the eleven trading days between March 2 and March 16, there were at least four instances of restructuring of these short put positions to lower risk by both reducing the strike prices of the put options and by decreasing the number of positions held. Nevertheless, although the market was up on certain days in this period, the market ultimately continued to decline through these lower strike prices, causing losses to the Structured Alpha 1000 fund.", "id": "j1ylrv", "created_utc": 1601383932.0, "score": 1878, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 322, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 6 | **First Seen In WSB** | 7 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 49 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 10 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06798805296421051}, {"body": "Hi, I'd like my pension.\n\nNo problem, we just need your account num.... aaaaaaaaaand it's gone.", "score": 407, "replies": [{"body": "Hi, I'd like my pension.\n\nInstead of money, how would you like some expired SPY puts?", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5341595411300659}, {"body": "Hey, I've seen that one before *cries in $70 Nortel pension check*", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46335962414741516}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3146607577800751}, {"body": "WSB copy trader", "score": 633, "replies": [{"body": "I can be an investment banker!", "score": 211, "replies": [{"body": "> The lawsuit is reportedly one of several lawsuits pension funds have brought against Allianz over $4 billion lost by the Structured Alpha funds. \n\nYou\u2019ll have to do better than $100m in losses to get there champ.
