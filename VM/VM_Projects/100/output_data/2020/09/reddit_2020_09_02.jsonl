For instance, Covid-19; reality: There are pandemics *all the time everywhere on the planet* and a large number of them are deadlier. Why this one? To be totally honest, no one knows, Ebola should have blown up everything if we are concerned for deadliness and the SARS should have collapsed the world over but neither of these things happened and there's no particular reason why.\n\nOur historians still ponder about what causes these things and while we can definitely look back and chronicle it all there's no real rhyme or reason why Tesla is what it is today or Zoom flew off the handle (because, think about it, Zoom's revenue is *not surprising* seeing as everyone has been using remote services; it should have been absolutely priced in by just simply thinking about it) or why stocks that have nothing to do with Corona blew up too; some of the stocks that actually *gain* from Corona exploded down. Makes no sense.\n\nSo the truth is that no one knows. We don't know what causes A to follow B to follow C. None of it requires a genius mind to realize certain stocks should have more value during certain times or when certain services are in play and yet the valuation of things is rampant and drunk not because people are stupid but because people are too clever; they've decided they know what they do not know about how things so obscure and complex work that they are all suffering from Dunning-Kruger.

Most people get what it is wrong; you're living through it right now, a lot of people taking guesses on things they think they know (i.e. \"DD\") but have no idea that they don't actually know it. And it's convincing as hell.\n\nTo put my point bluntly:\n\n>It\u2019ll take an earth-rendering event to shake investor confidence in equities.\n\nThe icecaps are melting. That's earth-rendering.
