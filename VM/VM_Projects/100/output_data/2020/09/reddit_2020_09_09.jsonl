This something that has been shown to be affective in the research of Dr. Roland Griffiths, and is already seeing positive results in Canada.

HOLL has their revenues from the US cannabis sector (another very hot industry right now) and TRIP is targeting legal recreational markets in the Netherlands. I like Field Trip because they have some psychedelic assisted clinics already set up in places like Toronto, and probably will be a good company in the sector. Revive therapeutics is another one with legitimate revenue sources, but they have a bad wrap as being sector chasers, so invest at your own risk.\n\nMMED, NUMI, & BOSS are a few others in the sector that people like.
