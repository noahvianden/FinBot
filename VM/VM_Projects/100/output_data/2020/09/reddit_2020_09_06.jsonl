{"title": "Intel : the big picture and why I'm bullish on it", "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely o solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\n\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.\n\n\nEdit : positions 74000 in Intel Jan 2022 55 calls. https://imgur.com/GxExa8T.jpg", "id": "inrj01", "created_utc": 1599418079.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "Not bad at all.

Effective immediately, the Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group (TSCG) will be separated into the following teams, whose leaders will report directly to the CEO:\n\nTechnology Development, led by Dr. Ann Kelleher.\u00a0An accomplished Intel leader, Kelleher has been head of Intel manufacturing, where she ensured continuous operations through the COVID-19 pandemic while increasing supply capacity to meet customer needs and accelerating the ramp of Intel\u2019s 10nm process. She will now lead Intel technology development focusing on 7nm and 5nm processes.\u00a0Dr. Mike Mayberry, who has been leading Technology Development, will consult and assist in the transition until his planned retirement at the end of the year. Mayberry has a 36-year track record of innovation at Intel, during which he has made key contributions in technology development and as the leader of Intel Labs.Manufacturing and Operations, led by Keyvan Esfarjani.\u00a0Esfarjani most recently led manufacturing for Intel\u2019s Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG), in which role he set the vision and strategy for Intel\u2019s memory manufacturing and led a rapid expansion of capacity. He will now lead global manufacturing operations and continue Kelleher\u2019s work driving product ramp and the build-out of new fab capacity.Design Engineering, led in the interim by Josh Walden while Intel conducts an accelerated global search to identify a permanent world-class leader.\u00a0Walden is a proven leader in technology manufacturing and platform engineering. Most recently, he has been leading the Intel Product Assurance and Security Group (IPAS), which will continue to report to him.Architecture, Software and Graphics will continue to be led by Raja Koduri.\u00a0Koduri has responsibility for driving the development of Intel\u2019s architecture and software strategy, and dedicated graphics product portfolio. Under his leadership, we will continue to invest in our software capability as a strategic asset and further build-out software engineering with cloud, platform, solutions and services expertise.Supply Chain will continue to be led by Dr. Randhir Thakur.\u00a0 Thakur will report directly to the CEO as chief supply chain officer, recognizing the ever-growing importance of this role and our relationships with key players in the ecosystem. Thakur and his team are charged with ensuring supply chain is a competitive advantage for Intel.\n\nAs a result of these changes, Murthy Renduchintala will leave Intel on Aug. 3, 2020.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working directly with these talented and experienced technology leaders, each of whom is committed to driving Intel forward during this period of critical execution,\u201d said Swan. \u201cI also want to thank Murthy for his leadership in helping Intel transform our technology platform. We have the most diverse portfolio of leadership products in our history and, as a result of our six pillars of innovation and disaggregation strategy, much more flexibility in how we build, package and deliver those products for our customers.\u201d\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-changes-technology-organization/", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1.

Since every option is a contract that can be sold up until its expiration date, you could technically profit just by timing your purchases and sales of different options contracts. This likely wouldn't be considered market manipulation. \n\nOn the other hand, any time you buy or sell an option, the person you sell to or buy from needs to adjust their positions in the stock markets to maintain a neutral exposure. Many time, it's market makers who are the other guy - and this 'forcing market makers to purchase ... ' will happen even if you're just trying to arbitrage options contracts (and don't have any of the underlying stock, and so won't benefit from its price changing, which is pretty much a prerequisite for market manipulation). \n\nI'm keeping things simple b/c ELI5 but am happy to go a bit more detailed if anyone wants.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6628625392913818}, {"body": "You're reading that from someone who didn't even know that an options contract is a contract for 100 shares.

When people trade options, the market maker hedges against that trade with the opposite trade by buying/selling shares or opposite options contract strategies in order to remain neutral to moves in the stock. This is how all market makers function and the only reason it caused a huge move in tech is cause SoftBank is a whale and bought 10 billion dollars worth of amzn, TSLA, googl etc. There's nothing illegal about it, it's just aggressive and it was profitable.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You are right and wrong at the same time. Market makers do take opposite positions, but not in full sized. They may sell a call to you, and buy only 10 or 20 shares. As the stock goes up, they are \"forced\" to buy more shares. \n\nThis effect is compounded a lot when the market makers sold deep out of the money calls. First, they got less premium for selling them. Second, the changes in option price as the stock STARTS to rise is small and seems almost negligible on their balance sheets. However as the call moves closer to in the money or even at the money, the delta starts increasing. When the options get in the money the delta starts to approach 1.  \n\nThe fact that delta increases as the stock heads up into the money is a big problem and makes the market makers trapped. They MUST buy more shares, even if they are delta-hedged. Why? Because the rate of change of delta starts increasing. \n\nThis is the important part. Even if they are delta hedges (hedged against the stock moving up) they are often NOT gamma hedged (hedged against delta itself increasing). \n\nZero hedge and others pointed out that the last 2 week of explosive upward movement was due to the market makers and others being short gamma... In english, the out of the money calls started moving in the money and delta (how much an option moves when the stock moves) began increasing to such an extent that the market makers were ALL behind the curve and couldn't keep up. Just trying to stay hedged was pushing the market up more which made them need to hedge more.\n\n It's essentially a short squeeze. All the market makers were in a short squeeze.

If they didn't do it and thus ended up trapped in a gamma squeeze/convexity squeeze then that's their mistake. \n\nAgain I'm not saying SoftBank is innocent in all their trading activities. This was an incredibly aggressive and well-timed bet, but it wasn't illegal or manipulative IMO. The fact that market makers ended up trapped in a squeeze is due to their own poor risk management.
