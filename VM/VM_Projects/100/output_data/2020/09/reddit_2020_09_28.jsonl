I\u2019ve spent a non-insignificant amount of time in China so I would like to weigh in to this discussion for the benefit of this community.\n\nChinese people engage in conspicuous consumption at a higher rate than their western counterparts. Most people of means, if not all of them, live in high-rises. The neighborhood home is simply not really a thing over there and tier one cities. What does this mean? Imagine financial success was twice as important for your social standing and prospects as it is now in the west. Possibly even more. It is everything\u2026 And you can\u2019t simply buy a house to show off because it\u2019s simply not as visible unless you send pictures of your address to people online. Of course that happens, but what I am getting at is that for most Chinese people their choice of car is the number one indicator of their financial status.\n\nBecause this isn\u2019t as important, even though it is important, for Westerners, many of you frequently talk about various Chinese electric car companies as if they are going to dominate the Chinese market in the future.\n\nIf this was the case, why our iPhones still being sold in China? Think about that. They are literally produced in that country alone, it is an extremely valuable product, and it features predominantly in the way the people interact with the world. It is also a quintessential American company\u2026 And yet, iphones are still selling in China. \n\nAsk yourself why that is. There\u2019s nothing special about an iPhone. Other phones have extremely equivalent capabilities. The reason why they still sell is because of conspicuous consumption. There\u2019s only so many ways the Chinese can show off the wealth, and having a nice car is arguably number one, with travel, clothing and purses being secondary.\n\nTesla has an excellent brand image. If Chinese millennials are anything like us, tesla is the new BMW, Audi, and Mercedes combined. It is also a western brand, with a larger than life CEO. Even if the Chinese auto manufacturers are able to produce equivalent cars for the equivalent cost, Tesla is still going to have significant sales in the country in the future. Why is that? I\u2019ll tell you. You have no idea the number of Audi in range rovers that are being driven in Beijing right now. No idea. Chinese show wealth by buying among the prevailing luxury brands, and over there at least when I was there eight years ago, those brands were very specific. Land Rover and Audi. Chinese sales are so important to these brands that when she jumping started clamping down and corruption, it led to huge financial issues for these companies as I recall.\n\nSo what does this mean? This means that even if Chinese companies are able to produce a competitive vehicle at a competitive price to Tesla, the gradual shift in luxury consumption habits in China given the context of Chinese consumption cultural phenomenon means that Tesla will begin to slowly replace the market share for luxury vehicles in the country.\n\nA caveat to all of this is the assumption that Chinese millennials have similar luxury brand choices as their western counterparts. I am relying heavily on this. But I also think that there is a degree of western trendsetting when it comes to luxury brand choices, as indicated by Chinese luxury brand consumption in the first place.\n\nBasically, the gist of this is to flat out ignore any article that points towards Chinese domestic electric vehicle consumption as indicative of a future where tesla does not have major Chinese sales in the future.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "China\u2019s President \u201cShe jumping\u201d.

The reality is essentially a superposition of all possible outcomes, until the state is collapsed by one of them becoming the reality.\n\nThere are basically three parameters to the valuation: The expected value, the deviation from it, and the external alternatives.\n\nExpected value is what I described in the beginning. It\u2019s the probability of every outcome multiplied by their corresponding stock price.\n\nThe deviation is what describes risk. The way I use it to define valuation is by looking at how much the price needs to be discounted in order for the expected return to be 90% certain. This should also take into account all possible errors in defining all the values. This is also known as the margin of safety.\n\nExternal alternatives create relative value between assets. There's also opportunity cost associated with investing in any single asset. This means, that if you invest in asset A, there could be missed higher returns in other assets.\n\nThe way this affects the price is like how the sea level stays relatively flat despite a bumpy seabed. If there's a higher return associated with any asset, it will be levelled by the price increasing. Therefore all assets should have an equal potential for gains. \n\nHowever like the ocean has waves, also the stock market has it's dynamic inbalance, meaning that the real levels fluctuate around this ideal. Information isn't always perfect, and emotions play a part.\n\nWhy Elon says the stock is overvalued might be because he isn't fully grasping the third element. Potentials will always be levelled out, and Tesla's potential is huge. This leads to what is also often called the future looking valuation.

{"title": "Capital Efficiency Theory", "selftext": "Okay so when Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger say they never owned more than 3 stocks to get rich but warren had/has one stock (Coke) and Charlie had 2 (Bank of America & Wells Fargo) in their personal portfolios. their take on diversification is, its for idiots. Because a really good business is well protected from the bear markets and competition over the long term. Basically one good company that you understand everything about. I get what hes saying but to me it feels alot like an \"all in\" or a \"yolo\" play to me. But I also understand that investing $10,000 into 50 companies (some you dont fully understand) is worse than, and you wont make as much profit if you were to put that same $10,000 into 1 good company you completely understand and like.\n\nSide note:\nWarren did use to say no more than 7 when he was younger, then started saying no more than 3 when he got older. But he personally recommends less than 3 EXTREMLY good companies and he personally only invests in ONE.\n\nAnother side note:\nThey say you lose capital efficiency when you go past 13 different companies, that you could\u2019ve compounded money into less and better company\u2019s making you more money over time. Warren thinks you lose capital efficiency with more than 1 and munger thinks more than 3 your losing capital effefficiency. They also say that the finance institutions are basing their curriculum not to get you rich but to maintain decent growth and protect your money. But as an argument to that, you are protected because a really good company just has the market in their palms and the other competitors will only get a small slice of the pie. And they also say when that \u201chuge dip\u201d is inevitable it gives them a better buying and return opportunity than someone that is buying into a lot of different companies.\n\nLast side note:\nYou have companies like Amazon who if the e commerce industry were to burst or go to shit they have other business ventures to fall back on for revenue like Amazon prime, twitch, etc which would make them broader and better investing opportunities than some other blue chip companies that might not have those assets.\n\nLast thing:\nMark Cuban says the same thing saying diversification is for people that don\u2019t know what they are investing in.\n\nJust trying to see you guys\u2019 take on that, im also wanting to figure out how I can calculate capital efficiency. Aka the \u201csweet spot\u201d\n\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are very sure of a company, so sure that you would invest half of your life plus into that single company. Then yes, but they would have to be the biggest in their industry, no chance of competition. You need to fully understand their business model inside and out, how they got to be where they are \u201cdid they change or innovate in order to get there?\u201d And \u201chow are they positioned for the (contactless) future, you need to know EVERYTHING about their financials, understand and compare past growth to other companies. Andddd, they should have other assets to fall back on if their primary business were to fail. Then yes, it could be a great investment. Side note, when that one company eventually drops hard you\u2019ll have a better buying and profit opportunity putting all your money in that one company, than you would have if you invested into a lot of different companies.\n\nTL;DR: better companies = better investments, less companies = calculated investments and more profits. \n(Still don\u2019t know if I want to yolo into 1 company tho) \n\nGive me your insight on this*", "id": "j1dk32", "created_utc": 1601305156.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "Ok thank you for this now I own Coke", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "I dumped about half of my portfolio into a few dozen kilos.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Kilos of?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Coke.

Buffett said that *institutional investors* should not diversify. [Many people misquote him however he does support diversification for the small retail investor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbjPiYE-F4Y) Most of the people who are in this sub and on reddit as a whole *should be diversifying* and using indices because they are not professional investors. \n2. One of the problems with \"diversification\" to begin with is a failure to understand what it is. Diversification can be achieved (literally and academically) with very few positions; if you took one position in XOM, one in TSLA and one in GLD for instance you've chosen three distinctly separate market segments that don't overlap and thus are diversified. That's all it takes. You can mix this up a million ways but basically it's about correlation, not number, so anyone who dilutes their positions is suffering for it.\n3. Large position owners have a lot of perks that the average person does not so it is not best to fail to understand this. There's just more to it such as taking on part of the revenue of the company on your own books and so forth and so on. Most people are not large position holders (5%+) so thusly most do not ever get this type of investment power which in turn means that most do better not doing this.\n4. Hardcore compounding does work but it requires skill and a lot of time *however* you must start *cheap*. You have to have a lot capital upfront and a very good idea that is very cheap at the time. For instance what Berkshire bought $KO for is in the Berkshire letters and it was below market for one and then the fact of the matter is that $KO was just stupidly cheap at the time and had extreme brand value that was not properly valued. This is *significantly* harder today due to crowding; you can't come up with a great idea that isn't arbitraged away very rapidly in the markets because today people jump on things very quickly. WSB is evidence of this. Generally speaking you're better off not trying this approach because again what happens now is large gains are made in quick instants versus long-standing outliers.

The hot potato game can go all the way to the point where the option is no longer ITM, or it gets exercised, most likely by a market maker.

You are leveraging the *price movement* of the underlying, not the underlying itself. \n\nIf you are doing a fair comparison, Test A would buy 100 shares of XYZ and Test B would leverage 100 shares of XYZ through call options and then exercise to end up with 100 shares. Apples to apples, shares for shares. \n\nIn this case, leverage needs to include the cost of exercise, and in many cases, using a call to leverage ownership of shares *costs more* than just buying the shares earlier, because exercise is premium + strike + fees. If Test A is buy 100 shares of XYZ when it is $80 and Test B is buy a call with a strike price of $100, with the forecast that XYZ will hit $100 before expiration, Test B is a leverage win only if XYZ ends up substantially higher than $100. If it is only $101 and you spent $2 on the call, your net cost to own those shares is $102, which is a loss, relative to Test A.\n\nIt's apples to oranges to compare leverage of shares vs. leverage of price movement only. Given the same Test A and B as before, but now, Test A leaves you owning 100 shares of XYZ for a $21/share profit (because XYZ is $101 on expiration) on $80/share investment vs. Test B which leaves you with a $21/share profit on a $2/share investment. B looks like a win, but it's not a fair comparison.\n\n> Delta Value of Option x Price of Underlying Security / Price of Option\n\nThe first part is the dollar delta calculation. If you want to know what the \"share equivalent\" of your call is, you calculate delta x price of underlying. So if XYZ is worth $100 and your delta is 50, you would have the equivalent of 50 shares of XYZ, in terms of dollar price movement.\n\nThen dividing by the option cost would give you cost of the option in terms of shares per dollar.

Of course, I don't want to wait till the last minute to close out the spread. IS there an estimate as to how much return one can expect on these spreads? 75% of $215? 50%?\n\nThat's up to you. You choose the profit target for early exit. There is no guarantee that profit level will be hit, since some trades are just going to be losers no matter what you do, but on average after hundreds or thousands of repetitions, you'll average out to whatever % target you set.\n\nYou should choose a loss limit and max holding time for early exit as well. Keep in mind that you don't want to choose a loss% that is so many times the profit% that you have negative expected value. For example, if you have a 60% chance to profit on a $100 max profit spread, and you want to bail out at 20% of max profit, the highest loss% target you should pick is 30%. Anything higher and you'll net an average loss, because if max profit is $100, (.60 x $20) - (.40 x $30) = 0, or break even. Any loss larger than $30 will be a negative number.\n\nBTW, Option Pricing Calculator has a short link feature.

If it is late on expiration day, yes, it will very quickly get assigned. If it is weeks away from expiration, no, it will not get instantly assigned.\n\nThe closer you are to expiration, the higher the risk an ITM short call will get assigned. This is because the extrinsic value shrinks to nothing at expiration, and that ex value counts as a sort of \"exercise fee\" that owners don't want to pay. The farther from expiration, the higher the ex value, the higher the ex value, the higher the \"fee\" the owner has to pay to exercise.\n\n> Also, is the person that bought the call the only one that can exercise it?\n\nThat's not how it works. When a contract position is opened, a buyer (owner) and seller (underwriter) are paired. But after that trade is filled, they have nothing to do with each other, it no longer matters. If later the owner decides to exercise, that exercise is *randomly* paired with an underwriter that has an open position at the same strike/expiration. It is most likely not the same \"person\" that filled the owner's order to buy. If that random pairing happens to pick you, your short position gets assigned.\n\nBTW, you shouldn't write covered calls so close to the price of the stock, unless you want to have your shares called away.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ok thanks.

The wider the strikes, the higher the risk. Even money is a good initial target to shoot for, like risk $100 to earn $100, but you may find worse ratios that are all you can afford, like risk $100 to earn $80. Better ratios, like risking $400 to earn $500 are more desirable, but harder to find. Starting with one whole strike width is safe, like $121/$122. If there are half dollar strikes in between, skip over them. You want a whole strike interval, which will either be $1, $5, or $10, depending on the price of the underlying.\n\nThe Sky View Trading YouTube channel has explainers about debit spreads.\n\nCredit, the typical backtested starting point is to open the short leg as close to 30 delta as you can get and the long leg at the strike that gives you a credit that is 1/3 the width of the strikes. So if the credit is $2, the width of the strikes should be no more than $6.

Like most people, I own index funds in retirement accounts.  These aren\u2019t readily accessed without penalty, however I would still like to create cash flow while these appreciate.  \n\nHere\u2019s the strategy:  Allocate 2.5% of portfolio for selling call spreads, ~30 Delta, ~30 DTE on SPX, collecting 1/3 of the width of the strikes.  \n\nThe idea is that even if the spread loses, I gain in the remainder of the portfolio.  I also subscribe to the theory that the market takes the stairs up and the elevator down, meaning in most cases the main portfolio may appreciate a little bit, but not enough to challenge the spreads. \n\nI have a few questions/assumptions about running this strategy.  \n\n- How much should I allocate to this strategy?  I was planning on allocating 2.5% to this strategy because, at current IV levels, a ~30 Delta, ~30 DTE spread is generally about 2.5 - 3% above SPX\u2019s current price and any loss from spreads would result in an equivalent or greater gain in the portfolio.  \n- Should I close these early, at 50% profit?  If I were only selling spreads, I would think this is the correct approach, however, in this particular situation, I am thinking about holding until expiration.  If the market declines after entering the position, I gain the full amount from the spread.  If the market increases such that both legs are now ITM, I will accept the loss, enjoy the gain, and sell another spread even higher.  \n- Should I roll losing positions?  \n- In this particular scenario, spreads seem superior to naked calls.  Personally, I like the defined risk.  The margin requirements are also lower.  With spreads, I can allocate a lower % of the portfolio to this strategy.  Plus, if the market goes up 10% instead of just 3%, I get to keep the additional gain in the index funds past the loss of the spreads.   \n\nI\u2019d appreciate any feedback.
