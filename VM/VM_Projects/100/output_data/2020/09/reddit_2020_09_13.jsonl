{"title": "When do options expire? (Important)", "selftext": "It seems that options expire at market close on Friday but this is not the case. Options can be exercised until 5:30 pm the Friday of expiration. That means most traders have an hour and a half Friday after close to exercise their option. The reason this is important is because an option seller might think he\u2019s clear of any obligation once the market closes. He is thinking about how much ice cream he can buy with the premium he has received but little does he know it can be exercised much later. The short put he sold at $100 seems to be expired but some bad news after hours leads the stock to tumble from $105 to $90 and the person who bought the put exercised it. Now the Option Writer has to take responsibility for these shares and is assigned shares at $100 when the underlying is trading for $90 for a loss of $10 per share.

Their data center seems promising too and I believe Apple is a customer.  To be honest, it's probably dead money for awhile and it's going to be in this $4 to $5 range. I wouldn't be surprised if it dips under $4.  Maybe pick up 250 shares and sell when it goes up a quarter and wait for pullbacks or hold on for the long term in case they get acquired. Other than that, you are better off with Marvell Technologies, Apple, Qrvo, Qualcomm for a 5G play. Even if you get less shares for $1000, the likelihood of the stock moving up is much greater. Also, if they pay dividends (Apple pays divs but not sure of the others), just reinvest the dividends and you will have more shares in the future. I've been burned by a lot of these cheap stocks that they are almost not worth investing in because they just don't move much.  You can consider having a portfolio of 6 of these under $7 stocks but don't put more than $3k. If one of them pans out, great. Not all will be winners.  \n\nYou may want to consider Ark Invest ETFs as I have a couple of them (ARKK and ARKF). The returns have been tremendous and Cathy (CEO) invests in disruptive companies.

{"title": "Oracle Chosen as Winner in Deal for TikTok\u2019s U.S. Operations", "selftext": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-drops-out-of-bidding-for-tiktoks-u-s-operations-11600039821?mod=mhp\n\nEditing to post in updated article:\n\nOracle Corp. ORCL -0.58% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, a person familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.65% in a deal to salvage a social-media service that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.\n\nOracle is set to be announced as TikTok\u2019s \u201ctrusted tech partner\u201d in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the person said.\n\nMicrosoft earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd.\n\n\n\u201cWe are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok\u2019s users, while protecting national security interests,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTo do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.\u201d\n\nThe move by Beijing-based ByteDance comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok\u2019s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.\n\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn\u2019t sold to an American company by Sept. 15, though it isn\u2019t clear if that is the operative deadline. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn\u2019t sold to a U.S. buyer. That gives the parties until Sept. 20 to seal a deal.\n\nTikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app\u2019s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed for a sale, expressing concern that TikTok could pass on data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China\u2019s authoritarian government.
