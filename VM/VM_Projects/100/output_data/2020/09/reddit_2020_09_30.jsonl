They mute themselves, turn off the video, and run fucking the washing machine. Lockdown and shelter-in-place has led to an explosion in household chores to include washing and drying clothes. Guess what everybody is wearing at home? Not their fucking dress clothes but casual clothes that are now being redirected to the home washer/dryer rather than out-sourced to dry cleaning services. Literally, the only headwind to P&G's fabric care business is you greasy fucks refreshing the daily thread and sorting by new posts hoping to secure early entry on the next big pump have probably stopped doing laundry altogether.\n\n**Family Care (Charmin, Bounty, Puffs)**  \n[Why toilet-paper demand spiked 845%](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-toilet-paper-demand-spiked-845-how-companies-kept-up-2020-5).\n\nSelf-explanatory. Toilet paper, paper towels, and even tissues have been perpetually out-of-stock. And it's not because we are out of trees to chop down but because pantry loading and consumption have exploded. At home pantry levels are increasing due to fear of another panic buy. Working from home and shitting on company time means you are now using even more toilet paper than before. Staying at home more means you are cleaning more which leads to higher paper towel consumption. Kids learning from home instead of at school means more messes which means more Bounty sales.\n\n**Dish and Air Care** **(Febreze, Dawn, Gain, Cascade)**  \n[Dishwashing Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Supplies Expected to Grow by 275%](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/23/2020697/0/en/Dishwashing-Amid-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Supplies-Expected-to-Grow-by-275-Leading-Manufacturers-Include-Unilever-Procter-Gamble-Henkel-Lion-Corporation-and-Reckitt-Benckiser-Among-Ot.html).\n\nStaying at home and restaurant shut downs means an explosion in home cooking.

Families are stocking the fuck up on diapers and wipes cause they're afraid of rampant out-of-stocks. And I know this one will be hard for your virgins to understand, but once we are 9 months into the pandemic (Dec/Jan) we will see an explosion of new births due to all the stay at home baby making leading to another boom in daiper sales.\n\n**Surface Care** **(Swiffer, Mr. Clean, Microban)**  \n[Sales of cleaning products are skyrocketing during the pandemic](https://www.businessinsider.com/cleaning-product-sales-surge-procter-gamble-pandemic-2020-7).\n\nThis is the big one.

Mommy blogs are fucking writing about how to efficiently clean. Late night talk shows are talking about cleaning. Swiffer and Mr. Clean have been out of stock since March and consumption is through the roof. But that's not even the biggest sign that we are on our way to tendie-town...

In March of 2020 - this fucking year - right when the pandemic hit. P&G launches a new brand that disrupted the sanitization and antibacterial space. A consumer sanitizer that has residual, long lasting, kill and effective on SARS-CoV-2. Competitive santizers only kill bacteria on contact and Microban is able to protect the surface for a 24hr period. This is a groundbreaking product without any competitive parities that launched at the start of the pandemic. Guess what matters to stockholders & the share price? Growth vs. prior year. Guess what blockbuster brand didn't exist in P&G's portfolio in the prior year - Microban. The keyword here is *incrementality*. This killer product, launched at the most serendipitous time, is going to be completely incremental to P&G's revenue and profit and has been completely sold out since the first week of launch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do we know P&G's supply chain can supply all this growth potential?**  \n[The New Construction Approach That Helped P&G Build Their \u201cPlant Of The Future\u201d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2020/02/21/the-new-construction-approach-that-helped-pg-build-their-plant-of-the-future/#7fa5b0d5714d). P&G just built a new plant that requires 1,800 fucking factory workers in West Virginia.  \n[P&G gears up new $500M plant.](https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2018/03/01/p-g-gears-up-new-500m-plant.html#:~:text=Procter%20%26%20Gamble%20Co.%20began%20manufacturing,up%20production%20of%20other%20brands). They threw $500,000,000 at this bitch to stand up a 2million sq ft manufacturing site. Construction started in 2015 and new reports say that it was full operational only recently. And guess what they produce at this plant? Fabric Care, Household Cleaners, Dish Detergent, and more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Okay, so what does all this mean to P&G's earnings?**  \nFucking \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nAll the categories we just covered represent 60% of P&G's net sales in 2019. That means 60% of P&G's sales year ago has been consuming full tilt to the point that they can't even keep shelves in stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uidadoulycq51.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee988b4d21d5db2825068d49053faea9180ee386\n\nP&G beat earnings per share in their Q4 by 14%. October 27th will be their first earnings in the new fiscal year and they will similarly crush analyst expectations.\n\n[Analysts are estimating only a measily 3% growth YoY on EPS.](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=pg)\n\nThey got the estimates completely wrong last quarter and they will undervalue the surge in consumption in this next quarter as well.\n\nThat's right P&G only needs to beat a 3% growth YoY. With 60% of their business completely exploding due to the pandemic, a 3% growth target is going be absolutely decimated like your TSLA FDE calls on battery day.\n\nNeed more reason to believe? [P&G revenue grew 4.8% in their previous fiscal year.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PG/procter-gamble/revenue) And 3/4 of the fiscal year did not benefit from pandemic consumption levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional indirect indicators that P&G is going to exceed expectations:**\n\n* [Costco beat earnings](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/costco-q4-earnings-and-sales-beat-estimates-stock-slips)\n* [Walmart beat earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/18/walmart-wmt-q2-2021-earnings.html)\n* [Target beat earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/target-tgt-earnings-q3-2019.html)\n* [Kroger beat earnings](https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2020/09/11/why-kroger-s-second-quarter-earnings-surprised.html)\n\nAll these retailers are beating earnings and posting comp store growth... Guess who the fuck is supplying them with all their product? Procter and fucking Gamble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What the play to print?**  \n30 days before their last earnings there was a $11 run-up and then another $9 run-up the 30 days after. Since then PG has been trading sideways. IV is low and we are about 30 days before the next earnings call which means the time is now to get into the pre-earnings run-up. And because this isn't a meme stock being traded by retards across the world, the post-earnings run-up will print without substantial IV crush.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r81rcyx22dq51.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3dc82a886b92d063d17c19f2b7841b77b21df2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hop in faggots, we're headed towards tendie-town.**\n\n10/23 $140c  \n10/23 $150c  \n11/20 $150c  \n11/20 $160c", "id": "j2wav8", "created_utc": 1601505167.0, "score": 286, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 7 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10517536848783493}, {"body": "I mean the name literally has Gamble in it.
