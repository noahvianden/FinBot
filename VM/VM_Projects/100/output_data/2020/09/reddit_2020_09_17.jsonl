{"title": "AMD about to test 50 day MA", "selftext": "The 50day MA as of writing this is 75.24. AMD is currently sitting at 74.72 pre-market. AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market.\n\nIf you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.\n\nThe entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.\n\nBut as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.\n\nThe main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was.

I had some savings left and everyone was telling me don't do it, don't invest anywhere and I felt saving accounts weren't giving me anything. So started doing research because at that time AMD had been in a lawsuit for anti-competitiveness with Intel paying manufacturers to use their product over AMD( I think the settlement was like $4 billion) but don't recall. When the crash happened they tumbled along with a couple of other ones, like Sony and Microsoft. So during the crash I had picked up AMD (my starting costs were at 1.25 or 1.26, if i recall correctly). Then I started buying more as i started working during school. Later on my research found that they were being used in gaming systems. So I decided to start buying more and at ~~one~~ my highest point, I had like 40k shares, but now wish I had held on to it all. With that being said, I started buying more AMD during 2009 to 2015, I also started buying SNE (15-17/share) and MSFT around 22/share but sold them off. But i had a feeling that they would be coming back up because their core business is not really consumer as it is innovation and businesses.

{"title": "Sell Facebook from all long term holdings, they are on a decline, VR won't save them.", "selftext": "Of all the tech stocks that are down today, FB is down the most. This confirms that big funds are rebalancing, they are cutting stocks that they think will yield shittier returns in the future. Also confirms my belief about Facebook on a decline, with the whole Social Dilemma, it shines a light on their corrupt evil ways, the users are increasingly aware of it.\n\nTikTok has Zuck shook, a tiny app originally from China almost dethroned FB, he had to resort to lobbying Trump to get rid of it. Long term, FB is running out of places to expand, they can't in China for obvious reasons, which is arguably the biggest and most profitable market. So they resorted to South East Asian countries, but the problem is their middle class is almost none existent, and FB coming in have caused mass civil unrest... their users LITERALLY killing each other off, not good for business. They are DESPERATELY trying to branch out by investing heavy in AI and VR, VR has very little demand right now, mostly a fad until it can achieve insane resolutions, and frankly it's risky and probably won't pay off in the near/medium term. Their AI department cannot compete with Google or Tesla, I think the big boys realize this, that's why they are dumping it the most. Either way, I would not long FB in any of my long term portfolios. Twitter is a much better bet, they are essentially becoming an utility at this point.\n\nTheir domestic market is becoming stale, with China on the rise, having zero access to their market is a huge downside. What's left for them to expand? Africa? Idk much about them, but I'm pretty sure China has first dibs on their market, WeChat will most likely be the social media app of Africa.\n\nYou gotta ask yourself, where is FB going to find growth? Take a look at Apple, they penetrated pretty much every market on earth, and their devices are becoming less and less appealing with each iteration. They need a breakthrough in hardware technology to get on the next wave, therefore, their only move is services, it took them 10 fucking years to realize this... they need to squeeze more dollars from their existing customers instead of finding new users. Facebook doesn't have that luxury, it doesn't have the cult following Apple has, Apple has a much stronger moat than Facebook, because while Facebook has network effects on its side, it will also be its downfall. Network effects can work negatively too, when another app becomes popular, it uses network effects to growth exponentially, and FB's market share will shrink exponentially. Its the reason why some social media platforms rise as quickly as they die, MySpace, YikYak, Tumblr. How much more fucking advertisement can they stuff down your throat? How many more dollars can they squeeze from their data that is starting to lack diversity? How much more is their data gonna be worth by recording your 1020023rd like on the latest Instagram Thot's 5226th ass picture?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Facebook's reigning days are numbered, they are on a decline, no more exponential growth.
