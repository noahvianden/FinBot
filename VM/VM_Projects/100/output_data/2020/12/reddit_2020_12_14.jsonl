{"title": "Made $16k in 24 hrs on PRPL last options expiration, or how to play max pain!", "selftext": "Yep.   I made $16k in 24 hours by playing against MMs move to max pain on the last options expiration.  \n\n\nProof:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2rmkpgtm2561.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4964298a012ca2bc8535d44a85909f6403bc2a1\n\nI sold 400 30p 11/20's for \\~$0.40 each for about $16,000 in profit on the day before expiration when the stock price was about $29.70.   Why did I take such a \"risky\" move?   Because PRPL religiously follows max pain when it isn't in the middle of its mid-quarter run up.\n\n# What is Max Pain?\n\nI'll spare you my own detailed explanation and let you google it yourself (or for the lazy, start [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp)).\n\nBasically, Market Makers' delta hedging actions, in the absence of an underlying or external force driving movement in the stock (aka news event), will force a stock to land at the max pain price on options expiration.\n\nNo, it isn't some sinister coordinated action against you.   It's just the math of the position and strategy that Market Makers take.\n\nAnd yes, this is a controversial topic in some circles, but so is Wall Street Bets.  Those circles are clearly stupid on both accounts.   We know what we are doing here.\n\n# Why don't all stocks follow this and how come everyone doesn't just play this?\n\nTwo words:  retard strength.  Never ever, ever, ever attempt to play this against a stock with a constant influx of retards buying up positions on the stock (looking at you Tesla!), aka retard strength.\n\nRetard strength and major news events present a gamma risk to the market makers and can cause movements in the underlying price of the stock that they are unable to \"manage\" to the same degree.  As the market makers are constantly trading their hedges, new buyers (or sellers as it may be) can provide price support outside of max pain targets.\n\n***THIS*** is exactly why PRPL is PERFECT for max pain plays.   Outside of its traditional late-quarter run up into ER, PRPL is about as boring as it was for your date your first time in bed.    There's very little short-lived action and nobody is talking about it much the next day.\n\n# PRPL and Max Pain\n\n[Historical Max Pain Data from Opricot](https://preview.redd.it/qey2gnwvp2561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=0609d0a040260fa5c1f22b7044647f39f7974108)\n\nLet's look at how well PRPL has tracked against max pain, EVEN for post-ER price action.   See, PRPL tends to get very excited on the run up to ER (it blows its load early), and disappoints when it is time to score (Joe Megibow, while a great CEO, is the anti-Elon-Musk in terms of ER excitement).   For max pain plays, this is perfect because there is no external price support outside of MM's driving to max pain.\n\nEven for the infamous Q2 ER that I called wrong, PRPL ended at max pain just days later.\n\nPRPL works really well for max pain because there is an inordinate amount of option activity compared to a relative small amount of stock volume.   It's the perfect scenario for a MM to maximize their strategy, but it makes PRPL price action ***PREDICTABLE.***   If you can predict the price and the timing, you can make money using options (and stock trades), ***ESPECIALLY*** because PRPL tends to have fairly wide swings between expiration dates (noted above).\n\nAll you simply need to do is make a play on an outside swing betting that it will return to max pain, and voila: tendies.\n\n# What are the risks?\n\nClearly, you are in the wrong sub if you just asked this question.   For the benefit of the outsiders who don't truly belong here:\n\n1. max pain is a moving target\n2. max pain can't be perfectly calculated\n3. news events can break the pattern (which is why this works on boring stonks with high option volume relative to stock volume)\n\n**Max Pain is a Moving Target**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ck0rcxoer2561.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7b6678cdd1cc09e0131252a19b0abfb4c1d7c42\n\nOur very own [Swaggy Stocks](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/PRPL) has one of the best max pain calculators I've seen ([this one](http://maximum-pain.com/options/PRPL) is ok too, especially if you don't want to pay for Opricot).   Towards the bottom of Swaggy's is a historical max pain chart which helps explain that max pain is a moving target.\n\nPeople are constantly buying and selling options.   The net of the open interests and strikes is the max pain price.   So, max pain can move on you after you've made your play (which is why I wait till closer to expiration).\n\n**Max Pain Can't Be Perfectly Calculated**\n\nWhile we know open interest and strikes, we don't necessarily know WHICH SIDE of the play the market makers took on each play.   This doesn't invalidate max pain theory, but it presents a risk that should be understood when making these plays.\n\nIf you assume that the market maker is always taking the short side of an options play, you will likely be generally correct (because who's theta gang, really?  Oh right, me.), and can rely on max pain as a guideline.\n\n**News Events Can Break the Pattern**\n\nAn inordinate amount of volume from a news event or retard strength can break max pain theory on a stock (see the PRPL expirations BEFORE ER that are the run up to ER).   I probably won't play January on PRPL, but I'm playing December.\n\n# Prediction and Positions\n\nMy prediction is that PRPL ends very close to max pain of $30 again on 12/18, which would represent a nice movement up from the close on Friday of $27.435.   Of course, you autists could all pile in and move the max pain target on me, but I thought I would take that risk and share this.   Assuming you guys don't bring retard strength in a bad way (move max pain and then deflate the price action activity at the end of the week, allowing a max pain ending at a different price), then we will see $30 by week's end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gc0yec3at2561.jpg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cd9b05b0f7797c4ec37da569b4c170cab2f7cc3\n\nI'm playing 100x each of 25c, 30c, and short 30p.   All 12/18's.\n\nThis isn't investment advice, nor a recommendation, but for you autists who can't put two and two together:   shares and ITM calls.\n\nIf you guys jack this up, then lesson learned from me, and I'll never remind you of this again.   You will all forget about it like the goldfish you are and I'll play it again after next earnings for some tendies.\n\n# Technical Astrology\n\nYou all know what I think about Technical Analysis.    Confirmation bias at best, and a cheap fortune cookie most likely.\n\nThe Technical Astrologers on Stocktwits are calling for similar price action to the 30's next week based upon magic charts:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrr7a86du2561.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=57f9a6cbef45634f68cef6cdbb7e8f23b7269c21\n\nI shamelessly swiped this from some guy's post calling for a double bottom, which means things are looking up.    I don't know about you, but a double bottom means a threesome to me, which means things are looking up.\n\nI put about as much weight into the above TA as this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85sylewmu2561.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb4395192ae24c5f4a1975bbc42aeb65af3444b\n\nThe above is still related to double bottoms and threesomes.   Clearly she didn't take into account her own game when making this stupid COVID rule.   For any man or woman brave enough to take that on, it counts as a threesome.   Legally.\n\nThe in-between skin on rolls is usually purple, so buy PRPL.\n\n# The Big Boys are Doing It\n\nBlackRock increased its holdings by 53.7% in PRPL during 3Q, according to their latest 13F, so they know own about $36.3M in PRPL.   Vanguard also increased their position.\n\nI'm very bullish still long term and think we'll see this baby in triple digits in the next two years easily based upon their announced manufacturing capacity and the fact that they still sell everything they make.\n\nThere's definitely opportunity in short term plays though.", "id": "kcqfwa", "created_utc": 1607919690.0, "score": 168, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 138, "comments": [{"body": "My phone died while scrolling.", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "I hid a tl;dr in the middle", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Is it in Maggie's rolls?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I knew someone would eventually lick there and find it.
