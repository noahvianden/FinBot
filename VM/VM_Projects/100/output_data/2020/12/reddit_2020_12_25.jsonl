What if the bull runs we've seen only amount to half of that?  Or a quarter?  \n\nAs well, we have corporate earnings that are insanely good, regardless of our shattered Main Street economy.  If someone like say, Apple or Nike can continue to make extreme profits even with tens of millions of unemployed, then will their stocks stop going up out of sympathy for the masses?  Or will those stocks reflect the almost sickening profits?  \n\nAnd for that matter, if Microsoft and Salesforce and Rocket Mortgage can continue to crank the automation dial for their customers, using technology to squash down costs and drive up earnings, won't those stocks continue to rise, even if a lot of restaurants go out of business permanently?\n\nThis latter logic is why I don't fear the boogeyman of so-called corporate tax increases.  These companies make more than enough to go back to paying the same tax rates they were just a few years ago.  They can certainly afford it, and then some.  If their shares get hit on any such worries, I buy.  Sure, they'll moan and bellyache, and their CEOs and surrogates will pretend they'll all collapse, and they'll pack up and move to Ireland.  But as the quarters tick by, we'll notice that... hey they're actually doing ok, and hey, they didn't leave the country.  \n\nThese are companies that would have told you a year ago they could never survive such socialist oppression as having to put up plexiglass around their cash registers or give free hand sanitizer to the commoners.  But when those supposedly impossible obstacles got between them and being an \"essential\" vendor... bam! They had it done overnight, and went on to set ever-increasing record earnings.  \n\nThey can certainly go back to paying prior tax rates.
