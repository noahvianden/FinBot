{"title": "Greek Government and Palantir Reaffirm Digital Transformation Partnership", "selftext": "As posted in /r/PalantirTech earlier.  \n\\_\\_\n\nAlex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir\u2019s ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response. \n\nSince the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir\u2019s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,\u201d said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. \u201cWe have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece\u2019s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.\n\n**About Palantir**\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc. is a software company that builds enterprise data platforms for use by organizations with complex and sensitive data environments.

Two reasons: Nasdaq uplisting and hype. \n\nNasdaq:\nThe uplisting will bring in a larger group of investors.

These guys are self made multi millionaires from social arb investing (complicated, but essentially trading off trends, hype, and the like). I agree with their stance that the \u201cshroom boom\u201d has hype written all over it. Psychedelics are cool, new, and interesting! People compare them (often incorrectly) to weed stocks when they first took off. There are some real comparisons there though. The hype could be insane. \n\n\nI\u2019ve been following this stock and the sector as a whole for months, and I\u2019ve watched it catch on as evidenced by one article every 2 weeks or so to a new article coming out almost daily now. People are catching on but it is still very early. \n\n\nLong term there is great potential too, but honestly I\u2019m more bullish on medium term (2-6 months) as the masses catch on and hype drives us to a crazy share price. I\u2019ll start selling a portion after the real hype kicks in (pose-Nasdaq), but will surly keep some for hopes of the trials panning out. \n\n\nOh yea, Kevin O Leary and Bruce Linton are quite involved in MindMed.

Think of otc stocks as more risky, \u201cstill-trying-to-prove-themselves as legitimate companies\u201d stocks. \n\n\nMindMed *could* get on Nasdaq as early as next week. Many mmed bulls will say it 100% will after 5 consecutive days of trading at $2usd, but there\u2019s no way they can make that claim. I\u2019m the biggest mmed bull there is and I\u2019m only 75% sure.... it\u2019s just more complicated that what people think and there could be more to it. Either way, I am expecting it to uplist to Nasdaq soon, and even if it takes another 2 months (unlikely) the investment is worth it in my opinion, but that\u2019s easier to say when you are in at a lower average price ($1.13usd for me).", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.629344642162323}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4676498770713806}, {"body": "Don\u2019t mention Dumb Money here.

It was scary that evening when no one knew why, but the very next day it came out that it was pre planned and was actually not bad news at all (I forget the reasoning). But not worrisome in the least. \n\n\nA reverse split was more of a fear a few weeks/months ago and those fears are getting smaller as the share price climbs. It is agreed on my most (although not 100% confirmed from what I can tell) that the Nasdaq uplisting price requirement is $2usd for 5 consecutive days. Mmedf was way below $2usd when they applied, so the fear was legit. Since then they have gone on a very healthy run and broke $2usd yesterday and held it all day. \n\n\nSo they are likely very close to holding the share price they need, and since they have held out for this long, it would make no sense to do a reverse split now, seeing as they are seemingly so close to meeting the requirement naturally. I can\u2019t say a RS won\u2019t happen for sure, but it is looking extremely unlikely at this point, especially after yesterday. If it holds $2usd again today then even less likely. \n\n\nHonestly Nasdaq *could* happen as early as next Monday, but my DD makes me more comfortable saying within next 1-3 weeks (things often take longer than expected, and covid could even factor a slight delay). **Bottom line is, if you are interested in getting into this stock, get in no later than the 5th consecutive day of trading at $2usd+, which could be as early as Friday, because day 6 could be \ud83d\ude80. Better yet, get in as close to $2 as you can.** Always do your own DD though, don\u2019t rely on a random internet stranger who is a clear mmed bull. \n\n\nI\u2019m very passionate about the short term gains of this stock and see it as *almost* guaranteed free money, assuming nothing unpredictable happens (pennystocks in general are volatile).

It may be useful to other members here.\n\nTurns out that what I was attempting to do is not possible.  See, I am trading inside a Canadian TFSA account and the problem is this.  When you buy/sell shares the settlement data is T+2 (2 days), whereas when you buy/sell options the settlement date is T+1 (1 day).  When i sold my shares and then put in a purchase order for some options contracts, the system detected that I would not have the funds to purchase the options on the settlement date.  I would not have those funds until the day after the options purchase was settled.  Since I am trading in a TFSA account, I am not allowed to go into a negative balance (so I gather this whole situation would be just fine and dandy if this was a non TFSA trading account).  If I want to trade shares for options, I have to sell the shares on day 0, and then buy the options on day 1.

Based on the NASDAQ as a whole, the market correctly intuited that the internet would be huge and, from a discounted cash flow perspective (one of the most traditional valuation methods there is), dot com was \\*not\\* a bubble in the sense that if you bought in '99, you are up on that investment today with a reasonable return.

IMO. They won't get delisted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast \"Thursday, an analyst gave a negative view of China's EV industry, sending NIO's stock lower by 5%. UBS issued a note on NIO rival XPeng, cutting its rating from buy to neutral based largely on the huge run-up in valuation that XPeng had seen. NIO investors seemed to take that message to heart as well.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNIO is in a healthy downtrend channel and needs to hit support at around the 38.18 range to complete. It should bounce off resistance and head back to  39-40 level where it may find some resistance. If it breaks resistance at that level, anticipate NIO to climb to 41-42 range for the second resistance level. It may bounce or may exit the downtrend since the pattern will technically be complete. If it jumps out expect a  PT of 42-45 within 3-4 days of the breakout.\n\nIf NIO fails to break the first resistance level at 39-4o level, anticipate it to drop to the 38-36 range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNiO shouldn't go lower than 30. 30 PT is a danger zone. We are getting near the bottom so be mindful of your indicators and oscillators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Suggested plays for NIO:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* HEDGE: 42c 12/11, 42p 12/11\n* If NIO breaks 44.28 resistance, convincingly, play a 44c 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 45.11 - 51.93 (not getting even close to 51) range.\n* If NIO breaks support at 41.16, convincingly, play 40p 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 38.18 - 29.06 range.\n* I recommend you let your hedge expire worthless or you could try to sell you put at the bottom and keep your call for on the way up - this is WSB after all.\n* BIG BRAIN with bullish sentiment for next week towards NIO might hedge with a 42c 12/18 exp. and 42p 12/11. If you take that strategy. Good luck friend.

{"title": "Why Canoo is Ahead of All Other EV SPACs and Will Change the EV Market", "selftext": "**A Quick Intro:**\n\nCanoo is an EV company going public through an SPAC merger later this month. Their 1st vehicle will begin mass production in 2022. You can look at it [HERE](https://www.canoo.com/design/)\n\nIt plans to offer it's product (vehicles) through a subscription based model. These subscriptions could be 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1+ year, etc. The subscription includes the vehicle, registration, maintenance, charging, and access to insurance.\n\n**What Puts Them Ahead?**\n\nThere's a few things that do. The easiest to see is the fact that they have a product. Their first van type vehicle(aka the BangBus) has already went through 50 crash tests and has actually been driving on the  highway.\n\nThe most exciting fact is the **Skateboard Design.** First watch [THIS](https://youtu.be/8m3fRujSlW0). The skateboard is essentially everything that makes the car go. Combine this with their steer by wire design(frees up a ton of space and can be put anywhere) and you have everything you need to make the car drive in the floor of the vehicle. This means for every model they're just adding the top \"shell\" to the skateboard and BOOM: you have a vehicle. Once they finalize the skateboard design(which they pretty much have done) then they can pump out new EV models like nothing. I'm talking delivery van, pickup truck, sports car, sedan, etc. [This picture sums it up](https://i0.wp.com/alabamanewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Canoo_Design_Exterior_Possibilities.jpg?ssl=1) All they have to do is the design work, slap it on the skateboard, and run some tests.\n\nTheir **Subscription Based Model** makes electric cars available to a a whole new market. This includes people who don't want to fully buy/own a car. The monthly fee covers literally everything so it's perfect for them. It includes people who can't afford to buy an electric car. The subscription model lowers the price of owning an EV, making it accessible to more customers. And then since it's easier for them to make new models, they may be the first to put an electric delivery van or pickup truck on the market. This would attract a TON of retail businesses/people.\n\nNow the rest is **Purely Speculative** but there are plenty of potential deals that may arise that make a lot of sense. The most being an **Uber** or Lyft deal. The subscription model makes Canoo vehicles perfect for Uber drivers. No gas expense, no maintenance fee, won't have to dirty your own car, etc. And Uber could then play this up in advertising by saying many of their drivers \"drive electric\".\n\nThis is another popular one but a shot in the dark. **Apple** has been wanting to get into the EV game for awhile. Canoo would be the perfect target for an investment. An innovative product that rethinks how vehicles are traditionally made and sold. It's not like Apple has ever made anything like that before...........\n\n**The Stock Itself:**\n\nCanoo has largely been under the radar until the past week or so. They have a lot of good things happening this month, which could serve as major catalysts. They're unveiling their delivery van on December 17th, voting on the merger on the 21st, and who knows what else might happen. Canoo is being valuated at $2.4 billion through this merger, which is criminally low. The only way I see this company going is up from here on out.\n\n[Watch this is you want to feel as confident as I am in this company](https://youtu.be/9F_W8pev4XQ)\n\nTLDR; Shares, Warrants, Calls. They all go.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that they have an engineering contract with Hyundai and Kia to help them develop a skateboard for their Electric line of cars.
