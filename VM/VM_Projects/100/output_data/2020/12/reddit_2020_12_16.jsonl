That model just makes more sense for them. \n\nIf they tried to go completely independent, who would provide the care on the other end of the telehealth? Apple would need a team doctors and nurses. They are then a healthcare provider. That means they need to partner with payers directly. But why would insurance companies want to pay for Apple\u2019s service when their existing provider network already offers telehealth? Would Apple have access to the patients health information from hospital visits? Clinic visits? Lab tests, med lists, allergies, etc? They would need to partner with the patients main healthcare provider to get this information. Now multiply that by hundreds or thousands of independent networks across the states. Or would Apple open their own hospital system? Just in one state? Or across the states? That would take years. Maybe they could tap into an existing network, like CareEverywhere, but that would require not only approval from Epic but also the board of CareEverywhere, which is led by providers from the whale organizations. They don\u2019t trust tech companies. At all. \n\nBasically, under the current US healthcare system, because of insurance networks, interoperability, differing laws across states, and a number of other nuanced hurdles, large healthcare organizations who do it all have an advantage over small networks. That\u2019s why there\u2019s been so much consolidation in the healthcare space in the past 20 years. \n\nNow TDOC is facing many of these obstacles as well. They\u2019re going to provide their own services and will try and compete with the whales. Their only advantage is that they are lean enough that they might be able to partner with the remaining orgs that cannot afford Epic/Cerner. Those orgs still need to offer telehealth to compete with the whales. There\u2019s a market there but it must be a better experience than Epic/Cerner to maintain customers. TDOC is currently offering the better experience, so they are on the right track. So it\u2019s like a niche service that might cost more but is a better experience for the patient. \n\nOr.. Apple could provide a service if they had their own payer network. That\u2019s what Amazon is doing. That\u2019s what CVS is doing with Aetna. They provide telehealth to their own patients. But still.. you\u2019re competing against giants here. \n\nBottom line is that there\u2019s more money to be made for Apple if they partner with the existing structure than trying to disrupt it. \n\nThat being said, if we get Medicare for all or single payer, then the whole model implodes and it would allow for smaller orgs to offer more innovative services as long as they can get approved by the gov.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think I get what you are saying.

{"title": "Don't Touch $SPCE", "selftext": "Good evening, everyone! I know we're in a little bit of a milieu this week, between the Palantir and GameStop hype these last few weeks and the $MT steel stonk parade we're going to be seeing starting next week. I figured I'd take this time to talk about everyone's good friend Virgin Galactic\n\nNow, I know. The stock's down a quarter after their test fiasco. But what's the long-term outlook? Is it going to the moon, and then back again in time to get the latest billionaire back for chicken tendie lunch? Or will it go tits-up and crash into the Mojave Desert? I suspect the latter. Here's why:\n\n1. **The market is very niche.** There's 2,095 billionaires, according to [the first thing on Google](https://howmuch.net/articles/world-map-of-billionaires-2020), and 46.8 million millionaires [according to ABC.](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/half-worlds-entire-wealth-hands-millionaires/story?id=66440320). So, seems like a pretty big market right?\n\nWell, maybe. But maybe not. The initial price for a ticket was $250,000 per seat. That's a lot of money to have in cash. A lot to blow on a fun afternoon sight-seeing flight, and I really doubt most millionaires will have that to spend. So I'm going to make a really unscientific guesstimate and strike that number down by 3/4. So we're down to a market audience of about 12 million.\n\nNext, we'll have to ask ourselves: who really wants to go to space? I do, but I don't have a quarter of a million dollars lying around. Google showed 400 people have pre-ordered tickets, but that only required a $1,000 deposit, and that's about as reliable a metric as the 14,000 people who ordered the Nikola Badger. These are early adopters, sure, but space operations need revenue and revenue requires a large market.\n\n2. **Okay (for) Boomers?** of our millionaire and billionaire market, 99% are over 35. The average age for a millionaire is 62, and of course greater wealth skews older. The average billionaire is 65. Now, the oldest person in space was 77, so these guys should be okay right? Well, that 77 year old was Sen. John Glenn, former Marine fighter pilot and first American to orbit the Earth.  Probably better shape than most of his peers and he was just along for the ride when he went up at 77.  Nasa astronauts generally max out at about 46 years old. If you're just a tourist and you're not going to touch anything, you can definitely go older, but how much older?\n\nAre you going to risk a 65 year-old, in average health? How about a 75 year-old? Or someone in poor health? What's the chance some old guy dies from a heart attack right as you reach the exosphere? Does VG have insurance for the oncoming lawsuit? How much does this eat into profits? If higher insurance rates jack up the price, how much does that reduce the market size?\n\nOr say it's not safe, for at least a while, for the average >65 year old to go into space. Is VG going to cut over half their market, or are they going to pay way higher insurance premiums and suffer ensuing lower margins for these people?\n\n3. **Perception** Branson isn't Musk.  He doesn't have the charisma, the sympathetic vision, or the memes. He's like Daniel Boone's less successful cousin Cleetus, who'd follow behind on blazed trails, getting the stumps out. People will be less excited by his successes, less forgiving of failures. And failures, with crewed aircraft,, are going to kill confidence. VG can't exactly re-enact that [SpaceX falcon crash montage](https://youtu.be/bvim4rsNHkQ) when every shot potentially results in the death of 8 people.\n\n4. **Volatility** Imagine getting your entire call portfolio chewed up by IV. Yuck. But we're going to see a pattern with this stock: it shoots up before a test and crashes afterwards. A catastrophic failure will tank it. Can try to time shares, and just go for short-term gains, but the whole stock is at the mercy of the weather. Sure you can hold long, but as I said I don't see much of a future for this company.\n\n5. **Disappointment in WSB** as far as I've seen, nobody's even said *$SPCE Jam* yet. Frankly I should've put this first, it's the inspiration for this whole post.\n\nSo that's my opinion, feel free to comment and tell me how I'm wrong, I'll appreciate it.\n\n**Positions:** \nnone, that was the whole point;\n15 pride flags and a copy of *The Bear Almanac* on order from Amazon", "id": "kdzxx4", "created_utc": 1608084342.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "I bought my first option ever a few days ago...

According to TechCrunch it takes about 8 weeks to refurbish a Falcoln 9 booster. Let's cut the hypothetical refurbish time in half, say they got some really fine-tuned procedures going. 4 weeks. We're at a month between each plane's flight. Keeping that 5,100 passenger number for consistency sake, that's still a minimum fleet of 70 planes, without accounting for spares and stand-ins when repairs take longer than 4 weeks.\n\nEvery year each of those planes will make about $18,000,000 in revenue. How does that stack up to, say, an airliner? I crunched some numbers:\n\nAverage profit per passenger is $19.65, or a 9% profit margin. So i did 19.65/.09 to find an average revenue of $216.33 per passenger.\n\nLet's say you have a 737, that seats 189 people. That means the average flight makes $41,265 (rounded) per flight, and assuming 3 flights per day, 6 days per week, we get (41265\u00d73)\u00d7[(365)\u00d7(6/7)]=123,795\u00d7312.857= 38,730,150\n\n$38,730,150 in revenue per year, for a plane that brand new would cost about $90,000,000 meaning it would be paid off in it's third year, before factoring in maintenance costs.\n\nI don't see the VG ships being cheaper than a commercial 737, even with Boeing's markups.

Most of his networth is tied to PLTR. He is the head of the PayPal mafia and really people he has backed formed the back of Silicon Valley post google.\n\nHe loves to provoke controversy by paying kids to drop out of college to start businesses. He promotes seasteading and anti aging research. So why does this matter. Well his ventures funds are all usually 10x oversubscribed so yes it\u2019s nearly impossible to invest into him even if you have billions of dollars. Yes you can throw billions of dollars at him and he won\u2019t take your money. \n\nBut by buying palantir you are literally replicating the same portfolio positioning as the smartest ventures capitalist in the world. The man who foresaw the rise of Facebook, the man who is best buds with Elon musk (backed Tesla and Space X, they actually both nearly died in a car accident in Elon\u2019s Mclaren F1). This man does not fuck around (even if he does fuck other men).  \n\nAnd on top of that his money is directly used to save the world from a mimetic apocalypse brought about by zero sum completion. The man is literally doing it out of Christian duty to save the world.\n\nhttps://www.city-journal.org/peter-thiel\n\nLook, if you don\u2019t give this man more money we will all be living in some sort of dystopia, be it totalitarian AI, matrix, post nuclear war road warrior, factional sectarian violence ala reformations 2.0 or the purge where antifa and militias battle it out on the streets.
