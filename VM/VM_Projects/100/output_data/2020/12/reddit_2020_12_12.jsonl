{"title": "Making money off this AAPL leap", "selftext": "Made a pretty big move last week that I already kind of regret. I dropped about 48k into AAPL Jan 2022 leaps. I like to buy ITM to lessen theta, but should have thought more about the break even price of $140. Over the past week I've had less and less confidence in this play. I've started to think AAPL is overvalued, and even if good news does continue to come out, it's already a 2.1 trillion dollar company. What's left to catalyze this stock to a bigger market cap? \n\nThen you have the vaccine. Money will surely be taken out of tech stocks like Apple and allocated into beat down stocks. I should have thought about this play harder. What's your take on it?\n\nAlso, I'm thinking about selling some weekly calls against it, but can't decide if I should just abandon the position. Would appreciate some others' insight here.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6aVtUsj](https://imgur.com/a/6aVtUsj)", "id": "kbpbvq", "created_utc": 1607780703.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "Since you posted this on r/options Im less inclined to troll you.

However, if you can learn the fundamentals of the market in which a security trades, and the catalysts for demand, then when exogenous forces, for example trillions of dollars given to insurance co\u2019s, money managers, banks etc., one can project with reasonable certainty that a security\u2019s price will move in the direction towards a strike. \n\nI\u2019m 26 and by most standards \u201cpoor\u201d, so I\u2019m interested in your active management system...

This is because one the premiums are relatively higher and two you can aim your strikes better. Sounds like a no brainer right? Wrong. Most people go for monthlies or quarterlies. Makes no sense to me but hey, what do I know. \n\nBasically I find stocks I wouldn\u2019t mind owning. I then short a put or call option (so cash secured put or covered call) for the premium, with strikes usually ATM or slightly OTM if I\u2019m a little bearish for puts or bullish for calls. I never sell or let my stock get assigned below the purchase/assignment price. So basically I\u2019m okay with breaking even on the stock or profiting, and meanwhile writing options on it the whole time. \n\nSome people call it the wheel but the wheel has a lot of rules that I think are bullshit. For one, never judge a trade by its expiration. If I sell a put at 40 and it finishes at 38 for the week, I turn around and sell calls until it hits or surpasses 40 again. Therefore I never lose. Even if it takes months or even years. It\u2019s all about patience. But in the meantime, no matter what I\u2019m making money. \n\nOther dumb rules are avoid earnings and volatility, and stuff like that. Being afraid of movement is like being afraid of the thing you\u2019re trying to do. \n\nIt\u2019s somewhat of an art form. But that\u2019s the gist. I do this in my Roth because it\u2019s tax free.

But it\u2019s just down and costing me in opportunity. So I just waited until I broke even in total, meaning premium total minus loss on the underlying equity.

Some of the quality issues are things that Tesla catches and fixes (rework) before they deliver the vehicles. Some are things that the customer complains about and Tesla fixes under warranty. Some are cosmetic issues such as uneven panel gaps, which bother some customers while others others don't care or don't care much. And of course some are unfixable problems (lemon laws) or a fix doesn't become available until sometime later.\n\nAccording to recent reports, in the US the Model Y (considerably younger and with more quality issues than Model 3) is already outselling Model 3. It's fairly widely known that the quality issues are more common for the Y but customers are still clamoring for Model Y. Some customers always wait a while when a new model comes out, and they will push demand even higher later on. It appears that in general Tesla customers are pushing more for new features and greater quantity than for insistence on complete perfection.\n\nThe recent Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey bears this out - even though customers reported relatively high rates of quality issues, Teslas got high customer satisfaction ratings compared to other brands.\n\n> the GP was clearly saying that standards shouldn't be lowered to hit speculator targets based on this email\n\nAgree that Tesla should continue to work hard on quality, which they have been doing. The Model 3 production in Shanghai has reportedly been producing very high quality vehicles, and the Fremont factory has significantly improved its Model 3 quality. I expect that the new Model Y lines in Shanghai, Berlin, and Texas will produce significantly higher quality vehicles than current Fremont Model Y production.\n\nBut what Elon is saying is that at this moment in time, high volume of production is particularly urgent. \n\nYour words seem to indicate that you think the current quality issue rate is fine - just don't let it get any worse. But do you really feel that way? Or would you prefer for Tesla to make quality the top priority? They could do that, but production volume would suffer. I believe that for non-safety-related issues, it's reasonable to have a balance between quality issues and production volume, and what Elon is describing appears to be consistent with what the current customers want.\n\nAnd as I mentioned above, I believe that Tesla quality will continue to improve (other than temporary spikes in quality issues as new models are introduced).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Is that why demand is so low, as Elon has been complaining about? ;-)\n\nThis is a stupid way to look at it.

Also, by the end of February around 30% of the population (around 100 million) will have already had Covid-19 and so have some natural immunity.  This 30% figure assumes we continue to have the same rate of infection, about 17 million per month, through February \\[1\\]. If you don't believe infection confers immunity you are retarded.  By March 145 million total should be protected (assuming 30% of the people receiving the vaccine have been infected previously).\n\nBy March we should be damn close to herd immunity.  This doesn't count potential vaccine supplies from Johnson & Johnson (should have results in January) and AstraZeneca (which had questionable results).  But this also assumes no new manufacturing issues (we already see Pfizer having some issues).\n\nWhy do folks say things won't get back to \"normal\" until June or later of next year?
