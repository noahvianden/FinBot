There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that\u2019s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you\u2019re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the \u201cChewy-fication\u201d of GameStop \u2013 efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.\n\nAnd if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn\u2019t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn\u2019t like Sherman\u2019s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he\u2019s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He\u2019s saying: Don\u2019t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.\n\nAnd the \u201cor else\u201d is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the \u201cor else\u201d is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn\u2019t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman\u2019s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it\u2019s done. He\u2019s got the eye of the tiger, he\u2019s still in that young and crushing it phase. He\u2019s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he\u2019s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He\u2019s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30M. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.\n\nThen take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company\u2014the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!). And he knows that he\u2019s going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \\*him\\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn\u2019t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.\n\nAnd this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen\u2019s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It\u2019s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call \u2013 one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it\u2019s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you\u2019re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?\n\nOr do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don\u2019t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It\u2019s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I\u2019m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman\u2019s incentives \u2013 financial, ego \u2013 point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn\u2019t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that\u2019s coming to him. But even though I\u2019d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I\u2019m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren\u2019t hard see here.  We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits. \n\nThis is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "This just convinced me to load up on more shares\n\nGonna be a hell of a ride, but fuck it, this saga is way too interesting to be on the sidelines", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5308507680892944}, {"body": "Holy crap you wrote a lot.

{"title": "GME Q3 Call Thoughts on the clash between Cohen and Sherman [Insert Rocket Emoji Here]", "selftext": "I posted this on stocktwits and in another comment thread, but given the feedback I've received, I thought I would create a new post to let this august community think Deep Thoughts about all of this as we approach the moment of truth.  I'm not a social media guy so I usually don't get how all this shit works - just a 40-year-old lawyer who hates his job and sees a ticket out.  Do your own DD and figure your own shit out.  But the time is drawing nigh here for GME.\n\nI know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. \n\nBut first take Cohen. \n\nBoy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.\n\nAnd then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen\u2019s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that\u2019s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you\u2019re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the \u201cChewy-fication\u201d of GameStop \u2013 efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.\n\nAnd if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn\u2019t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn\u2019t like Sherman\u2019s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he\u2019s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He\u2019s saying: Don\u2019t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.\n\nAnd the \u201cor else\u201d is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the \u201cor else\u201d is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn\u2019t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman\u2019s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it\u2019s done. He\u2019s got the eye of the tiger, he\u2019s still in that young and crushing it phase. He\u2019s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he\u2019s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He\u2019s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30B. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.\n\nThen take Sherman. \n\nDude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company\u2014the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!) this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \\*him\\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn\u2019t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.\n\nAnd this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen\u2019s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It\u2019s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call \u2013 one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it\u2019s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you\u2019re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?\n\nOr do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don\u2019t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It\u2019s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I\u2019m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman\u2019s incentives \u2013 financial, ego \u2013 point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn\u2019t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that\u2019s coming to him. But even though I\u2019d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I\u2019m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren\u2019t hard see here. We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.\n\nThis is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.\n\nEDIT:  After that call and the shelf, Sherman clearly deserves none of the credit I gave him here.  The company is solid and will be fine and everyone with shares and April calls should be AOK.  Lots of positive stuff.  But Sherman miscalculated horribly with the shelf.  Cohen is going to rip Sherman's fucking heart out and make him watch, Temple of Doom Style.  This is when things start to get interesting.\n\nEDIT 2:  In light of recent events, I would like to amend my last two paragraphs.  I will leave the first three sentences and then conclude with the amount of credit I should have given this greedy shortsighted, dumbfuck Boomer.\n\n\"And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen\u2019s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has.  So Sherman decides that instead of carefully considering Cohen's critiques and then bolstering his case to lead this company by buying back shares (as authorized) or giving better guidance on Q4 to possibly raise the share price and even trigger a short squeeze, delighting shareholders far and wide and even making them feel a sense of loyalty to him for it, Sherman goes for the all-too-perfect encapsulation of a Baby Boomer move: he protects himself with a totally needless shelf registration that is a transparent, weak-ass poison pill.  But one that threatens to destroy shareholder value and let the shorts off the hook should an activist investor try to get a little too cute with their operations.  Using us, the shareholders, as pawns in any possible proxy fight.  Because Fuck You, I'm George Fucking Sherman.  You'll get your Q4 numbers and I'll get my bonus and you can fuck right off.\n\nWe should all be outraged at how this was handled.  And I can guarantee you that if Cohen was contemplating a takeover or a total removal of the Board, this couldn't have gone any better for him.  The fear was likely that Sherman crushes it and we all shout the name Sherman! Sherman! from the rafters (not you Georgians probably) in exultation at our good fortune.  A shelf registration and an after hours drop in price of 17%??  Chris Davis, Cohen's attorney, must be shitting himself at his good fortune.  If Cohen moves, he is going to move quickly on this - possibly even tomorrow if the price really gets hammered.  Wishful thinking?  Yeah, possibly.  But if I had the ability to call a vote on replacement of the Board and knew that could likely trigger a massive short squeeze for a stock I own nearly 10% of?  I'd consider doing that.  Very much so.  And if I wanted to replace an inept Board and CEO, would I want him to do something that is transparently selfish and possibly destroys shareholder value?  Yeah, I fucking would.  And I would have a much easier time doing it right after almost every shareholder heard that call and thought: Fuck this Sherman guy.

If you see an activist take a synthetic long, then you know the target is shorter term. \n\nI\u2019d basically call this a thesis breaker. We now know that the CEO has full board support.

CEO/boards *absolutely* take activists seriously, but you have to have *earn* it and that takes years and a couple of big wins (see Icahn, Greenlight, Starboard, 3rd Pt, etc) before you have the cred to be taken seriously. \n\nStarboard v Darden like 7yrs ago was a good example. Prior to that campaign, nobody outside the industry had heard of starboard but they were very successful with targeted transactional campaigns. When they approached Darden, they got rebuffed. Starboard then launched a very noisy, long and dedicated public campaign that took like 12-18mo from beginning to end (the public part was a little shorter). Eventually Starboard \u2018won\u2019 and Darden semi-capitulated.

To buy the company next week, it\u2019d cost about $1.25B to $1.4B all in. Cohen might just write a check but that appears that would be (more than) all of his money. So he has to finance it. \n\nNow this is an area I know *really* well. In this market and this space, creditors would only loan a small amount (say ~$800m vs $600M of equity) bc this is a dying retailer, in a dying space (mall retail), that isn\u2019t flowing cash (for now), and when it does flow cash it\u2019s not a ton (low margin business and margins are going the wrong way)....I can keep going. You just can\u2019t arrange financing like that right now. If you could, you wouldn\u2019t see all these retailers being pushed into Ch11 and ch7 bc they could just refi way out past coronavirus - but they can\u2019t. \n\nImagine if that was a person (low-paying, shitty job in a bad field, no transferable skills and their employer is publicly saying \u2018we are gonna lay off a ton of ppl\u2019) - would you loan that person a *HUGE* sum of money? Of course not, and neither would a person like me (or a bank).\n\nAdd to that, cohens strategy: throwaway all the physical and intangible assets in an effort to go purely online. Well, those assets were gonna be the stuff that secures the debt.....but he wants to throw it away. So I can\u2019t really imagine a leveraged deal structure that works here. Bad strategy for a takeover bid. \n\nIn the end, all these retailers end up getting liquidated and the only \u2018value\u2019 in the end (besides inventories and stuff) are the brand names. There been a pretty active market for legacy brand names; Ascena just sold a bunch in Ch7 a few weeks back. I\u2019d bet that \u2018Gamestop\u2019 is worth $30M *TOPS* and probably less. \n\nThat name is the core legacy asset, particularly if the strategy is \u2018go pure online\u2019. So the question is, why would Cohen spend a huge sum of money ($1.2B to $1.4B depending) to buy an asset worth $30M? Maybe if and only if he\u2019s fucking insane - but that\u2019s not a great long thesis. \n\nAnd lastly to his thesis: Cohen is absolutely right that the future of gaming is strictly digital. He\u2019s also retarded if he thinks a legacy mall-based retailer can develop that platform. Reddit loves to post \u2018TIL Blockbuster turned down the oppy to buy NFLX for $50M in 2003 - lolololol they were dumb.\u2019 This is always a dumb take bc *blockbuster would have straight up killed netflix* - probably on accident or via innocent incompetence - but they would have killed it. And they would have killed it bc physical retailers CANNOT run a cutting edge tech platform. I can\u2019t even think of a legacy retailer that\u2019s developed a strong tech platform; not even Walmart and they have more cash than god. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. \n\nIf Cohen wants to find the next big thing, put $1B into developing the platform and buy the \u2018gamestop\u2019 name out of bankruptcy.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your thoughts, man.

You don\u2019t just blow in like the Kool-Aid man and expect to shake things up.

Those pg1 holders would have *never* agreed to the issuance if they were *also* going to fire the senior management team and (essentially) replace the whole company. \n\nCohen might try to force the issue bc he\u2019s 1) already in the black, and 2) he\u2019s trying to develop a reputation, and 3 he\u2019s probably more than a little pissed about what happened tonight.

And now the Board and Sherman have made their moves too.  I'm pretty shocked that with a short interest above 100% and some long suffering shareholders (not me, I just got in in late Oct) that they prioritized a shelf offering announcement now over, say, a nominal buyback, when that could have really put the heat on the short sellers and created some upward momentum so if they really needed to issue the shelf, it wouldn't sting as much.  And also: there was a lot of good stuff that was said on that call.  But all the oxygen was sucked out of the air because of the shelf.  And the AH price reflects that.
