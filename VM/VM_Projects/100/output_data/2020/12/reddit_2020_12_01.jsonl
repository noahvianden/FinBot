{"title": "My portfolio is currently 43% in cash. Where should I put it?", "selftext": "I came in to some money in September and have it in a brokerage account. I have been investing it slowly over the past few months and have already closed a few successful positions for nice gains. (CEQP, MRO, MAXR and WORK). I have not yet invested all the cash. I am interested in both trading plays and Long term investments. I am ahead in each of my 10 current holdings. Here is a breakdown of my current portfolio:\n\nCash - 42.8%\n\nARKQ - 8.5%\n\nARKF - 7.7%\n\nARKG - 6.7%\n\nICLN - 5.9%\n\nRXT - 5.8%\n\nCVS - 5.6%\n\nPACB - 5.2%\n\nRKT - 5.1%\n\nSWCH - 3.9%\n\nACI - 2.7%\n\nThis account is separate from my 401k and my Roth, I also have an online account, but that is only about 20% the size of this new account.\n\nJust looking for opinions from the hivemind. I would be interested in buying some of the big names,, I just like to time my entries. My strategy so far has been to swing some trades to load profits into my etf's. In hindsight, I should have just thrown all the money in at once, but I chose to just drop some in each week. I have been thinking about some metals etf like GLD. I have also given some thought to putting something in UVXY to hedge against a large dip in the market. What else should I be looking at? Thought about jumping into AMZN today as well.\n\nJust looking for ideas....Thanks!", "id": "k49450", "created_utc": 1606781802.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "VTI", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Ignore everyone else trying to pump their investments.

Don\u2019t see that many people with the \u201dboomer\u201d view on this. I think it\u2019s kinda weird considering that you\u2019ll have a much better chance of succeding if you pick market leaders with good and stable growth, revenue, low debt etc. This made it sound really easy, but you get what I mean.\n\nLike, I get it why the companies like PLTR, NIO and SE get a lot more attention, since the biggest and the quickest growth and winnings come from the companies that are new and have a lot of potential, but it still bugs me out that people are doing \u201dinvesting\u201d more and more from a trading stand point rather than the traditional buy and hold strategy. People are lacking patience.\n\nPeople can do whatever they want, but if we forward to 10 years in time, how many of us can actually provide solid returns with the constant buying and selling that can perform better than the S&P 500, so about 10% annually. It\u2019s gonna be real hard with timing the market consistantly. Even picking the right growth stock can be really hard eben though Reddit and the amount of speculation does help a bit with it. There isn\u2019t any guarentees that PLTR can be a blue chip company in 20 years. Sure, there isn\u2019t anything sure about AAPL or MSFT either, but at least they\u2019ve proven they can do it on a solid basis.\n\nDon\u2019t want to be mean or anything, just wondering if it\u2019s really worth trying to time the market if you can get steadier profits from the already existing market leaders. I do enjoy reading newsand staying informed, but IMO it\u2019d be safer just to stick with the blue chips. The point of investing is gaining wealth steadily, not gambling with it, right? The biggest bonus with growth stocks is probably the possibility of getting huge profits in a short term which isn\u2019t a reality with the blue chips. You can still get tons of profits with MSFT, JNJ or AAPL, it\u2019s just that it won\u2019t happen overnight. I think you should have a healthy mix of both market leaders and growth stocks.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say with this.

{"title": "Nio stock gets upgrade at Goldman Sachs", "selftext": "\u2018In hindsight, we underestimated\u2019 Nio, Goldman Sachs says\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts flipped their stance on Nio Inc., saying that in hindsight they underestimated the benefits that the Chinese electric-vehicle maker would get from breakthroughs such as its battery-swap idea.\n\nThe analysts, led by Fei Fang, upgraded Nio\u2019s NIO stock to the equivalent of hold, from sell, saying in a note Tuesday that when they tacked on their sell rating in July they did so on valuation. They believed that \u201cthe share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s changed? Mostly, Nio unveiled its battery-as-a-service program, expanding its market. Most households in China lack conditions to install private chargers, especially outside of main cities, Goldman said.\n\nThe analysts also upped their 12-month target price on Nio\u2019s American depositary receipts to $59.00 from $7.70.\n\nNio launched its battery-as-a-service program in August; service users purchase a Nio car without the battery, \u201cmaking it more price competitive against existing powertrains, while also providing the flexibility to change battery capacity depending on their needs,\u201d the Goldman analysts said.\n\nExisting public charging stalls are often busy, but within \u201c10 minutes, Nio car owners can swap their depleted battery with a fully charged one, which is much more time efficient than the fast charger stall that requires around 2.5 hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, (battery-as-a-service) also represents a systematic solution to the long-existing challenges for EV penetration, including battery degradation, battery upgradability, and lower resale value,\u201d they said.\n\nNio\u2019s ADRs have gained nearly 1,100% this year, compared with gains around 13% for the S&P 500 index. SPX The average rating on Nio of the 13 analysts polled by FactSet is the equivalent of buy, and the average price target on the ADRs is $42.18, representing an 11% downside from Tuesday\u2019s prices.\n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nio-stock-gets-upgrade-at-goldman-sachs-11606844454)", "id": "k4rvp7", "created_utc": 1606850375.0, "score": 1129, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "I mean they changed it from $7.70 so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into this, basically just updating their price which was clearly way behind the times.", "score": 391, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck these fucking banks and analysts, it's all just legalized pump and dumping because rich people rarely face the music", "score": 152, "replies": [{"body": "Reminds me of the movie Margin Call.

As you said, they are massive, and if they need to buy/sell, they can\u2019t just decide to click the buy/sell button like we as retail traders do (unless they intend to drive the prices up/down on themselves).

Institutions/funds are also trying to one-up each other as well, not just retail, but that\u2019s a different game between the big guys. Wall Street is a dog eat dog business, that\u2019s a well known fact and I don\u2019t feel anyone should feel the need to sugarcoat it.

The company also embarked on a makeover of its paint facilities, which are part of its U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California.\n\n\"Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!\" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.\n\nElectric vehicle news site Electrek previously reported the contents of Musk's email.\n\nIn early 2020, amid sluggish auto sales the world over, Tesla cut some employees' pay temporarily, slashed contracts with temporary workers and fired an undisclosed number of workers after an annual performance review process. It has since rehired contractors and restored employee pay.\n\nThe Tuesday e-mail echoes previous statements by Musk but does not specify how Tesla plans to mind its budget.\n\nOn the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts and shareholders, \"We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it.\"\n\nBut on that same call, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said Tesla plans to ramp up its capital expenditures by $2 billion versus its prior stated plans to $2.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. Among other things, he said, the increased spending would enable Tesla to \"in-source\" things like some of its battery cell manufacturing.\n\nTesla raised $5 billion in September through an equity raise but needs to pay down about $1 billion in this, its fourth, quarter related to converts.\n\nShares of Tesla were trading above $580 ahead of the market's close on Tuesday.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/elon-musk-warns-tesla-employees-stock-could-get-crushed-like-a-souffle-if-company-doesnt-ac.html)", "id": "k4uytz", "created_utc": 1606859277.0, "score": 637, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "I am guessing he is trying to find a leaker.
