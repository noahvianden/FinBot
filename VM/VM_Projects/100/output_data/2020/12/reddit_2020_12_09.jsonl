I decided to focus almost exclusively on selling options during 2020 to see how it went. I\u2019d say it was a worthwhile experiment, but for many reasons it showed me that active trading like this is a poor use of time and resources.\n\n___\n\nUPDATE Dec 22: currently at $280k in my account, mostly from selling CSP on ABNB at the right times and riding volatility and volume on it. So that gets me closer to $150k in gains for the year, with about $32k in total commissions and fees, so net ~$120k.\n\nI also forgot to mention that I took a $37k @ 0% interest cash advance on a credit card to juice my buying power, so that means my ROI is even sweeter, at around $120k on $210k, or 57%. Not so bad after all.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nCanuck here, so no RH equivalent for free trades.\n\nI use questrade and have been meaning to switch to interactive brokers for months, but kept telling myself \u201cI can\u2019t take a break for even a week, I\u2019ll miss out\u201d.\n\nWell after looking more carefully at my October statement, I\u2019m mad at myself and ready to miss out for a week while things get transferred over.\n\nMy gains would have been far more impressive but I fomo\u2019d into a pltr trade 2 weeks ago and lost $24k (I ask for neither pity nor scorn), and I\u2019ve had a few massive losers since July, missing any one of which would have had my account an extra $100k higher.\n\n___\n\nEdit to add account value for context:\n\nI started the year with about $95k in the account and deposited about $150k over the year, for $245k in contributions (the majority of that was added in June/July after big losses).\n\nI\u2019ve withdrawn $80k, paid $30k in fees, and have $210k in the account as of today.\nSo that\u2019s around $75k of gains before fees.\n\nFees (as of November) were 40% of gains. That\u2019s appalling.\nReturn before fees of 30% is pretty good, but net of fees is barely more than 18%. Also kind of appalling, considering all of the work and stress.\n\nHad I just held my goddamn tech leaps I\u2019d be up 200-400% for the year, easily.\nI\u2019d say that pursuing theta and wheeling was a mistake for me.\n\nIf even just one of the massive losses I took hadn\u2019t happened (between $60k-115k each on zs, MSFT, dkng, pltr) then things turn around significantly and maybe it would have been worthwhile.", "id": "k9kt2a", "created_utc": 1607487590.0, "score": 147, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "This thread is making me realize how much I've been taking commission-free trading for granted.

{"title": "Michel Burry Short On TSLA", "selftext": "***Michel Burry Short Position***\n\nOn **$TSLA**\n\nAs we all already know the news on shorting TSLA by Michel Burry came out Dec 3, 2020\n\nFrom his standpoint on the position, the argument is that the price of TSLA is overvalued and there should be a correction made in the market. The profitability of TSLA and the rate of expected profitability is high but however, they are not on the rate of profitability for their projected Q1-Q2.\n\nHe showed on his tweet about the trade; The total Revenue, Market Capitalization, and EBIT of 32 companies in the auto sector and compared them to TSLA. It shows us that TSLA is underperforming and is in fact overvalued.\n\nI will now go in-depth of my review of TSLA and break the companies performance using multiple financial benchmarks.\n\nIn this review I will use companies in the auto sector, TSLA\u2019s direct competition and EV ETF\u2019s I will, however, account for the future probability of the company since I think that it has high importance.\n\nBellow are key benchmarks shown: ( total Revenue, Market Cap, And Ebit)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xd9g29de3461.jpg?width=1815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80a05b1a18c5d96795caa2cc5ffdac0e57e405f4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this spreadsheet, we can see the comparison between the total  (Revenue/Market Cap/Ebit) of the whole auto sector. and in compression to TSLA.  From this, we can determine that tesla in Market Cap alone beats all other Auto manufacturers.  Their EBIT this year is about 1.7 Billion to the 40 Billion total. But does the company truly have the potential and the value that it is at?\n\n***Bellow, I will add more benchmarks to TSLA compared to the industry to see the true value in the company and its financials and external sources of value to TSLA that would make this trade go in the wrong direction.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v48shyje3461.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a1038c71293b90ca474810c614651038aec6e30\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look purply at the (share price) we clearly see the massive 867% yearly gain on TSLA. However, if we look at the metrics where the company excelled in would be P/E, Price/Book.\n\nWhere the problem is would be the profit margins. Both EPS and EBIT metrics are low for the value of the company.  That is the main problem of the overvaluation of TSLA is that they don't make enough profit to validate their share price. We can say that the future value is there however in the short term the price is moving in a way that would indicate to us a bubble. And a correction that should affect the price of the stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8bdwsdmle3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1e57b3f2277c41f216b8e29a3d46aff1a4ce1b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere I demonstrate mixed metrics on all the 32 companies in the auto sector. To show how TSLA is underperforming in most of the benchmarks. This is to show where the company has overvalued and how.\n\n* MKT cap ($616b)\n* Accounts payable turnover:  ( The accounts payable turnover ratio is a short term measure used to quantify the rate at which a company pays off its suppliers. Accounts payable turnover shows how many times a company pays off its accounts payable during a period.)       -Here TSLA has a rate of 5.43 that states to us; they are taking time to pay to their creditors and compared to other companies in the auto sector are underperforming in this benchmark.\n* Profit Margin: -2.56% of the cost of production exceeds total sales. TSLA has more costs than they are able to cover by their profit. Other companies that have a negative profit margin in the sector all have a share price lower than their valuation.\n* Gross profit: $4.07B where the value is $616B this indicator alone shows us that the company is way overvalued. We can argue that they are in the Tech sector more than in manufacture or cars. But however, their model of operations demonstrate to us that they are heavily weighted on that side of the business and not tech.\n* Supply chain revenue: 0.19% this benchmark demonstrates that they are not generating enough revenue from their supply chain operations.\n* Inventory days: ( how many days on average does it take to take 'product to market') 59.3 days Higher than the average of the auto sector.\n* Inventory growth: 14.09 in the past 12M\n* ROA: -1.96% losing money on their return on assets.\n\nAnalyst Predictions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uc8x2ydne3461.jpg?width=1749&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1befc6f8f9915bd8660e7933183c006110d6b2f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe average target price of TSLA is **$375** however there are indeed more buy signals at 35.9%\n\nBut Burry's target price would be around $300-$350\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0ta8j8oe3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4b82d8668e7a8364b80bb61da96202bd0773d19\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVerdict:  Based on the financials it is overvalued \n\n'Options'\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3k0fnr3re3461.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42b16c2166724ef88aeb9d3f5ddbd5bdf618bb9c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe level of puts on open interest is increasing in the market this would indicate that Bearish volumes in the market on TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5tyx8xre3461.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce5536d5244900e9e888f2a06dbf9488ec0b7e28\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ1 of 2021 shows us the options volumes where the market is pumping more volume in the lower level of the stock price.\n\nI strongly agree with the numbers and that this stock is overvalued but has a lot of extrinsic potential and value in the future, but there should be a market correction that would take place and we can profit from this move. TSLA is a great company and has a bright history but at the levels, it is at now. I personally do not see it going higher.

However, if the price is then $750 and the drop is to $525, then the person shorting is screwed on those positions. So it is very difficult to short ahead of time.

It is like valuing a new house based on a slew of houses that need serious remodeling or will be torn down. Overall, the industry is going to be shedding ICE related assets and will be cell constrained going forward. So likely the overall auto market shrinks while the EV specific market grows dramatically. Tesla is the leader in the disruption and is a pure play without any legacy distractions. On top of that, Tesla is really an automaker, plus dealer, plus solar module maker, plus solar installer, plus utility scale and residential stationary storage vendor. You have to add all of that together even though automotive revenues currently dominate. That won\u2019t be the case going forward.\n\nFinally, their Autopilot software has built up quite a large amount of deferred revenue. As they release updates, they recognize more of that revenue which is basically near 100% margin. That can blow out the current earnings... another perspective is that it re-writes previous margins, which makes your DD blow up.\n\nIt is definitely quite profitable to be a tactical short in TSLA with great timing and more profitable to be a strategic long on TSLA.

If you remember 2014 GoPro was trying to tout thembselves of as a tech company, a social media company, a brand of sorts, and more. I believe they were trying to tell people they were going to also be a drone company. Stonk was soaring. I remember thinking this is just a fucking camera company. All they make is a above average to low premium camera. Why are the large camera companies of the world not crushing them. Well turns out the company was actually valued at around 5 bucks eventually. I believe the same will happen to PTON. It may not go to 5 bucks but I believe it could definitely go to 30-40 dollas by the fibinachi bands. My take is boat loads of people are not going to purchase a 2-4k dollar bike that does not even move. This is during a pandemic where money is supposedly tight. They also have lots of people aggressively fighting for market share aka ... Nordictrack, Mirror thing, Apple, Plain old normal bikes.\n\nI dont see them as a tech company or a social media company. I see them as a fad excercise equimpement. Half of going to the gym is actually going to the gym. Most people never work out as well at home. This bike will be ridden by my fat wife Becky for a few months then after that it will go in the corner. After a few more months I will trip over it and move it to the garage. After a few more months of pay the subsription I will cancel it. After a year or so my wife even fatter than before will now drag the bike out of the garage for a couple weeks and watch spin class from youtube on her ipad or phone. After a few months the bike will go back in the garage where it will stay for another few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; PTON is the shakeweight of stonks. It is a meme in it self.

{"title": "TSLA S&P Purchase Chart - 73B in TSLA purchased around 12/18 - Where will it come from? Is it possible? At what cost?", "selftext": "All funds, ETFs, etc that directly track the S and P have to buy TSLA on or around the 18th. The majority will be purchased directly on the 18th. almost **15% of TSLA Float** will be bought on or around the 18th. Locking it up for as long as it is in the S and P.\n\n**Can They Buy Enough TSLA on 12/18?**\n\nWhen only counting S&P and tracking index funds / ETFs, at current Tesla Price, they are scheduled to purchase **$73 Billion in TSLA.**\n\nThis gets progressively larger, as the price increases.\n\n[TSLA Price Changes Changes S and P inclusion purchasing](https://preview.redd.it/qsv4203674461.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deebe56d8351bcd988ac5698ae07ddf8c86b1d87)\n\nThey have to buy 113+ Million shares, or about **15% of all available shares.**\n\n**How are they going to do it?**\n\n1. **Institutional Investors - 52.96%** [Institutional investors](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&subView=institutional) Hold 402M Shares\n2. **ETFs - 4.6%** \\- 35M Shares. These aren't for sale. Example QQQ owns 10M shares - [165 ETFs that control 17B of TSLA](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA)\n3. **Retail Investors - 42.4% -** The rest I assume.\n\n**What percent of this TSLA can actually be traded on or about the 18th?**\n\n**ETFs can't sell** their shares, they are tracking something, they just can't sell TSLA.\n\nI believe less then **20% of the retail investor shares will be available.** The rest are held by people that won't even log into an investment account on 12/18 or next week at all. Think of retirement funds, long term investors, etc.\n\nThis would mean that **64M** TSLA shares might be available for purchase from retail investors --if the price is right. I don't think these investors are going to liquidate at the current stock price. They are still holding for a reason.\n\nThen there are institutional controlled shares, I believe that a lot of those shares are locked up, think of mutual funds, and investment groups. Baring an emergency they must have meetings and votes on what they trade. It takes weeks or months for many of them to divest in one area and invest in another. They aren't setup to switch strategies at a moments notice, especially for a stock that is having a rally. Also, Think of funds that are filled with just manufacturing or car companies, etc. They won't decide to exclude TSLA for a day / week / month because the price is too high.\n\nSome of the institutional investors have had TSLA for a long time, they have already decided that they want to keep it, and aren't ready to part with it just because it has a high value.\n\nAlso look at Capital Group management and Vanguard Fund, together they control about 10% of TSLA (15% of float) and I'm assuming it is intermixed within many of their combined 170 mutual funds they control. I can't imagine that they can divest TSLA from most of the places they have it stashed on one day. Maybe they already have started, but I doubt it.\n\nI think less then  **40%** of the institutional shares will be available on Dec 18th, I think this would be a very 'high' estimate. I also think that the price would have to be North of 750 for these people to think of liquidating. They have TSLA for a reason, and it has done very well for them, a lot of them sold some shares last quarter, and I bet they regret it now.\n\nThat would mean **161M** Shares might be available from Institutional Investors, if the price goes astronomical.\n\n**225M Shares actually available on 12/18 (Based on my guesses) - THEY NEED 113M+ and the price will be sky high to get that number.**\n\nI think that it would be very expensive to get 113M shares out of the grips of investors. I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before seems unlikely, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**\n\nThere is a speed that this has to be done at as well, Even if only 80% has to be done on the 18th, They have to buy **13.9M+ SHARES ( $9B @ 650) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a ***B******lood Bath***. Yes some funds can invest a few days before, but it's a small percentage of them, and it still doesn't change the fact that between now and then 113M shares minimum need to be locked away.\n\nAlso, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.\n\n**Wildcard 1: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.\n\nI am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.\n\n**Wildcard 2: Options**, What happens if investment firms start buying options just to exercise them and get the shares? Naked Short Calls will be popped at the worst times, causing market orders to be placed and force buying all over the place. There will be margin calls that require short stocks to be covered, etc. I can see chaotic price increases. \n\n**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:** I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.\n\nThe S&P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.\n\n**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?** Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.\n\nTheir biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** \n\n**S and P Benchmarked Funds:** There are another **6.6T** in funds that are **Benchmarked** to the S and P, but they are actively traded, and they aren't going to be required to buy shares on the 18th. Some, are already buying shares, those shares will most likely be unavailable for the 18th. This could easily add another **25M - 50M more shares** to be purchased on or around 12/18.\n\n**One last thing to consider:** Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S.

Market is closed? Sure there are some after-/premarkets, but they trade like 10-50k stocks in total, nowhere near what \"needs to be bought\".\nSo will S&P500 put a purchase order for 100 million stocks (or whatevs) at the opening on monday? For the closing price on friday? What if noone is willing to sell for that price? Will they increase their purchase price? How much? No limit? Say there is only 30 million stocks marked for sale at x, y and z prices. If i were to put my stocks for sale at $2000 a piece, will those also get bought?\n\nOr will it be as OP wrote that under friday the 18th they will purchase 230k stocks every minute for every hour the entire day?

As i said, i'm guessing stock goes up towards inclusion, then some magic happen that i have no clue about how it'll work, and when S&P500 has done their buying everyone and their mother will cash in and sell, causing the stop to drop, followed by the ones that directly/indirectly follows S&P500, but doesnt have to purchase exactly at the 18th/21st, they will buy at this cheap price, causing the stock to go a bit zig-zag for a while and then eventually settling out.\n\nSo $600 today, $700 eow, $800-900+ on thursday, $1000-who the hell knows on friday and/or monday however it works out, and then down again to $400-600-ish.
