This has been talked about here for months now so bear with me as I needed a place to rant.\n\nLike many, I\u2019ve been following most of these EV companies since the summer. I mean who isn\u2019t enticed by seeing people make 300% in a month? It\u2019s completely rationale to want and get in on the action. Hell, I consider myself a conservative investor and even I\u2019ve made money on some of these names so I guess you can call me a hypocrite for even writing this.\n\nAt some point though one has to recognize just how irrational this has become. No revenue until 2025? No problem, here\u2019s a $17 BILLION market cap (talking about you quant scape). Go onto any EV/SPAC forum or Stocktwits and dare to question a valuation or why a stock tripled in a week. Ask about the potential dilution from warrants or PIPE shares set to go out. You\u2019ll likely just get a cocky response about having FOMO. These bulls are getting so caught up in the moment with short term gains, it reminds of those 2 Florida real estate guys from The Big Short:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfu_iFS-UY8\n\nTake PIC for example. Traded around its NAV (basically a price floor before merger) for months before abruptly surging. Nothing has changed about the company -  no new catalysts other than rumors of a potential merger date which is widely expected. What is the rationale for paying double what the company was valued at a couple weeks ago? These SPACs are becoming commodities in a sense that it\u2019s solely supply/demand driven by hype and literally nothing else. \n\nI guess to me the worst part of all this and why it bothers me so much is that 99.9% of the time it will be that average Joe who eventually loses cause they put too much of their savings into a SPAC at $50 after watching some pumper from YouTube who used bright colors and 500% gains In the thumbnail. \n\nYou know who wins 99.9% of the time? Institutions and hedge funds. They are eating this up. Whether it is just shorting these risky stocks or taking advantage of the arb opportunities. I\u2019ve counted 6 recently merged SPACs that have significant spreads between the common stock and warrants. Arbitrageurs are locking in these gains - eventually taking retail money. \n\nI know I sound lame but this EV hype is getting dangerous and people need to be aware of how this will end. Some will make money short term and know when to get out but a lot of ignorant people are going to lose money once the dust settles with all this.\n\nThoughts?", "id": "k77cgs", "created_utc": 1607174374.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "Of course it will end, 90% of these companies have no real value.
