I am not going to post Chinese news article detailing the entire power struggle, just English. I mean, you monkeys can't read moon runes.\n\nYou see, the power struggle has been happening since Alibaba and Jack Ma became the ecommerce god of China, like Jeff \"the bald Grinch\" Bezos did with Amazon in America. China are commies, worshipping anyone but the party is illegal. That is why despite the profits and everything else, they are still sitting at 300+ and not flying like AMZN. Chinese know the power struggles all to well, smart ones will avoid it like plague. Not even Chinese boomers are touching it.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Mystery-video-suggests-power-struggle-in-China\n\nThe previous power struggles resulted in Ma forced out of CEO position in 2018, cue lip service to western friends who don't give a fuck just to make sure BABA don't drop. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/18/alibabas-jack-ma-spent-10-years-preparing-for-his-retirement.html\n\nBut like anyone who had felt the power trip of being the richest and most powerful man before, Ma could not stay retired and out of the limelight for long.\n\nSo he came out of retirement with the biggest fintech IPO in Asia, Ant Group. Now, that really pisses the Emperor off. Recognising his efforts in revolutionalizing ecommerse, Emperor Xi decided to let him spend the rest of his life in retirement... like a charity case. Yet he decides to step in limelight again, and overshadow the most ~~paranoid and insecure~~ powerful man in all of China?! Well Emperor is the party and party is the Emperor, now Emperor finally decides that you must be removed. Especially when they are showing the entire China the power and money capitalism brings. Cue CCP vs CEO power struggle round 2, except this time they are clashing in the open.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power\n\n\"Wait so why western crowds don't know???\"\n\nUh you retards know you don't read right?\n\nSo what happens?\n\nBuy the dip??\n\nCut losses and run???\n\nAnswer is simple:\n\nIf you are holding stocks then just keep holding it.

The dip will not stop until power struggle turmoil is over, it will get even uglier over the months as Politburo falsify more charges to threaten the CEOs to back down.\n\nRecover your call losses with puts, it really is that easy.\n\nI have no options in it because I hate commies and know how they work. So until there is a clear winner in the power struggle, I am not gonna be a bad retard. If you want to listen, cool.
