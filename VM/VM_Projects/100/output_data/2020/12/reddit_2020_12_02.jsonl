{"title": "Taking out Profits and Exit Strategies, a short story (and perhaps some advice)", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nIn the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally. Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's electric vehicles and big data. \"Stonks\" were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness (and an trainee spot at Deutche Bank's analyst desk). My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. Everybody is a genious in a bull market, put some money in to a company in IT and bam! You had LOL GAINS. Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe \"dip\" came. Eli thought \"stonks only go up\" I'm gonna \"buy the dip\". Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an idea that I'm using myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I automatically start scaling back profits\n2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This money has had a ridicoulus payback over the years.\n3. For every 20% growth I take home 20% of the profit, no matter what. For crazy rockets I might take home more, say half the profit of every 20% growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times\n2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%)\n3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I pay off mortgate, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  Its money. I have money so I can spend it, use it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoral of the story. Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6 months. Its not coming back for a while. Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing Q4's and remember its not money until you sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Can't count to 3.", "id": "k5a8ju", "created_utc": 1606919485.0, "score": 395, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "What do you mean by \"after 20% growth you take home 20% profit\"?

But if it's based on the stock price, it would work like the example above.

He sells a partial share worth 20% of his gain in StockX ($40) and is left with $1,160 of StockX.\n\nStockX gains another 20% and is now worth $1,440 per share.

Just to piggyback off your post I\u2019m going to add a handful of mine for people to read and consider.\n\n~No emotion. If I start feeling excited or upset about the price action of a share I close my computer and go get some coffee or do some chores. It\u2019s all Monopoly money until you cash out and emotion has a way of causing you to break rules that you set for specific reasons and that usually doesn\u2019t end well.\n\n~7% stop loss/limit when entering a position. I would rather leave the position with $93 of my original $100 than let it collapse to zero. Stonks don\u2019t always go up and it\u2019s better live to fight another day.\n\n~Once over 7% increase, stop loss/limit moves up to 10-15% depending on my perceived volatility with the historical price action and current events. There needs to be room for natural swings and 7% won\u2019t be enough for normal market movements.\n\n~Do some good with profits.

I know the sub-species of idiots who exist on this sub need to earn some money to later lose on OTM calls for high-risk small cap companies that are at all time highs. I\u2019m here to provide. \n\nThere is no better purchase then Saleforce tomorrow, we are below all moving short &amp; long averages, and we of course have had another unprecedented crash on amazing news. Providing a wonderful opportunity for you idiots to buy in at an absolute low, when the company will be at all time highs within the next two months. \n\nI know some dumb cunts are going to be like \u201cwell their future outlook isn\u2019t looking as good as we wanted\u201d I\u2019m here to tell you that when stocks have been crashing like Paul Walker after beating expectations for no reason, what do you do as a CEO and CFO to attempt to avoid this? You set the bar super fucking LOW to make sure your investors are nothing but happy and stop reducing your companies value by 10% every quarter. It\u2019s like none of you have ever read a book on financial relations or PR.. Oh wait... \n\nBuy the stock or by calls, whatever you want to do, Saleforce will absolutely make you money this month. Merry Christmas assholes.\n\nEDIT: Well boys and girls if you got in early this morning; Christmas came fucking early.\n\nEDIT 2: Position adjustment: Day traded 12/31 250C for roughly 50% gain. Due to larger sell off then anticipated adjusted the Strike to 12/31 240C. \n\nThere also seems to be a misconception about what I expect to gain from these contracts, and I need to make sure that everyone understands I do not chase 4000% gains. I\u2019m not betting on CRM going to 300 by the end of December. \n\nWhen it comes to making money with bullish OTM positions the question is simple: Will the stock price rise enough, and at a high enough ROC (Average ROC presented with IV) to overcome the loss of speculative value, or Theta from its current position? When I release free money alerts I\u2019m telling you that within the expiration date this will occur. Whether you want to hold and hope that it continues is fully up to you. In other words I\u2019m happy to tell you what to buy, but I won\u2019t tell you when to take profit. \n\nIn other words people, don\u2019t get greedy and bag-hold your fucking calls over the next month if you have OTM\u2019s. Take advantage of the oversell on the bounce back and get out. You don\u2019t buy OTM hoping for real value by the time they expire you buy them to sell on the one big day it bounces back.", "id": "k50ckv", "created_utc": 1606876663.0, "score": 136, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks! buying more PLTR", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "I like PLTR between 15-18.", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "I like your mom between buttered bread", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Ya\u2019ll are like radical feminists, stocks are always sinusoidal.
