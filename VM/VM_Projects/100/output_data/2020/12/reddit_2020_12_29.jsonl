{"title": "Why Palantir is a Solid Long (Software Engineer Perspective)", "selftext": "My friend is a software engineer at Google, and he believes Palantir is a solid long based off of the ability of their engineers. The hiring process at Palantir for software engineers is more competitive than Google, Facebook, etc. (or at least as competitive). He said he was rejected by Palantir but hired by Google.\n\nI think among the tech companies, the ones with the highest engineering bar are the smaller companies (often startups), like Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir. Google ranks somewhere in the middle difficulty. Then the \"easiest\" to get in are Amazon and Microsoft. Don't get me wrong though, all tech companies are hard to get in. However, I know that there are a lot of \"coasters\"/\"slackers\" in large companies who do the bare minimum etc. Large tech companies try their best to set high bar for entry, but because of the large number of engineers they need, they inevitably lower standards in the long run.\n\nThis is especially true of engineers in government... which is the ultimate \"monolith\" and magnet of mediocrity.\n\nPalantir's competition is other government contractors, and the work done by other government contractors has historically been extremely mediocre. Do you remember the Obama care website that the government paid an absurd $2 billion to make? How about during covid, the state of New York couldn't manage their unemployment website (due to high traffic) by themselves. They needed help from Google to help run the unemployment website from their platform.\n\nFrom my point of view, there is no way Palantir can lose if they are hiring the best engineers, and if their competition is government contractors.\n\nEDIT: Positions: 1k shares in Palantir", "id": "km624j", "created_utc": 1609212551.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "1 shitty programmers interview experience.\n\nSolid DD there cowboy", "score": 446, "replies": [{"body": "I had a coworker who was really smart, she got hired at palantir and quit less than a year later because she didn't agree with the company direction.

{"title": "Disney and AMC Will Happen - Ban Redemption DD", "selftext": "How about a Ban Redemption DD for you autists. Disney REQUIRES movie theaters and there is 0% chance they allow AMC to go under. Disney revenues could see a decline of nearly $300 million per tentpole if they plan on going PVOD (paid-video-on-demand) only with Disney+ subscribers versus movie theater release.\n\n**Disney Tentpole Releases**\n\nIn 2019, Disney released eight major tentpoles with an average of $1.4 billion in revenue ($1.2 billion median revenue). If you take into consideration production and marketing costs, along with revenue share with distributors such as AMC and Cinemark, you\u2019re looking at a net revenue of around $250-300 million. How does the math work? (rounded to nearest $100MM):\n\nAVG tentpole revenue: $1.4 billion\n\nAVG revenue share (@ 50%): -$700MM\n\nAVG production cost: -$200MM\n\nAVG marketing cost: -$200MM\n\nAVG net revenue: $300MM\n\nWith an acquisition of the theater itself, you have embedded advertising within the theater for upcoming releases and more importantly, the revenue sharing would be wiped for AMC (which holds approximately 50% of attendees). The reduction of costs (cinema advertising, TV advertising, online advertising, etc.) would be dramatically reduced, likely around 20-25% given free media inventory, including email and elsewhere, could be used to supplement. The big savings comes from the revenue share reduction. Here is the breakdown of the savings if acquired:\n\nRevenue share savings (@50% share): $350MM\n\nMarketing cost savings: $50-75MM\n\nDisney is expected to expand releases at a level of 10+ tentpoles per year across the entire seasonal cycle, with summer and holiday season being the predominant timeline. This level will likely not be reduced as Disney is in content creation mode which allows movie production to coincide with series production in order to consolidate production budgets (think Wandavision with Marvel and Mandalorian with Star Wars). These synergies will greatly reduce production costs going forward, but only if revenues will support. Disney+ content will likely not be net positive until some point in 2023-24. The net return moving positive will be realized due to pricing expansion as they are giving things away to further build their subscription moat.\n\n[Here's Disney's full movie release schedule through 2027 - Insider](https://www.insider.com/disney-pixar-marvel-star-wars-fox-movies-through-2027-2019-5#pixars-soul-was-moved-from-the-summer-to-the-fall-of-2020-now-it-will-be-released-on-streaming-1) \n\nWhy are theaters imperative? Mulan will likely show a revenue total across Disney+ in the $55-60 million range. Assuming we see the same revenue curve of traditional theater revenue, their first weekend of $35 million will likely net to be 60% of total revenue (revenue data for movies). With barely breaking $65 million in the box office, Disney likely left $600-800 million on the table had the pandemic not hit.\n\n [How important is the opening week to a movie's total box office? (stephenfollows.com)](https://stephenfollows.com/how-important-is-the-opening-week-to-a-movies-total-box-office/)\n\n**Additional Revenue Sources**\n\nNow here is where the other big element comes in that will have some speculative math. I wanted to add this in order to convey the possible revenue streams to come from this.  We can take a look at 2019 levels to work against. Here are the numbers:\n\n2019 AMC attendee levels: 356MM (taken from the 2019 annual report)\n\nUnique visitors: 71MM (assuming a five movies-per-year)\n\n[Movie theater attendance statistics in U.S. | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264396/frequency-of-going-to-the-movies-in-the-us/)\n\nOne thing to note about people who visit theaters is their propensity for entertainment consumption and travel are higher than other individuals. What this means is that these people are more likely to be ones who go to Orlando or California to visit Disney parks versus other people. They are more likely to go to a restaurant and spend their discretionary money on experience. Cross-promotion of this audience with loyalty, Disney+ subscription, Disney annual passholder and other discount potential would allow further capitalization opportunities. Additionally, the creation of a brick-and-mortar Disney store within theater itself would allow for product purchase to an audience already showing demand for the IP they are going to see (think of Gamestop toys in an AMC \u201cGME Gang 4 Life!\u201d). Queue speculative math:\n\nNew Disney+ subscribers annual revenue: $100MM (@2% unique visitors joining annually)\n\nDisney store (in theater) revenue: ??\n\nLease renegotiation/additional synergy savings: ??\n\nDisney park/passholder revenue: $50-75MM (@2% of unique visitors with average visitor spend at parks) \n\n[Annual Disney Park Attendance Statistics and Charts | Disney Resources (disneynews.us)](https://disneynews.us/disney-parks-attendance/)\n\nAdvertising reduction: $25-50MM (based on a 10-20% reduction of current ad spending around $280MM for parks)\n\nTotal additional revenue and savings: $175-250MM\n\n**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**\n\nThis MFer is important. The corporate overlords have to find ways to spend their money the best way possible. They decide if content creation, capital expense with parks, etc will net the most in returns given opportunity cost. Within my own company and friends\u2019 companies across the CPG/Media/Technology sectors, I am seeing anywhere between 8-15% IRRs. In other words, Disney needs to make that back with any capital expense, be it an acquisition or within their current assets. The return timeframe is anywhere from 2-3 years, especially in this environment since the concern of inflation in the next 3-5 years may push that IRR number up. Simple math, lets look at a 10% IRR in these calculations:\n\nCurrent AMC market cap: \\~$385MM\n\nCurrent AMC debt obligations annually: \\~2-2.5 billion\n\n[Why AMC Entertainment's Debt Refinancing Is a Big Deal (fool.com)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/03/29/why-amc-entertainments-debt-refinancing-is-a-big-d.aspx)\n\nMarket Cap high (October 2018: $2.1 billion\n\nWhile looking at a market cap high with a production company purchasing the assets is likely not truly a like-for-like view, understanding what potential savings that Disney would see if they purchased the AMC assets and capitalized on the savings noted above, we can assume this conservative savings level:\n\nTentpole savings (@ 10 per year): $4.5 billion\n\nAdditional revenue/savings: $175-250MM\n\nMinus debt obligations: $2-2.5 billion\n\nNet revenue gains: $2.675-2.75 billion\n\nFinally, if we look at a 3-year window for the IRR assumption, we take the net revenue and minus the initial acquisition cost. We would not want to go down to the bottom of the IRR, but have the float be considerably higher versus the IRR minimum assumption of 10%:\n\n2-year revenue gains: $5.35-5.5 billion + acquisition cost\n\nAcquisition assumption: $2-2.5 billion, but likely even as high as $3 billion\n\nMarket cap range stock price: $12.50-15.50\n\n**Headwinds and Entry Point**\n\nWow, stock price gains from $2.40 to $12.50 sounds wonderful, but I would preface to say that the next three months are going to be a rollercoaster. There are two major events that could be a catalyst lower:\n\n1) share dilution due to an offering of 100MM shares (as about 55MM have been added of the 150MM that was noted in previous disclosures)\n\n2) bankruptcy due to cash burn. If AMC does dilute further, we could see a 40% reduction from these levels. If bankruptcy happens, then it\u2019s game over.\n\nWhat does this mean? Entry point for me is some point in late winter, in and around the last week in February or early March. I would definitely wait until January is over to see what happens. It may be as late as April, but you may miss the bottom at that point. This isn\u2019t financial advice, but no one ever picks the absolute bottom.\n\nDo I buy shares or options? I would expect the stock price to creep below $2 over the coming months and think to enter between $1.50-2.00. There may be some crazy options available in the $3-5 range that look to be FD level, but may as well take on the stock side at those levels. If you do get into the options side, expect cheap leaps depending on bankruptcy news (as they are cheap right now anyways). Just understand it is a risky bet. After reading the archived u/Deepfuckingvalue post, I would think this may be one of those stories.

With a cost-cutter like Bob Chapek in charge of reversing AMCs course to sustained profitability being a win-win for AMC and Disney, this would fit in well with the Disney properties.\n\nI welcome your brutal thoughts as I put on my helmet (the one with my name on it).\n\n**TLDR:** If AMC isn't delisted by April, Disney will likely buy them.

Whether you have an iPhone or Samsung pos it\u2019s an iPhone. FaceTime has become a verb. Apple stock is severely, severely under priced right now. We saw the EXACT same thing happen after the 2014 split. It took a solid couple years and analysts bashing before it finally doubled and then ended up 500% higher and split 6 years later. This will happen again. I\u2019m a long holder of Apple and will buy every dip I see along the way. I also love the 150c for 2/19 and beyond. Fantastic deal right now.

The point is that we don't have a full breakdown unless we spend considerable time below 25, then I could maybe see things fall back down to 20. I think it is far more likely we just remain in this extended consolidation phase of 25-30 until we get some sort of a catalyst or a short squeeze.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddzg718of5861.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=58b39c19f793dee8366fc2bafbc55bfe49d49836\n\nBut this is not the point of the post today. Today I am here to convince you why a cost basis of 20 or 25 doesn't matter for PLTR. You are buying the company at around 40-50x 2020E sales, Which seems quite high  (not as much compared to SNOW and some other big data plays) but still. So why bother with PLTR?\n\nBefore I proceed, I know most people who are here can't read, and I am going to be dropping a gigantic wall of text which I expect all maybe two of your guys to read, so here is the short form  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\nThis was the primer I had written on Information Technology  back in 2017\n\n[https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/](https://etherealvalue.wordpress.com/2017/02/25/technology-primer/)\n\nI started by looking at the S&P500 since the early 1900s to understand if there was a mental model I could use to outperform the index. What I found was that starting in the late 1800s, most of the companies that ended up creating enormous shareholder value started as technology companies. Dupont was a technology company in the 1800s, Edison Electric was a technology company in the 1900s, GM was a technology company in the 1920s. If one looks at the market capitalization of companies today, many of the largest are today\u2019s technology companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft have market capitalizations which eclipse many old traditional industries.\n\nThere is clearly something about technology companies that allows them to generate enormous shareholder value and create wealth for society, after all, if\u00a0the stock index was still dominated by the likes of American Cotton Oil and American Sugar Refining like in the 1900s, we would all be living in a different and much poorer world. The challenge with investing in technology companies is that for every Edison Electric there is a Zenith Radio. for every IBM there is a Sinclaire Rearch and for every Apple there is a Blackberry. There had to be a way to analyze or put into context why some companies last longer than others and why some managed to generate returns over a thousand fold for its investors while others fizzile and pop with the latest turn in the economic cycle.\n\nI agree with Peter Thiel\u2019s thesis that technology advancement is probably slowing down and primarily concentrated around information technology as a result of regulations around the \u201cworld of stuff\u201d. I believe this will continue to be the trend of the next 20-30 years, with some exceptions and that the rise of AI may start creating innovation again in many static fields. I believe historically, there were massive innovation happening across multiple disciplines from the 1800s-1950s, where technological progress branched \u00a0out like a tree and\u00a0built on itself. Since the 1970s or so, this branch narrowed \u00a0into only a few sectors, primarily focused in information technology.\n\nSo I wanted to strip out the massive amount innovations that have taken place around agriculture, communications, transportation, energy and petrochemicals over the past 100 years. It is helpful to think backwards if you will, focusing on just the age of computers and back into the late 1800s, into the birth of the electronic age. When we focus on just the computer led revolution in the 1950s and electricity revolution in the 1870s, we start seeing some interesting trends.\n\n**Information Technology Cycles**\n\nThe following is my attempt at\u00a0describing from a very high level the history of computing and informational technology. What I found was that technology moves both in cycles of proliferation and consolidation and that there is a directional theme.\n\nElectronic Age\n\n**Electricity/Scaled Power (1875-1900):** Platform competition and consolidation phase: Edison vs Tesla. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and factory owners to replace\u00a0physical labor.(Important companies: GE and Westinghouse)\n\n**Electronics (1900-1925):** Electricity prices fall as infrastructure rollout, creating a proliferation of electronic hobbyists and startups. Hardware dominates first half, platform dominates next half. Consumer Facing.(Important companies: RCA, Zenith, Galvin (Motorola), most went belly up, upstream and downstream do well)\n\n**Electronics Consolidation (1925-1950):** The electronics sector consolidates, with content platform operators (software) dominating, and winners usually emerge from previously niche targets.(Important companies: AT&T, NBC, IBM)\n\nComputing/Software Age\n\n**Computing/Scaled Electronic (1950-1975):** Platform consolidation: IBM and the seven dwarfs. Enterprise facing, originally to convince government and large scale enterprise to replace\u00a0\u00a0basic mental labor.(Important companies: IBM)\n\n**From Hardware to Software (1975-2000):** Computing price falls, creating a proliferation of hobbyists, IT startups and companies. Lots of PC makers who go bust, software and internet dominate in the second half.(Important companies: Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Dell, most early PC makers go belly up, up and downstream do well)\n\n**Software Consolidation (2000-2025):** Sectors like Retail, information and social consolidate. Hardware continues to fall away to software as content platform start to dominate, winner is emerging across multiple sub verticals.(Important companies: Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent)\n\nCloud/AI Age\n\n**Machine Learning (ML)/Smart Software (2025-2050):** Platform consolidation phase. Enterprise facing, convince companies this is the future of advanced mental labor. It will be about the use of AI at the industrial scale being adapted by corporations and governments for various analytical, resource management and decision making processes.(Candidate Important companies\\*\\*:\\*\\* AWS, Microsoft,\u00a0Palantir, companies yet to exist in China)\n\n**Specialized AI\u00a0(2050-2075):** Machine learning/AI becomes cheaper, creating a proliferation of AI hobbyists and developers, high level programing focused, consumer facing. This will be about the proliferation of AI in our everyday lives. Just as how starting in the 1990s, the story of technology was one with the integration of computers and software to our daily lives, to some extent, outsourcing\u00a0the memory/logic processing components of our lives to computers. Now, we will be calling upon multiple AIs to do many deal of the functions of our lives in perhaps faster input times (using neural interfaces). Companies\u00a0and products could be formed in seconds from simply thinking through the process and outsourcing it to smart software who functionally construct its various\u00a0parts in second to minutes depending on how quickly you can direct and scale your digital minions to do your bidding.(Candidate important companies: most will go bust, up and downstream will likely do well.)\n\n**General AI (2075-2100):**\u00a0Consolidation of Software/AI. It will be about the web linkages of human/AI integration. Whether this looks like some sort of neural net where we live in a web of information buffeted by our web of AI advisors.\n\nThe average core technology cycle seems to be approximately 75 years, with 25 years of infrastructure platform competition and roll-out, 25 years of new venture creation most of which gets washed out, and 25 years of industry consolidation.\n\nThe initial phase of the cycle is dominated by 1-3 players fighting it out in a standards war that then gets rolled out as the foundational infrastructure of the next 50 years:\n\nIn the initial phase, the general theme is that the companies start off as enterprise and government facing. In the historical electronics and computer cycle, there has been two such periods, the roll out of electrical grid by GE/Westinghouse and the roll out of mainframe computers by IBM. In the case of the AC vs DC standard war between Edison and Tesla, both men through their respective backers, GE and Westinghouse, to invent and supply standardized power equipment and build power plant, the initial consumers were local government to replace previous gas lamp systems with electrical street lamps and to factories. The new technology was seen as cheaper and more efficient than previously gas operated lambs operated by cities and more importantly, electricity delivered by wire is seen as much more efficient than having onsite power for factory operators, allowing for the displacement of onsite steam engines and boilers. The birth of the mainframe computer was similar, although less competitive. Due to an earlier lead and first mover position, IBM was able to dominate the market over its competitors, making them irrelevant. The mainframe computer was sold to large corporations and government defense agencies for the calculation of complex formulas that had previously required the employment of hundreds of staff. The two initial cycles produce two monopolistic businesses that are still DOW components today, GE and IBM, which set the standard for a drop in the price of electricity and computing that would benefit the next phase of the cycle.\n\nThe proliferation phase, the general theme is that there is a cheapening of the previous platform technology, electricity and computing power, which enables hobbyists to take advantage and start building new products in the electronics and PC space. This is characterized by period of high new firm creation, high levels of creativity and a move from enterprise focus to the consumer. We saw it in the 1900-1920s with the birth of the electronics industry, there were dozens of radio makers, appliance makers and various electronics manufacturing startups. During this time, there was heavy competition from the host of new hardware businesses, with most profits coming from IP licensing. A similar analogy could be made of the PC era of the 1980s-2000s, there was a lot of hardware makers, it was highly competitive, and the winners of the era were primarily focusing on software (ie Microsoft).\n\nThe consolidation phase, In the case of the 1920s, the commoditization of hardware created an opportunity for content providers. History is littered with names of large scale manufacturer that are now defuct, names like Zenith, admiral and dozens of electronics makers which use to hover mid-western industrial hubs such as Chicago. The content providers in Radio and TV became more dominant. Through the current consolidation phase, starting in 2000, we see less new venture creation and generally a focus on the content/distribution platform side of consumer technology. Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple are key examples of the shift.\n\nWhat it means today,\n\nI would argue that we are in the consolidation part of the cycle until 2020-2025, where it will continue to be about shrinking number of consumer technology players and the dominance of content over infrastructure. This explains the phenomenal\u00a0increase of FANG stocks relative to the rest of the market. As a result, for the next 5-10 years, if one can pick good entry points for Amazon (I will discuss my dislike of Google in a future post), one will be successful, and the company will likely last for a long time. It remains to be seen if Apple can create a bigger ecosystem. Contrarian value plays probably revolve around Chinese ADRs which are out of favor with the US public.\n\n**From 2025 onward, the most exciting prospect is the idea of a repeat of the infrastructure buildout that happened at the onset of the electricity and computing age. I believe that the new phase will be targeting enterprise and government and will be a winner take all fight similar to the few cycles. The previous cycles revolved around scaled mechanical energy and scaled linear mental processing, I believe the next phase will revolve around advanced mental processing. I think that corporations and government while benefiting from scale, are beholden to inefficient decision making due to complicated management structuring.** The automation of complex management process that can analyze of complex large data and deploy resources more efficiently will become invaluable to large corporate/government clients. Companies that have potential in this space are big data players with big client channels like AWS and **Palantir** or emergent players which have yet to develop in the US or China. It is also possible that will come from a spinout team from one of current tech giants.\n\nIt is a serious mistake to continue to look for consumer plays in the technology space. I believe that the sector is consolidating and played out. New entrants will find it nearly impossible to survive at the downturn of the next cycle and current incumbents will solidity their positioning. The next batch of potentially interesting companies will likely come from the enterprise space. While Wall Street analysts continues to be focused on AWS and the fight over IaaS and PaaS, the most interesting\u00a0segment to watch is in advanced analytics and resource allocation tools, which is ripe for innovation. There are lots of fat in the middle management layer of corporations and governments. I strongly believe that this space is where the next once in a generation infrastructure player (like GE and IBM) can offer an impressive solution which will fill the niche. The early identification of this company/companies will generate significant out performance relative to any market benchmark.\n\n2020 Update:\n\nIf we are in the infrastructure roll-out stage than first mover absolutely has an advantage as we could see with GE, IBM and microsoft to some extent during the previous eras. In the consolidation ages, the last mover had an advantage. Amazon and Apple were not the first e-commerce or hardware makers, but are likely the last because they benefit from  a slow down of technology and a focus on ease of use and scale.  This is why every contract and sticky ones PLTR has is so important, because these relationships will scale in a non-linear way once AI and machine learning starts making its way into  large institutions and first mover advantage is very very important here, just like how GE was working around the clock to sign on factories and local governments for lighting and electricity contracts, once they were in, that is forever and they could start selling other equipment and devices all of which were collecting licensing or patent fees.\n\nI have very high conviction on Palantir.  I believe the reason above is what drove Peter Thiel to invest into Palantir, because it is building the infrastructure layer for the age of AI and PLTR is primed to becoming the single most important company in technology for the next 2-3 decades and will be a 100-1,000x bagger.\n\nPosition Update;Now have $220k in shares  (bought another \\~$90k in shares yesterday, still about 30k (down from 50k) in calls.

The troubles of the world has something to do with the city/rural divide.

Each person with their 100 acres of farm land kinda gives each person their own space. The industrial revolution comes along and you now get the benefit of economies of scale and factories and workers crowd into the cities starting in the early 1900s, this create extreme rent seeking (tenement housing) extreme wealth inequality and massive boom send busts. If creates a kinda mimetic feedback loop. Post Great Depression the us went about spreading people out and got lucky in that it kinda recreated the original dynamics of the Jeffersonial farmer family except with the suburbs, this reduced mimetic competition and led to reduced rent seeking and set off an economy boom. Starting in the 80s, this went back into reverse and we concentrate back into the cities again. This leads to increased pressures on rent seeking (crazy rent in big cities) and misery (millennials squeezed into tiny apartments) and recreates a lot of the similar societal pressures of the 1930s, hence you see antifa and right wing fighting in the streets. The proper thing to do is encourage remote working and rebuilding rural infrastructure so people can spread out, get more land and rebuild agency again.

He then worked for Micron as a director and panic sold his shares based on Samsung capacity and ignored the thesis I outlined to him from David Einhorn and that Samsung was going to rationalize the memory sector much like what happened with hard drives. But he was convinced there was going to be another Chinese player just like in the previous cycles with Taiwan, Skorea and Japan and dumping.\n\nTrust me, engineers are some of the worst investors in the world from my experience.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Clearly he's from accounting and not from engineering.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06601213663816452}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.056220486760139465}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "bruh these autist non cs majors have such a wrong impression about AI.
