{"title": "Why Palantir is a Solid Long (Software Engineer Perspective)", "selftext": "My friend is a software engineer at Google, and he believes Palantir is a solid long based off of the ability of their engineers. The hiring process at Palantir for software engineers is more competitive than Google, Facebook, etc. (or at least as competitive). He said he was rejected by Palantir but hired by Google.\n\nI think among the tech companies, the ones with the highest engineering bar are the smaller companies (often startups), like Netflix, Facebook, Airbnb, Palantir. Google ranks somewhere in the middle difficulty. Then the \"easiest\" to get in are Amazon and Microsoft. Don't get me wrong though, all tech companies are hard to get in. However, I know that there are a lot of \"coasters\"/\"slackers\" in large companies who do the bare minimum etc. Large tech companies try their best to set high bar for entry, but because of the large number of engineers they need, they inevitably lower standards in the long run.\n\nThis is especially true of engineers in government... which is the ultimate \"monolith\" and magnet of mediocrity.\n\nPalantir's competition is other government contractors, and the work done by other government contractors has historically been extremely mediocre. Do you remember the Obama care website that the government paid an absurd $2 billion to make? How about during covid, the state of New York couldn't manage their unemployment website (due to high traffic) by themselves. They needed help from Google to help run the unemployment website from their platform.\n\nFrom my point of view, there is no way Palantir can lose if they are hiring the best engineers, and if their competition is government contractors.\n\nEDIT: Positions: 1k shares in Palantir", "id": "km624j", "created_utc": 1609212551.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "1 shitty programmers interview experience.\n\nSolid DD there cowboy", "score": 446, "replies": [{"body": "I had a coworker who was really smart, she got hired at palantir and quit less than a year later because she didn't agree with the company direction.

{"title": "Disney and AMC Will Happen - Ban Redemption DD", "selftext": "How about a Ban Redemption DD for you autists. Disney REQUIRES movie theaters and there is 0% chance they allow AMC to go under. Disney revenues could see a decline of nearly $300 million per tentpole if they plan on going PVOD (paid-video-on-demand) only with Disney+ subscribers versus movie theater release.\n\n**Disney Tentpole Releases**\n\nIn 2019, Disney released eight major tentpoles with an average of $1.4 billion in revenue ($1.2 billion median revenue). If you take into consideration production and marketing costs, along with revenue share with distributors such as AMC and Cinemark, you\u2019re looking at a net revenue of around $250-300 million. How does the math work? (rounded to nearest $100MM):\n\nAVG tentpole revenue: $1.4 billion\n\nAVG revenue share (@ 50%): -$700MM\n\nAVG production cost: -$200MM\n\nAVG marketing cost: -$200MM\n\nAVG net revenue: $300MM\n\nWith an acquisition of the theater itself, you have embedded advertising within the theater for upcoming releases and more importantly, the revenue sharing would be wiped for AMC (which holds approximately 50% of attendees). The reduction of costs (cinema advertising, TV advertising, online advertising, etc.) would be dramatically reduced, likely around 20-25% given free media inventory, including email and elsewhere, could be used to supplement. The big savings comes from the revenue share reduction. Here is the breakdown of the savings if acquired:\n\nRevenue share savings (@50% share): $350MM\n\nMarketing cost savings: $50-75MM\n\nDisney is expected to expand releases at a level of 10+ tentpoles per year across the entire seasonal cycle, with summer and holiday season being the predominant timeline. This level will likely not be reduced as Disney is in content creation mode which allows movie production to coincide with series production in order to consolidate production budgets (think Wandavision with Marvel and Mandalorian with Star Wars). These synergies will greatly reduce production costs going forward, but only if revenues will support. Disney+ content will likely not be net positive until some point in 2023-24. The net return moving positive will be realized due to pricing expansion as they are giving things away to further build their subscription moat.\n\n[Here's Disney's full movie release schedule through 2027 - Insider](https://www.insider.com/disney-pixar-marvel-star-wars-fox-movies-through-2027-2019-5#pixars-soul-was-moved-from-the-summer-to-the-fall-of-2020-now-it-will-be-released-on-streaming-1) \n\nWhy are theaters imperative? Mulan will likely show a revenue total across Disney+ in the $55-60 million range. Assuming we see the same revenue curve of traditional theater revenue, their first weekend of $35 million will likely net to be 60% of total revenue (revenue data for movies). With barely breaking $65 million in the box office, Disney likely left $600-800 million on the table had the pandemic not hit.\n\n [How important is the opening week to a movie's total box office? (stephenfollows.com)](https://stephenfollows.com/how-important-is-the-opening-week-to-a-movies-total-box-office/)\n\n**Additional Revenue Sources**\n\nNow here is where the other big element comes in that will have some speculative math. I wanted to add this in order to convey the possible revenue streams to come from this.  We can take a look at 2019 levels to work against. Here are the numbers:\n\n2019 AMC attendee levels: 356MM (taken from the 2019 annual report)\n\nUnique visitors: 71MM (assuming a five movies-per-year)\n\n[Movie theater attendance statistics in U.S. | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264396/frequency-of-going-to-the-movies-in-the-us/)\n\nOne thing to note about people who visit theaters is their propensity for entertainment consumption and travel are higher than other individuals. What this means is that these people are more likely to be ones who go to Orlando or California to visit Disney parks versus other people. They are more likely to go to a restaurant and spend their discretionary money on experience. Cross-promotion of this audience with loyalty, Disney+ subscription, Disney annual passholder and other discount potential would allow further capitalization opportunities. Additionally, the creation of a brick-and-mortar Disney store within theater itself would allow for product purchase to an audience already showing demand for the IP they are going to see (think of Gamestop toys in an AMC \u201cGME Gang 4 Life!\u201d). Queue speculative math:\n\nNew Disney+ subscribers annual revenue: $100MM (@2% unique visitors joining annually)\n\nDisney store (in theater) revenue: ??\n\nLease renegotiation/additional synergy savings: ??\n\nDisney park/passholder revenue: $50-75MM (@2% of unique visitors with average visitor spend at parks) \n\n[Annual Disney Park Attendance Statistics and Charts | Disney Resources (disneynews.us)](https://disneynews.us/disney-parks-attendance/)\n\nAdvertising reduction: $25-50MM (based on a 10-20% reduction of current ad spending around $280MM for parks)\n\nTotal additional revenue and savings: $175-250MM\n\n**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**\n\nThis MFer is important. The corporate overlords have to find ways to spend their money the best way possible. They decide if content creation, capital expense with parks, etc will net the most in returns given opportunity cost. Within my own company and friends\u2019 companies across the CPG/Media/Technology sectors, I am seeing anywhere between 8-15% IRRs. In other words, Disney needs to make that back with any capital expense, be it an acquisition or within their current assets. The return timeframe is anywhere from 2-3 years, especially in this environment since the concern of inflation in the next 3-5 years may push that IRR number up. Simple math, lets look at a 10% IRR in these calculations:\n\nCurrent AMC market cap: \\~$385MM\n\nCurrent AMC debt obligations annually: \\~2-2.5 billion\n\n[Why AMC Entertainment's Debt Refinancing Is a Big Deal (fool.com)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/03/29/why-amc-entertainments-debt-refinancing-is-a-big-d.aspx)\n\nMarket Cap high (October 2018: $2.1 billion\n\nWhile looking at a market cap high with a production company purchasing the assets is likely not truly a like-for-like view, understanding what potential savings that Disney would see if they purchased the AMC assets and capitalized on the savings noted above, we can assume this conservative savings level:\n\nTentpole savings (@ 10 per year): $4.5 billion\n\nAdditional revenue/savings: $175-250MM\n\nMinus debt obligations: $2-2.5 billion\n\nNet revenue gains: $2.675-2.75 billion\n\nFinally, if we look at a 3-year window for the IRR assumption, we take the net revenue and minus the initial acquisition cost. We would not want to go down to the bottom of the IRR, but have the float be considerably higher versus the IRR minimum assumption of 10%:\n\n2-year revenue gains: $5.35-5.5 billion + acquisition cost\n\nAcquisition assumption: $2-2.5 billion, but likely even as high as $3 billion\n\nMarket cap range stock price: $12.50-15.50\n\n**Headwinds and Entry Point**\n\nWow, stock price gains from $2.40 to $12.50 sounds wonderful, but I would preface to say that the next three months are going to be a rollercoaster. There are two major events that could be a catalyst lower:\n\n1) share dilution due to an offering of 100MM shares (as about 55MM have been added of the 150MM that was noted in previous disclosures)\n\n2) bankruptcy due to cash burn. If AMC does dilute further, we could see a 40% reduction from these levels. If bankruptcy happens, then it\u2019s game over.\n\nWhat does this mean? Entry point for me is some point in late winter, in and around the last week in February or early March. I would definitely wait until January is over to see what happens. It may be as late as April, but you may miss the bottom at that point. This isn\u2019t financial advice, but no one ever picks the absolute bottom.\n\nDo I buy shares or options? I would expect the stock price to creep below $2 over the coming months and think to enter between $1.50-2.00. There may be some crazy options available in the $3-5 range that look to be FD level, but may as well take on the stock side at those levels. If you do get into the options side, expect cheap leaps depending on bankruptcy news (as they are cheap right now anyways). Just understand it is a risky bet. After reading the archived u/Deepfuckingvalue post, I would think this may be one of those stories.

With a cost-cutter like Bob Chapek in charge of reversing AMCs course to sustained profitability being a win-win for AMC and Disney, this would fit in well with the Disney properties.\n\nI welcome your brutal thoughts as I put on my helmet (the one with my name on it).\n\n**TLDR:** If AMC isn't delisted by April, Disney will likely buy them.
