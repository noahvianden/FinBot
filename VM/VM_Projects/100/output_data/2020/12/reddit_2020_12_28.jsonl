A typical handling sequence is first the broker evaluates the order for their own accounts. If they like the trade, they pick it up and you get the benefit of a very quick fill. If they don't want it or can't fill it themselves, but they have direct access to one or more markets, they route the order directly to the market. If they don't have direct access, they sell the order to a wholesaler, who then routes it to a market.\n\nBut no matter which way the order is routed, it ends up in a market, such as it is.

This  long call is deep ITM with a delta between 0.70 - 0.85.  The underlying  stock is perhaps one of the biggest names in big tech such as AAPL,  AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, etc.  My point for using this detail is to imply that  there is a fairly high probability that the company will ultimately  appreciate during the course of the 365 - 535 days.  With this long ITM  call, you plan to simulate owning the stock and selling weekly OTM  covered calls against it for profit and weekly revenue with deltas  around .\n\nLet's say that something  happens in the economy or specifically with the company you purchased  the long Call for and this issue causes a temporary, gradual downtrend  in the underlying and your long Call option during a period of about 3 -  6 months before the value eventually recovers.  Specifically, after  purchasing the Call option, you eventually realize that you unknowingly  purchased it during a time that it was near the all time high and it has  been gradually declining in value ever since.\n\nYou  want to sell weekly call options OTM expiring on a Friday of each week  with deltas of 0.24 to 0.35 with roughly a 72% - 80% chance of the  strike price NOT being reached for any given week.\n\nDuring  the middle of the 3 month gradual downtrend of the underlying stock,  the total value of your long Call option is reduced by about 40% - 50%  because it has a much larger delta compared to the weekly OTM calls you  are selling.\n\nNow, let's say one of  those weeks during the 3 month downtrend, the value of the stock  increases to a point that is not a full recovery from the original price  it was when you bought the long call, but it increases just enough to a  point where it still exceeds the strike price of your weekly call  option.  What I am saying here is that your long Call ITM is still at a  big loss yet your weekly call option goes ITM and is vulnerable to being  exercised.\n\nWhat do people do in this bad situation?  Here are the only choices I can think of and each one seems really unfavorable.\n\n1. Keep  holding the long Call in hopes it will eventually recover and increase  in value.  As soon as the value of the stock reaches the strike price,  immediately buy back the Call option for more money than you sold it  for.  At the same time, you would feel a little content that perhaps the  underlying stock is partially recovering in value and moving towards  what it was when you originally purchased the long Call.\n2. Liquidate  the long Call by selling it back to the market for significantly LESS  money than it was worth when you originally bought the Call.  Even  though you are coming out at a loss, the money you receive is still  worth more than the cost to buy back the weekly ITM Call option so that  it is not exercised.\n\nNormally,  investors think of the synthetic covered call strategy as being highly  profitable because during an uptrend, their long ITM Call is guaranteed  to always increase in value much more than their weekly provided they  are still far away from expiration and their long Call delta is much  higher than their weekly.  However, you would no longer think of your  long ITM Call as \"insurance\" against the weekly OTM calls if your long  Call is worth less than what you bought it for, correct?\n\nAs  experienced options traders, what would you do in this bad situation?   How would you handle selling weekly Call options while owning a long  Call ITM that is worth much less than what you bought it for?\n\nA  better question for experienced options traders is this:  Do you still  view a long ITM Call as \"insurance\" against your weekly OTM Call options  if it gets sold back at a loss compared to when you bought it?

It's obviously safer to assume that, in general, there will be economic growth in the future whereas it's not safe to assume that volatility will increase, so it's smarter to buy and hold in the stock market than the options market, but that's how the \"sum\" or average gains of the market works, right?\n\nSorry, not trying to be argumentative, it's just the only way I know to ask the question is to lay out the reasoning and have someone tell me where it goes wrong, if it does.\n\nIf I just pick a random (weighted by capitalization) stock, on average, my investment should increase if the stock market overall increases and decrease if the stock market overall decreases.

As I understand it, the basic tasty trade idea is for 21DTE+, rolling the untested side in when your breakeven on the other side has been breached (as opposed to your tested strike price), and if under 21DTE, rolling out in time to the next month (and maybe adjusting the untested side or creating a jade lizard too). \n\nMy question is - If my deltas have moved from .12/-.12 to say .28/-.7 and there is still a month to expiry, but neither the strike nor the breakeven have been breached, do I just need to chill out and not stress the fact that there's such a big difference between deltas? I don't want to get whipsawed by overmanaging, but thought the goal was to remain relatively delta neutral. Does anyone manage by doing something like, \"If one delta is 3x the other, I'll roll the untested side in\"? Or \"Once delta on one side passes .30, I'll roll in\"? \n\nI understand you can also buy the underlying or sell more on one side to balance deltas, but am trying to understand how to best manage without increasing size.

Let's say that's 21 DTE. If you are at 25 DTE, you are only a week away from your max holding time limit. From that perspective, adding risk by making an adjustment doesn't sound so good, right?\n\nAlso missing is the P/L situation. Delta is a means to an end. How profitable is the position at the moment? If you have a loss that is near your loss limit, time to do something. Personally, I prefer bailing out and cutting losses over adjusting, but tastytrade prefers to adjust. It's up to you to decide which to do. If the position is profitable but below your profit target, you can just hold.\n\nOverall I'd say your instincts are aligned with what I would do.
