{"title": "Final update and predictions for $NVAX: time is running out to get in before take off", "selftext": "**28Dec2020 Update:**\n\nStill extremely bullish here and think we get an announcement for Phase 3 UK results within the next 5 trading days. Based on an improved version of my model, the UK trial should be well over 50 events by now, even if we assume 100% efficacy. I suspect management is waiting for the original 66 event threshold in the clinical trial protocol due to the massive increase in COVID cases in the UK. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday's US Phase 3 trial announcement didn't generate much of a reaction but all vaccine stocks have traded down over the course of the day. The value in this announcement is that we know that the FDA has approved their manufacturing process and release testing assays, which takes away some downside risk. I suspect that the lukewarm response to the trial announcement may be due to the misconception that NVAX is much further behind than they really are bc of the failure to understand that the UK trial is what really matters. The US trial needs to be run to support eventual full approval in the US, but not for emergency use authorization and global licensure and that's what really matters. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hoped the trial announcement today would have been a bigger catalyst, but this still all comes down to the UK interim update. If efficacy is >90% then this will take off. I haven't started rolling my Jan 15 calls and probably won't start unless we get to mid-week next week and we still don't have an update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI continue to get questions about NVAX and decided to make one final post for current and prospective NVAX holders. For those who didn\u2019t read my previous posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/)), I\u2019m currently a biomedical PhD candidate and have >5yrs of experience in vaccine R&D.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to several persistent misconceptions, NVAX is insanely undervalued and is poised to take off in the very near future due to the upcoming interim readout of their Phase 3 UK trial which will support global licensure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I say that I think NVAX will take off, consider that it went from $90/share to over $140/share in 4 trading days on news about setbacks to AZN's trial, which is nothing compared to the impact of the upcoming interim readout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on \\*current\\* supply deals alone, NVAX is projected to supply more doses of their COVID vaccine to the world in 2021 than Pfizer and Moderna combined, yet NVAX sits at a market cap of $7.3B. For reference, MRNA and CVAC - two other companies with no marketed products - have market caps of $61B and $23B, respectively. Also consider that not only does CVAC have no marketed products, their COVID vaccine is still in Phase 2 (NVAX started Phase 3 in September) and their Phase 1 data looks weak (NVAX's Phase 1 data is arguably best to date).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the supply/distribution constraints for Pfizer and Moderna, I suspect NVAX will ink several additional agreements upon release of their Phase 3 interim data. Earlier today, Australia increased their [order](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/coronavirus-live-blog-december-11-covid-vaccine-trials/12972448) from 40M to 51M doses due to issues with an in-country vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# If all of this is true why is NVAX's market cap so low?\n\nI suspect that the *primary* reason for NVAX's low market cap is the misconception that NVAX is too far behind Pfizer/Moderna/AstraZeneca to matter because their US Phase 3 trial hasn't started.\n\n**The market doesn't seem to appreciate that they started a 15,000 person trial in the UK on September 24th which will support global licensure if successful** (my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) post outlined why I think the probability of success is extremely high)**.** Rarely do I see this mentioned in NYT, Bloomberg, or WSJ articles on COVID vaccine updates and as a result, I think NVAX is being incorrectly viewed as a longshot.\n\nAlthough it's not definite, the UK trial will also likely be able to support a US EUA due using a trial design harmonized with US requirements. Regardless, the timing for the US market is not nearly as important due to the fact that their funding from Operation Warp Speed ($1.6B) guarantees purchase of 100M doses as long as a viable vaccine can be delivered. There are no stipulations that they need to be first to ensure purchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# When will we get the interim readout and why is this important?\n\nThe UK trial originally had a planned interim readout at 66 events, but that's been moved up to 50 events due to anticipated high levels of efficacy (confirmed the validity of the screenshot in my last post). This means that once 50 people in the trial develop symptomatic COVID, they'll unblind and determine the percentage of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo. This type of readout is what supported the announcements made by Pfizer on 09Nov and by Moderna on 16Nov.\n\nA positive interim readout (anything >90% effective) would be enormous because it would vault NVAX into the spotlight alongside PFE/MRNA. NVAX\u2019s $7.3B market cap would quickly be in the rear view mirror. Full approval in the US would still require completion of a US based phase 3 trial (set to start imminently) but as I mentioned, US supply deal of 100M doses is already confirmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so when will we get 50 events in the trial?\n\nThe official language used in company press releases says that the interim data are expected \"as soon as early first quarter 2021, although the timing depends on the overall COVID-19 rate in the region.\" However, that was before they decided to change the threshold from 66 to 50 events. Also, their president of research also indicated in a meeting on November 24th that he thinks they'll get there before the end of the year because the trial is centered in several locations in the UK with extremely high rates of transmission.\n\nSince I have >90% of my portfolio invested in NVAX options, I wanted to get some more confidence around the timing of when the trial would hit 50 events and put together a model to estimate a timeframe. Although this might seem like a ridiculous exercise, I actually think it's semi-reasonable due to the meticulous level of detail that the UK's Office of National Statistics [maintains](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata) regarding COVID infections and the daily modeled incidence rates they publish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Going through the details of the model is probably overkill for WSB so skip to the end if you dont care. I\u2019m including it so I can get feedback from anyone with a stats background\n\nUsing public statements about trial enrollment numbers, I assume three periods of linear enrollment from 24Sep to 27Oct (0 to 5500), 28Oct to 09Nov (5501 to 9000), 10Nov to 27Nov (9001 to 15000). Per the clinical trial protocol, events are eligible to be counted 7 days following the second injection. As a result, infections for participants injected on day 0 (24Sep) aren\u2019t counted until 22Oct (1st shot + 21 days for 2nd shot + 7 days). Screenshot below should help to explain better if that's not clear. I also assume a 10% dropout rate, a 15% asymptomatic rate, and a 100% vaccine efficacy rate (this actually makes the projection more conservative).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cmnb8pz6h461.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ccfa13f90793285b382d0f2ebeb3f9134e41654\n\nBecause the probability of infection increases over time and there are different rates of infection on different days, I treat each row of the above table as an independent group to estimate the number infections over time based on the daily modeled infection rates. A screen shot of the table I used is below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5mciai07h461.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9031712307e8052df3559e45397c313f47fc22\n\nI divided each daily number by 10,000 to calculate an individual incidence rate per day and then used these daily incidents rates to determine cumulative incidence rates over different periods of time and then apply that to each group of participants in a rolling window. See below to get an idea of the calculation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eplpltd17h461.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1c1bbb6940c5b65db7145c7cf4e236769548b4\n\nThe modelled incidence rates from ONS stop at 22Nov. For the dates beyond then and into the future, I duplicated numbers on the low end from the published period, which is probably more conservative than what we\u2019ll see in reality. Another important difference is that the modeled incidence rates are for England (pop. 55M) but the trial is performed across the entire UK (pop 66M) which also makes the incidence rates more conservative. I\u2019m ok with these factors being too conservative since the linear enrollment assumption is almost certainly too optimistic.\n\n**With those caveats, my model estimates that the trial will accumulate 50 events between December 12th and December 20th.**\n\nI think this is reasonable, however I don't have a statistics degree and am open feedback assuming anyone actually read all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion and Final Predictions\n\nWe can debate NVAX\u2019s management team and ability to deliver on manufacturing output, booster revenue, and a whole bunch of other things I addressed in previous posts but I\u2019ll spare you bc none of it matters for what happens in the next 2-4 weeks.\n\nThe success of this trade will be based on 1) whether or not they announce positive interim results and 2) the timing of the announcement. If results are positive and they're announced in the ballpark of my estimated timeframe, then it could be an easy 500% return depending on the contracts you buy.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the stock dips a few more times prior to announcement in response to Pfizer/Moderna news, but I think we\u2019re close to the bottom. I\u2019m not comfortable missing an announcement so I\u2019m not gonna bother trying to time it perfectly but keep that in mind.\n\nI\u2019ve settled in on a strategy of buying a few grand worth of OTM weeklies while building a core position of January 15th options on dips. Overall options volume isn\u2019t great so I\u2019ve been picking my strikes based on volume and have a ton of Jan 15 150c and 160c. See previous posts for proof.\n\nIf your risk tolerance isn\u2019t high then regular shares aren\u2019t a bad move because this is gonna move enough to still make good return and there\u2019s potential for big swings until an announcement is made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Predictions**\n\n\u00b7 Announcement of initiation of Phase 3 US trial between 11Dec and 18Dec\n\n\u00b7 50 events recorded achieved between December 12-20; press release within 7 days of events being achieved (December 19-27)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nUpdate\n\nRegarding options prices, consider the price history of the Jan 15 150c:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekfwggromh461.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a89f8e974e0ebbcee444ded22c6e8fbe3fb942\n\nThat was due to a jump from $100/share to a high of $145/share. Interim announcement sends this much higher than $145/share.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "kaulkc", "created_utc": 1607656859.0, "score": 131, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "Passed the \u201clong scroll\u201d test...im fully in", "score": 107, "replies": [{"body": "I love your extra DD!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09946215897798538}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14938297867774963}, {"body": "God damn man, that\u2019s a hell of a play you got going here.

That is not a real price.\u201d Proctor & Gamble had just fallen 25% in a manner of minutes, then 29%, then 31%. Cramer had never seen such a shiny knife, such a beautiful buy, and he searched frantically for the right camera to beg his followers to add PG to their portfolio. \n\nThere weren\u2019t enough buttons on Cramer\u2019s soundboard to fully capture how he felt about the quickest drop in Dow Jones history. In what would later be dubbed \u201cThe Crash of 2:45\u201d or simply \u201cThe Flash Crash,\u201d over a trillion dollars was wiped from the stock market in a manner of 15 minutes. The odd thing was, despite dropping more than 9% at one point, the market would rapidly recover a bit after 3 PM and would close only 3% lower for the day.\n\nIn the ensuing days and weeks, journalists and financial commentators and United States Congressmen would try and determine where this volatility had come from. Something *weird* had just happened.\n\n\\#\n\nIn the investigations that followed, regulators would consider a couple of theories. Was this a \u201cfat-finger trade\u201d where a trader inadvertently placed a large sell order, triggering a domino effect of sorts where algos would in turn sell? Was this a well-coordinated cyberattack, aimed to cripple American institutions? Was it simply a dip exacerbated by high-frequency traders? Had Janet Yellen forgotten to change the printer toner?\n\nNobody knew. But five months after the flash crash, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint report that on May 6, 2010 the market was \u201cso fragmented and fragile that a single large trade could send stocks into a sudden spiral.\u201d They stated that a group called Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. had inadvertently played a role in the crash by initiating a sale of 75,000 E-Mini S&P contracts ($4.1 billion total) as a hedge to an existing position. This, the report said, coupled with the high-frequency traders trying to sell the long futures contracts they had just picked up from Waddell & Reed, led to a game of \u201chot potato\u201d where the contracts were resold to other HFTs.\n\nThe report though was leaving out a crucial player.\n\n\\#\n\nIn 2005, Navinder Sarao was living the dream. At 27 years old, he still lived with his parents in Hounslow, a working-class suburb outside of London, demanding tendies to be delivered to his bedroom by his sweet emigrant mother. To the people who knew him, Navinder, or Nav, was known to be quick-witted and quick to anger. He was dominant at Halo and FIFA, and he had a proclivity to focus on one task for hours and hours on end until he mastered it. He was almost obsessive in his interests.\n\nDespite still living with his parents, young Nav had aspirations. In 2006, he responded to an ad in the Evening Standard that read, \u201cWanted: futures traders. Must work well under pressure.\u201d That\u2019s it. That was the ad. And Nav, with no experience and a honey mustard-stained tie, went to the FutexLive headquarters\u2014a drab office situated above a supermarket 45 minutes outside London\u2014and successfully hid his Asperger\u2019s and got the job. He was now a professional trader.\n\nNav picked things up quickly. Realizing that he was surrounded by day-trading retards, he moved his desk to the corner of the shabby trading floor and bought a pair of noise-canceling headphones. He\u2019d found success trading E-mini S&P Futures, which is the primary futures trading vehicle for the S&P 500. And with his noise-canceling headphones, Nav would follow the orders that would enter and leave the markets. His coworkers would marvel at the autist in the corner and the returns he was regularly pulling in.\n\nThen 2008 happened. By the time the financial crisis was in full swing, Nav was almost thirty and had decided to leave Futex. He had accumulated $2 million from his trades the last couple of years, and he figured the most prudent move as a budding millionaire was to set up his command center in his bedroom. He still lived with his parents.\n\n\\#\n\nNav realized something early on in the mortgage crisis that not everyone else did. He realized that governments would be forced to step in and save these retarded institutions, and he knew the banks wouldn\u2019t be allowed to fall. And he bet $2 million\u2014his whole net worth at the time\u2014that he would be right. He made this bet on a Friday, and the following Monday, George Bush announced the TARP plan.\n\nPrices proceeded to recover 19% over the next couple of weeks, and Nav rode the wave and turned his $2 million into $15 million. Did he rest on his laurels? Fuck no, this kid\u2019s retarded! Nav didn\u2019t want a wife and a home with a couple of kids running around. He wanted GLORY.\n\n\\#\n\nAround 2010, the markets were seeing an influx in high-frequency trading, and Nav took personal insult to these robots. People were getting scalped by these algos, and those scalps belonged to Nav. Those profits were rightfully his.\n\nIn order to beat the robots, Nav decided to build his own robot. And unsurprisingly, fueled by Code Red and autism, Nav\u2019s algo worked magnificently. Pretty soon, he was regularly pulling in half a million a day. All the while living in a cramped bedroom of his parents\u2019 home that cost $300,000.\n\n\\#\n\nMay 6, 2010, started out as a regular day for Nav. The markets were sliding a bit, and Jim Cramer was flailing about his studio as though he were fighting a cloud of bats, but this was roughly on par for the time. Nav\u2019s algo was pumping E-mini sell orders into the market\u2014$200 million worth of orders to be exact\u2014which ultimately resulted in a loss of liquidity (don\u2019t ask me how this worked, I\u2019m still confused why my PLTR 12/11 40C aren\u2019t printing). At around 1:40 EST, or 6:40 in Hounslow, his mother called from the bottom of the steps to inform Nav that din-din was ready and would he please come down. \n\nSo Nav logged off.\n\nAnd exactly one minute after that, the market began to fall at a rate that had never seen before. Nav had no idea though; he was in an argument with his father about why he needed to chew with his mouth open in order to let the scalding tendy fumes out. A trillion dollars had been wiped from American markets, and the instigator of it all was too retarded to know what he\u2019d done. \n\nThe tendies were good though.\n\n\\#\n\nThe trillion-dollar loss turned out to be not that big of a deal. The DOW snapped back from the 9% freefall like a rubber band, like any stock that Andrew Left has deemed to be a casino. But the NYSE and NASDAQ officials proceeded to meet over the next couple of months to try and determine what caused the nosedive and rapid recovery. In the reports that they would write, regulators made no reference to manipulation and no reference to Nav. In fact, he wasn\u2019t even aware there was an investigation going on. He wasn\u2019t aware he did anything wrong.\n\nBut regulators eventually began to notice that Nav was canceling a lot of orders. The CFTC sent him an email and asked if he could explain what he\u2019d been up to. What was the reason for his canceling an obscene number of orders? That\u2019s what big banks did. And that\u2019d usually be fine and all, but Nav was a singular trader and that made it suspicious. \n\nNav wrote back to the CFTC explaining in careful terms that he had nothing to apologize for and that the CFTC could kiss his ass. He actually sent that. He told the CFTC to kiss his ass. Which, in hindsight, might\u2019ve been a bad idea but the regulators were still too stupid and boomery to charge him with anything at the time. Nav would\u2019ve gotten away with it too if it weren\u2019t for a blabbermouth desk trader in Chicago who months later reported a different block of Nav\u2019s trades to the CFTC, rekindling the case against Nav.\n\nThe investigation and case were dragged out over months and years, and I know 99% of you were too impatient to get this far, so I\u2019ll give the cliff notes for the rest. Basically, Nav would eventually be charged with \u201cspoofing,\u201d which is the purchase of a large block of orders with the intent to cancel them. Spoofing artificially drives prices higher or lower. So the FBI and other concerned parties showed up on the doorstep of Nav\u2019s Hounslow townhome in 2015, and he was extradited to the U.S. The judge learned he was worth $50 million, so he set bail to $7.5 million. Curiously enough though, Nav couldn\u2019t access the $50 million or pay bail, and it was later determined that he\u2019d somehow lost the fortune, seemingly to various shady investment advisors who promised to keep his money safe. (I personally like to think he\u2019s stashed his earnings into a Caribbean account and that he\u2019ll return to his private island once things blow over)\n\nOver the next couple of months, Nav worked with investigators and taught them how market abuse happens. He was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s by a prison doctor, and the judge, sensing the moral dilemma of incarcerating an autist, and sensing Nav had received punishment enough from being scammed out of his $50 million, recommended a year of house arrest. \n\nSo Nav is currently serving his year of house arrest in the same bedroom where he amassed $50 million. But now he\u2019s penniless at 41. \n\nTLDR: Some autist beats the system, but the casino is angry and creates new rules to retroactively punish him for his winnings.", "id": "kb1vz9", "created_utc": 1607689858.0, "score": 769, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Almost spit out my cereal reading \u201cJim Cramer fighting a cloud of bats\u201d", "score": 224, "replies": [{"body": "WE CAN\u2019T TAKE CALLERS HERE, THIS IS BAT COUNTRY!!!", "score": 58, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35196352005004883}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2261335253715515}, {"body": "Can we make this guy a mod?
