If you're selling a covered call and your shares get called away *you're paying more for the shares* so you're actually losing money.

On top of this if you did buy it on APR 23 after assignment for 279 and sold a 10% CC on that over a month again you'd basically have gotten no premium and you'd have barely cleared assignment by a week. My guess is however that you want to play SPY and get more premium so you're not shooting for 10% OTM (which is pretty far) but maybe 5\\~7% which would have seen you assigned multiple times this year while also having to come up with the difference again and again.\n\nSo again, how do you finance this?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Whats the difference between this and buying the same amount of shares monthly?\n\nWell, in percentages then, you've made 10% plus say 1%. So 11%. The stock has gone up 22%. I am asking you basically can you finance this internally to itself. When you DCA *you don't buy the same number of shares, you put in the same amount of money* but in your case you need to buy at least 100 shares, period, for this to work.\n\nThis is not an averaging because unless you're \"building\" up to 100 shares over time and then risking them all just to do it again you're lagging. This is especially true the more spaced out your dividend; if you got assigned your shares the month before the dividend you can't afford, internal to your system, another 100 shares. That's the problem.\n\nI get that you keep explaining that it is like DCA but DCA specifically does *not* aim to use an actual set number of shares (hence DOLLAR cost averaging, not SHARE cost averaging) so you're basically burning yourself because you need *constant reserves* but in an ironic bid the greater your external reserves, especially in DCA for dividends, the lower your returns over time. \n\nI understand your explanations perfectly but I am having trouble trying to figure out how you think a non-specific system integrates into a specific-system that requires basically a very large reserve fund to work. You have to have enough funds in your reserve fund for any type of sudden increase beyond your own expectations and then the longer dated your CC the greater the risk (and premium) so your best bet for these wouldn't be monthly anyway, probably quarterly, and specifically in the highest IV environments you can get.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWhen you DCA you may buy 10 shares one month and 50 the next depending on the price and maybe only 1 in the next month. That's extreme but follow me here. If you lose 100 of the shares due to the price increasing the DCA buying power you had goes down so the ability to ensure you have enough to DRIP successfully over time goes through the floor. The main problem is that if you're going to do this you would do it with very high premium risks which are longer plays and thus have greater odds of assignment because upfront cash is worth more (Time-Val Money) so ultimately this collapses on itself backwards: You either have to risk what you cannot afford or you have to collect and reinvest at a loss in order to protect the dividend itself.\n\nThis basically sounds like a Wheel with two replacement spokes that don't work as well.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your assumption is backwards. I am assuming you are writing as many covered calls as possible. This means that your risk is multiplied because if you lose 1,000 shares the costs are linear but scalar to your loss so your ability to replace these shares is diminished. In essence what really occurs is a cataclysm that you cannot cover because you have to keep these \"reserves\" relative to the actual risk of loss which means either a lower investment or a larger reserve pool that scales likely faster than your earning power.\n\nBasically your problem lies in your financing structure.

Exactly when it is too high to keep reserves to protect this strategy is unknown to me and I won't interfere in your model but I imagine it is probably lower than 60%. \n\nBasically if you have to build a trench and a moat and a castle to protect a hen house you're probably better off without the hens.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You shouldn't be telling me to backtest this.

The only company which comes within spitting distance of that figure on a reasonably regular basis is Apple, followed by Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil.

It is absolutely ubiquitous everywhere, and your gripe about Linux is only meaningful to a tiny sliver of people. Further, their revenue has grown 41.5% over the past five years.

You absolutely cannot reasonably compare a company with a $608B market cap to some tiny biotech waiting on FDA approval for some possible blockbuster drug. You need to compare apples to apples, and for companies of this size, you cannot look for confirmation of your bias.\n\n> And this ignores that they will be collecting revenue from insurance. And HVAC. And solar. And FSD revenue. And taxis. And semis. And packs, if they choose to sell them, and on and on and on and on.\n\nFor one thing, your hypothetical did not include any of these other lines of business. Further, you had better hope they do not diversify into all of those things. At that point, they will be valued strictly upon their performance as a business.

I've worked off and on in transportation, in some form or another for over a decade. I absolutely, 100% guarantee that you're talking straight out of your ass and have no idea how much money UPS is raking in off Amazon.\n\nMaybe you've seen a BoL or two that show some absurd discounted rates, but that is not even the tip of the iceberg for where the money comes from.\n\nExample. My company has major contracts with Becton Dickinson and Abbott Nutrition. On their individual shipments, they get roughly a 75-90% discount, depending on distance from the home service center. But Becton pays out the ass for us to leave ten empty trailers at their facility at all times and for us to do same day swaps within 4 hours of notifying us that they're ready. They also pay heavily for their one day a week of five scheduled swaps.\n\nAbbott pays significant fees for up to three live unloads at our cross dock per day.\n\nSo while that little bill of lading for your mom's 16\" big black dildo may say they're only paying $1.75 to ship it instead of the standard $17.50, UPS is making their money by being paid to leave equipment on-site for Amazon to load at their leisure.\n\nIn shipping, there is no such thing as a \"loss leader\" because margins are already razor thin.

There are some parts of possible deals with FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Amazon I do not know about but I think what I said is an educated conclusion.  I am really kind of winging this comment so I don't know how coherent and concise it will be. Anyways...\n\nHere's what I do know about UPS and Amazon. It is a huge portion of total packages shipped out, especially through the holiday season. They cost of shipping an Amazon package through the UPS network is a fraction of the cost as packages sent by normal customers. Like you said yourself, margins are already razor thin, so at the very least extreme discounted rates make them even smaller. The most profitable segments for UPS (FedEx as well) is our small businesses. A lot of focus for sales and marketing has shifted in past years from big business to small business be sure of the larger profit margins.\n\nFedEx at at least one point (I think they did it twice though) has dropped out of delivering Amazon packages. I assume this is due to losing money and possibly the additional stress those packages put on their delivery network (their one-time deliveries decreased quite a bit in recent years). Seems odd for them to do that if they had such a 'cherry deal' with Amazon. However, they jumped right back in their deal with Amazon almost immediately. My management has said that the only thing worse than possibly losing money with Amazon, is having the U.S.'s largest retailer work solely with your main competitor. \n\nYou may be right that UPS has some amazing deal with Amazon and they are making a good bit of money. However, it seems more likely that UPS and FedEx are just locked in battle using Amazon to remain in front of customers rather than give any of that edge to the other guy. Also a big point that I do know has circulated through UPS management many times is that we are very afraid of Amazon transitioning into a shipping carrier of their own. They have yet to make it work on a large scale. \n\nBut, UPS and FedEx would be completely screwed if that were to happen so they are proving to Amazon that they are perfectly capable of delivering their packages even if it means they lose a decent chunk of profits to so.\n\nI honestly think it's a combination of UPS getting some sort of Amazon deal in addition to them taking a hit on margins to stay in front of customers and keep Amazon out of their territory.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "FedEx told Amazon to piss up a rope because Amazon was rolling out their own fleet to compete and FedEx is so well diversified in the freight industry they don't need Amazon to be successful. They do literally everything.

Their LTL wing was through buying a single national carrier, Overnite Transportation. FedEx bought several small regional carriers along with two national carriers (American Freightways and Watkins).\n\nSo, like I said, you don't know what your talking about.
