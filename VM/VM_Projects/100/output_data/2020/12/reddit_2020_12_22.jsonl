Remember that diversification is for preserving wealth and concentration is needed for building wealth and you are obviously still very much in the building wealth stage of your life. And as your portfolio grows over the years, it will likely naturally become more diversified as you naturally discover more companies that you understand and believe in rather than trying to force in more diversification just for the sake of it which is what you are currently trying to do.\n\nHere are some quotes from some highly successful investors to help drive this point further:\n\n* \"Investors have been so oversold on diversification that fear of having too many eggs in one basket has caused them to put far too little into companies they thoroughly know and far too much in others which they know nothing at all. It never seems to occur to them that buying a company without having sufficient knowledge of it may be even more dangerous than having inadequate diversification.\" - Phil Fisher\n* \"It is a mistake to think that one limits one\u2019s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence. One\u2019s knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself entitled to put full confidence.\" - John Maynard Keynes\n* \"If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is going to be a terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea.

The stock market won\u2019t earn you enough to live off of with only $10k invested (and even if it did the taxes would be killer), so plan on letting that money sit there and grow until you need it or are retired.

Right now with weakness in the market and no positive catalysts coming for any of them they\u2019re all going to be trending downward.  As meme stocks they\u2019re all overvalued, and without some sort of positive news to hype them up people and investment firms tend to be a bit more realistic and take out profits while they\u2019re there.  But Nio has a potential positive catalyst in Nio Day on January 9th, which should cause the stock to start trending up after the new year (and after that it\u2019ll peak and drop).  Tesla has a potential positive catalyst coming up the first week of January (January 4th maybe?) when they report their 4th quarter sales, and again January 27th when they report 4th quarter earnings.  I\u2019d expect the stock to start trending upwards after Christmas (Elon will probably put out a tweet to stir peoples\u2019 interest in the announcement a week or so ahead of time, especially if the news is good), fall after the delivery announcement, then start climbing again around the 20th only to fall around the 29th.  Workhorse has a potential positive catalyst whenever the USPS announces the new delivery truck contract, but only if they get a significant chunk of it.  If they don\u2019t get enough it will be a negative catalyst.

The trading day prior, the stock price was $1.60. They rejected a buyout of almost 330% premium because they felt **\u201cthe offer significantly undervalued Sorrento\u201d** and unanimously rejected it.

On March 12th, [someone had purchased ](https://imgur.com/a/rwStwJJ)3700 calls 250% out of the money.
