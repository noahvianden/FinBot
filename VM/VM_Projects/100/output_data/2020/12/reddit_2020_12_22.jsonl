Remember that diversification is for preserving wealth and concentration is needed for building wealth and you are obviously still very much in the building wealth stage of your life. And as your portfolio grows over the years, it will likely naturally become more diversified as you naturally discover more companies that you understand and believe in rather than trying to force in more diversification just for the sake of it which is what you are currently trying to do.\n\nHere are some quotes from some highly successful investors to help drive this point further:\n\n* \"Investors have been so oversold on diversification that fear of having too many eggs in one basket has caused them to put far too little into companies they thoroughly know and far too much in others which they know nothing at all. It never seems to occur to them that buying a company without having sufficient knowledge of it may be even more dangerous than having inadequate diversification.\" - Phil Fisher\n* \"It is a mistake to think that one limits one\u2019s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence. One\u2019s knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself entitled to put full confidence.\" - John Maynard Keynes\n* \"If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is going to be a terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea.

The stock market won\u2019t earn you enough to live off of with only $10k invested (and even if it did the taxes would be killer), so plan on letting that money sit there and grow until you need it or are retired.

Right now with weakness in the market and no positive catalysts coming for any of them they\u2019re all going to be trending downward.  As meme stocks they\u2019re all overvalued, and without some sort of positive news to hype them up people and investment firms tend to be a bit more realistic and take out profits while they\u2019re there.  But Nio has a potential positive catalyst in Nio Day on January 9th, which should cause the stock to start trending up after the new year (and after that it\u2019ll peak and drop).  Tesla has a potential positive catalyst coming up the first week of January (January 4th maybe?) when they report their 4th quarter sales, and again January 27th when they report 4th quarter earnings.  I\u2019d expect the stock to start trending upwards after Christmas (Elon will probably put out a tweet to stir peoples\u2019 interest in the announcement a week or so ahead of time, especially if the news is good), fall after the delivery announcement, then start climbing again around the 20th only to fall around the 29th.

The trading day prior, the stock price was $1.60. They rejected a buyout of almost 330% premium because they felt **\u201cthe offer significantly undervalued Sorrento\u201d** and unanimously rejected it.

On March 12th, [someone had purchased ](https://imgur.com/a/rwStwJJ)3700 calls 250% out of the money.

{"title": "[deleted by user]", "selftext": "[removed]", "id": "ki9o6s", "created_utc": 1608657756.0, "score": 207, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 330, "comments": [{"body": "Here\u2019s how I think about Tesla\u2019s valuation. Tesla\u2019s ambition is to grow revenues 50% per year through 2025 and achieve 10% net margins. The ambition was outlined in 2015, and so far they have grown revenue almost exactly by 50% annually and last quarter their net income margin was ~4% (this quarter it will probably be ~7%), so they are tracking well towards their goals (especially since they are building out 3 factories on 3 continents this year and next). If they achieve their ambition of 50% revenue growth, their revenue in 2025 will be around $240 billion. At 10% net income margin, that\u2019s $24 billion net income. If we assume 5% dilution in their share count per year, that\u2019s 1.4 billion fully diluted shares in existence by 2025, so the earnings per share is $16.94. If we assign a 90 price to earnings multiple (similar to Amazon today, which is the closest analogue of such a business success story), then Tesla will be worth $1,525 per share in 5 years, or an annual return of 19%.\n\nNow, of course, Tesla might fall short of their ambition. The worst Tesla has ever performed against any long term ambition they had is falling short of their delivery goals in 2018 due to stalled/slow Model 3 production ramp. They had been aiming for 500k sales in 2020 for many years (which no analysts or anyone on Wall Street believed), and after the Model 3 showed so much demand upon reveal, they accelerated the target to 2018. In 2018, they fell short of this target by 50%, but they will likely hit the target in 2020. So, let\u2019s do a scenario where Tesla does $120 billion revenue in 2025 (50% short of the $240 billion target) and 6.25% net income margins, and bump the price to earnings down for worse execution to 75. Then, Tesla would only be worth $397 per share in 2025, or an annual return of -9%. I don\u2019t view this scenario as very likely, as the Model 3 ramp was their only production ramp at the time and they did eventually accomplish their goals. Tesla will be doing several production ramps at the same time from here on out, and it is very unlikely that they all fall short by 50% simultaneously (in other words, they are diversified now). \n\nSo there you have it, if Tesla accomplishes their ambition, they\u2019ll return shareholders 19% per year, and if they fail as hard as they have ever failed, they will return -9% per year. Now you can assign likelihoods to each scenario to come up with your own price you think Tesla should be at. It is worth noting that Tesla may underperform the bad scenario (if every automaker put out plans like Volkswagen\u2019s aggressive plans and actually executed well on them) or outperform the good scenario (especially if they succeed in creating robotaxis or if governments ramp up support for EVs and accelerate the transition to EVs, or if you put some faith in their latest ambition of 50% not just through 2025 but through 2030), but these two scenarios are a good guide. I estimate that the market is currently valuing Tesla as if each scenario outlined above is equally likely, and outcomes worse or better than the two scenarios aren\u2019t currently reflected in the valuation.", "score": 466, "replies": [{"body": "You answered the question wrong.

To specify here. I mean a car that can navigate by itself in ALL situations. Pretty much you could remove steering wheel and that car could go anywhere you tell it.

That's why the announcement 'This year we are really are ready with FSD'  seems to be coming for the past 5 years every year.\n\nI am definitely not a person that says 'it will never happen'. It will but it will take much longer.\n\nThe robotaxis that will take quicker are the ones that drive in very limited area where every inch is mapped in great detail but these cars would be crap if you go outside that area. I believe that TESLA is doing the true AI approach that once it is ready will work anywhere I just think its a long way away.\n\nBtw, I saw the FSD Tesla youtube videos (several) and that just emphasizes my believe that we are a long way away. It is super impressive and I understand its BETA but holy cow people would get in a crazy amount of accidents and most of the cases I have seen weren't even any particular edge cases.\n\nAll that said I would love to have a FSD car immediately I am just being a realist.\n\nBatteries: As you can see with recent announcements there are so many things happening with new battery tech that could be completely disrupting and even established battery technology (especially in China) is already cheaper than Tesla's batteries although there are currently no official price for TESLA battery but its estimated a bit below $100/kwh.\n\nSo you are claiming people had the same choice of electric cars (besides Tesla) 2-5 years ago as they are starting to do now. I hope I am not the only one that disagrees with you here.\n\nThere was super little EV competition until now and the coming Years. Some of the EV's from a few years ago were also only compliance cars. Way more models are released now than in the past and they are coming from established car makers (Ford, VW, Audi, Mercedes, GM, BMW, Porsche etc.). Not even talking about all the Chinese automakers some of which will ship internationally. Than there are a million SPAC EV makers and even Toyota will bring out a decent EV next year and they don't even believe in EV's.\n\nSo to say the EV competition several years ago was the same as it is now / near future is completely wrong in my opinion.\n\nFor tons of people 250mile range is plenty. U.S. is not the only EV market even though thats what some people seem to believe. Europe/Asia has different needs and this is also why Tesla is not even the No1 selling EV car in the EU anymore as they used to be the previous years.\n\nTo finish this up I believe TESLA is a great company and without them there would be no / very little push to EV's which I believe is way better for the environment (depending where the electricity is from, how batteries are made etc.) but I think the days where people only looked at TESLA when they think about EV is over or will be over very soon as there are just so many choices coming up and Europe already proofs this by having other models on No1 for EV than Tesla.\n\nI just think that it will be much tougher for TESLA going forward but competition is great for consumers and EV's are a huge growth market.\n\nWe should check this back in a few years.

They have already looked into all battery tech, have no fear once something new is viable/superior for their cars they will switch quickly.\n\nCompetition: I'm all for competition(own a nissan leaf and model 3), but right now Tesla is 5 maybe 10 years ahead of the competition.  The whole 250miles is plenty is the thinking other car companies use to justify their crappy EV cars.  Add in cold weather, a couple errands, charging to 100% is bad for the battery, forgot to charge last night, a roof rack, low tire pressure, etc etc and that 250 ideal miles quickly becomes much much less(want to go on a ski trip?, nope better have a ICE car)....in order for EVs to eliminate ICE cars it will have to match it's range/price/convenience and Tesla is the only EV maker taking that seriously with the most range, focus on battery supply/price and super charger network....they still have a way to go but they will be the first company to offer a 500 mile range affordable EV by at least 5 years and this is a very very big deal.\n\nGlad you see the bigger picture about how Tesla has forced the rest of the car industry to adapt or go out of business.  But  you still underestimate how far ahead Tesla really is and how difficult it will be for the other players to catch up.  No one else is involved in battery development like Tesla(besides making batteries Tesla is actually mining battery minerals themselves), that is a huge cost advantage...The real problem for the big car companies is their entire business model is centered around the ICE vehicle, the dealerships and finance(loans/leases/warranty)....ICE vehicles require much more maintenance and warranty work than EVs do, and they have a much shorter lifetime, the only limiting factor on EVs lifetime are the batteries, so it wont be uncommon to see 500k mileage Teslas soon and future battery tech could push that to a million miles.  ICE cars are good for what, 100-200k miles if your lucky, lets not forget all the money required to get much passed 100k....This will destroy most big car companies because if they start really pushing EVs they also shutoff the majority of their historical profits(very little profits in making cars as you know, unless you highly vertically integrated like Tesla)...and why no car company has really tried to take on Tesla to date, not because they cant but because once they see the end financial results they just push compliance cars and pay Tesla the regulatory credits, and they still come out way ahead making ICE vechicles(for now anyway)....I'll guarantee most big Car companies will not be able to convert to EVs without declaring bankruptcy or being bailed out first due to this...Allowing Tesla to move further ahead.\n\nOh and to add the energy utility ability of a 500 mile range/1million mile lifetime cars is the biggest deal very few can comprehend...it will make Tesla 10X bigger than Apple when they execute on that but its something few can comprehend unless you've ever dealt with solar/house batteries.

{"title": "PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/22", "selftext": "Told you 25 was the bottom\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr\\_technical\\_analysis\\_from\\_a\\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)\n\nWe are going to 40-45, mid January. Originally was targeting beginning of the year because we looked like we were moving 50% faster than the run-up of NIO and about 100% faster than TSLA , now it looks like the moves are about the same as NIO, so a target of 40-45 to late January is a safer bet. This is why I told you guys to use 1/15 and 5/21 calls, because you can roll those with less theta decay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ayjurt9xr661.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=aabc196dfa12af7353fb341180c3630f7123f8d7\n\nI rolled half of my 1/15 30 strikes to now 2/19 30 strikes with a slight hit (10% off purchase price) and increased the 2/19 30 strike position by 100%.  Basically increased total option positions by 50% to now 60k. Holding about 130k in shares.\n\nI expect us to be pinned around 27-28 before Christmas, then we'll have another run up to 31-33 when the shorts unwind for the gamma pin on monday/tuesday. Then a pinning of around 29-31 before year end. Then we'll have a large rally for the first 2-3 weeks of January, maybe ahead or after the public demonstration of PLTR.\n\nWe are in a game where we push up the value of companies so they clear multiple market cap and liquidity hurdles to be included in various ETFs/indexes, these then create a base level of support, such as with NIO and TESLA, the ultimate of which is inclusion in the S&P500, then really there is not much to the game left. This is why i recommend you sell your TSLA and get into PLTR, because the game is only getting started with PLTR. In the meanwhile we have to contend with various antics of MM who are trying to make sure options expire worthless, which drive interim moves.\n\nIf you can't handle the volatility, just buy shares. If you are playing options, be very aware of option expiry dates, gamma positioning through max pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1: Getting a lot of comments on insider selling post lock-up. It is absolute bullshit. I know you guys can't read, but its literally right in the S-1**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u34w149jv661.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=68ba8763bffc5616f80e2e981d703a03ec95bd4a\n\n60%+ of the company is owned by Thiel, Karp, Cohen, and SOMPO (A Japanese Strategic who has a JV with Palantir in Japan), none of whom will sell major stakes in the company any time soon.\n\nOut of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which may need to liquidate due to fund life terms. Half of that is probably going out next year as they appear to be cross fund investments by all these VCs, the earlier vintage funds will have liquidation pressures while the later funds can wait. So maybe half these shares need to be sold in 2021 post lock-up.\n\nEmployee option is peanuts. The only thing being sold post lock-up is 10% by the three VCs (Foundrs Fund/Thiel, 8VC and DTS. That is nowhere close to 1 billion shares, it\u2019s closer to 250 million shares or about 4 days trading volume, which is no big deal. They will be exiting that 10% over likely the course of 6 month/1 year, it won't even make a dent in the market liquidity.

The earlier funds will likely need to liquidate. 20% is owned by sompo a strategic Japanese insurance company which is creating a JV in Japan. \n\nOut of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which need to liquidate due to fund life terms. Half of that is probably going out next year as they appear to be cross fund investments by all these VCs, the earlier vintage funds will have liquidation pressures while the later funds can wait. \n\nThe 60% that is owned by Thiel, Karl and Sompo is not going to be sold. Employee option is peanuts. 20% is the float that is traded already. That leaves about 10% by the VCs.
