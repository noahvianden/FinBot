They don't actually hold the debts themselves, so if bankruptcies or defaults occur, that doesn't hit them.  Most people don't understand that though. \n\nTheir revenues are huge and have been growing.  \n\nThe detractors - and why the stock price is low - is because of the narrative that they've just had their best year and that future years won't be as strong.  Even if that's true, so what?  An \"off\" year for Rocket would be a dream year for any other their competitors.  And I believe that even if 2021 is an off year, as bears suggest, Rocket, being the biggest and highly efficient, will just thrive anyway the same way that big box stores and Amazon thrive when times get tough for their smaller, weaker competitors.\n\nIt's a bit stunning that Rocket gets no respect when they are basically a mix of fintech like SQ and LMND which have both exploded.  I think Rocket's day will come when markets remember that value matters.  \n\nNormally, with the narrative about future growth being slowed, a stock like RKT would be drilled lower and lower.  In this case though, it's hard to short them on fundamentals, plus last ER they announced provisions for for a monstrous buyback.  It's unclear how much of that provision they'll use or under what circumstances.  But knowing that they have arranged the right to potentially buy back half (I think?) the float would make it quite risky to short.  The buyback announcement itself was a bit interesting.  They offered a chunk of the company as an IPO in 2020 and the consensus was that was worth about $18/share.  So for them to effectively take in $18/share one day, and be willing to buy back shares at approximately the same level the next, is unusual.  \n\nSo thus we have it locked in a very tight range between people betting that future quarters will be merely \"strong\" instead of last year's which were \"super-strong\", but also not willing to sell it lower and get crushed by buybacks.  For all we know, maybe the stable price is a result of buyback activity.  \n\nI use 3 position sizes, small/medium/large and my RKT hold is size large.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "RKT is a very profitable and growing company with a strong market share.
