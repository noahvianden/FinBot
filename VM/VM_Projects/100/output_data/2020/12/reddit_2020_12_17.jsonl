{"title": "I think TSLA S&P500 is the ultimate trade", "selftext": "Remember how $TSLA did a secondary on Dec 09 that brought the stock down from $650 to $585? And how the next day it went up almost 12% to $630? They're DESPERATE trying to bring the stock price down. Tesla knows that it will be hard to capture new talent if their stock trades at their 2025 earnings... that means no returns for those engineers if the stock goes down from here or trades sideways.\n\nBut see how hard it was to keep the stock under $600? Well there are a bunch of traders and fund managers that know that $600 is an important level of support and that keeping the stock down would lead to a chain selling reaction... they can't afford that. So they've been doing their best efforts to keep the stock below $650 and above $600.\n\n**There are three forces at play here:** momentum hedge fund managers that bought shares in November and have been selling this week to secure profits; Tesla which tried to hit the stock hard selling 5 BILLION dollars in shares in ONE DAY (who does that if you want to keep the stock up?); and WEALTHY TRADERS that don't wanna be bag holders and are waiting for FRIDAY to send this stock to the moon.\n\nAll traders until now have been bag holders and funds. These traders will try to push the stock on Friday as far up as they can, I can see it going to $700 premarket and get a 20% day after that. **THE REAL WAR BEGINS NOW.**\n\nI'm all in on this. It will be insane but we must fight like Spartans and I wanted to post this to give some perspective, because some of you might've felt discouraged by the couple last red days. But I think we can win this.\n\n!!!!\n\n**AROO**\n\n!!!!\n\nEDIT:\n\nMany champs saying that these funds have been buying up until now and will exchange the shares on addition date. First, there are trading funds that wanted to capitalize momentum but here we're talking the index tracking funds, these index funds don't wanna beat the index they must and want to imitate it, so they will try to add TSLA at as close of a price as possible to official closing price on Friday 12/18. Second, it is ILLEGAL as per SEC regulations to cross sell shares between funds even if the funds are own by the same company (E.g. Vanguard), SHARES MUST PASS THROUGH MARKET. That's why when Ark invest shows that they sold Tesla shares they show the shares sold per fund, or if one fund buys and the other sells they show in the trading report because the shares must pass through market, they can't simply move them from one fund to the other.

I had to endure reading Spanish and German job posts, so you know this shit is legit. If you don't believe me, look into the URLs I pasted in the comments. Mods banned my post for having too many links pasted in a post, so deal with it.\n\nAm I saying PLTR's platforms will be as crucial (or maybe more) to a company as Microsoft's while having only 1/35 of its current market cap? Yes. Is it great news that many of these new companies are European since the brr dollar won't be worth shit in the next years? Yes. Am I saying PLTR will moon while we hear news about all these new clients? Yes. Can you ban me if PLTR doesn't hit 50$ by end of 2021? Yes.\n\nEDIT: I can post them here as an edit, right gay mods? ;)\n\nABBVIE: [https://careers.abbvie.com/abbvie/jobs/2008000?lang=en-us&src=JB-11040](https://careers.abbvie.com/abbvie/jobs/2008000?lang=en-us&src=JB-11040)\n\nAccenture: [https://www.accenture.com/es-es/careers/jobdetails?id=00842864\\_en](https://www.accenture.com/es-es/careers/jobdetails?id=00842864_en)\n\nAT&T: [https://www.att.jobs/job/-/senior-advanced-analytics-data-visualization-and-automation/117/18035963?utm\\_source=indeed.com\\_organic&utm\\_medium=organic&utm\\_campaign=organic&utm\\_content=job\\_aggregator&dclid=CIz53pnR1O0CFcPvdwodQ-YCNA](https://www.att.jobs/job/-/senior-advanced-analytics-data-visualization-and-automation/117/18035963?utm_source=indeed.com_organic&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=job_aggregator&dclid=CIz53pnR1O0CFcPvdwodQ-YCNA)\n\nBMW: [https://www.bmwgroup.jobs/gb/en/jobfinder/job-description.18962.DE.Munich.CorporateStrategy.MarketResearch.html?mode=job&iis=Indeed&iisn=Indeed.com](https://www.bmwgroup.jobs/gb/en/jobfinder/job-description.18962.DE.Munich.CorporateStrategy.MarketResearch.html?mode=job&iis=Indeed&iisn=Indeed.com)\n\nBOEING: [https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=eeba4b561f31102d](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=eeba4b561f31102d)\n\nErnst & Young: [https://eygbl.referrals.selectminds.com/experienced-opportunities/jobs/financial-crime-technology-consulting-manager-148052](https://eygbl.referrals.selectminds.com/experienced-opportunities/jobs/financial-crime-technology-consulting-manager-148052)\n\nKPMG: [https://us-jobs.kpmg.com/careers/JobDetail?jobId=52552&utm\\_medium=%2522mcloud-jobads%2522&utm\\_campaign=&utm\\_content=Senior%2520Associate%252C%2520Federal%2520Data%2520Analytics&utm\\_term=52552&srcCat=Internet&specSrc=Indeed](https://us-jobs.kpmg.com/careers/JobDetail?jobId=52552&utm_medium=%2522mcloud-jobads%2522&utm_campaign=&utm_content=Senior%2520Associate%252C%2520Federal%2520Data%2520Analytics&utm_term=52552&srcCat=Internet&specSrc=Indeed)\n\nMerck: [https://www.stepstone.de/stellenangebote--Lead-Machine-Learning-Engineer-Darmstadt-Merck-KGaA-Darmstadt-Germany--6861972-inline.html?suid=91cd9beb-6e38-4fe6-b51a-80eafd0bcf23&rltr=1\\_1\\_25\\_dynrl\\_m\\_0\\_0\\_0\\_0](https://www.stepstone.de/stellenangebote--Lead-Machine-Learning-Engineer-Darmstadt-Merck-KGaA-Darmstadt-Germany--6861972-inline.html?suid=91cd9beb-6e38-4fe6-b51a-80eafd0bcf23&rltr=1_1_25_dynrl_m_0_0_0_0)\n\nUnicredit: [https://recruiting.unicreditgroup.eu/sap/bc/ui5\\_ui5/ucihr/ercuiunr/index.html?sap-theme=zuci\\_ercui\\_belize@https://recruiting.unicreditgroup.eu/sap/public/bc/themes/\\~client-270/&sap-language=DE&sap-client=270#/Posting/fe089c68-4b05-1edb-8e91-78daa96c4012](https://recruiting.unicreditgroup.eu/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/ucihr/ercuiunr/index.html?sap-theme=zuci_ercui_belize@https://recruiting.unicreditgroup.eu/sap/public/bc/themes/~client-270/&sap-language=DE&sap-client=270#/Posting/fe089c68-4b05-1edb-8e91-78daa96c4012)\n\n**TLDR**: **Fresh Foundry clients are ABBVIE, Accenture, AT&T, BMW, Boeing, Ernst & Young, KPMG, Merck, Unicredit.
