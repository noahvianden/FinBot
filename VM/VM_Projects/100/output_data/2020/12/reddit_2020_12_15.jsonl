[**Price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500**](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) \\- currently is 32.95, and it is higher than the average ratio of 15.85 which is apparently not a good sign. During the dot-com bubble it was 32.9. But we need to look at the other indicators.\n2. [**Shiller P/E Ratio**](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/table/by-year). This indicator addresses the market inflation and is considered more accurate. Currently it is at 30.27. This is a lot higher than the average P/E ratio over the last 100 years of 16.75. Average over the last 20 years is 25.6 which makes things seem more reasonable.\n3. **The Buffet Indicator** which is higher than what it was during the  **dot-com bubble** crash. \n4. **Returns you get in market vs other asset classes** \\- 3.03% is the average market return. The growth in these earnings requires adding the average US GDP growth which is between 2 and 3 %, so let's say 2.5%. Therefore, 2.5%+ 3.03% = **5.53**%. Meaning if we buy stocks now we can expect an average annualized return of 5.53%. Since the 1920s the average was 10%. What this means, apparently, is that because stocks are at very high prices their returns have gone dramatically lower. Compared to other asset classes such as bonds/banks are very low.\n\nWhat this points to is the market being overvalued. However, since banks and bonds have low interest rates, lower than inflation, you end up losing money, this is why investors are still investing in the stock market even though prices and indicators are showing they are very high. There is nothing else to do with money. \n\n**Therefore, the one indicator we need to keep our eye on are interest rates.** If that goes up it will change things.  \n\nSo I guess keep those treasury interest date announcements in your calendar and understand in the weeks leading up to it market sentiment may move in to correction territory.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "But the Fed isn\u2019t going to raise interest for 3 years, right?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "MaRkEt Is FoRwArD lOoKiNg!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "wait what \n\noh wait i get it now\n\nso we're all just like little cynical soothsayers", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3352818787097931}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30795979499816895}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10191436111927032}], "tickers": ["bubble", "inflation", "crash", "gdp"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "When everyone puts their money into the stock market as a type of savings account.

Edge/object detection also appears to be the only thing lidar can do since it can't see color which is where the cameras come in. Side note, Elon has also talked about using \"4d\", or in other words, figuring out what has changed between adjacent frames instead of analyzing each frame individually.

Maybe you could help me understand something about the lidar approach that has always confused me. I've never understood the approach that you and Waymo seem to be taking where you map out locations before you ever put an AV on those roads. What has always confused me is why would you map out the area before if your AV is supposed to be able to successfully navigate an area given similar inputs that were already collected using a human-driven vehicle with lidar? Ultimately both the human-driven vehicle and AV share the same sensors used to collect data on the world around it, which just makes the human version seem redundant and pointless. The only answer I've been able to come up with on my own is that the AV are incapable of handling or processing the complexity or size of data taken in from the lidar + cameras. Therefore you use the human-driven lidar system to map out a rough \"sketch\" of the location to which the AV would compare its data to in order to cut out static objects(buildings, trees, edges of road) which would reduce complexity and load on the neural networks. Using this system the AV could then focus it's neural networks on dynamic objects(other cars, people, dogs, leaves) that it has to predict the future of. Is this a good interpretation for why you and Waymo map out areas before using human drivers, and then geofence the area?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It saves compute but you are getting ~100% accuracy on static object detection. With the human maps, you can pre-label everything and more importantly all the relative distances with ~100% accuracy. Then when you run the AV stack in real-time, you can just compare the point clouds like a look-up table. Then you can compare the two lidar maps and localize exactly where you are on the map with insanely high accuracy too. \n\nThis takes out a good amount of engineering and reduces things that can go wrong. Debugging/Triaging within a combinatorial space is probably the hardest part of AVs, and reducing the amount of engineering you have to do is the smartest thing to do. The only issue is that this is hard coding and doesn't scale well.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Very interesting. Is there any talk at Argo AI or other companies that use lidar to switch to just cameras? It seems like the bet on lidar is based on either a camera-based vision system being inaccurate, or a combination of better algorithms and better data processing making it so lidar on the autonomous vehicle can operate without a predetermined map. It just seems very hard for geofencing to scale, and even if AV+ lidar could operate without geofencing it would end up just being more expensive than only cameras.

We are 1-2 years out to commercializing their technology. Princeton lightwave Lidars will be a fraction of the price of velodyne, higher point cloud density, lower power consumption, and higher frequency of scans. Despite all the CMU hoopla that management likes to trout, our real advantage is our lidar. \n\nAlthough mapping geofences areas is a lot of manual work, it\u2019s more deterministic than engineering work.

This is just a matter of GM focusing on today, while Tesla is focusing on the future.

The new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund payouts come well below the hundreds of millions in annual cash CenturyLink enjoyed under past programs, endangering a stable revenue source. Filling the void with more winning bids: new players like cable operator Charter Communications and SpaceX. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald) \n\nMany saw this as a huge blow to revenues, but this was business that sharps believe LUMN did not want to win due to the low margins. \n\nPlus they have more lucrative contracts already locked up and we all know Elon has no problem running in the red to build a business. \n\nActually there were more bidders for ever for this business and the FCC had set aside $16B for this auction and only had to use $9.6B - it was a race to the bottom. \n\nThe average 10-day volume before the dip after hours was 10MM shares a day. \n\nThe next day over 16MM volume and the stock rebounded - it was a buying opportunity for the heavy hitters to add on the dip and they did. \n\nToday the overall market pulled back and LUMN was up again on higher than normal volume - 13MM. \n\nIt is being acquired by institutions, also the dividend is very attractive for these types of investors that hold 5-7 years. \n\nThe play on LUMN is 5G fiber and here is how:\n\nCenturyLink can thrive in a 5G world\nDespite this massive, long-term decline, it could see an upswing as analysts forecast an increase in profits. Why? Put simply, instead of destroying CenturyLink, 5G may have saved the company.\n\nAs it so happens, 5G networks remain heavily dependent on fiber. From an infrastructure perspective, the biggest difference between the previous 4G LTE standard and the current 5G is the number of cells needed. Instead of one cell every few miles, 5G requires numerous small cells located close to one another. \n\nAs a result, carriers have exponentially more cells, and they all need to connect to their networks. To do this, carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will need CenturyLink's fiber. Hence, instead of fiber becoming obsolete, it may become more important than ever to the telecom industry.\n\nWhich brings me to:\n\nAn old company with a new name\nWill Healy (Lumen Technologies): The fiber company long known as CenturyLink has become an afterthought as consumers increasingly embrace wireless. Moreover, some investors might assume that a wireless telco industry makes fiber networks obsolete.\n\nThey should think again.\n\nThe exponentially higher number of 5G antennas will depend in large measure on fiber networks for backhaul. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) will also rely heavily on fiber to enable edge computing.\n\n\nAdditionally, Lumen is also well positioned for a popular Democratic program -- rural broadband. Based in Monroe, Louisiana, Lumen has used its network to offer high-speed internet to some rural areas. This could help Joe Biden, who has pledged broadband for \"every American\" in an effort to reach rural voters. Biden also worked to expand broadband access when he was vice president.\n\nLumen stock has experienced a secular decline since 2007 as consumers dropped landlines and cable TV. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than eight does not seem so cheap given tepid earnings growth. Furthermore, missed deadlines on SEC filings and a falling dividend have also hurt the stock.\n\nHowever, even the reduced annual dividend of $1.00 per share still yields just over 9%. Also, with a free cash flow of $803 million exceeding the $291 million cost of its dividend in its most recent quarter, the payout should remain safe.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, Lumen stock could benefit as the company repurposes its network to support 5G and IoT. Nonetheless, if a Biden administration subsidizes rural broadband, Lumen could receive an additional boost.\n\nIn summary, this is not Century Link anymore, it\u2019s something much different and ready to be a 5G PLAYER.  \n\nI would have YOLO\u2019d this one as well as I have 140 January 2022 $15c at an average of .50. \n\nI believe this has the legs and from what I laid out here think $30-40 could be realistic by Q4 2021. \n\nLots of value and the big boys know it and are acquiring it.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32022804021835327}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04906173795461655}], "tickers": ["ups", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4292391240596771}, {"body": "And it\u2019s from 23.30 down to 22.90!

{"title": "PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/15", "selftext": "So I did an update a week ago telling you why PLTR at 25 was likely the bottom. I also told you to get the hell out of the 12/11-12/18 options as those would expire worthless.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr\\_technical\\_analysis\\_from\\_a\\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)\n\nnow I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks. I am cutting down the number of words I am writing because it has come to my attention from comments in my previous posts that a lot of you guys can't read. So I am going to keep it even more basic.\n\nWe are now approaching where TSLA and NIO were after their first initial rally, correction and consolidation before the second leg rally which then forms the symmetrical triangle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzim1gl5ke561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e35a306b95241794ff00e6c69b14e6285bae886\n\nAgain, this was the same chart for Tesla for the first phase of the run-up and transition to the second run-up. The slight skew of the triangle doesn't matter, what matters is you see a narrowing of the band before the upward movement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obkgayjake561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c53d79f93f758ee43d8b46c61646088f1f7293\n\nNow we look at option pricing. Option deltas  are the most attractive that I have seen on PLTR for almost 1+ month now. These tell me that there are very few buyers of call options at this point and we are in a lull before periods of significant more option buying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v2btc0pyje561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e01729545a596866a3b062935bee7d25f6ebe41\n\nWe are about to start the explosive second run phase of Palantir and my target still mid to low 40s by end of the year/early next year.  Again, don't be surprised if we still dip down to around 23. But the downside is largely done. This is of course assuming we don't get a massive stock market crash for which I have small amounts of hedges on VIX calls that are rolling on a monthly basis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1orczd5xje561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef76cf4df7324f0779a1949f980dd78d29f2f150\n\nTLR: go long PLTR now, risk reward is quite favorable. 23 is the lowest it can probably go in the short term. You are already seeing doubters on PLTR on WSB. This means from a psychological stand-point, most would be sellers are already gone. The market is now open widely to incremental buyers. I bought some 12/24 calls at the 30 strike and added more to my 5/21 50 strike.\n\n**Update 12/16.
