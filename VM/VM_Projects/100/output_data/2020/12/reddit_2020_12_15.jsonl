[**Price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500**](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) \\- currently is 32.95, and it is higher than the average ratio of 15.85 which is apparently not a good sign. During the dot-com bubble it was 32.9. But we need to look at the other indicators.\n2. [**Shiller P/E Ratio**](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/table/by-year). This indicator addresses the market inflation and is considered more accurate. Currently it is at 30.27. This is a lot higher than the average P/E ratio over the last 100 years of 16.75. Average over the last 20 years is 25.6 which makes things seem more reasonable.\n3. **The Buffet Indicator** which is higher than what it was during the  **dot-com bubble** crash. \n4. **Returns you get in market vs other asset classes** \\- 3.03% is the average market return. The growth in these earnings requires adding the average US GDP growth which is between 2 and 3 %, so let's say 2.5%. Therefore, 2.5%+ 3.03% = **5.53**%. Meaning if we buy stocks now we can expect an average annualized return of 5.53%. Since the 1920s the average was 10%. What this means, apparently, is that because stocks are at very high prices their returns have gone dramatically lower. Compared to other asset classes such as bonds/banks are very low.\n\nWhat this points to is the market being overvalued. However, since banks and bonds have low interest rates, lower than inflation, you end up losing money, this is why investors are still investing in the stock market even though prices and indicators are showing they are very high. There is nothing else to do with money. \n\n**Therefore, the one indicator we need to keep our eye on are interest rates.** If that goes up it will change things.  \n\nSo I guess keep those treasury interest date announcements in your calendar and understand in the weeks leading up to it market sentiment may move in to correction territory.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "But the Fed isn\u2019t going to raise interest for 3 years, right?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "MaRkEt Is FoRwArD lOoKiNg!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "wait what \n\noh wait i get it now\n\nso we're all just like little cynical soothsayers", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3352818787097931}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30795979499816895}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10191436111927032}], "tickers": ["bubble", "inflation", "crash", "gdp"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "When everyone puts their money into the stock market as a type of savings account.

Edge/object detection also appears to be the only thing lidar can do since it can't see color which is where the cameras come in. Side note, Elon has also talked about using \"4d\", or in other words, figuring out what has changed between adjacent frames instead of analyzing each frame individually.

Maybe you could help me understand something about the lidar approach that has always confused me. I've never understood the approach that you and Waymo seem to be taking where you map out locations before you ever put an AV on those roads. What has always confused me is why would you map out the area before if your AV is supposed to be able to successfully navigate an area given similar inputs that were already collected using a human-driven vehicle with lidar? Ultimately both the human-driven vehicle and AV share the same sensors used to collect data on the world around it, which just makes the human version seem redundant and pointless. The only answer I've been able to come up with on my own is that the AV are incapable of handling or processing the complexity or size of data taken in from the lidar + cameras. Therefore you use the human-driven lidar system to map out a rough \"sketch\" of the location to which the AV would compare its data to in order to cut out static objects(buildings, trees, edges of road) which would reduce complexity and load on the neural networks. Using this system the AV could then focus it's neural networks on dynamic objects(other cars, people, dogs, leaves) that it has to predict the future of. Is this a good interpretation for why you and Waymo map out areas before using human drivers, and then geofence the area?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It saves compute but you are getting ~100% accuracy on static object detection. With the human maps, you can pre-label everything and more importantly all the relative distances with ~100% accuracy. Then when you run the AV stack in real-time, you can just compare the point clouds like a look-up table. Then you can compare the two lidar maps and localize exactly where you are on the map with insanely high accuracy too. \n\nThis takes out a good amount of engineering and reduces things that can go wrong. Debugging/Triaging within a combinatorial space is probably the hardest part of AVs, and reducing the amount of engineering you have to do is the smartest thing to do. The only issue is that this is hard coding and doesn't scale well.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Very interesting. Is there any talk at Argo AI or other companies that use lidar to switch to just cameras? It seems like the bet on lidar is based on either a camera-based vision system being inaccurate, or a combination of better algorithms and better data processing making it so lidar on the autonomous vehicle can operate without a predetermined map. It just seems very hard for geofencing to scale, and even if AV+ lidar could operate without geofencing it would end up just being more expensive than only cameras.

We are 1-2 years out to commercializing their technology. Princeton lightwave Lidars will be a fraction of the price of velodyne, higher point cloud density, lower power consumption, and higher frequency of scans. Despite all the CMU hoopla that management likes to trout, our real advantage is our lidar. \n\nAlthough mapping geofences areas is a lot of manual work, it\u2019s more deterministic than engineering work.
