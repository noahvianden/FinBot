{"title": "Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheap premiums", "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

I collected around $240.00 as a result of 3 puts I sold last week.\n\nThe risk of a CSP, and on this particular stock, is assignment. My strike price was $9.00 which I think is over valued on the stock, so I don't actually want to own it at that price. This is because I think BTC is going to retrace back down to sub $9k, and when that happens it will drop the price of MARA back to around $1.00-$2.00 range.

Thank you for the explanation and yes it made perfect sense.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "In the event that you think the stock price will decline (a lot), you have a couple options (heh) with options. \n\nYou can do a bear put or call spread where you buy & sell OTM puts (or calls) above the current price maybe .30 delta or .20 delta for the additional safety. This strategy caps your upside & downside, but the downside can be pretty nasty still.\n\nYou can sell naked calls above the current strike (and collect premium). This strategy has a capped upside and unlimited downside risk (because the stock price can go to infinity in theory). For additional risk, you can combine this with shorting the stock itself.\n\nIf you think the stock could make big moves in either direction (upside or downside), you could buy a straddle or a strangle. A straddle spread is buying a call & put at the same expiration & same strike price. For example, you buy a call & put at a strike price of $12.00. The underlying will need to move enough in either direction to make this trade profitable, which means it's a volatility play. You want a lot of volatility (lots of price change in the underlying).\n\nA strangle is effectively the same thing, but the strike prices are different. For example, you buy a put at a $10 strike and a call at a $14 strike price. This spread is a little bit cheaper with the premium, but relies on the same principles as a straddle in that you want a lot of price movement, and you want lots of volatility. Ideally you want IV to be increasing (not decreasing) over time, and you want to do this when you think the stock price is going to move quickly in the near future (such as an earnings week, you expect some bad news, bitcoin tanks, etc.)\n\nThere other bear & volatility plays that I'm not covering. \n\nThere's a great book called The Bible of Options Strategies: The Definitive Guide for Practical Trading Strategies by Guy Cohen which lays a lot of these out. \n\nHighly recommend it if you want to get some ideas.

I mean NKLA put out earnings reports with earnings listed in $0.003mn and it all came from installing solar panels on the CEO's ranch but the share price didn't budge.\n\nSecondly, it's more likely that NKLA is/was more susceptible to these trends because people were actually buying stock thinking they were getting in on the TSLA train that they missed the last time around. The real gains aren't driven by this when it comes to options they're driven by delta and gamma hedging from MMs lowering their risk profile by accumulating shares of the underlying for the contracts they sell. Options volume is a \\*significantly\\* better indicator of market direction than almost anything else, especially these days when fundamentals seem to not mean shit anymore.\n\nIf you take RIOT for example, they were (and still honestly are) a pennystock crypto farm whose rise has been ENTIRELY because of Bitcoin. If you overlay the charts it's more or less point for point following the value of Bitcoin. Its action at this point is completely consumed by the motion of Bitcoin and has nothing to do with its underlying fundamentals or earnings. As long as they can keep the lights on and farming and the board doesn't get arrested for selling secrets to China they'll probably be worth $200/share in a couple years due to nothing but the motion of Bitcoin and nothing to do with their fundamental earnings or tangible value.

It uses radio waves to ionize and heat an inert propellant, forming a plasma, then a magnetic field to confine and accelerate the expanding plasma, generating thrust. It is a plasma propulsion engine, one of several types of spacecraft electric propulsion systems.The VASIMR method for heating plasma was originally developed during nuclear fusion research. VASIMR is intended to bridge the gap between high thrust, low specific impulse chemical rockets and low thrust, high specific impulse electric propulsion, but has not yet demonstrated high thrust.\n\n[About Me](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply !delete to delete - [Article of the day](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

{"title": "\ud83c\udf39PSTH Warning Shot & Q&A - I've Done Well in This Market - I am Here to Help You - Please Don't Be On Team-FOMO When This Monster Stock ROCKETS", "selftext": "Hello r/wallstreetbets\n\n***First order of business, I assure you I am not here to pump targets. Just levelling with the WSB community, which I have come to love and value.***\n\n***Second order of business, before you dismiss this play, read at least a bit to understand the nature of the Tontine structure. Amazing value and big reason we see some many heavyweights gobbling up this stock. Literally stuffing their faces with PSTH, they are.***\n\nI started posting about Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd ($PTSH) around a month ago.\n\nHere are my DDs in order of appearance. The last one sums up and provides updates. The comments section in the first one is most instructive for people who are at least aware of the SPAC.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\\_dd\\_klarman\\_buffet\\_ackman\\_the\\_unicorn\\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k83mpz/psth\\_and\\_the\\_ever\\_present\\_difficulty\\_in\\_finding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k83mpz/psth_and_the_ever_present_difficulty_in_finding/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kixho7/psth\\_pershing\\_square\\_tontine\\_holdings\\_ltd\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kixho7/psth_pershing_square_tontine_holdings_ltd_the/)\n\n**My DDs have garnered a decent conversation in the comments threads.** I've learned a lot through that process, so thanks. I hope you have learned something too. Ultimately most of us are just trying to learn and lock in enough capital to make life easier and more enjoyable for ourselves and our families. To be part of WSB in that joint endeavor is special.\n\n**This is a perplexing SPAC. It has the dubious distinction of being BOTH THE BIGGEST SPAC EVER BROUGHT TO MARKET AND THE LEAST REPORTED ON IN THE PRESS.**\n\n**Notably, its gotten some attention on reddit and Twitter.**\n\nIn any case, I bring a short message below about how attractive this thing is, in addition to the info above. I have my positions locked in already. I have dramatically, dramatically changed a big portfolio around to dump the majority of my capital into this stock. I am holding it for 12 mo at a minimum (likely at least 40% until retirement) and have made appropriate lifestyle modifications to plan for that outcome, even in this crazy market.\n\nI am just convinced that this stock is not being publicized for some sinister reason. I don't want to go all conspiratorial but I really think its media malpractice for them to not be letting people know about this investment vehicle.\n\n**CNBC HAS CHAMATH ON EVERY FUCKING DAY AND THEY NEVER HAVE PSTH ON. EVEN IF ACKMAN DENIED THE INTERVIEW, THEY STILL DON'T EVEN COVER IT. DID CRAMER LOSE MONEY WITH ACKMAN???? WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE????**\n\nI digress...\n\nIf I dumped everything I have into this now and quit investing, I would retire with the wealth of the last ten generations of my family combined, and I am not from a poor family (sorry).\n\n**Anyways, here it is. Its something, some say, rivals the likes of which we haven't seen.**\n\n**--The PSTH Play--**\n\nPSTH warrants have a strike price of $23 and so every 9 common shares you own now pre-merger allows you to buy 2 additional shares post merger close at a price of $23 per share. AKA TONTINE.\n\nRight now $PSTH is $3.03 above the strike price of $23 at $26.03.\n\n**So for the price of 9 shares today ($234.27) and buying 2 additional shares at the Strike of $23, you will own 11 shares in the future which means your average cost is actually (($234.27+46)/11 = $25.47 (TONTINE).**\n\nTargets really ultimately don't matter for us. **Bloomberg, amazing. In-n-Out, wonderful. Stripe, holy shit. SpaceX, we are in a simulation and Elon Musk is the overlord, what the fuck is happening, omg we are going to mars.**\n\nRegardless of who Ackman picks up, you\u2019re essentially guaranteed to have a low entry price here and be in the money **bigly**.\n\n**TONTINE TRICKS: Oh and it\u2019s possible you can get 3/9 or 4/9 additional warrants for every 9 you own, thus bringing the average price DOWN EVEN FURTHER. The warrants are only given out for shareholders who hold through the merger and there is a set amount of them that go out to someone!**\n\n\\----\n\nOver the weekend a warm calm came over me. I feel I have investigated this play for months and I have learned a lot about investing and life in the process.\n\nUltimately, I have only felt as sure about something as I did with Tesla in March of 2020 when the stock was trading at $385 before it split (equivalent of $77 today, with TSLA trading at $660).\n\n**I am envisioning a 250% gain in the next 4 months.**\n\n**Merry Christmas WSB! And Stay Safe & Lucrative...**\n\n[\ud83c\udf39](https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/rose-emoji/#:~:text=The%20rose%20emoji%20can%20be,signal%20alliance%20with%20democratic%20socialism.)[\ud83c\udf39](https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/rose-emoji/#:~:text=The%20rose%20emoji%20can%20be,signal%20alliance%20with%20democratic%20socialism.)[\ud83c\udf39](https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/rose-emoji/#:~:text=The%20rose%20emoji%20can%20be,signal%20alliance%20with%20democratic%20socialism.)\n\n[PSTH.

The warrants trade on the exchange now. This already happened with the original PSTH units with ticker PSTH.U. In sept, the units spilt into PSTH and 1/9 warrants.\n\nThe same will happen with PSTH ticker on merger, in other words, PSTH splits into the new ticker and 2/9 warrants at price of $23.\n\nI don't know if you will have to call your broker. Just email their customer service now and you'll know everything tmr specific to that broker.\n\nIn terms of the rest of your questions, they are covered in my last DD. But in brief, the meat and potatoes of the story is that the warrants are exercisable either 30 days post merger, or July 2021, whichever is later. Once the exercise period opens you can buy the shares at $23. You would need capital to buy them yes. You are free to buy and sell any amount of stock at any time, its yours. So yes, you could, in theory, wait for the LOI bounce and sell some stock off to cover the future purchase of the $23 warrants if you had no other capital. Most people aren't going to do this if they are intent on trying to stay in though, because the more commons you hold, the more warrants you get...\n\nBased on my understanding and reading, the cash in the vehicle was $20 per share on IPO, its called NAV or net asset value. That's just cash. Right now the stock is trading at $26 and that's what we mean when we are saying the stock is trading at a premium. Technically in buying a share, you are paying $26 for something that has a cash equivalent value of $20, aka the huge premium, found by dividing 6 by 20 and multiplying by 100 (30%). Of course this is a simple way to look at it because it doesn't factor in the value of the vehicle re: investor list, likelihood of success, incentive, etc.\n\nSo that's what you get back in any case, based on my best reading. I think there is technically speak of sub $20 but in reality I think you can just choose to redeem at $20 instead of going through with the merger. \n\n**The $20 per share is just cash in the account, so its always there.** \n\nAll that to say that this worst case scenario thinking is bananas.

I think the news of an acquisition is going to dwarf anything pertaining to wsb/twitter-related movement. The thing to keep in mind is that Ackman is hunting. He is going to literally gouge the eyes out of whatever whale he lands because he\u2019s engineered a situation where that works for both sides. He\u2019s not skimming off the top like other SPACs do at the front end. But he\u2019s taking the target for a ride on the back end, rest assured of that. Why you ask, new investor? Because he\u2019s obtaining a minority stake. It\u2019s basic psychology 101. The target company is being presented with an actual assurance of 7B in cash on day 1. No IPO bullshit like we saw with ABNB and SNOW where they each lost 4B in valuation on day one. That assurance is worth something itself, and it translates to a bigger piece of the pie at an \u201cattractive\u201d (word Ackman keeps using) price.\n\nUltimately, it shows how big his cerebral cortex is. Even Buffet\u2019s Capos didn\u2019t think to do this. My guess is that Ackman, with this move, and this structure, is going to actually re-define what going public means. It truly is biblical.
