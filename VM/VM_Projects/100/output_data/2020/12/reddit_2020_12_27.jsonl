{"title": "Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheap premiums", "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|Stock Price|IV (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPY - SPDR S&P 500|325B|$369.00|16%|\n|PEP -

I collected around $240.00 as a result of 3 puts I sold last week.\n\nThe risk of a CSP, and on this particular stock, is assignment. My strike price was $9.00 which I think is over valued on the stock, so I don't actually want to own it at that price. This is because I think BTC is going to retrace back down to sub $9k, and when that happens it will drop the price of MARA back to around $1.00-$2.00 range.

Thank you for the explanation and yes it made perfect sense.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "In the event that you think the stock price will decline (a lot), you have a couple options (heh) with options. \n\nYou can do a bear put or call spread where you buy & sell OTM puts (or calls) above the current price maybe .30 delta or .20 delta for the additional safety. This strategy caps your upside & downside, but the downside can be pretty nasty still.\n\nYou can sell naked calls above the current strike (and collect premium). This strategy has a capped upside and unlimited downside risk (because the stock price can go to infinity in theory). For additional risk, you can combine this with shorting the stock itself.\n\nIf you think the stock could make big moves in either direction (upside or downside), you could buy a straddle or a strangle. A straddle spread is buying a call & put at the same expiration & same strike price. For example, you buy a call & put at a strike price of $12.00. The underlying will need to move enough in either direction to make this trade profitable, which means it's a volatility play. You want a lot of volatility (lots of price change in the underlying).\n\nA strangle is effectively the same thing, but the strike prices are different. For example, you buy a put at a $10 strike and a call at a $14 strike price. This spread is a little bit cheaper with the premium, but relies on the same principles as a straddle in that you want a lot of price movement, and you want lots of volatility. Ideally you want IV to be increasing (not decreasing) over time, and you want to do this when you think the stock price is going to move quickly in the near future (such as an earnings week, you expect some bad news, bitcoin tanks, etc.)\n\nThere other bear & volatility plays that I'm not covering. \n\nThere's a great book called The Bible of Options Strategies: The Definitive Guide for Practical Trading Strategies by Guy Cohen which lays a lot of these out. \n\nHighly recommend it if you want to get some ideas.

I mean NKLA put out earnings reports with earnings listed in $0.003mn and it all came from installing solar panels on the CEO's ranch but the share price didn't budge.\n\nSecondly, it's more likely that NKLA is/was more susceptible to these trends because people were actually buying stock thinking they were getting in on the TSLA train that they missed the last time around. The real gains aren't driven by this when it comes to options they're driven by delta and gamma hedging from MMs lowering their risk profile by accumulating shares of the underlying for the contracts they sell. Options volume is a \\*significantly\\* better indicator of market direction than almost anything else, especially these days when fundamentals seem to not mean shit anymore.\n\nIf you take RIOT for example, they were (and still honestly are) a pennystock crypto farm whose rise has been ENTIRELY because of Bitcoin. If you overlay the charts it's more or less point for point following the value of Bitcoin. Its action at this point is completely consumed by the motion of Bitcoin and has nothing to do with its underlying fundamentals or earnings. As long as they can keep the lights on and farming and the board doesn't get arrested for selling secrets to China they'll probably be worth $200/share in a couple years due to nothing but the motion of Bitcoin and nothing to do with their fundamental earnings or tangible value.

It uses radio waves to ionize and heat an inert propellant, forming a plasma, then a magnetic field to confine and accelerate the expanding plasma, generating thrust. It is a plasma propulsion engine, one of several types of spacecraft electric propulsion systems.The VASIMR method for heating plasma was originally developed during nuclear fusion research. VASIMR is intended to bridge the gap between high thrust, low specific impulse chemical rockets and low thrust, high specific impulse electric propulsion, but has not yet demonstrated high thrust.\n\n[About Me](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply !delete to delete - [Article of the day](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.
