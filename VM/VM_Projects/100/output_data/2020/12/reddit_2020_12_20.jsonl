The shipper knows it\u2019s going through as smart post and smart post isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as it ensures packages are delivered from the shipper in a timely manner. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying about FedEx and UPS being unable to deliver to every home in America daily has to do with their simple inability to do so. Check out the the ground fleet size of each respective company ([Fed Ex: 75,000+ worldwide](http://www.fedex.com/us/about/overview/companies/corporation/Corporation.pdf), [UPS: 136,000+ worldwide](https://pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=FactSheets&id=1426321563187-193), [USPS: 200,000+ US and territories only](https://about.usps.com/news/statements/011516.htm)) and you\u2019ll see they both pail in comparison to USPS. For example: if you were able to stop all other package deliveries in the US for a day, gave each delivery service\u2019s staging area one package for each and every home to be delivered in a single day, neither FedEx or UPS would succeed because they don't have the ability to do so.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "We seem to be saying the same thing while talking each other in circles.

These fifty stocks are credited by historians with propelling the bull market of the early 1970s, while their subsequent crash and underperformance through the early 1980s are an example of what may occur following a period during which many investors, influenced by a positive market sentiment, ignore fundamental stock valuation metrics.
