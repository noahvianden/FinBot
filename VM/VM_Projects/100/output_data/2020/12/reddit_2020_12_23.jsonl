{"title": "$SNOW MASSIVE Dilution Incoming & Easy Put Opportunity $$$", "selftext": "I put together the below DD for retards in bullets so you retards could easily follow. Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a tremendous Put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:\n\n1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.\n2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct.\n3. The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.\n\n* The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales.\n   * Snow CEO makes $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can't imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this\n* Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book.\n   * Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market\n* Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially.\n* The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.\n* Since my balls don't drag on the ground when I walk, I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. Positions below, $10k in each.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS1 showing upcoming lockup expiration of 37M shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpvqrfsaiv661.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=448f95d3fafacb49c7d6909407d9b49b097b26ec\n\nThis shows price to sales ratio for large companies and how massively overvalued SNOW is, this is a few weeks old but still relevant\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vxx36cblv661.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=a35f52e32eaa555e20a0e5ab3fd3e49a55acf811\n\nTwo positions, no I don't use RH to trade but this is the screenshot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd2z7n4giv661.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41b5b22a7a639546ca0f77c43c91722816cf7540", "id": "kina26", "created_utc": 1608702321.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "320P 1/08/2021  here\n\nDown \\~52% now.

Do you have any idea how many startups Uber bought for their self-driving? None of them helped solve the problem. \n\nLaunching a rocket is in comparison much easier, because all the equations are already known and it's entirely a scientific process. Literally nothing new needed to be invented to get a rocket to launch and land. (Intellectual property had to be developed, but that's not necessarily \"novel\", as in patent worthy, although perhaps some of the manufacturing processes are new.)\n\nMaking rockets cheap is a very nice accomplishment, but it's really not that big of a deal, IMHO. I think the scientists that built the first artificial life using supercomputers were a bit more innovative than Musk.\n\nMusk built a nice electric car company with his money, and turned it into a religion, but like all mad religious leaders, they start promising things they can't deliver, like a robotaxi.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "oh ok you're one of those?

When building such systems the first results are easy, but adding an extra 9 of reliability costs exponentially much, because a system that can do 99.99% might have to be redesigned from scratch to do 99.999%. Most people tend to assume that a 99.99% system just needs \"more time to learn\" to get 99.99999%, but that's not how it works.\n\nEven that might not be enough for European regulators, however. \n\nWhen such things are discussed in /r/SelfDriving, you get banned, because you do not buy into the religion of self-driving cars. I have no doubt that a self-driving car could be produced that reaches a million miles without intervention, but none of the companies have the capabilities to do so for a price that is affordable.\n\nCan a car be created, which drives large sections of a highway under reasonable conditions? Perhaps, but how is Tesla going to show that under all possible conditions it works?\n\nFor example, this happened in 2016: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk. \n\nYou might say \"Hey, that was a long time ago!\", but why does this then happen in 2020:\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/06/02/tesla-in-taiwan-crashes-directly-into-overturned-truck-ignores-pedestrian-with-autopilot-on/ ?\n\nRight, I am a religious zealot, which just sees the proof that even the most basic features don't work?\n\nNote that I didn't even know of the 2020 article before I was writing this comment, but such things are inevitable given that their technology is flawed in its very foundations. I *know* it can't work, because apparently, I understand their technology better than they do. I don't need to see their source code to understand how it works, because based on the kinds of things it fails at, I can derive the design. \n\nI'd tell them to fire all their engineers and hire a bunch of researchers and go back to the drawing board. They quite literally don't know what they are doing. Perhaps some progress can be made, but the most likely outcome is that despite 7nm chips being used, it's just not enough.\n\nThe technology required to make a self-driving car could also be used for other more limited domains and even in those domains nothing is working on a commercial level. \n\nSelf-driving car prototypes only exist, because Silicon Valley is bored and many take Ubers to work; 99.9% of the population doesn't take an Uber to work. I am not waiting to get into a self-driving death trap anytime soon. It's not because I am against progress, but I don't think they are progressing at all. You might point at some features \"But it can do red lights now\" (well, it really can't, because in 2020 I have seen pictures of it failing spectacularly), but ultimately none of those features work as well as in a well rested human. \n\nBy which year does a self-driving car exists that works as well as KITT did in fiction?

Lenin!*  *Vladimir Illanich Uleninov!*\n\n***Donny***:*What the fuck is he talking about, Dude?*\n\n\n\n\nHello again, GME Gang. What a fun day we had yesterday! Could it continue today? Only Melvin Capital (and maybe Ryan Cohen) knows!\n\nAnd an extra special hello today to our newest WSB lookie-loo, Mr. Cramer (Can I call you Jim? I\u2019m gonna call you Jim).  \n\nNow Jim, from what I\u2019ve been able to gather, you and your Boomer stocks and your Hot Manic Takes don\u2019t always get a lot of love around here. But that\u2019s not *all* your fault, Jim. The Paste-Eating Rocket Kids are often good for a solid meme (FYI: it\u2019s pronounced \u201cMee-Mee.\u201d Feel free to use that on air without verifying). But the Rocket Kids can be a dense bunch and they\u2019re also often one click away from Total Financial Ruin (Quick shout out to SPCE: Pleas fly again). So you have to dig a bit in here to separate the wheat from the chaff, as someone like you actually says in real life. What the fuck even is chaff, Jim? And why do all Boomers seem to think that folksy farm-based idioms are the perfect way to conclude a thought?\n\nAnyway. Those of us who watched your teevee clips last week where you reference your interest in WSB know that you, Jim Cramer, might be one of the Olds, but that you also Think Young(TM). [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15). So we\u2019re going to do our best to help your young-thinkin\u2019 brain find the Needle In the Haystack here so you can get All Your Ducks In a Row on GME.  Because we know that you\u2019re a long way from being Put Out to Pasture, and though you may be an out-of-touch millionaire prone to facile yammering, we now ***like*** you here, Jim\u2014simply because you mentioned us and that made us blush a bit since we\u2019re needy Millennials who just want our Boomer mommies and daddies to Tell Us They\u2019re Proud of Us. So even though the Paste-Eating Rocket Kids here are often Buying A Pig in a Poke (Christ, please do not *ever* say that or the kids\u2019 Mee-Mees are gonna fuck you up), we appreciate you recognizing that, every now and then, there\u2019s something worth paying attention to over in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs.  And since you\u2019re actually telling your loyal single-finger-typin\u2019 viewers to check out this WSB shitshow, and \u201c*if they\u2019re running GME, then do some work on GME*,\u201d we assume you might actually be checking this shit out too, since all true Young Thinkers know that What\u2019s Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander. \n\nNow, is the GME play as solid as your recent recommendation to buy Bed Bath and Beyond? Who knows? That seems pretty stupid, and I would look it up myself this weekend but my nice little Saturday is already pretty full so I don\u2019t know\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have enough time. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: the GME play is **a lot more fucking fun**.  Life in a pandemic is boring, but here in this weird WSB place, these kids like fun.  And for all your Boomer weirdness, you seem like you still like to have a little fun in this Mad, Mad world of ours. So consider joining us here more often.  A word of warning, though: if you don\u2019t like all the dern cuss words we use around here, Jim, well that\u2019s just, like, your opinion man, and we\u2019ll have you know that the Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint. \n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: we have a bit of a bone to pick with you (now there *I* go). The stuff you said last week about GME as the next Blockbuster was D-U-M dumb, Jim. You were a bit out of your fucking element with that.  You even made our largest shareholder and conqueror-in-waiting, Mr. Ryan Cohen, send an emoji-only tweet in response, which if you know the super nice-guy Ryan Cohen like all of us do (we actually know nothing), that is pretty much the equivalent of him bringing his dog over to micturate on your and George Sherman\u2019s rug.\n\nNow, I myself have never been into the whole brevity thing, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get you up to speed on the GME movie you\u2019ve wandered into. And I know you\u2019re down with this because you told all your viewers that if WSB is talking about GME, then \u201cmake sure you know GME.\u201d So before you say something Absolutely Mad again and Cohen sends a tweet with an even less ambiguous emoji, it\u2019s high time that you start Making the Sure here, Jim. Just consider this to be CPT Hubbard delivering you some Orange Sunshine and turning you on to some of that Sweet, Delicious Non-Chaff Wheat you love so goddamn much. \n\n**Part 1: GME\u2019s Bonkers-Ass Short Interest**\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to lead with the most crowd-pleasing part of the story here (Get ready, Rocket Kids!), and it\u2019s the one that you did not even seem remotely familiar with in your \u201cStay out of GameStop, Deadbeat!\u201d rant last week. Maybe that was by design or maybe not. We\u2019ll return to that, Jim. But the point here is: the **short interest here is batshit insane**. And not just your garden variety Boomer in Rolled Up Sleeves Ranting About Buying Estee Lauder While Hitting Buttons On The Beep-Bop-Boop Machine kind of insanity. Really and truly fucking nuts.\n\nSo to TL/DR this shit for you, Jim (to use the parlance of our times): GME is **the** **most shorted stock** **trading today\u2014by far**.   [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) How shorted? Well, the value of shares short exceeds the market cap of the company; there are currently ***more shares short than the total number of shares outstanding***. And when factoring in the institutional and insider ownership, the total short percentage of float is **nearly 300%**. [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp) Even higher, actually, now that Cohen\u2019s interest is over 10%.  Now, I\u2019m not a numbers whiz like you, but that level of short interest and the small available float seems pretty fucked up to me. Like: \u201chow is that even legal?\u201d fucked up. And just for a frame of reference, the **third most shorted** security right now is your beloved Bed Bath and Beyond, with a short percentage of float at a nice and tidy 69%. \n\nAre you starting to gather why some of us in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs are a little excited about GME? You see, as u/Jeffamazon and RodAlzmann u/Uberkikz11 and others have explained in these here corners and on the twitter machine with their top-notch DD, and as I will translate to you in lingo you can dig, the short sellers got way over their skiis on this one expecting a bankruptcy in Spring of 2020 that never came. And yet, amazingly, the short interest has only **increased** since then\u2014there has effectively been no covering in the aggregate and, in fact, the short percentage has only **gone up**. And now, on the threshold of 2021, we all sit atop a massive powder keg wondering what is going to be the thing that finally lights this shit up. And at the end of this little missive, I\u2019m going to tell you what I think that thing might be (Spoiler: It\u2019s Ryan Cohen! Better start getting used to seeing his name, Jim, because this dude does not fuck around and he\u2019s not going anywhere). \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the\\_real\\_greatest\\_short\\_burn\\_of\\_the\\_century\\_part/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann)\n\n[https://thecollective.finance/2020/10/gamestop-gme-a-squeeze-to-44-from-14-can-be-justified-fundamentally-100-of-the-shares-are-short-watch-out/](https://thecollective.finance/2020/10/gamestop-gme-a-squeeze-to-44-from-14-can-be-justified-fundamentally-100-of-the-shares-are-short-watch-out/)\n\n**Part 2****: GameStop Isn\u2019t Going Bankrupt and People Actually Want to Buy Shit There**\n\nSo, you foul mouthed little prick, a bonkers-ass short interest is neat and all, but why is Jim Cramer wrong when Jim Cramer compares GME to Blockbuster you might be asking yourself in the third person. First, the most obvious answer, Jim, which you should fucking know already: Blockbuster was **nearly $1 Billion in debt** and missing debt payments left and right when it was delisted way back in 2010. That was also when there was a bit of a credit crunch, if you recall, right after that whole Housing Crash Unpleasantness that you saw coming from a mile away and from which you made hundreds of millions of dollars due to your contrarian foresight\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m clearly confusing you with Christian Bale starring as Dr. Michael Burry, weirdo head of Scion Asset Management, which also holds about 1.4M shares of GME (You really gotta start looking into this stuff, Jim. This story is made for TV, man\u2014and you Boomers were raised by TV and you turned out TV!). Also, in 2010 when Netflix is ripping and when Blockbuster was about to be delisted and bankrupt, an analyst noted the obvious fact that Blockbuster  had \u201cnothing on the horizon that makes it look like Blockbuster is going to be more profitable.\u201d \n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702) \n\nBut Jim, if your Blockbuster comparison has any plausibility, GameStop must have a major debt problem then, right? And yet just last month GameStop **repaid $125M in debt** several months ahead of time. It\u2019s also really weird that over the past year management bought back a ton of shares, taking the OS from 102M **down to just under 70M** (making a short squeeze even more likely, my Rocket Children). The weirdness continues with a soon-to-be-bankrupt company holding almost $500M in cash on hand. And according to George Sherman\u2019s \u201cThine Omnichannel Shalt Be The Omni-est Channel of Them All\u201d Conference Call following Q3, by March 2021 GME will have retired a total of $500M in debt and returned $200M to shareholders through stock buy backs. I\u2019m no expert here, and I do not presently own a Beep-Bop-Boop Machine, but that\u2019s all pretty weird shit to be doing if you\u2019re about to go bankrupt.\n\nNo, no \u2013 I get it: who the fuck actually looks at balance sheets anyway before spouting off about what a stock is going to do? I sure as hell don\u2019t. That\u2019s why I follow my man u/Uberkikz11, since that dude is a GME DD Encyclopedia and was born to crunch numbers. No, when Really Smart People make the Blockbuster comparison, it\u2019s usually just Mouth Sounds for: A B&M Store That Used to Be Popular But Now Is Not Because Technology, QED. But here even the Really Smart People might be missing something as well. They\u2019re right in the sense that GME must use this new console cycle window and cash influx to quickly pivot to a tech-first gaming company (more on that and our boy RC shortly!), but they\u2019re wrong on the timing and relevance of this Super Smart Insight.\n\nSo fine, they\u2019re doing ok on debt and cash. But who even goes to that 90s-Ass-Looking Cluttered Mall Geekery anymore anyways? I confess: in my darkest moments, as the short sellers manipulate the fuck out of this stock and I curse the names Bell and Sherman, I too have wondered this. But it turns out that, just like I have no idea why anyone listens to Maroon 5 or eats at Applebee\u2019s, apparently a lot of people in America do shit that I do not. Crazy huh? So here is some pretty neat data showing us how out of touch we might be here, Jim: \n\nFirst, when a pretty large sample size of people were recently asked the question: *which of the following stores or websites do you plan to buy holiday gifts from*? The **#5 response** from United States Americans was none other than **GameStop** (Ticker, Jim: GME). Only Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Dollar Store (poor people buy gifts too, Jim) were ahead of little old GameStop. That\u2019s higher than Nike, Macy\u2019s, the Apple Store\u2014and **double** the response of Bed Bath and Fucking Beyond in every category they surveyed. Check it: (h/t to my man u/snowk88) \n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915)\n\nThat\u2019s kinda crazy huh? See Jim, when you Think Young(TM), you really can learn something new every day. And by following our man u/snowk88 (@snowk88 over at stocktwits), I learn lots of cool shit. But guess who already knew that? The guy that wrote this bad-ass letter that identifies GME\u2019s brand and customer data as being one of the most valuable things GME has going for it. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\\_Ventures\\_Letter\\_to\\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) \n\nSo now we know that Real Life People actually buy shit at GameStop here in the year of our lord 2020. But like that analyst from 2010 said about Blockbuster, there must not be anything on the horizon for GameStop to be more profitable in 2021, right?\n\nNow, I will admit that being a bit bearish on GME in December of 2020 would make more sense if, say, GameStop were the nation\u2019s largest purveyor of limp and half-lit pumpkin spice-scented candles and we were exiting the apogee of Shitty Candle Season. But as it turns out, GameStop is currently selling basically the most sought-after items that exist in the marketplace right now\u2014where demand for the Xbox and Ps5 is far outpacing supply and is projected to continue well into 2021.  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021) I don\u2019t really need to get into the details on that here, because it\u2019s pretty goddamn obvious, but I think 2020 GameStop at the precipice of a new console cycle might be in a bit of a better position than, say, 2010 Blockbuster relying on the latest Adam Sandler release to lift its sagging rental numbers. But I don\u2019t know. Millions of people don\u2019t watch *my* show looking for Candid Analysis from me and *my* folksy man-of-the-people-lookin\u2019 rolled-up sleeves.\n\n**Part 3:** **Ryan Cohen is the Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Short Sellers\u2019 Dumbass Heads** \n\nAnd now we\u2019ve gotten to the best part. It\u2019s my favorite part of all of this, Jim, and if you give this a little time, I think it will be yours too. You see, all that corporate bla bla bla about balance sheets and console cycles and early debt repayment and overleveraged short sellers and brand recognition is neat and all\u2014and definitely worth a second look by itself. Maybe even a little Beep-Bop-Boop on the ol\u2019 sound machine\u2014I don\u2019t know your methods. But the real thing that\u2019s about to rip all our faces off here is the business and investment decisions of a mild-mannered wunderkind named Ryan Cohen.\n\nNow you can revisit my prior epistle if you want to know a bit more about the involvement of Mr. Ryan Cohen in *Le Affair* *GameStop*. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme\\_tribe\\_a\\_story\\_about\\_how\\_ryan\\_cohen\\_is\\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/).  My fly-by-night theory of his lawyer\u2019s possible use of the consent solicitation could have probably marinated for another day, but the thrust of my argument there was that Cohen and his attorney have been laying the groundwork to come after GameStop for a while now. And that Cohen was likely emboldened by the humiliating, lame-ass CC performance by some dude with a mid-century comic-strip sounding name that we\u2019ll all soon know only as: The Guy With the Punchable Face Who Used to Be CEO of GameStop.\n\nBut here is where things get really interesting. This is a story in the making, Jim, for fucks sake - take notes! This Monday, on December 21, Mr. Ryan Cohen filed a revised 13D showing that last week he started buying a shit-ton of shares\u2014starting on Tuesday December 15th\u2014which is ***the day after*** the stock price inexplicably plunged on Monday the 14th and the very same day you were yammering on the teevee about GME being Blockbuster! Instead of listening to you, however, Cohen started buying more GME shares (super-sleuth dark pool watchers u/rgrAi and u/snowk88 noticed in real-time that there was some very large accumulation taking place), which culminated in the big reveal that Cohen purchased a total of 2,501,000 additional shares last week\u2014500,000 of which were purchased on Friday December 18, 2020 **at the price of $16.02 a share**. Ryan Cohen is still the single largest shareholder of GME with 9,001,000 shares in total, taking his ownership of GME above the 10% threshold from 9.98% to 12.9%. And so he apparently thinks that the floor for his investment is $16.02 per share. Is he still buying? We\u2019ll know soon. But yesterday seemed like a little taste of what it might look like if a large buyer steps in to prevent short sellers from manipulating all of my nervous little Rocket Children here and their delicate little paper hands.\n\nThere was another thing we learned from this 13D filing: Ryan Cohen has apparently hired a new attorney and law firm. Instead of the great Christopher Davis of Kline Kaplan, now Ryan Cohen is represented by Ryan P. Nebel, a partner with Olshan Frome Wolosky, LLP.  Now, if you\u2019re familiar with my prior ramblings, you might wonder if I was a bit confused, and maybe even a little sad, at this sudden change from my man C. Davis. And you might be a little right. But then the wonder of the internet allowed me to learn a bit about these new lawyers. And holy shit, things are about to get fun.\n\nNow, I liked what I knew about Chris Davis and he seems like a genuine bad ass activist attorney. But the folks at Olshan Frome and Wolosky, LLP are Next Level Players and really seem tailor-made for this exact situation. First off, Olshan is ranked as **the top global lawfirm** for Activist Attorneys. [https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf](https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf) (H/t @flummoxed at stocktwits). They seem to be the go-to law firm for major proxy battles initiated by activist investors. But possibly even more important is that Olshan is the ***same firm that represented Hestia and Permit*** in their successful proxy battle earlier this year to appoint two new directors to the GME Board.  I\u2019m not going into the fine details of that, because this is already a bit of a long-form Idiot\u2019s New Yorker article, but GameStop just went through a proxy fight last year with Activist Investors Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, which resulted in two Board seats for our shareholder buds from Hestia and Permit. So, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the attorneys at Olshan might know their way around GameStop at this point and where the pressure points are here. \n\n[http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/](http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/)\n\n[https://www.olshanlaw.com/resources-mentions-HestiaCapital-PermitCapital-GameStop-BoardofDirectors-ShareholderActivism.html](https://www.olshanlaw.com/resources-mentions-HestiaCapital-PermitCapital-GameStop-BoardofDirectors-ShareholderActivism.html)\n\nAnd if you follow u/snowk88 over at stocktwits (@snowk88)\u2014 you\u2019d also find a wealth of DD on how Olshan rolls when entering these activist-investor-replaces-dumbass-boards-and-CEOs type disputes. To bottom line it: **they get it fucking done**. \n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534)\n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266155112](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266155112)\n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266153175](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266153175)\n\nBut what else did we learn from the 13D? We learned that Ryan Cohen is definitely not going anywhere any time soon. Specifically, the filing notes that RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop\u2019s board *\u201cregarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements.\"* And while RC Ventures *\u201cdesires to come to an amicable resolution with \\[GameStop, it\\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.\u201d*\n\nI really like that last part, don\u2019t you? And although I thought his November 16th letter was pretty goddamn clear, this 13D just ratcheted up the transparency level here. In sum, Ryan Cohen has all of our backs and he\u2019s going to replace this Board and Sherman with people that are on the level and that will help implement his vision.\n\nAnd now seems like a good time to return to those \u201cRyan Cohen: Boy Genius\u201d articles that were definitely NOT part of a well-coordinated pre-hostile takeover media campaign initiated earlier this year. I think there might be a few things in those articles that Mr. Cohen wanted all of us shareholders (as well as the short sellers and the Board he\u2019s about to replace) to really and truly understand.  Recall also that Cohen is not one for diversification or for playing it safe. So here\u2019s a few choice nuggets for you to ponder:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBloomberg, June 2020: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)\n\n\u00b7 \"It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas,\" he says. \"When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in.\" \n\n\u00b7 Cohen uses the word \u201cconviction\u201d a lot. He says it\u2019s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. \u201cHe taught me how to block the noise from the masses,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cTo have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 He wouldn\u2019t, however, recommend his \\[non-diversified\\] investment approach to everyone. \u201cYou need to have the temperament to block the noise,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes it feels like a roller coaster.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 He likens his obsessive focus on building Chewy to his approach to stock picking. \"I don't want to swing for a single,\" he says.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou hear that, Jim? Our man Cohen likes idioms too! But fuck those farm idioms, Jim \u2013 we\u2019re upgrading to the Sportsball kind now.  So what\u2019s the takeaway here? I\u2019d say that Cohen has his Eye On The Ball and that it\u2019s time for all short sellers and the Board to Throw in The Towel because Ryan Goddamn Cohen likes to Take the Bull By The Horns and will ensure that he Hits a Homerun for shareholders that believe in his vision.\n\nHere\u2019s a few more things Mr. Cohen wants all of us to know:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nForbes, August 2020: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)\n\n\u00b7 \u201cFor me, each no sounded like they just didn\u2019t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those \u2018no\u2019s never made me doubt my strategy \u2013 it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cI understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I\u2019m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I\u2019m doing. It wasn\u2019t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201c\\[M\\]y biggest risk would have been not taking risk. The risk of going head-to-head against Amazon. The risk of insourcing fulfillment. The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. The risk of spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.1%'s budget. The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren\u2019t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.\u201d\n\n\u00b7 \u201cDad never swayed when he believed in something. I never compromised my vision, regardless how many investors turned me down I was not going to give up on building Chewy into the world\u2019s biggest online pet retailer. I love to be challenged, and I\u2019m flexible on details, but I\u2019m never willing to give up.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nGoddamn it, Ryan. I was done having children but now you\u2019ve forced me into getting back on that train just so I can name this future child Ryan Fucking Cohen. Thanks a lot, asshole.\n\nBut to return to my point: are those the statements of a man that seems likely to walk away at this point? Or is Cohen trying to tell us all to get ready because he is going **All In** on this shit?\n\nSo where does this leave us? After a huge week where Cohen buys 2.5M more shares and then the SP skyrockets to $20 yesterday on that news? Well, this is where I want to tip my cap to my man Justin Dopierala over at Seeking Alpha and allow him to conclude this section. He, along with his pal Dmitriy Kozin have been pretty clear-eyed on all this shit for a while now and they both deserve some credit. And I know I gave my main man Justin a bit of a hard time in my last novella, but the dude is sharp as hell and helped a lot of us see the forest through the trees here.  And you should also definitely invite him to join your poker nights (seriously: check out the dude\u2019s tweet in response to our own Rod Alzmann\u2019s introduction of the #WeWantCohen hashtag right after the Q3 call debacle). [https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592).  You have no comment on a potential takeover involving Ryan Cohen, Justin after your hour-long googly-eyed call together? Can\u2019t believe you\u2019re just preemptively leaving the WSJ and Bloomberg hanging like that. Justin, I love you dude, but if I\u2019m holding pocket Kings I\u2019m folding after that tweet because that twinkle in your eye lets me know you\u2019re about to drop two Aces on my ass.\n\nAnyway. Here is what our man Dopierala thinks might happen here soon (and he called this way back on November 17th- and sorry - no links here, per the mods, as apparently no Alpha must ever be Sought from these parts):\n\n*I think a very likely outcome at this point is a majority slate next shareholder meeting where Cohen takes over BOD and then makes himself CEO. A majority slate proxy battle would require all institutions to call in shares and would force a squeeze.*\n\nWe\u2019re intrigued, Justin. Please continue:\n\n*If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero.*\n\nAnd now is when I get to speculate on what I think is going to happen here. But I do not necessarily think Cohen is going to put an offer to buy GME to take private. That would definitely trigger a MOASS, but I\u2019m not sure I see it given the attorneys he\u2019s hired and his recent buys up to $16 and the amount of cash that would take. Like Dopierala\u2019s *first* comment, though, I think Cohen is going to nominate directors to replace nearly the entire Board of Directors with a vote happening at the annual meeting and once that Board is in place, they\u2019ll appoint Cohen as CEO. And as Justin notes, if he nominates a majority slate of directors, shares will have to be called in to vote. And this vote and proxy battle will make the prior minority slate Hesita/Permit battle, and the tiny short squeeze that took place when that happened, look tame by comparison.\n\nNow everyone: get your calendars out. Because the date to nominate directors here is in **Mid-March**, and my super-smart corporate lawyer buds inform me that it\u2019s standard practice to file about 7-10 days prior. So, if this actually happening, we should be seeing something on this by **early March**.\n\nBut even though early March is now the mark on the wall, today\u2019s insane price action caused me to think about all of this a bit harder and speculate a bit more. And a major h/t to my buds on the stocktwits board, especially u/rgrAi (@amarbar) for all the sharp analysis on this. But if you were Ryan Cohen and you knew this company was hugely undervalued and you had a high level of **CONVICTION** here and also knew you needed shareholder votes to sweep out these dumbasses and implement your vision\u2014then how would you play this with the short interest here as crazy as it is? I\u2019d keep buying. Why? Well, lots of reasons, you smart alecks. \n\nFirst, so I have more guaranteed votes (duh?). Second, so that when the building starts burning and short hedge funds run for the exits they find that a mild-mannered Millennial with super-good ideas has sealed off all the doors and windows. That\u2019s gruesomely delicious, isn\u2019t it? Why else, CPT? Well, finally, and maybe most importantly, because I would want to excite and delight all my fellow shareholders by triggering a slow-burn short squeeze, raising the SP significantly, so that I can once again make the point (as he did in the Nov 16 letter) that the incompetent management that caused a **HUGE drop in SP** following that utterly incompetent Q3 call and the shelf registration, had **nothing to do with the SP increase** that again happened once Cohen announced his intent and started buying. Not the console cycle, not the cost containment measures, not the buybacks and not the early debt reduction. Nope: rightly or wrongly, shareholders will see Ryan Cohen buying shares and the corresponding SP increase and everyone\u2014especially all new buyers who are delighted at their good fortune and swept up by Ryan Cohen Fever 2021\u2014will start getting #WeWantCohen tattoos on their ass they\u2019ll be so happy. And all of us, newly enriched by Ryan Cohen\u2019s Big Canadian Balls and tactical brilliance, will crawl over glass to vote for him over The Boomer Artist Formally Known As GameStop\u2019s CEO. I could be very wrong on this last point in particular, but if we start seeing 13Ds drop here shortly, things should get very fun very quickly. \n\n**Part 4: A Return to Our Short-Squeeze-to-Da-Moon Discussion: Who\u2019s Side Are You Fucking On, Jim?**\n\nNow, Jim, given the fast friendship we\u2019re creating here, and all we\u2019ve been through over the past 5000 words, I hesitate in bringing this up. But we\u2019ve all seen the video, Jim. You know the one I\u2019m talking about. Yes, the one where you actually tell the truth about how short selling hedge funds manipulate the market to knock down the price of perfectly good securities that many hard-working people *invest in*\u2014many normal-ass people all assuming they wont ever have to Point Where On The Dolly The Invisible Hand of the Economy Touched Them. But that\u2019s not life now is it Jim? And fuck those poor-ass rubes for not knowing how to play the game with you sophisticated Masters of the Universe, *amirite*?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim\\_cramer\\_reveals\\_dirty\\_tricks\\_short\\_sellers\\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/)\n\n[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)\n\nSo where are **you** in this whole GME/Cohen story, Jim? You candidly (gleefully?) acknowledge that a prime strategy that shorts deploy is to spread negative rumors that are then amplified by Big Smart Trustworthy Financial Media Titans like yourself to shake out unsophisticated retail players like my Rocket Kids here\u2014who because of their tiny paper hands and you mean short selling brutes often subsist on paste and paste alone. \n\nSo for this particular security, are you the one helping with the manipulation and actively creating the \u201cnew truth\u201d or are you just one of the Useful Idiots that these short sellers use to manipulate with an anodyne, TV media-ready comparison like: *GameStop Is The Next Blockbuster*? And how in the fuck does this fit into your Think Young(TM) project, Jim? Because if there is one thing that we over at WSB fucking hate, it\u2019s a bunch of Manipulative Short Selling Boomer Fuckwads. Why on earth would a hip Young Thinker like you want to be included in that crew, Jim?\n\nAnd I know we\u2019re all friends here now, Jim, but I need to push back a bit on some of what you said in that video in such a cavalier whatareyagonnado manner. So if I understand you, short and distort and fomenting negative reactions from retail players based on deliberately false narratives is ***illegal***, but still easy as fuck to do \"because the SEC doesn't understand it.\" But you fucking do understand it, Jim! So why are you helping those short and distorters break the law here? Why are you being such an obtuse dumbshit? Just check out what happens to the borrow rate and short selling every time there is any good news for GME: \n\n[https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950](https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950) (h/t @slantedangles). This manipulation isn't just happening with GME; it is happening *everywhere*. It\u2019s baked into the cake. And that is pretty fucked up that we all just accept it because *whatareyagonnado*.\n\nI think that one thing that those of us who truly do Think Young(TM) have a hard time understanding is at what point in your lives do you Boomers all finally come to realize that it\u2019s maybe time to stop playing the game like you have been? What point do you finally have enough where doing the right thing matters more than getting paid? Maybe start by telling the truth more often\u2014and maybe don\u2019t go out of your way to help those corrupt-ass hedge fund managers who continually fuck over average people *merely because they were stupid enough to believe you all*. What contempt you Masters of the Universe have for all of them\u2014for all of *us*. There is a bigger story here on GME and this out-of-control short interest (naked shorting, counterfeit shares)   [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) than even Ryan Cohen and the inevitable short squeeze we\u2019re about to witness here. And it begins and ends with people like you and Melvin Capital and Bank of America not giving a fuck about the rules while thinking you\u2019re smarter than the rest of us who do\u2014but who lack power to do anything about it. And you know what? Maybe you *are* smarter than us. You certainly know how to play this game pretty well, as that video shows. But if I know my old school 1980s movies like I think I do, this is usually the part of the story where the rag-tag kids from across the tracks come over to show you hubristic rich fuckheads what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass. \n\nNow I myself have never dabbled in pacifism, Jim, so this isn\u2019t too much of a stretch for me, but seeing that video of yours and seeing the insane short interest and all the manipulation here makes me want to burn the whole corrupt system to the ground\u2014while barricading the doors to trap in those arrogant-ass short sellers who lie and cheat and distort to profit off average people. And though I\u2019m certain that this larger battle is not driving him, maybe that result is one that Ryan Cohen wouldn\u2019t mind too. Though he\u2019s a polite Canadian and would probably just let everyone know that he\u2019s not really mad, just disappointed. But me?  I\u2019m an Angry American and I say: Block the fucking doors and windows and light that shit up. \n\nSo maybe this epistle will be useful for your Think Young(TM) project and cause you to reflect a bit more on what\u2019s really going on out there with this whole GME thing and the likely illegal shorting that has driven the short percentage of float to these insane levels, drawing in new retail shorts too stupid to know what\u2019s even happening.  Or maybe it wont cause you to reflect in the slightest (count me as one of those cynical types that see your overtures to WSB as a transparent play for greater market share from the Young Crowd since your old-ass audience is dying and/or switching to bonds).  But in a few months when all the Billy Ray Valentines and Louis Winthorpes assembled here are toasting each other in stupid shirts on a white-sand beach somewhere, we do not want you to look back on your knee-jerk boomer-ass dismissal of GME and your Useful Idiot blathering with that same tinge of regret and longing you feel when you look at a pre-Client 9 picture of you and your old roomie: warm-toes-and-hosiery-enthusiast E. Spitzer, Esq.\n\nIn conclusion: GME = Blockbuster comparisons are for Simps and Corrupt Short-and-Distorters. Don\u2019t be like them, Jim.  And to my Rocket Children: the only weapon we wield in this stupid game is Diamond Hands with a float like this. Toughen the fuck up.\n\nAnd Happy Holidays everyone.\n\n\\--CPT Hubbard\n\n**TL/DR**: Jim Cramer likes farm-based idioms and apparently being a useful idiot to scummy short selling hedge funds. DD on the GME turnaround is solid and overleveraged short sellers should be shitting themselves. Ryan Cohen, our polite, hard-working Canadian benefactor is about to rip all our fucking faces off and trigger a MOASS. Probably even by early March, if that time is good for you (he\u2019ll text before he comes).
