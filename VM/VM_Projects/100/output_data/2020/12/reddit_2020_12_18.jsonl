{"title": "2020 Performance and Strategy Recap", "selftext": "[YTD Performance Chart](https://i.imgur.com/Qetdo5W.png) \\- Note there's a $50k deposit in March\n\n**Long Post Warning (TLDR at the bottom)**\n\n* I never post so allow me this one big one lol. This is really to get all my thoughts down in one central location for myself and others to reference.\n\n**Account Details (as of EOD 12/17/20)**\n\n* Portfolio Margin (PM) account w/ TOS\n* $590k cash (100% cash - see strategy below)\n* $561k net liq.\n* 0.3% delta beta-weighted to SPY\n* 0.3% theta\n* $13k commissions and fees YTD ($0.4/contract)\n\n**The Game Plan**\n\n* **Strategy #1 - SPY HTS**\n   * ***EDIT (January 2021):*** *Switched back to long SPY shares instead of SPY HTS. I'm skeptical HTS would beat buy/hold in the long run and I'm too lazy to find out lol. HTS also requires some timing of the market which is against my religion. Currently sitting at 70% of net liq in long SPY shares. I will probably aim to keep this around 75% in case of any early assignment. Perhaps even more if I get less aggressive and/or more passive with my theta account.*\n   * **Background**: I used to be 100% long SPY and use the collateral (85% of SPY net liq. with PM) towards option BP. But several months ago, I went 100% cash and have been using the Hold-The-Strike (HTS) methodology instead.\n   * **The Trade**: Write SPY CSP ATM (contracts determined by cash amount).\n   * **Management**: If SPY goes down as your expiration approaches, you roll to the same strike. If SPY goes up, you roll up to a strike ATM (still tinkering with when to roll up and what DTE).\n   * **Notes**: Will this beat buy/hold while also factoring in loss of dividends and taxes on STCG? Time will tell!\n* **Strategy #2 - Weekly SPX Strangles**\n   * **Background**: I stumbled upon [ERN](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/09/28/passive-income-through-option-writing-part1/) several years ago who got me started on this type of mechanical, emotionless strategy. Of course I've customized it a bit to my own style.\n   * **The Trade**: Every Wednesday, write an SPX strangle 45 DTE. Number of contracts and delta are determined by desired yield and account size. My target return is 12%/year with these. This is currently putting me at 1 contract around 5 delta.\n   * **Management**:  For the short puts, I will roll up if >21 DTE and >50% profit to original delta. I will close for a loss if <-300%. For the short calls, I will close for a loss if <-500%. If these are getting tested near expiration, I will close for whatever gain/loss at the time to avoid gamma risk. Otherwise, I will let them expire worthless.\n   * **Notes**: [Spintwig](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-call-strategy-performance/) has taught us that SPY 45 DTE short calls are not profitable. The 5 delta are almost breakeven. But I'm willing to live with that as this adds a little negative delta to my otherwise super positive portfolio delta.\n* **Strategy #3 - Short Puts on (mainly) Blue Chips**\n   * **Background**: This is just your basic CSP stuff here except naked (cash secured is not capital efficient and cannot beat buy/hold IMO). I try to diversify amidst all the major sectors. And yes I'll do a \"meme\" here and there \ud83d\ude09\n   * **The Trade**: Write 45 DTE, 20 delta short puts. Size the number of contracts to use no more than 1% BPR.\n   * **Management**: Pretty standard TW exit/rolling techniques here. Will look to start taking profits around 50%+ if the DTE trade-off is worth it. I'll also take profits if it's 30%+ in a few days and/or earnings are coming up. If ITM and decent extrinsic value left, I will wait to roll until expiration day upon which I will roll to the next monthly for a credit choosing a strike based upon my sentiment. If it's deep ITM, I will look for a high IV day to roll. Of course I'll only roll if I'm still bullish on the underlying.\n   * **Notes**: The 1% position sizing is important. If 1 position goes bad (and it will), my whole portfolio isn't stuck in the mud. I also used to add short calls as defense (5-10 delta) when my short puts went -100% but I rarely do this anymore due to whipsaw. Also regarding earnings, as long as the ER isn't within 2 weeks, I don't care.\n* **Strategy #4 - Weekly Naked Lottos (Don't Do This!)**\n   * ***EDIT (February 2021):*** *I am no longer doing these due to risk/anxiety/time. I might only re-visit these on solid blue chips that I already have short puts on, high-IV runners that I will close same day, and 0DTE on expiration Fridays so I don't have lose sleep thinking of nightmare blow-up scenarios lol. I've probably made net +$50k or so on these since starting the experiment last summer. It's been a wild run but I need to de-stress!*\n   * **Background**: I love pennies. I hate steamrollers. I almost didn\u2019t post this strategy but it\u2019s amazing entertainment/pain/stress and I get asked about it a lot. Also it\u2019s become a major portion of my gains as I\u2019ve honed in on the mechanics and fully dived in after getting as comfortable as I can. Still, don't this - the tail risk can be blowup-worthy heh.\n   * **The Trade**: Use TOS Option Hacker for <5DTE, >120% **options** IV, <5 delta, >0.03 bid, no earnings, and exclude things from my \"too risky\" watch-list (TSLA, Biotech, EV, IPOs, cruise lines, airlines, pot/solar/vaccine stocks, etc.). After that, make sure no upcoming binary events or rumors. Do some basic TA with my stupid eyeballs. Analyze desired position by stressing up/down to strike and make sure BPR will not put me in a margin call (**this part is important and what determines the max # of contracts I will write**). Send order near the ask and see if MM is sexy enough to grant me more than I deserve. Walk down to minimum desired bid until filled. Depending on account size, underlying price, and underlying EPR, these positions usually range between 50 and 100 contracts for a total premium between $100 and $500. But I wouldn\u2019t dare put target returns for this; some weeks I get less than $1k, other weeks I get $4k.\n      * ***EDIT (January 2021)****: New criteria -> Avoid anything with short interest > 10%. Lessons learned from 1/25 $5k losses on BYND/RKT. Luckily avoided additional short squeeze madness on GME/IRBT/etc.*\n   * **Management**: I set alerts at -$1k for these positions. If that hits, I'll either close for the $1k loss, balance delta by buying/shorting shares and/or adding short calls/puts, or let it ride. I have hard stops at -1000%.\n   * **Notes**: Really only worth it with a PM account due to BPR. I\u2019m at my computer every trading day before opening bell to try and capture opening volatility. I\u2019ve also found the first few minutes after ER a good time to scalp. Again, don\u2019t do this unless you have a risk management strategy and low blood pressure.\n* **Leverage**\n   * I generally aim for a target of 50% free BP. However, I will let this run as low as 30% before I start trimming fat if I think we are oversold or as high as 70% if I\u2019m getting weary/cautious.\n   * I stress my portfolio almost daily beta weighted to SPX for price and volatility to know how far away I am from a margin call in either direction. Sometimes, like now, the stress testing will inform me that a ton of my BPR is due to my SPX short calls. With this knowledge, I know I can be more aggressive opening up more short puts from strategy #3.\n* **Hedging Another 6-sigma Event**\n   * **Background**: After COVID bent me over in March, I realized the hard way I needed a black swan hedge (among other risk management/exit strategies of which I NEVER HAD) to avoid/mitigate what happened to my account should another doomsday scenario occur. Still new to my arsenal and experimenting with this.\n   * **The Trade**: Buy 7 DTE, 10% OTM puts every Monday for 0.04% of net liq. Also buy 120 DTE, 10 delta VIX calls every month for 0.08% of net liq. Do the math and this is a total of 3%/year portfolio drag. These numbers could probably scale with portfolio returns and VIX level.\n   * **Management**: Hopefully these expire worthless until I'm dead. But if not, when the next black swan hits and these babies pop, I'm honestly not exactly sure how I'll manage these. I just know I'll be glad I had them.\n   * **Notes**: Not only do the long SPY puts hedge my SPY HTS CSP and SPX short puts, it also drastically reduces the BPR for these positions due to cross-margining rules (another beauty of SPX and PM). VIX hedge based on [Option Alpha YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-luY8MHgYW0).

Thank you so much for sharing.  I have also been greatly influenced by ERN and Spintwig.  If you don't mind, I have a couple questions:  \n1. Strategy #1 and #2: Have you considered /ES or /MES in lieu of SPY and SPX?  I guess based on the fact that scenario #1 is cash secured and scenario #2 is based on target yield, perhaps there is no benefit for you with reducing collateral requirements?  Edit: You would get more favorable tax treatment under Scenario #1 using /ES but it probably gets more complicated determining how many contracts to sell.  \n2. Strategy #3 Individual Tickers: Position sizing based on 1% BPR is interesting.  Do you sum up your total notional exposure to determine how a big pullback might affect all your various positions?  I'm doing something similar, but getting spooked if during a big drawdown I wouldn't wipe out.  Are there any of these tickers you would accept assignment or would you roll in perpetuity / close for loss at some threshold (multiple of premium)?  \n3. Black Swan Hedge: Have you considered UVXY in lieu of VIX.  I've done some backtesting in TOS on Demand and the issue with long duration VIX calls is they don't provide a great hedge when vol explodes if they still have long to go due to euro exercise style and mean reversion of the VIX.  UVXY outperform significantly, since long duration calls rise during the black swan since they are american style.  The issue with UVXY is higher premiums (but you can go further OTM due to leverage) and UVXY decays around 9% month over month. I've been trying to determine my own 6-sigma hedge and have been digging pretty deep into this recently.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks man! These are great questions. I'll try and address them below:\n\n1. This is actually a great point. If I knew I was going to be doing the SPY HTS indefinitely, I should be running strategy #1 and #2 using /MES (as opposed to /ES due to denominations as you mentioned). This would save money on taxes for strategy #1 and also has significantly less BPR (/MES SPAN beats SPX PM though I expect TOS to eventually lower their SPX stress back to pre-COVID levels). I'm going to look into this more this weekend. Thanks!\n2. Due to PM leverage and the lottos, my notional exposure is something ridiculous like $5M. So I use TOS to stress BP effect under various conditions as mentioned in \"Leverage\" section in my post. I will never accept assignment because with PM for an ITM short put position, the BPR is the same whether I take assignment or roll (another +1 for PM). I will only close for a loss if I no longer believe in the underlying.\n3. I did not consider UVXY. Looks like I have some more HW this weekend lol.

To give you an idea, the BPR for a short put is roughly 4X less compared to a Reg-T account.

One suggestion to hedge tail risk is to mitigate the cost of the hedge itself.  Instead of a long put (or long VIX call), you could finance some or all of the premium with time value.\n\nExample:\n\n* create an asymmetric box spread in SPX to go long volatility with offsetting positive theta, eg:\n   * buy an ITM 3900 call, sell an ITM 3920 call, then buy an OTM 3930 put and sell an OTM 3900 put.  Expected value at expiration is generally 20 points, so you might try to enter the trade long for 19.9 points (if buying a modest amount of volatility), or you could make the long OTM put vertical more aggressive and maybe the spread will cost you 21 points or something.  The idea is that the time value from the call spread will pay for some or all of the net premium on the long OTM put vertical.\n   * Costs relative to a simpler long volatility position:\n      * transaction costs - trading 4 contracts instead of 1 or 2\n      * complexity - different sensitivity to interest rates, maybe taxes, pin/assignment risk (if physically-settled and/or American-style), etc\n      * opportunity cost - upfront capital requirement for the net debit\n      * does little to address the challenge of realizing benefits when the hedge gains (at what point do you take profit?  In how many stages?  Just leave as unrealized gains to maintain portfolio margin requirement?  ...You still face these questions!).  However because you have more open contracts, it may be easier to visualize available alternatives and P/L effect (you already have open positions that you can compare the actual behavior to what you expected and use that information to proceed)\n   * Benefits:\n      * Probably a very margin and cost efficient way to adjust long volatility exposure and get exposure to rates simultaneously\n      * matches a negative expected value trade (long OTM put vertical) with a positive expected value trade (long ITM call vertical)\n\nA \"simpler\" version may be to simply use a long put vertical instead of the long outright, but in exchange for the capital efficiency (compared to the outright long), you'll want a well-defined opinion on the \\*difference\\* in volatility pricing in that part of the curve (across strikes and across time, too) to make sure the hedge can deliver.

TSLA announced SPY at market close, though it actually fell for the first 1.5 days or 2.5, I can't remember which, after the announcement.\n\n I figured the call was good premium but required vigilance rather than a perfect understanding of options pricing on a more macro level, I try to trade things where models will react more slowly than human emotion from unqualified factors in the models, and aside from that follow trends, some value, or trade volatility.\n\nEither way, the gods were watching out for me, even if I tend to close a little prematurely if it goes against me and isn't a stock I actually trade myself.

I just realized the ability for people to be exhuberant despite the runup to $90 already could send it somewhere and exited. \n\nThe problem with my strategy is it takes me down a peg into going in on calls. If you put me as -1 personal sentiment for selling the call exiting just brings me to 0. In reality if I started at 0, I would certainly have bought TSLA calls, but the psychology of going from shorting to long is hard to overcome. I end up going in on less likely outcomes with less payout just because I had no previous negative positions against them. Id say my portion size to risk is one of my best things, so it still works out, but I miss out on all the positions I'd have had a good chance of having bought a few calls on just bc it takes me a few days to overcome being short even though the exact idea that led me to exit calls would mean that buying them would probably be optimal.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Makes sense.
