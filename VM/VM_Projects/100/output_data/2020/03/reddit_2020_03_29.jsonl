{"title": "Direction Play: Net Short via Puts for mid April", "selftext": "**Short-term Bull Case**\n\nFund rebalancing will continue on 30th and 31st to close the month/quarter. Probably an additional $300B or so rotation into equities. It's tough to gage this because I'm sure a lot of rebalancing occurred last week, but it's definitely not finished. Some funds may rebalance a bit later on April 1st; we don't really know all of their timelines. JPM is tracking this and initially said fund rebalancing was on the order of $850B for March and as of Friday is about 40%-45% complete. Last week's bull run may not be over, but we'll see this week how the market responds to the virus accelerating in the US.\n\nOur relief rally might extend through Tuesday with some volatility and perhaps peak at SPY 270 where the option market is priced on the upside (we know for certain that there's a lot of selling pressure at 269. High odds of holding, but ultimately we don't know). There's some minimal bets on 290 and 300 because if 270 breaks there's not much in the way to 300 from a technical perspective, but this is low odds.\n\n**Medium-term Bear Case**\n\nOn the flip side, as we hit 255-260 last week massive put positions were opened in the 200-220 range for both April and May and I witnessed accumulation at 190 for the first time. Some of this is hedging I'm sure, but there are transactions which are very clearly bearish. There's a lot more put activity on SPY & SPX Apr/May puts, which opened on Thursday & Friday. I can give more examples if needed. For those that think it's all hedging or selling, that's not the case. It's pretty easy to identify bear put spreads or larger directional plays. It doesn't make much sense to hedge in 50,000 lots, so these transactions are more obvious. Of course, hedges themselves are bearish because the longs believe there's a significant chance of a retest.\n\nAs the buying pressure lets off by Apr 1, we'll get the next week of jobless claims on April 2 and unemployment data on April 3rd. We may or may not sell off in advance of these events on April 1st, but regardless I'm very confident that Apr 1-3 will be net negative and likely begin the trend towards a retest of March lows. As we continue in April, the coronavirus will continue to ravage and spread across the US where we start seeing most hospitals in several major US cities overwhelmed and infection/death statistics hitting new highs. Sadly, it looks to me like the US healthcare system is less prepared than countries in Asia and US demographics are at much higher risk of death than populations in Asia. In two weeks from now, call it Apr 11, we'll likely see 2,000 deaths per day and over 4m infections (total count, which includes millions not tested). It's difficult for people to comprehend the exponential function of the virus spread but the growth factor in US is about 1.25 and Trump has no plans to institute a nation-wide lockdown for 6-10 weeks so the virus will flourish (all countries which halted the spread initated nation-wide lockdowns). And last of all, there's many buyers thinking this is a bottom, indicating it's not, and massive long-only funds are not going all-in. They are merely cherry picking a few names and dipping their toe in. Pretty soon these bull events will be priced in and the negative news will rain down in mid April.\n\n**Positions**\n\nPlaying April puts is still quite risky and very expensive so I take a pass on that. I've been building put positions for 5/15 in the range of 200-230 and the same for SPX 2000-2200. This is conservative enough for me. I considered June with lower IV, but my research points to something happening in mid April so paying a theta premium for June didn't make sense even though the vol is cheaper. I also think markets tend to react *before* something happens so I think May gives enough time. If SPY rose to 270 and VIX fell to say 50-55 then I would certainly jump on some June puts, perhaps even 230P or 240P; but this is low odds. In this market a VIX in the 40s is very cheap (3%-4% moves when realized vol is 5%-7%, even 9%-12%) and VIX in 50s is quite reasonable; arguably cheap as well since we haven't bottomed and MM are short gamma causing extreme swings.\n\nI'm long puts and long equity, but net short. I keep my option strategies fairly simple and focus more on the research side. I think a bear put spread is good idea for a short position or just long puts if you can time it right (buy low) and willing to take the risk of losing 60%-80%. But the upside on these is more like 100%-200% which is why I'm playing them. There's a pretty massive put spread opened March 20 around 11:10am for 80k contracts on APR17 puts. Long APR17 235P 80k at 12.46, short APR17 210P 80k at 5.44 for a debit of around 55m expiring 4 weeks out. The 210P also had 30k-50k lots purchased as the market fell on March 26th, closing out a huge OI of 254k contracts. The most unusual option activity I found was on March 25 and 26: SPY OCT16 260P 230,000 contracts opened for $700m.\n\nI only buy OTM options to use gamma to my advantage. I try to avoid near-the-money and deep OTM, which is why I'm avoiding <200 and >240.\n\n**Risk**\n\nThis market is definitely headed lower to retest March lows. Where I can be wrong is the timing. A true bottom might only form in May or June depending on how events develop, namely 1) the virus 2) solvency\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you for the positive feedback. Since this post is well received, I'll try to answer some of your questions and provide further analysis.\n\n**Effects of the option market on the underlying**\n\nMarket makers hedge when they are short options. Large blocks of option transactions have material impacts on the underlying because market makers must delta hedge those positions. It's pretty simple to remember: if you open a new long position of an option contract, the seller takes the short side of that option, so to hedge the seller must take the long/short of the underlying. E.g.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|You buy calls (+)|MM buys shares (+) to hedge|\n|:-|:-|\n|You buy puts (-)|MM shorts shares (-) to hedge|\n\nAnd when these positions unwind (close) the opposite effect takes form. This has a sudden material impact when large funds are buying and selling 1k, 5k, 10k, 30k, 50k lots.\n\n**Technical Analysis: My Opinion (debatable)**\n\nThere is some legitimacy to technicals, which is why funds pay 200k+ salaries for technical analysts. Technicals work best when the greatest number of people believe them, so major technicals are most reliable. Things like volume, RSI, 200-day MA, 200-week MA, historical bottoms (major support lines), retracements. That\u2019s about all the TA that I follow and it only forms a small part of my analysis, specifically for when to enter/exit after I\u2019ve completed fundamental analysis on direction. When I say most reliable I mean they work >50% of the time but nowhere near 100. Don't forget, many algos are programmed to trade on technicals. Please avoid any con artists on Youtube drawing lines everywhere with crayons. When the market sold off in Feb & March there was huge uncertainty, so the only thing that was reliable were technicals and that\u2019s what the market fell back on. The market high is 339 and the recent low is 218. A 50% retracement is 278 and as we fell from market highs we saw technicals play an important role in price action as many 50% retracements came to fruition. We don\u2019t have to perfectly retrace at 50%. Since there is so much more fear in the market and perhaps some front-running, it makes sense that we might only retrace 40% (combined with other DD). It\u2019s not just about the numbers, but what events are DRIVING the technicals. You need to combine it with further research.\n\n**Analyzing the other side of the trade: positioning.**\n\nWhen we hit the short-term bottom at 218-220 the VIX was fading because speculators & hedges were taking profits and starting to go long. This makes complete sense because long options are bets on volatility and if you\u2019re holding puts as the market tanks 30%-34% while the VIX hits all-time highs THIS was your time to sell. I mean if you didn\u2019t sell, what were you waiting for? We saw bullish positions opening in 250, 260, 265, and 270 but the magnitude was far less because these calls were so cheap. So you have puts closing with 10x the value of the calls that were opening and the VIX fades.\n\nAs we approach SPY 260 we start to see some call positions closing near 260 and large put positions opening. This provides resistance around 260. The effect would be much, much greater at 270 because most of those APR17 250, 255, 260, 265, 270 calls need to be closed. Many of these call positions cannot remain open because if they were opened in the 220s they have now gone 5x-12x and must be closed as we approach expiry. At the same time, at 260 it\u2019s suddenly a lot cheaper to play the downside or hedge to the downside so new put positions will cause further downward pressure.\n\nOn the long equity side, longs will see 1 week returns upwards of 20% at these 260-270 levels so they are likely to take profits because these funds normally salivate over 11% annualized returns. You also have huge ETF/Mutual Fund buying which caused dog shit companies to have dramatic returns last week even though they are still dog shit. This is another point of weakness when sentiment shifts.\n\n**Is this selling over?**\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of a lag with some long-term holders getting to the point where they freak out and sell. This is the type that either checks their portfiolo less than once per month or the type that clenches their seat as their portfolio sinks 40% because \u201cyou can\u2019t time the markets\u201d and \u201cstocks only go up.\u201d Except the emotion will weigh on them as we fell from 339 to 218, bounce to 260, and will turn in April. Once they realize this isn\u2019t a v-shape recovery the emotion will get to them. In April, many people will get their March statements and clue in that the market is in really bad shape, so there\u2019s more selling to come.\n\nYou don\u2019t get the fastest sell off in history and VIX at all-time high unless something is seriously wrong. Complete economic paralyzation, record unemployment, incoming bankruptcies, pandemic uncertainty, oil sector & airline industry blowing up, permanent change to consumer behavior, and record leverage in the financial system do not allow for a quick recovery. It may take some time for this to develop but it\u2019s a decent indicator. Historically, bear markets last closer to 9 months, the median time to return to all-time highs is 2 years, and a market bottom usually forms around 2 months after the VIX peaks. Feel free to fact check these (consider the magnitude of this bear) because I haven\u2019t looked at these stats in awhile. Point is, the market isn\u2019t going to fix itself in April.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nEDIT: Just want to add a bit of a disclaimer here if anyone is thinking of acting on this. I'm not here to offer investment advice. I'm just here to share my opinion on what I'm observing in the market, what I am doing as a result, and why I'm doing it. Hopefully I welcome different perspectives on these subjects and constructive criticism. If I mention specific numbers in my post it just means that those numbers hold significance to my analysis but in no way shape or form does it mean we are guaranteed to hit those numbers with accuracy. Maybe the markets crank up to 265 but reverses hard. Maybe oil tanks 20% tomorrow and drags the market with it. Maybe some outlier bear news hits the tape on Monday morning and the bull trend dies. To be successful in trading it's more about risk management, so don't go all-in on trades. Develop a thesis, stick to defined rules, be disciplined. Gradually work into your trades and gradually work out of your trades (or just exit 95% of it if you hit some pre-existing profit goal).

For large block sizes hitting a single transaction I think it's more likely to be part of a larger arbitrage transaction than a hedge.

If transactions drop the bid it's being sold.\n* If you have the \"best 3-day bull trend\" in history and at the end of that third day put positions are being opened when SPY is high and VIX is low, those are longs (bearish).\n* We can see the transaction sizes and timing. If market is hitting a strong resistance level (think 259) and suddenly call volume spikes on 250C, 255C, 260C, that's profit-taking. If put volume spikes on 200P, 210P, 220P when you're reaching new highs, that's new positions.\n* Likewise, if SPY is hitting 220 support at record VIX and you see put volume spiking, that's profit taking. And if call volume spikes here that's new positions.\n* The best indicators are tracking the option market in the last 50 min of trading, but mostly in the last 15 min of trading.\n\n>I have some thoughts on the Oct16 260p volume but it's pure speculation so I'll keep it to myself.\n\nI have a lot of uncertainty about those October puts. They were purchased at a time when you would want to go short on the market (now). But the long-term duration of them is odd because current market forecasts place the market near that level at year end.\n\nThis could be a short position because it's purchased at a time when IV is high so by October the vega will bleed, theta will bleed, and I'm sure this virus thing will be contained long by then (maybe even a vaccine by Oct), so a market above 2600 closing out the year is very likely and will expire these puts. I think I'll change my thesis to a short position. If it were long because of near-term vol, they'd probably choose near-term contracts.\n\nCan you share your thoughts?", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.006441605743020773}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "No in this spread, they want it to expire below the 210 so both puts are ITM.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's a put debit spread therefore max profits are when both puts are ITM", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I read op wrong.

{"title": "Quit my Job to Become a F/T Options Trader! Start Monday Morning. - This Time w/my Trading Strategies!", "selftext": "Everyone has to find their own comfort level. I will not be buying $rope (thank you for the advice), and I will not be jumping out of a window. I have a great resume but I'm never going to use it again.....EVER, and I am on great terms with my old boss (I sold my business but if I needed to go back into business, I could if I chose to.....that will be my decision to make.) Thanks for all the great advice, but here is my real strategy:\n\nBecause I'm quite conservative (I'm much more buy-and-hold), I'm really only selling cash secured puts and covered calls right now. With crazy volatility like we are seeing, premiums are fat so selling weekly's keeps my timeline short in case I make a mistake.....and even then, sometimes 5 trading sessions is like a lifetime. I prefer to sell puts 20% - 30% OTM on big down days and sometimes I don't even make a trade until Tuesday or Wednesday (with a Friday expiration). I only trade stocks that I know very well and currently own, or stocks that I would be willing to add to my portfolio (there's enough of them out there). If I actually get something put to me, it's really not punishment (or a loss for me).....I just get to own some stock (or some more stock), really, REALLY cheap. My goal here is to not get stocks put to me, but if I get something put to me, then I start my covered call strategy.\n\nI sell covered calls on everything in my portfolio. I prefer a longer timeline here (generally 6 - 12 months out), but with this kind of volatility, I had to buy everything back (locked in my profits) when we started the downturn. I am now selling (weekly's) on my covered calls. This is a MUCH more dangerous game. I sell my covered calls OTM with an expiration date no more than 5 trading sessions out. On these trades, my goal is to be accurate 100% of the time so I'm willing to take slightly less option premium for the safety of owning my stock next week and doing it again. The cost of being wrong is that I could generate a significant tax consequence, and lose a dividend if I'm trading on a stock that pays dividends. That, and I ultimately may not own a stock that I really WANT to own and I may potentially need to buy it back at a higher cost basis. Needless to say I'm much more cautious with these trades. Regardless of my cost basis, I start EVERY trade by asking myself the exact same question: \n\n\"If I bought this stock today....and at this price....would I be willing to accept a return of: xx% if the stock was to go up and this option was to actually be exercised?\"\n\nBy looking at each trade absent any outside factors, if the answer is: \"Yes, I would be willing to accept a 27% return in 3-4 trading sessions if in fact that event was to happen\", I pull the trigger without hesitation. If I was to get called out, on Monday morning I reevaluate my strategy and start over. Now in the back of my mind, I always have the tax consequence / dividend risk as a consideration, but every trade gets the merits of being a brand new trade....and having done this for 25 years, I know where my own risk/reward lies.\n\nThis might be \"The Wheel\" strategy you say. Well, not exactly. My goal is ALWAYS to keep my stock....100% of the time.....ALWAYS!!! Also, I was doing this 25 years ago before it was called a \"Wheel\" Strategy. Back then, we just called it options trading and it has served me very well through 25 years of up and down markets.\n\nJust a couple more items:\n\n1) Once in a while when the stars line up, I do like to jump out there and have a little bit of fun. On 3/24 when Boeing was at $120, I sold a bunch of BA 4/17 $110 PUTS for $16. I missed the absolute bottom - but my son nailed it (GD proud Father). If I was to get assigned, I would not be opposed to owning Boeing at $94/share. Depending on where BA is on 4/20, I may actually try it again. I actually believe I could own Boeing within the next 6 months for less than $90/share. If not, I walk away with $1,600/contract and live to fight another day!\n\n2) I am ok with trading a volatile market. I never trade stocks with underlying fundamental issues.\n\n3) I don't need any of this money to live on or pay my bills. I'm just using a great opportunity to increase my net worth and have a little bit of fun doing it.\n\n4) I have probably made 10,000 option trades over the past 25 years and have \"played\" my way through a couple of these ugly markets already. I \"day-traded\" my way through college. I have lost $11,000 in one hour (and I didn't like it), and bought a brand new BMW 750il trading options (this was more enjoyable). I have refined my strategy over 25 years and am very comfortable with my risk/reward.\n\n5) I have not lost on a trade in more than 6 months (I am conservative). I have not had either a put or a call assigned and when I tell people my goal is to be 100%, you can imagine their skepticism. Doesn't matter. It's my goal, not yours. I absolutely could be wrong (and I probably will be), but it won't be because I PLANNED to fail. For all of my friends that think a 90% success rate is good, every time they lose on a trade, they need two successful trades to make up for it. BE ACCURATE THE FIRST TIME!!!!! \n\n6) If you get up in the morning and throw up before you eat your first handful of Tums, you are probably doing this wrong!", "id": "fr8rag", "created_utc": 1585500060.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 296, "comments": [{"body": "Alright I did some digging in this guys post history for yall.

But to state that \"you can lose it all\" is pretty misleading. You don't lose anything when doing covered puts/calls strategy, unless the company completely goes insolvent. Even, for example, a downturn like this. If you continue to sell covered calls within your risk margin, while tracking what your cost basis is, it's still very profitable. I own 500 shares of Ford with a cost basis of $2.53 per share right now. So even though the company has gotten ravaged over the past few weeks, I'm still selling 5 call contracts every single week on those shares 2 strikes above what it's trading at when I enter the trade on Monday.

He collected the premiums he listed on weekly put options he sold (add them all up, x5 because he was always selling 5 contracts), and after the last contract executed he purchased at $3k, but already made $1735 on the put options. So his cost basis is 3000-1735=1265 then 1265/500=2.53 per share.\n\nSo if he sold at $5 per share now, he'd make $2.47 per share.

You're not taking into consideration volatility affecting pricing. Also just because his last option was at $6 doesn't mean they all were at that same price. \n\nExample stock goes down to $5, so you sell a put at $5, and due to volatility you sell at $0.80/share. Stock goes up from there to $5.50, so no execution. \n\nIn this case, he likely sold that put when the price was at around $5.40, thinking it would keep going up. It didn't get high enough, so he got assigned. \n\nThe reason he's able to so significantly reduce his cost basic is ONLY because this volatility is completely bonkers, and he's made several correct sales in a row, which isn't going to happen every time. \n\nI made a 15% return on my 7 puts I sold, against the cash securing it.

There seems to be some general confusion, and if I'm wrong, I will apologize, but a lot of people seem to be under the impression that every transaction has a buyer and a seller on both sides of every transaction and that is really not the case. In order to maintain the necessary liquidity in the market, the Market Maker is the true holder of pretty much every single transaction......meaning that if there is a seller but no buyer, the Market Maker becomes the buyer.

That is basically the \"price\" generated by a pricing model. But have you ever wondered why there is a difference in price between the Bid and the Ask? That's the Market Maker taking their \"cut\" if you will. So in a lot of instances, the Market Maker is holding a LOT of contracts come execution date, and basically the \"system\" executes those closing transactions. Maybe most people understand that, but kind of state it somewhat uniquely but the chances that there is some other person on the other side of that transaction is somewhat misconstrued when in fact the Market Maker could be that other \"Person\", and the \"system\" will execute that trade automatically based on a trigger.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking of making a post about that just for clarification, but given the response from this crowd, I may re-think that possibility.

In an article last week, I discussed a promising drug combination to treat the disease. There is now new data supporting this treatment. Since then, Kansas City area physicians, including Joe Brewer, Dan Hinthorn and me, continue to treat many patients, and some have shown improvement. Major medical centers including the University of Washington and Mass General have added hydroxychloroquine to treatment options. So here\u2019s an update, a response to some questions that have come up, and suggestions based on the latest information.\n\nWhat is the treatment?\n\nPhysicians are using two drugs in combination\u2014hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which I\u2019ll abbreviate HC and AZ\u2014to treat patients with advanced Covid-19 symptoms. We use a regimen reported in a recent open-label trial in Marseille, France, which was updated March 26, and which doctors may modify in any given case.\n\nWhat is the evidence?\n\nFor HC, two bodies of evidence support its potential in treating Covid-19: in vitro (test tube) studies and initial clinical reports from the field. After the 2002-03 global outbreak of SARS, a coronavirus related to the one that causes Covid-19, an in vitro study conducted by doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified chloroquine (a relative of HC) as an attractive option for prevention and treatment. If added before the virus was introduced, the drug was highly effective in preventing cellular infection. Even later application markedly inhibited infection. Another contemporaneous study showed similar results. As for Covid, a Chinese study published March 9 showed HC has excellent in vitro effects. Other recent information suggests potential antiviral mechanisms of HC and chloroquine.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.
