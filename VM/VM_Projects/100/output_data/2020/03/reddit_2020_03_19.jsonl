{"title": "Treatment options coming ASAP for Covid-19. Please read.", "selftext": "There has recently been an uptick in promising drug treatments for Covid-19. The most recent research is narrowing in on the fact that treatment must take place in two phases. First is to give antivirals to patients in the early stages of the disease. Then once the patient develops ARDS, to give anti-inflammatories. The drugs used in each stage that have shown promise can be found below. \n\n**Antivirals**\n\nRemdesivir: main issue is cost (~$1K per day - Gilead)\n\nFavipiravir: Japan based drug. Has a huge supply, prob. enough to export \n\nLopinavir/Ritonavir: Used already vs HIV/AIDS (AbbVie)\n\n**Anti-Inflammatories**\n\nHydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine: Cytokine inhibitor (Sanofi/Bayer)\n\nActemra (tocilizumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Roche)\n\nKevzara (sarilumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Regeneron and Sanofi)\n\nTrump knows this but faces two hurdles. \n\n1. Cost of drug produced. \n\n2. Treatment approval from the FDA.\n\nTrump cleared the first hurdle by enacting the Defense Production Act of 1950 which allows him to give orders to the private sector to start production and control drug prices to prevent profiteering. (Ex. Gilead)\n\nIn regards to the second hurdle, Trump hinted earlier today in the press conference that he had some exciting news to share about the FDA tomorrow. Some leaked rumors are saying that he has secured conditional approval by the FDA to allow the use of the drugs above. If so, Trump has paved the way for the immediate scaling and treatment of Covid-19 in the US. This is huge and will have a large psychological impact on sentiment along with the recent stimulus passed.\n\nSPY calls at bottom tomorrow before the presser. Market is going to jump on the news during it.\n\nEdit: Source of rumors\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DrDenaGrayson/status/1240267808807833610\n\nhttps://twitter.com/weijia/status/1240456119270678530\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ChuckCallesto/status/1240448201100005376\n\nhttps://archive.fo/LjaA7\n\nEdit 2 3/19: ITS HAPPENING https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-expected-to-detail-new-virus-therapies-but-expansion-could-be-controversial-11584629965?tesla=y&mod=article_inline", "id": "fl4spb", "created_utc": 1584596531.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 322, "replies": [{"body": "Two of those drugs are biologics that are very expensive to produce and will likely not scale up well or cheaply.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "But also only a small percentage of people will need these drugs, only if they have severe symptoms and develop ARDS.

(If used as a stand alone investment) Why? Because the future price movement is unknown, and each future price is a probability function of the last price. It can have a trend (normally upwards, at the moment downwards). But the future expected volatility aka implied volatility is priced in. It is only not gambling, if you are better than the market in predicting either trend or volatility. But guess what? Options are a zero sum game. If you increase the amount of bets or \"draws\", everyone seems to have the same mathematical probability LIKE IN A CASINO. It is gambling. And actually really dangerous, probably even more than going  to a casino. The problem of it is quite similiar. Even IF you make a good amount of money, people are really bad, especially autists like you, to do proper risk and money management. You made 100k out of 10k?

I would not consider trading options with your own money, the way most people in this sub do it, real work.
