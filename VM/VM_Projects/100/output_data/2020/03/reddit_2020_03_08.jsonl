Not saying this is likely to happen, but just wanted to see what those contrarian factors may be.\n\n1) The fact is that this bug has a low kill rate (for now) in the working age population at 0.2% or less. The hospitalization rate for severe cases is also not clear for this age group alone, but seems to be less than the 10-20% quoted before. Potentially, this group could go back to work and just deal with the bug if kept quarantined from older or more vulnerable populations who could get sicker.\n\n2)  Rapid tests can help people determine whether to quarantine. South korean tests can already identify corona results in hours not days. There's US companies working on tests that can give a positive or negative in minutes:\n\n [https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/massachusetts-company-says-rapid-detection-is-needed-to-slow-spread-of-coronavirus/2087414/](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/massachusetts-company-says-rapid-detection-is-needed-to-slow-spread-of-coronavirus/2087414/) \n\nIf these can be deployed more broadly, they can help identify when someone needs to quarantine, before they can spread the disease\n\n3) Past pandemics have had a rapid recovery in a matter of months not years:\n\n [https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-coronavirus-could-mean-for-the-global-economy](https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-coronavirus-could-mean-for-the-global-economy) \n\nIn what ways is this different from past pandemics?\n\n4) China and Korea seem to have a lid on their cases and are getting back to work. So it can be done. Will have to be seen if the handwashing and quarantine of people with a sniffle will keep numbers down once the crowds build back up, but it seems it is possible. \n\nAgain, I'm not convinced any of this will save the US from the shitshow it's about to fall into for the next month or so. And certain sectors like travel and tourism are probably fucked for a long time no matter what happens. Just want to see what alternate hypothesis are out there that have a chance of driving the market broadly in the other direction. \n\nIf you can add to this DD to help it become less retarded please do.", "id": "ffbwtp", "created_utc": 1583670584.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "When the majority thinks it's going down, like when your barber tells you to move to gold.", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "\"*Buy when people are fearful.
