{"title": "Prediction for the coming week, plays included.", "selftext": "This week has the appearance of being an absolute bloodbath. However I believe it will create a possible opportunity for short term options plays. As of 8:50 PM, it appears that the dow will open down by about 11-1200 points. This will likely cause panic and possible intervention from the federal reserve. This intervention will likely consist of a further rate drop of about .5-.75 basis points and controls on shorts. (Based on reactions to the \u201808 crisis) If tomorrow or Tuesday leads to rumors of a possible meeting by the fed, I would suggest picking up ITM calls on XLF and or XLK with an expiration of March 20th. I would highly recommend dumping these on Friday. In addition, should news come that rates will be cut and the markets rise, I will be purchasing XLF and XLK puts to be held into Monday. \n\nI am curious about this subreddits moves for the next week and possible issues that people may have with my moves.", "id": "ffmfpx", "created_utc": 1583715239.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Another cut already?

In China it has been higher but outside of China it is lower. It averages out to around 3%. The seasonal flu averages somewhere between 0.1% and 0.8% mortality rate depending on source and which country you look at. \n\nThe current values for China are at 3.8% mortality rate. Which still isn\u2019t high for a virus when compared to Bird flu, Ebola and other outbreaks over the past 100 years. Now if we look at South Korea. They have 7,500 cases that are confirmed but they only have 54 deaths so far. That gives us a percentage of 0.7%. Japan has had 530 confirmed cases but only 9 deaths, this leaves us with a percentage of 1.7%. Sweden has 320 cases but no deaths. Italy has 9,200 cases currently and 463 deaths. Both Italy and Iran have a high amount of deaths compared to cases when compared to the rest of the world. Italy has a relatively old population, especially in the north around Milan. So they will be more effected than other places. Iran on the other hand has a healthcare system that lacks funds and the country in general lacks a lot of resources to handle an outbreak of this scale because of the amount of sanctions placed on them. Because of these factors you have a higher mortality rate in these countries. You will also likely have a higher mortality rate in the United States unless the government does something to fix the healthcare system as well as making sure that people don\u2019t loose their jobs because they are sick. This may cause people to go to work and infect others when sick. As well as not seeking medical attention when really sick because of lack of funds or insurance. \n\nWhen averaging out the mortality rates for each countries then sure I might be a bit off with 3% but I am not far off, but the numbers are also affected by what each country is doing to curb the amount of deaths. A country like Sweden or Norway will have a lot more ability to save people\u2019s lives when compared with somewhere poorer with less of a built up healthcare system.\n\nTo be clear, both my parents work within healthcare and work with some of the top doctors and medical professionals in Sweden.

Surely you didn't invest half your savings with a known financial need upcoming.

If you're above the mark to cover the expense, take that money out and put it in high interest savings until you need it.  Continue investing the rest.

The stocks I have are actually from my grandparents; I\u2019ve had this in mutual funds most of my whole life. So nothing I invested personally.

It\u2019s more a question of: 1) if I leave the savings alone (which have already gone down $6k from its peak in Feb 2020) or 2) do I hold it until I actually need to pay for school (which will be mid-2021) and hope the $6k recovers and then some.
