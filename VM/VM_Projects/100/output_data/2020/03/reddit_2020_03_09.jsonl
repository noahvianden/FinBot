{"title": "Prediction for the coming week, plays included.", "selftext": "This week has the appearance of being an absolute bloodbath. However I believe it will create a possible opportunity for short term options plays. As of 8:50 PM, it appears that the dow will open down by about 11-1200 points. This will likely cause panic and possible intervention from the federal reserve. This intervention will likely consist of a further rate drop of about .5-.75 basis points and controls on shorts. (Based on reactions to the \u201808 crisis) If tomorrow or Tuesday leads to rumors of a possible meeting by the fed, I would suggest picking up ITM calls on XLF and or XLK with an expiration of March 20th. I would highly recommend dumping these on Friday. In addition, should news come that rates will be cut and the markets rise, I will be purchasing XLF and XLK puts to be held into Monday. \n\nI am curious about this subreddits moves for the next week and possible issues that people may have with my moves.", "id": "ffmfpx", "created_utc": 1583715239.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Another cut already?
