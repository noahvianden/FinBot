Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia Tuturiol](https://www.investopedia.com/university/all/fundamental-analysis/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "fhw8q1", "created_utc": 1584086891.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "Also, anyone notice that when the regular stocks are going up, many of the biotech corona stocks are mostly going down?

If you order a stock with \"day only\" on a Saturday your order will simply expire since - again - the market is closed today. $23.12 is the last known price tag for a stock that was used right before the market closed, but despite being official, in reality it is gone already and only exists in theory anymore. As far as I understand it: even after hour prices don't necessarily mirror the real market. Especially in uncertain times like we do have now. \n\nHere's more information: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/after-hours-trading-am-i-able-to-trade-at-this-time/\n\n>I'm using Schwab and the order type is market order, but for the timing, it says \"Day Only\" which says \" Expires at the end of the trading day if not filled.\" I'm a bit confused\n\nOne way to buy a stock as soon as possible (monday morning) is to create a market order that is not tied to a date.

A couple of years later, it dropped the uptick rule for all equity securities. However, the SEC still monitored naked short selling (even though naked short selling is prohibited in the U.S), and within a few years the SEC took emergency actions to limit illegal naked short selling as the mortgage crisis and credit crisis deepened and fluctuations in the market increased. In the fall of 2008, the financial crisis had spread across the world, leading countries to implement temporary short selling bans and restrictions on financial sectors securities. These countries include the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Canada and others that followed suit. (Read our tutorial on Credit Crisis to get more in-depth information on this crisis.)\n\n>\tShort selling bans have been utilized from the beginning of the financial markets and throughout history to address abuses like spreading negative rumors about a company to manipulate markets. However, many bans are repealed because short sellers have a significant role in the markets. The SEC identifies their importance based on their:\n\n>\tContribution to efficient price discovery\nMitigating market bubbles\nIncreasing market liquidity\nPromotion of capital formation\nFacilitating hedging and other management activities\nLimits to upward market manipulation\n\n>A good example of the short seller's significance involved identifying the overpriced stock at Enron. Short seller James Chanos examined the company's accounting practices and discovered that something was amiss. Some argue his awareness helped to uncover the accounting fraud known as the \"Enron scandal\" which put its executives behind bars.\n\nSecure tendies slowly... but secure tendies nonetheless", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Secured.

{"title": "To my fellow autists, a tip from the wise.", "selftext": "The markets are acting towards the way a recession would progress. Be calm and (try) to play it smart.\n\nDays like today where the market is up +5% is just as worrying in a market as those big down days. It's indicating a few possible scenarios:\n\n1. Large managed accounts are buying in a tiered format after a couple down days, so that they can become profitable in the future and will (somewhat) have bought some stock during the low point.\n\n2. Short sellers are cashing in and claiming their tendies.\n\n3. Bullish investors are trying hard to create a support line, but don't realize that they are just pushing the price up to a point that some panic investors will sell out while they can on the up day.\n\n\n\nUntil the market starts stabilizing, take these green days  with a grain of salt. Make sure you have enough cash set aside to potentially weather a couple years if this turns into a full blown recession. Don't be stupid if the money you are using is needed to take care of your loved ones, they are more important than money will ever be.\n\nFor the bulls, we feel your pain and just remember that it might suck right now but keep pushing forward. A lot of people's accounts have dropped right now and you could try doing some hedging of the losses, whether it's married puts or getting out of some stocks that you don't think would be able to survive a recession. Keep on buying if you want to and just bathe yourself in the red and enjoy it, cause you know that at some point the market should recover and surpass where it's at now. Prayers and love to each and everyone of you.\n\nLastly, wash your hands, stock up on supplies, and don't panic about the coronavirus. Instead just be cautious and treat people with respect as humans tend to get hostile in survival mode. \n\nSorry for the wall of text/autism.
