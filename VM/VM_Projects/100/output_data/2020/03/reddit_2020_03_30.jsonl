This almost always ends in disaster as the market bounces and then proceeds to fall further from its previous lows. This occurred prior to the record lows during the Great Depression and the Great Recession in 2008.\n\nBull Trap\n\nA \u201cbull trap\u201d occurs when people \u201cbullish\u201d about the market fail to recognize that the fundamentals of earnings, revenue, and employment are screwed, and yet continue to buy up stocks ignoring the obvious. They think that sentiment will overpower the fact that companies are screwed and going bankrupt and buy into an overpriced market thinking it will magically go up.\n\nConclusion\n\nRegardless of what category you fall into, it is clear that the current rally cannot be sustained until the economy starts functioning again.
