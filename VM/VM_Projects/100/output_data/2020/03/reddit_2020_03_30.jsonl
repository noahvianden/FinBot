This almost always ends in disaster as the market bounces and then proceeds to fall further from its previous lows. This occurred prior to the record lows during the Great Depression and the Great Recession in 2008.\n\nBull Trap\n\nA \u201cbull trap\u201d occurs when people \u201cbullish\u201d about the market fail to recognize that the fundamentals of earnings, revenue, and employment are screwed, and yet continue to buy up stocks ignoring the obvious. They think that sentiment will overpower the fact that companies are screwed and going bankrupt and buy into an overpriced market thinking it will magically go up.\n\nConclusion\n\nRegardless of what category you fall into, it is clear that the current rally cannot be sustained until the economy starts functioning again.

Reportedly they are inexpensive, can be quickly manufactured in large volumes, and can be taken orally, so if they are useful in treating COVID-19 that would be very good news. Of course the trials should continue - not just for treatment, but there have even been some suggestions that they might be useful for the most at-risk healthcare workers as a preventative measure - that would be great if it turns out to be true.\n\nThese are two of the drugs that Elon Musk has been suggesting for further investigation, and apparently his comments significantly raised the visibility of previous tests. (And since that time, Trump has been urging further tests.)\n\nThe FDA has recently been subjected to harsh criticism for excessively strict adherence to formal protocols that greatly slowed down the availability of COVID-19 testing in the US. While there's plenty of blame to share among various parts of the government, reportedly the FDA made it extremely difficult for many labs to develop COVID-19 tests, while the one test they initially approved for development turned out to be useless, resulting in a six-week delay in the widespread availability of tests in the US. Six weeks could have made an enormous difference in knowledge of the spread of the disease, tracking of individual cases, and ultimately in the number of people in the US who get sick and die from the disease.\n\nSome models suggest that most of the people in the US who are going to die from COVID-19 are going to do so in the next month or two. The FDA appears to have figured out that if a full formal approval process takes six months (or whatever they have planned) and then finds out that the treatment is safe and effective, then blocking use of the drugs until then would have resulted in many unnecessary deaths. It's encouraging if the FDA has now recognized that during a fast-moving health crisis, the optimum approach calls for a quicker than usual decision process.\n\nAnd relevant to this subreddit, of course, if fewer people get sick and die from COVID-19, the impact to the economy can also be lessened, and TSLA can go back up sooner.
