Right now, the specific energy of batteries is roughly 2 percent that of liquid fuel. Factor in the efficiency of electric powertrains compared to internal combustion engines, and yet get closer to 7 percent\u2014so 1,000 pounds of jet fuel yields about 14 times more energy than a 1,000-pound battery.\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s already been a lot of progress,\u201d says Venkat Srinivasan, a battery scientist at Argonne National Lab in Chicago. Battery energy density is rising by a non-negligible 2 to 3 percent per year.

I'd actually like to examine this, personally, for a moment:\n\nIn terms of energy density, batteries are currently 1.69% that of aviation fuel according to the numbers you've listed above. Assuming that scales exactly with range (it doesn't, more is used in the takeoff and landing than cruising meaning that the numbers will be worse than I show here) you would then have planes that can only make extremely short distance hops. Taking for instance the [range of a 737](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737), a similar electric platform could go roughly 120km. If you increase the conversion to 7% via your argument listed above, this would give less than 500km range.  This isn't promising.\n\nHowever, I can also state from [closer-to-home sources](https://www.harbourair.com/harbour-air-and-magnix-announce-successful-flight-of-worlds-first-commercial-electric-airplane/) that this isn't without its use cases. Sea planes are fairly ideal for electric testing, specifically because the safety margin is easier managed with an endless supply of \"runway\" beneath you if you do end up losing power. (Edit: also, for context, the normal Victoria, BC  to Vancouver, BC flights - not seaplanes - take 18 minutes. Roughly 100km.)\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is that this is a fantastic topic for discussion; I think both possible arguments have significant merit, and I'd go so far as to say just the research in these couple comments would be sufficient for me to approve a thread on the viability/lack thereof of electric planes. Even though it's at best tangential to Tesla at the moment, it could be great.\n\n---\n\nNow let's get back on track:\n\n> I think it's unreasonable to have to source every statement and again doesn't seem to apply to anyone else, but I do take the point that it's not a strong argument without sourcing. \n\nThis is a reasonable point, and one I think can be demonstrated by the following. You said:\n\n> So in 8 years battery density will go from 350Wh/L to 12000Wh/L? Ok then...\n\nThis makes a factual claim about the current battery density, the proposed future battery density, and disparages it as impossible. It's not wrong, as shown by your sources - that certainly won't happen anytime soon. But it's without context or anything to make it a reasonable argument.\n\nIf you'd instead stated:\n\n> The required energy density to match aviation fuel is unreachable right now. In my opinion, that won't be possible for a long time.\n\nI wouldn't have removed it regardless of later comments.\n\nThe issue is that the first leaves no room for discussion. It's unsourced, dismissive, and doesn't contribute effectively to the discussion.\n\nIf we compare that to the original comment, the only overlap is that it is unsourced. It is not dismissive, and it contributes to discussion by giving a new topic on which to talk. That's why, even though it isn't perfect, I've left it up.\n\n> I don't think that having an \"order of magnitude\" discussion should need a really robust debate - it's just not even close for aviation. \n\nAnd yet, as per my link, electric airplanes are *currently a thing*. Hence why discussion is more productive than dismissing. I'm sure it's not what you meant, or what you were envisioning, but that doesn't mean it's not relevant or discussable.\n\n> Isn't the onus on people to do a few minutes of research on google before posting things like \"Tesla will disrupt the plane business\"?\n\nI'd prefer it if they did, but I won't ban them for it. Unless a materially false statement is in some way harmful (AKA trolling, harassing, manipulation) discussion *is* the way to solve it (in my opinion). That's what debate is for; people looking for others with information and perspectives they don't have. This wouldn't be much of a forum is nobody was ever allowed to be wrong.\n\nSimilarly, should I be removing your comments because electric seaplanes are a thing? Doesn't seem productive to me.\n\nDoes that answer things? Did I misunderstand?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The point I was trying to make was not that you can't make an electric airplane - of course it's absolutely feasible to get something that can fly some distance on electric power (and that's certainly very cool).  The point I was making is that this is not, in any way, a path to the disruption of the aerospace industry.  Let's say you do a great commercial electric \"jet\" and aimed at short distance high traffic routes like DFW-JFK.  Let's assume the market supports the design/development/testing/certification of that airplane - you're still in the situation where you are carrying 10x the fuel mass than a similarly custom designed \"plant-burning\" plane aimed at that market.  \n\nAutomotive mitigates this in several ways.  Just a few points off the top of my head (there are many more):  1) ICE engines are typically 20-30% efficient where Telsa motors are up around 95%, 2) You're quite happy having a car with 1/3 to 1/2 the range because you can stop whenever you want, 3) the relationship between vehicle weight and fuel consumption is very different (gravity vs inertia etc).  \n\nAerospace is different:  1) high bypass turbojets are already at near 100% combustion efficiency, so you don't get any gains going electric 2) you can't stop (obviously)  3) [Weight is so much more important](https://www.traveller.com.au/airline-weight-reduction-to-save-fuel-the-crazy-ways-airlines-save-weight-on-planes-h14vlh).\n\nMaybe I'm missing something key here, but I don't see how electric can be disruptive without some kind of technology revolution in storage density.  I sincerely hope we get this and soon.\n\nSome of your more specific points since I finished work:\n\nI think if you're doing rough estimates then the additional energy consumption for take off for fixed wing vehicles is going to be roughly equivalent between electric and fuel.  Big aerospace companies are doing R&D into electric turbofans and the physics of power and lift once you convert the energy from chemical-kinetic is going to be roughly equivalent assuming you can build an electric turbofan which is as good as a jet engine (which currently we can't).  You get some weight back for the engines themselves in electric (they are much lighter), and you probably break even on the fuel tanks / lines with additional electrics.  Generally for a commercial jet you're going to throttle up to 90%+ N1 which is typically about 2-3x the power required for cruising - physics means this has to be available for takeoff just to push through thicker air with a much increased aerodynamic profile (flaps).  Landing isn't too much of a power increase even for commercial jets - your final approach power increase for flaps is typically very short and partially offset by the fact you're trying to lose altitude.  \n\nI think less promising than the 500km range is the very slow and incremental progress on battery chemistry.  3% ish increase per year means we're not going to solve this problem soon, and I have no idea where this comment \"[i]n about 8 years battery density will be at a point that will allow the creation of electric planes\" comes from - it's just misleading.  Again, you have to get into the same ball park to compete, or you have to find other mitigating factors.   This is also why a lot of R&D is going into biofuels to try and create carbon neutral jet fuel (sadly this is also plagued with complex challenges).  Worth also noting that Musk is taking the same approach for SpaceX which is why Raptor is methalox based instead of the old school Merlin RP1 based.  Not only is this much better for ISRU fuel generation, it's easier to get carbon neutral on. \n\nWhile some small companies might be happy with buying electric planes for specific short routes, the vast majority of commercial air carriers need a decent amount of range to service their routes, and typically they don't want airplanes from many different manufacturers due to spares, maintenance and training.  Range also gives them flexibility on routes and is a critical safety factor for diversions, ATC holding and other such - a 500km plane can't fly a 500km route - it has to have reserves.  So your addressable market is, at best, extremely small in terms of the aviation industry.  You also have to convince finance executives that your product is more competitive and will make them more money in an industry which already has ball-crushingly low margins.  Lastly, the regulatory framework for aerospace is completely different and incredibly challenging, and while that's not at all insurmountable for someone like Musk (who seems to have a magic wand) - it is very off putting for anyone that wants to move fast.  Opalampo's post was \"Tesla might even disrupt the plane business\", and I was commenting on not the feasibility of electric planes, but the \"feasibility of electric planes .. to disrupt the plane business\".  \n\nIf I had to make a bet, I'd say Musk knows everything I've said here already, and knew it years ago.  This is exactly the sort of first-principles analysis that he does better than anyone.  Hyperloop (Boring co) / maglev trains have more chance to disrupt short high-traffic routes, and Starship has more chance to disrupt long haul, in my opinion.  \n\nThe magniX plane looks cool, but honestly I'd wait for more detailed specs to get excited.  I hope they succeed.  Some links since you're interested.  This is a decent roundup of some of the startups and research projects in electric flight:\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2018/07/08/the-electric-aircraft-is-taking-off/\n\nThis is more promising for the short term - a hybrid plane that has enough batteries for short hops and a gas turbine to generate electricity for longer trips.  The Chevy Volt of planes.  Not sure it scales to larger jets because they already have an additional gas turbine for power generation (APU - auxiliary power unit), and don't know if they will get the turbofan performance high enough.\n\nhttps://zunum.aero/\n\nSo for the record I hope I'm completely wrong.  I'd happily bear any slings and arrows of public humiliation to move the needle on aerospace's contribution to climate change.\n\nOn your points about communication, of course you are correct.  I get bored and frustrated with misinformation and get pretty dismissive when I can tell someone hasn't bothered to learn anything before expressing an opinion.

{"title": "Disney is severely undervalued", "selftext": "Alright, so I know this place has turned into a gay bear orgy over the past few weeks, but I'm here to tell the straights and bulls who are just experimenting in college how to make some serious tendies without feeling dirty.\n\nCurrently, Disney is trading below 110, putting it at the same levels as it was in late March of 2019. So right off the bat, its priced at the same level as it was before several very important factors were priced in:\n\n1. The Disney-Fox merger being approved.\n\n2.  Disney+ release and demonstrated success.\n\n3. Galaxy Edge opening.\n\n4. Increased stake in Hulu.\n\n\"But wait!\", I can hear you saying, \"They must be losing SO much revenue from their parks being closed!\"\n\nYes and no. While parks are undoubtedly a big source of revenue for the company, in recent years, their media networks have edged them out as the top dog, while also being more profitable due to lower operating costs.   This is a trend which is likely to continue as their streaming services gain a greater foothold, and will more than make up for the steady decline of traditional tv services. \n\nNow, having established that parks are not actually the biggest moneymaker for the mouse, we will to figure out what exactly the impact to that revenue stream would be. Chinese parks have already begun reopening, and were closed for just the tail end of the Chinese New Year rush and the following month, which would have tapered off significantly in crowds anyway. We can project the same results to US parks and estimate about a months hit to park revenue, followed by a short slump and then normal operations. This means that March and most of April may be more or less out, but we can expect normal operations by June on. Peak Season.\n\nSo looking at perhaps a 10 percent disruption to operations of a revenue stream which only provides 24-26% of Disney total revenue, how much did the stock drop? Over 25 percent.\n\nNow, when you consider how blue chip Disney is, and the short time frame we can apply to the disrupting effect, I expect to see a major rally for $DIS in the next 1-2 months, most likely correcting to the high 130s or low 140s as value investors realize how oversold it has become over corona fears. Buying calls in this range to the low 150s for late June through next year could result in serious tendies.\n\nTLDR;  The mouse always gets his cheese. 7/17 $140 calls.\n\nEdit: some good advice from a few other members. There will most likely be at leastone more big dip, so theres an opportunity to grab short puts for some quick cash, and then snap up long term calls even cheaper.", "id": "fgnvd6", "created_utc": 1583884993.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "Well my Disney puts hope you are wrong.", "score": 184, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah fuck what Disney did in the last hour today", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Seriously.

For example, lots of money to be made betting a small portfolio percentage on calls on parabolic stocks, or straddles on small biotechs (prior to big trial results).

And for the most part they do have some merit. Insta/FB is without a doubt the regning king of social media and Fuckerberg has the entire world licking on his giant social media nutsack as he ejaculates everyone's personal data into the mouths of advertisers everywhere. \n\nNow, let's pretend we have more than 3 brain cells for a minute here and try to think critically about what SNAP has to offer, both upside-wise and downside-wise\n\n\n**Q4 2019 earnings**\n\nA little over a month ago, SNAP announced their ER. The market was anticipating an earnings and revenue beat on that ER, finally declaring snap to be profitable after all this time. People were buying into it like crazy as we approached the ER and analysts kept raising their price targets over and over and over. \n\nEnter ER day. SNAP announces they actually managed to post positive record profits in EPS (more than tripling what the analysts were estimating). Amazing, this is what the market was waiting for! SNAP to the moon, right? FUCKIN NOPE. They also announced that they missed on revenue estimates by a roaring 0.2%. \n\n*0.2%*\n\n**0.2%**\n\nDoesn't sound so bad right? \n\nWell the market had other ideas and the stock dropped down almost 20% over the course of the following day. \n\nSurely this is an overreaction and its bound to recover right? Again, fucking NOPE. It's literally been in freefall all the way through to today as the market was force-fed spoonfuls of bad news in quick succession. It is still yet to recover any sort of steam as I write this on 3/11/2020 (SNAP closed today at 10.80, down 9.84% on the day and down 44% from its 52 week high of 19.25 on 01/23/2020 right before the ER)\n\nFirst of all, let's address the 2 elephants in the room currently sticking their dicks in the market and what their impact would be on SNAP specifically:\n\n1. Oil price war\n\nAlthough Saudi crashing oil prices globally has a fairly huge negative effect on the market as a whole, if we analyze individual impact, this literally shouldn't affect SNAP in any way, shape or form. The entire world's supply of oil could run out today and SNAP as a company would remain totally unaffected. \n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nNow this is where things get interesting for SNAP. The assumption people are making is that everything will be affected negatively by this virus, SNAP included. And for the vast majority of stocks, they would likely be right. Coronavirus is causing a huge supply shock, manufacturing delays, prohibiting people from going to work/school and all in all just causing a huge global economic slowdown. Not to mention its taking out the boomers who currently own the biggest % of the market and may easily decide to liquidate if they feel their life/money is threatened.\n\n*However*, let's take a closer look at how this affects SNAP on its own, shall we? \n\n\n\nIs SNAP negatively impacted by the manufacturing slowdown or the supply shock that's hitting everything right now?\n\nNope, they don't manufacture shit and couldn't care less about supplies or imports/exports from any country\n\n\n\nIs SNAP negatively impacted by the fact that people can't go to work/school for a few weeks and have to chill at home?\n\nNope, as a matter of fact, similarly to Netflix, they actually make more money when people don't have shit to do and are sitting at home scrolling through their phones or texting friends. You wanna know what else? 90% of kids in middle school/high school in the US currently use SNAP and most of them consider it their primary method of getting in contact with friends. Now, guess who's schools are about to get canceled and won't be allowed to go see their friends face to face for a while? Yep, you guessed it. SNAP's whole fucking userbase almost. Very soon a shitton of kids will have to stay at home instead of going to school or going out with friends, and they will resort to their main method of talking to their friends while that happens: SNAP.\n\nOkay, so it's basically gonna be like Netflix where people use it a lot more just cause they're stuck at home right? So they should behave similarly through this whole thing?\n\nNo motherfucker, that's the best fucking part. We're diving headfirst into a recession right now. What do people do in a recession? They save money by cutting out services they pay for but don't necessarily need (i.e. Netflix). Well, guess what service finally figured out how to make money without the users paying anything? That's right, asshole. Mother fucking SNAPCHAT. That's makes it an even more reliable hold than NFLX right now despite what the market is pricing in\n\nThe sentiment around SNAP right now is oddly similar to how Tesla was being treated a little over a year ago when people were overselling it, shitting on it, and claiming it'll never post profit and will go bankrupt. That changes this year just like Tesla changed last year. Don't miss out on this opportunity to buy in while the getting is good or you may end up begrudgingly buying it at $25/share like some of you assholes who bought Tesla at 700. \n\nIf you want additional DD and a more detailed look at their numbers lately, check this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbzix6/bought_snap_stock_friday_1379\n\n/u/donnieisWiafu2 goes into what makes this such a solid buy in very good detail \n\nPS: for the most part this all applies applies to FB as well, but if we're talking about value investing, the value/price ratio I'm seeing in SNAP is much higher than that of FB atm. FB is currently almost 30x as big as SNAP marketcap-wise\n\n\nTL;DR:- Long SNAP - Middle/high school/college kids all about to have their schools canceled and won't be able to interact with each other for a while except through social media mainly. Vast majority of these kids are addicted to SNAP and will cause it to post record profits and revenue next Q without a doubt (they already practically did last Q). This will cause SNAP to soar. Get in while it's being pummeled right now by an irrational market.\n\n\nEDIT: OK noted, you cocksuckers only understand strike price and expirey. Buy LEAP calls for Jan 2021/2022 if you hate buying stocks or maybe like 12-14c that expire a couple months from now so it includes their next earnings report. I would highly recommend picking up a bunch of shares and holding for a couple years tho. You'll thank yourself and me later.\n\nEDIT (4/21/2020): SNAP just announced their earnings and beat on revenue, jumping 20% after hours and closing at 14.99. Hope some of you guys actually listened to me and profited from this unlike most retards in this thread\n\nEDIT (7/7/2020): After a huge 8% move up today SNAP is currently trading at 25.10. Sentiment around it seems to finally be turning bullish among analysts, media and WSB alike as anticipated. In fact, we might be too bullish in the short term now if I'm being honest. Earnings in 10 days will likely decide if the stock will break ATH and go crazy or consolidate back down. Hope this post convinced someone to pick up shares/leaps back then, should have profited handsomely over the last few months\n\nEDIT (10/21/2020): SNAP just reported their earnings again yesterday after disappointing a bit last quarter and absolutely crushed it this time around. They grew across all metrics and actually managed to post a profit for the quarter. The stock surged over the course of the next day and closed at 36.5 up 30% from the previous day. Sentiment around the stock has never been this positive so it doesn't seem like the run will stop here either - it is now way past its IPO/ATH share price. If they can maintain this growth/profitability for the next few Qs this stock will be an incredible long term hold. We'll see if they eventually shoot themselves in the foot or get screwed by some external market forces, but as of right now, this company is doing things right and can finally say it earned its IPO valuation.\n\n\nEDIT (12/07/2020): SNAP closed today at 49.5 after running up almost 10% over the last week (3% today). I'm honestly glad I started doing these edits cause it's pretty crazy coming back to this post every couple of months and seeing how different my sentiment and the stock price is from the previous edit/original post. Tbh I'm not expecting snap to stay over 50 for long if at all. I'm honestly starting to think the hot streak it's been on cools down from here and it trades in a range for a few months until they announce some new good news. Matter of fact, the whole market is kind of retarded right now and I'm not sure how sustainable this bull run really is. To be fair though, I feel like I've been thinking that for almost 2 years now and it's still running hot (except for the shortest bear market in history in March I guess).

Non integrated (not XOM or CVX) can't roll their debt over because no one in their right mind is going to lend to them.

No cash flow = can't service debt, plus the new problem of not being able to roll over debt.\n\nYou can give a bank money and persuade them to lend, but as we have seen from TARP, you can't make them because no bank is willing to take on more credit risk with a recession on the horizon.\n\nCredit spreads all the way to BBB have exploded these last two days, much more than during the coronavirus declines the weeks prior.

{"title": "Summary of why the world and markets are fucked", "selftext": "So seven months ago /u/cbus20122 posted this brilliant summary of why there is so much systemic risk in the global economy. Now I\u2019m going to repost it here to prevent you guys from losing money and buying calls.\n\nRemember this is a post from seven months ago, read it and buy your fucking puts, we\u2019re going down. \n\n*This time around it seems like geo-political issues will be to blame. Isn\u2019t this all very much preventable?\n\nThat\u2019s the problem. Everyone is thinking this is just trade warz. It\u2019s not. Trade issues don\u2019t help, and they may have tipped things in the opposite direction, but they are not the primary thing causing these problems.\nBut just to inform you...\n\n\u2022 The eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2011/2012 was never solved. We just got negative interest rates and lots of liquidity injections by the ECB over the past 5 years which kicked the can down the road. Now they\u2019re running out of ammo with almost the entire European bond market yielding negative... which is batshit insane.\n\n\u2022 China\u2019s credit bubble has expanded every year, while their GDP growth has been slowing down. I won\u2019t go far into detail here since it can become its own large thread in itself, but China\u2019s financial problems by themselves could send the world into a major depression in my opinion. I know that\u2019s an extreme comment, I know I\u2019m putting my neck out on a limb saying that, but I don\u2019t see any other way around it if shit hits the fan there. China is directly affected by the trade war issues, but they were seeing financial strain before trade war issues ratcheted up the pressure.\n\n\u2022 Brexit is still a thing, and the \u201cworst case\u201d no deal solutions that was once an afterthought is now becoming accepted as the most likely scenario.\n\n\u2022 US assets are generally very expensive, with software and growth stocks doing their best to mimic dotcom era valuations. Meanwhile, a lot of hot money escaping Europe and Asia\u2019s problems has flowed into the USA, which likely has played a big role in fueling these extraordinary valuations. Even \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been rather expensive. Multiples have compressed some ever since the height of the 2018 blowoff top, but this is largely just a product of money sloshing into fixed \nincome and safe havens more than anything else.\n\n\u2022 This same flow issue is providing an extraordinary bid for anything providing yield, as foreign pension funds , insurance companies, and banks are starved for yielding assets considering they can\u2019t purchase their own sovereign bonds for positive yield. This has forced foreign financial institutions way out the risk curve, and even with that in mind, they\u2019re still not getting much back in terms of yield. Japanese, Taiwanese, and other foreign institutions are at severe risk if and when credit gets downgraded, or when currency starts to move against them  (which it likely has already started). I can\u2019t state how much of a risk this is systematically.\n\n\u2022 Sure, something like CLO\u2019s by themselves aren\u2019t an enormous issue, but when you realize that CLO\u2019s are just one subset of the \u201canything producing yield\u201d bubble (junk bonds, investment grade debt, em sovereign debt, etc), you start to see the bigger picture. The bond market blowup of Argentina recently is a good example of the risk some institutions may take pushing way out the risk curve in search for a small bit of extra yield. \nThankfully, this wasn\u2019t anything major and it\u2019s not where most money is being placed, but it\u2019s a small example of what can happen here.\n\n\u2022 There is over 12 trillion dollars in emerging market debt denominated in USD, and the dollar just keeps rising. The more we see financial issues in Europe, Asia, etc, the more this just squeezes the US dollar higher, putting even more strain on the global financial system since it gets even more difficult to repay these USD-denominated debts. This is especially negative for all EM countries, and I\u2019m not really sure what the long term solution is. There have been attempts to kick the can down the road, but most of those just involved more borrowing, which just made the problem worse in the long run.\n\nSo to summarize, we have systematic risk in China, Europe, and broader Asia, and then on to of that, we have highly stretched valuations in the USA. It all goes hand in hand, but trade wars may be the hammer that breaks this stretched system apart. FWIW, there is a LOT of nuance, a lot of other issues, and there are also some positives I\u2019m not adding here since it\u2019s not the point. But the main point worth making is that people should pull their heads out of their ass and quit paying attention to all the trade war garbage. It\u2019s an issue, but it\u2019s likely more the needle than the actual problem itself.*\n\nSo in the end coronavirus started the reckoning, buy puts. I suggest on EM indexes and banks. Also will be a matter of time before tech valuations start to drill. And watch the fucking USD, the higher it goes, the bigger the world gets fucked.
