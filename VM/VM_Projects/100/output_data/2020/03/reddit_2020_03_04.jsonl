{"title": "Bearish rant", "selftext": "Not sure why there are 66% downvotes. I put serious time and though into this and trying to bring some rationality to the conversation. Someone tell me how many gigafactories you think Tesla can realistically build in the coming day.. 4 years? 4? 5? 13? The last number would be necessary to reach ARKs bull case. Is that plausible to anyone? If you include red tape, slower than Shanghai construction speed, ramping up and so on...\n\nFirst off, I want you to believe me; I am a Tesla bull in the long run, they WILL be one of the major players and I am doing everything I can to be able to buy one as soon as possible and I haven\u2019t even sat in one! I love this company but people are just blinded by so many things. \n\nPeople also talk about FSD as if that will generate billions in pure profits every quarter almost indefinitely. No. They might get a few billions in sweet profits before other manufacturers get up to speed This is software, catching up is faster. Even nvidia hardware will be enough for necessary processing in a few years (or now? More hz might not be a dealbreaker? I don\u2019t know), the fact that Tesla\u2019s is better will be a moot point in just a few years. FSD will become standard and margins will disappear, it\u2019s inevitable.\n\nAlso, most are accounting for slightly lower-than-Uber cost for taking an eventual Tesla taxi. How will that work out once you have a \u201csafe\u201d investment that prints free money? The markets will correct that with more supply and again; the margins are gone and the value of the car will depreciate below purchase price albeit at a slower rate than an ICE vehicle.\n\nAnother thing on their amazing data-lead that helps them with their FSD-algorithms: if Toyota decides to go all in they could fairly cheaply install cameras in ALL their newly produced cars along with a unit that sends the info back to their servers. In one year they would have 5x Tesla\u2019s total fleet of cars out there collecting data. I even expect major car companies would cooperate and share the data among eachother (for a price) and that advantage Tesla has is not only gone: it would be surpassed way faster than anyone seem to understand. After that their algorithms (which WILL evolve closer to parity by then) will churn through that data.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the regulatory issues with the Tesla fleet. The latest beat down might be unfair but it should warn you: these things takes time! The crash was in 2018 and you just got a statement, congressional hearings, partisanship and the Washington grind tells me 2-3 years is plausible but optimistic for a comprehensive set of laws. I am expecting them to be first and \u201cwin the race\u201d but they have chosen a path to build their own capacity. It\u2019s not like Apple in that way that could turn to Foxconn and have them starting to churn out millions of phones in \u201cno time\u201d. Sorry, that was a tangent.\n\nRegarding production capacity; Tesla has announced 5-7b in capex spending over two years which is awesome (2,5-3,5 annually). Giga Berlin is expected to cost $4,4b and produce 500k/year with possible extension to 750 according to some flaky waterpermit. That however requires further capex. Shanghai is estimated at around $3b. Those two combined will produce about a million cars by 2023. Add two more and you are likely around 2,5 (with Fremont included. That would put them 700/yr below the most bearish case of ARK invests lowest estimate by 2024. And that is during a phase of what Elon said \u201cwe can\u2019t spend money fast enough\u201d. Ark is talking about 7m/year in their bull case... the demand might be there but even that is unlikely with the premium price point. Either way, production capacity can\u2019t physically expand that much unless they introduce a plan tomorrow to build 12 gigafactories in the coming three years (...2,5 if you account for time to ramp up production). So no, those who think it\u2019s \u201cjust about ramping up\u201d don\u2019t understand the process. Even red tape would make that impossible. \n\nAdd to that the need to expand battery capacity for all those cars, semis, grid storage, power walls, solapanels... they have way more potential than they can meet and others will push to compete way more than they have. Tesla\u2019s bottlenecks will buy the competition the time to catch up and become good enough to retain most of their market share.\n\nI do think that their upcoming battery tech will yet again put them years ahead of the competition and they won\u2019t be able to meet demand. They are amazing and their tech is second to none. But the competition is coming (I know, you laugh but it\u2019s still true. They are getting their asses kicked and their shareholders will force them to change. They probably all ready are)\n\nSo chill down, Tesla is the best and will remain so but be realistic.\n\nSorry for the long rant...", "id": "fdg1rb", "created_utc": 1583341533.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "I agree with you about remaining realistic I think that's a good point.\n\nI am bearish on robotaxis for sure and I agree about regulatory hurdles.\n\nHowever I think \"competition is coming\" is overplayed a lot.

There's room for 10 or 20 competing systems in a market like that. \n\nMoreover you say that Toyota can just put sensors on their cars. The min cost for that would be $1k per vehicle with the computer and the cell connection and the servers to receive the data. So that would be a $10bn per year program, not exactly cheap or easy.\n\nSecondly re ramping you're assuming no improvement in manufacturing processes. We are about to see battery and powertrain day where they make a massive leap forwards on batteries and the ability to scale them. With less batteries needed per car and more produced this means they can loosen that bottleneck.\n\nI agree 7m vehicles in 2024 is a bit ridiculous.

By then the legacy automakers will be \u201cgood enough\u201d to start retaking market share from what is arguably a oremiun brand.\n\n10% is reasonable I think but not in five years. Some 8m cars annually would require 14+ gigafactories and their forward guidance might talk about 50% growth for years to come but that would require them to begin applying for 3-5gigafactory permits annually deoending in how fast they can ramp production. That\u2019s not in the plausible realm. Supply chain issues will start popping up as well as they will be growing so fast at the same time other brands want to do the same in the same areas (precious metals and so on). There are so many issues with scaling that fast that no one seems to consider. 50% from 300k/yr is \u201cEasyPark compared to the next 50%. \n\nAt the same time I want to acknowledge the insane efficacy of their factory construction. No one can do it like they can. But it\u2019s still not feasalbe even if you assume Shanghai speed for each factory (which is completely unreasonable in western nations).\n\nThe battery capacity bottle neck I assume will be completely worked out in some five years and I assume they will keep their lead there. I\u2019m focused on bottle necks related to production of the cars. And yes, new stamping techniques will pace even that up and they will keep a lead in efficacy. But it\u2019s on the margins and won\u2019t push Tesla from 300k+ in 2019 to say 3000k in 2024. Even 50% growth will only get then to less than 2m cars in 2024 and slightly above in 2025.

By year 2, the electrical architecture is already planned... that means that an announcement today that vehicles going forward will come with 8 cameras and FSD hardware for video collection wouldn't actually hit customers until 2022 at the soonest, and would mean large design changes midway though the design cycle. \n\nThe less obvious, but larger, problem, is that no legacy OEM has the in-house software expertise to be an equal partner in any self-driving data collection partnership, and therefore has strong business incentives not to make the partnership work. If VW were to partner with Waymo today, with an agreement to equip every vehicle with Waymo supplied self driving hardware and allow Waymo to collect video from all these vehicles on the road, this partnership would be an admission by VW that their long-term plan is to give up their position as an customer facing auto-maker and become a chassis/drivetrain supplier to Waymo, because once Waymo is successful and solves FSD, customers won't be buying VWs anymore, they will be riding in Waymo's fleet.

One thing people keep forgetting is that around the world cars are cheaper the in the US. For Tesla to grow significantly, they WILL have to release cheaper cars. So all of those models predicting 5-10 million cars in 2030 with average prices of 50k$ are completely unrealistic.\n2. In Europe, right now there's a huge wave of competitors in the BEV and PHEV space, with much more appealing price points, good enough range, and a good network of dealers to service and give customer support to those cars. They wil take a good chunk of the EV market share. Tesla will be pushed to a premium/luxury segment unless they change their market strategy. \n3. Tesla right now is neglecting customer support and service. It's already impacting customers, and it will keep getting worse as they sell more and more cars. For instance, the nearest service center to my house is 2 hours away, and you can't even talk to someone over to phone if you have a problem. Email take days to get a responce, if we get one at all. It actually got to the point that I canceled my Model 3 reservation because I couldn't talk to a single person without driving 2 hours to a show room.

This post isn't \"I'm a bull with some bearish concerns.\" You attempt to cast doubt on Tesla's entire business from automotive to energy storage to FSD and even solar.\n\n> I love this company but people are just blinded by so many things.\n\nYou are included in \"people,\" yes? So you could also be blinded by many things?\n\n> Someone tell me how many gigafactories you think Tesla can realistically build in the coming day\n\n...zero\n\n> 4 years?\n\n4 or 5. I count Berlin in there. I think a Texas giga is also likely. Only need two more after that. Tesla already has the free cash flow to achieve this.\n\n\"But regulatory hurdles!\" That's location-dependent. Obviously China's gigafactory was always going to be done more quickly than Germany's. And yeah there are hurdles in Germany, but Tesla is jumping them. Forest clearing is proceeding, ground will break soon.\n\nAlso, many locations *want* a gigafactory. Nevada competed to get the first one. China greased the wheels to build the Shanghai Giga super fast, and I believe Tesla was the first major company to manage to start operations in China *without* being required to partner with a local Chinese company (to allow them to steal technology).\n\n> 13? The last number would be necessary to reach ARKs bull case.\n\nYes, that's the *bull* case. The optimistic case. The case where you're supposed to be rosey. ARK said there's a 28% chance of Tesla being a \"High functioning EV company.\" It's far from guaranteed, it's just one of their many scenarios.\n\n> This is software, catching up is faster.\n\nThis is flat out false, and I don't think you understand how software (or business) works. You seem to assume leaders will stand still while competitors catch up.\n\nAsk Yahoo, MSFT, AskJeeves, DuckDuckGo, etc. how easy it is to catch up with Google search. Ask anyone how easy it is to catch up with Windows or Office. Google is massive and spending furiously on their cloud, but is not catching up with Amazon's cloud.\n\nI see this too often in financial discussions. People say, \"X is 5 years behind Y,\" and then extrapolate and assume that in 5 years, X and Y will have reached parity. That's generally not what happens.\n\n>  I even expect major car companies would cooperate and share the data among eachother (for a price)\n\n\"cooperating for a price\" is what we call a \"business transaction.\" If you have to buy data while Tesla has customers *paying them* to collect data for them... you likely won't catch up while losing money at the same time.\n\nEven assuming this happens, you're tacitly admitting Tesla is ahead and competitors will have to put in extra effort to catch up.\n\n> And don\u2019t get me started on the regulatory issues with the Tesla fleet\n\nWell please, don't, if you're going to talk about regulatory issues applying to Tesla only and imply they won't apply to the whole industry. This is a headwind they all face.\n\n> Regarding production capacity\n\nWell you're definitely a Bear here. Your assumptions are: Tesla will never get better at building gigafactories (so the cost will never go down) and Gigafactories will never increase in efficiency/productivity (you assume 500k cars/year and 50 gWh is the cap).\n\n>  And that is during a phase of what Elon said \u201cwe can\u2019t spend money fast enough\u201d.\n\nWhen did he say that? In the 19Q4 earnings call he said they're spending just as much as they want to right now, and that they could be spending more, but are being judicious with their money and only spending it where it'll get the biggest ROI.\n\n> Add to that the need to expand battery capacity for all those cars, semis, grid storage, power walls, solapanels\n\nAgain, ignoring the possibility that Tesla will only get better at this. Gigafactories can produce 50 gWh/year already. With Tesla's improvements in batteries coming (to be announced on Battery Day), each gigafactory could produce even more than that. So Tesla may not need as many gigafactories as you think to meet the terawatt hours of energy production that Elon said they need to hit.\n\nYou can be skeptical of the plan, that's reasonable, but Elon says they very much have a plan for achieving multiple terawatt hours per year. Tesla knows how critical this is.\n\n> But the competition is coming (I know, you laugh but it\u2019s still true.\n\nI laugh because it's NOT true. Back up your statement.\n\nIt's 2020 and Tesla has no real competition, period. GM and VW won't even begin to compete until 2021 at the earliest. If they slip at all, push that back even further. Everyone else isn't taking EVs remotely seriously enough. GM's EV day was sad. They admitted they're five years behind, at least, and also said they're not going to spend anywhere near enough to catch up.\n\nYou say shareholders will demand that these companies transition to EV. What makes you say that? Isn't it possible they'll instead say, \"These companies aren't doing it, and probably can't do it. I'm going to sell my position entirely and move it into Tesla.\" Or another possibility, they'll have their blinders on, as you state in the beginning, and ride these sinking ships to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nI'm genuinely curious on this one. Who do you see as major competitors? What vehicles, specifically? When do you expect these vehicles to hit the market? When will they achieve volume?\n\nYou scoff at the idea of Tesla building more gigafactories. What do you think about GM's plan to invest in ONE battery factory to come online sometime in the next six years?\n\nAgain, unless you somehow believe Tesla is going to stand still in the next five years, the odds of anyone catching up are very low.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "tsla", "msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Yeah you\u2019re completely missing the point", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "How?

I don't doubt that some day there won't be a competitor on the robotaxi sector, but an important thing to keep in mind is, that money alone isn't going to help the competition catch up. They also need to be able to access the best talent the global markets have to offer. Also I don't think Tesla's advancement will just slow down as the competition starts to catch up. Their tech will most likely stay the most reliable and advanced, even after there are other agents who have reached full autonomy.\n\nTesla has also strategic advantages in many ways, that can be difficult for competitors to achieve. For example their network of superchargers, no advertising costs (more money goes to improve the products themselves), cult-like following similar to Apple, and a rock star CEO. Their involvement in home energy storage, and insurance are also things that make Tesla a go to option compared to rivals.\n\nUnless something very drastic happens to Tesla, I don't see them being anything but the number one agent in what they do.

Maybe \u201ca list of some ways I disagree with the most optimistic Tesla forecasts?\n\nI partly or completely agree with some of your points, and disagree with others. For example, I think you did a pretty good job of taking a snapshot of how Tesla has performed recently and extrapolating it into the future, but I don\u2019t think that is what Elon is planning. You seem to assume a certain number of vehicles per year per gigafactory (in the sense that it will take this many gigafactories to produce this many cars). But remember that Elon dreamed of an \u201calien dreadnought\u201d factory where the machines work so fast that all a human would see is a blur unless they use a strobe light to freeze the motion. Elon supposedly gave up on that and said humans were needed to do much of the work \u2013 but since then they\u2019ve gradually increased the automation, reassigning the humans to new tasks. I expect the main thing limiting Tesla\u2019s ability to build factories is not the ability to borrow money and put up buildings, but the reluctance to build new factories that are still far from what they want the factories to be. At first (and Elon mentioned this ~2018), the greatest gain could be obtained by working to optimize the Fremont and Nevada factories. Tesla is still working to optimize the factories and increase production per factory, but more recently the tremendous benefits to be gained by putting a factory in Asia and one in Europe (in terms of tariffs and other trade issues and transportation logistics) became the dominating factor, and Tesla has built the factory in Shanghai and started the one near Berlin. But note that these so far have not involved public plans for further sites in Asia and Europe, but instead continued expansion and improvement of the Shanghai and Berlin factories. It\u2019s only very recently that Elon has hinted of building another gigafactory in the US (Texas). This may be a hint that the maturity of the factory design is sufficiently advanced that Tesla is now more comfortable with the idea of building more factories for something other than transportation or trade incentives. If this is true, then they could start building new factories far faster than they have been, possibly financed largely by local loans (like the Shanghai factory).\n\n> red tape, slower than Shanghai construction speed\n\nMany locations have been anxious to host a Tesla factory, not just for the direct economic benefit (e.g. jobs, tax revenue), but also for the prestige and the prospect of attracting other companies. And in their site search in Europe, Tesla made it clear that minimizing time to start and completion of construction were major selection factors. That doesn\u2019t make red tape go away, but it makes local officials eager to facilitate the process in every way they reasonably can. And having started with Shanghai sets an example for construction speed that others will strive to meet as a matter of pride.\n\n> People also talk about FSD as if that will generate billions in pure profits every quarter almost indefinitely. No.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to think that eventual competition will come from other Tesla owners more than from competing companies. Either rates will go down, or only a limited number of people will be able to participate in the Tesla Network. There will also be large low population density areas where individual ownership makes more sense than Tesla-owned robotaxis.\n\n> Even nvidia hardware will be enough for necessary processing in a few years\n\nComparable processing power is already available. But Tesla\u2019s costs much less and uses much less electric power. And Tesla is working on another generation beyond hardware 3 so they will continue to lead.\n\n> Another thing on their amazing data-lead that helps them with their FSD-algorithms: if Toyota decides to go all in they could fairly cheaply install cameras in ALL their newly produced cars \u2026 In one year they would have 5x Tesla\u2019s total fleet of cars out there collecting data... After that their algorithms (which WILL evolve closer to parity by then) will churn through that data.\n\nI think you enormously underestimate the work involved to usefully process that data and to convert it into teaching material to train the neural net. Much of what Tesla collects is selected by the onboard computer to meet certain criteria to train for given \u201ccorner cases\u201d, and recording of incidents where the self-driving system chose one course of action and the driver overrode (or differences between driver actions and what the system would have done when in shadow mode). Tesla is also implementing steps to greatly increase the speed of creating training material. The Tesla team has worked for years on their approach, and continues to work hard \u2013 they are likely to maintain their lead.\n\nA major difference between Tesla and taxi systems like Uber and Waymo: Tesla can make money during the development process as drivers enjoy the increasingly useful FSD features in their vehicles and more people pay for FSD, while the other companies have to wait until their systems are essentially completed before realizing significant revenue. In the Q4 2019 earnings call, Elon said it would make sense to start up the Tesla Network even before level 5 \u2013 Tesla owners can provide rides while lightly supervising their level 4 autonomous vehicles.\n\n> And don\u2019t get me started on the regulatory issues with the Tesla fleet.\n\nGovernment agencies have in general been very supportive of the development of autonomous driving systems, because they know that in the long run that will save many lives, and they are not insisting on perfection before such vehicles are allowed to operate. Some states are considerably more supportive of FSD than others, and if it works well in those states then other states will be encouraged to allow it too.\n\n> \u2026Elon said \u201cwe can\u2019t spend money fast enough\u201d\n\nAgain, Tesla still has great opportunity for improvement in speed and cost of production in their factories. And once they have the factory design dialed in to their satisfaction, I expect that we will be astonished at how much faster they can raise funds / borrow / build. Elon said Tesla would like to get to 20 million vehicles per year.\n\nElon has emphasized that speed of innovation is by far the best moat. Elon and his great team have been working for years innovating as fast as they can, and have a huge lead, as shown by the recent stumbles of so many \u201cTesla killers\u201d. And unlike the expectations of so many people who say it\u2019s just a matter of competitors catching up, Tesla\u2019s goal is to continue to accelerate, to continue to increase their lead.\n\nNote that I do not endorse a specific timeline for development of FSD good enough to support robot taxis. Some of the greatest challenges for level 5 autonomy involve \u201cnegotiated\u201d interactions between the autonomous vehicle and people or other vehicles, as discussed in the recent Tesla Daily interview of Pierre Ferragu \u2013 for example being pulled over by a police officer, or one vehicle signaling that it is yielding right of way to another vehicle. I expect that Tesla will have really nice non-geofenced level 4 ahead of its competitors, and both Tesla and the drivers will benefit from greater safety and more pleasant driving. Even when level 5 is achieved, it will not be a binary value \u2013 continued improvement will continue to make the vehicles safer and more pleasant to ride in, and Tesla\u2019s rapid pace of development will continue to provide an advantage to Tesla.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "> Tesla is the best and will remain so but be realistic.\n\nTesla is the best what?\n\nI think it it useful in investing discussions to separate out the product from the company.

{"title": "Impact of the Coronavirus (COVID19). Be Safe, life is more important than money.", "selftext": "I had been doing lots of research since early January about this epidemic and thought I should share some findings. Firstly, I always believe that when a government tries to cover up something, it usually mean the situation is way worse than we can imagine. If it is only a little horrible, the government can say, \u201cIt is very bad but we can still fix it, that\u2019s why we are telling you the truth.\u201d. But if the government tries to cover up, it usually means the truth is beyond horrible and there is no way for them to be transparent about it. And that is usually when I am really worried.\n\nHere are some facts from the more transparent countries. For those who don\u2019t know, the following charts (credits to Braydo25) shows exponential growth in the number of infected people. For people who don\u2019t understand the power of exponential growth, if you have a dollar on the first day, and it doubles each day, you would have more money than the entire world combined in less than 2 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3bczy8qflk41.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=11a6ee6c63cc869a3459e52b013c245b297c8f3d\n \nAnd this is the number of critical patients whom will need ventilators to help them breath when the virus took over their lungs. Combine this with the exponential growth of the infected, one can\u2019t help but come to the conclusion that the healthcare system is going to be overwhelmed by the number of patients coming in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdi18nzpglk41.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=0131cb562001baaf2b3aa5fd551f33c119e652d5\n \nIf it is growing exponentially, then why is China and Iran telling the entire world that everything is good and dandy? And this is the part where government cover up is in play. Do you remember the few whistleblowers of the coronavirus situation? 2 of the doctors are dead and 2 of the journalists whistleblowers had been arrested and never heard from again.\n\nSource: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\n\nSource: https://nypost.com/2020/03/03/chinese-doctor-who-worked-with-late-whistleblower-dead-from-coronavirus/\n\nSource: https://qz.com/1801361/wuhan-virus-citizen-journalists-fang-bin-chen-qiushi-go-missing/\n\nIran is another country trying to play down the numbers. If one is willing to look for it, there are videos of mass graves being dig in Iran right now (Source: https://en.radiofarda.com/a/lawmaker-in-iran-dismisses-official-coronavirus-death-toll/30460224.html ). In fact, 8% of Iran's parliament has tested positive for coronavirus. Source: https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/h_13306122baecfcaa123a7ca59478d0d6\n\nWhat is the percentage of parliament people to the total population of Iran? That may give you a clue as to the actual cases in the country so if you see Iran only reporting 2000 cases in a country of 81 million people, take it with a grain of salt. If Iran only reported 20 people dying from the coronavirus but they are digging mass graves for the bodies, then it is really suspicious\n.\nLike I said, if the government is trying to cover up, it simply means the truth is beyond your imagination and they are not able to be transparent about it.\n\nTLDR: The world is not only going into a recession, but the healthcare system may be overwhelmed during this epidemic. Governments are trying to coverup because the situation is so much worse than you can imagine.
