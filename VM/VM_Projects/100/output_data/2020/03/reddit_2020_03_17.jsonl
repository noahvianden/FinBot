Musk slipped out of his legal problems somehow, car production rose (most importantly without stories of him being a maniac to staff and building cars in tents).  A factory in China went from fantasy to plausible.  As the stock inched upward, their ability to fix their debt phantom started to fade.  Then some good ER showed profitability might be attainable sooner than later.  Production kept rising, along with the stock.  The big cap really silenced the debt problem.  Good news can be a self-fulfilling spiral, and indeed it was.  When you're hot, nothing can derail you.  Bad demo of truck windows?  Doesn't matter.  \n\nWith a lot of things, we judge their potential based on what figments of evidence we've seen.  When you see your child get their first A in school, it makes you realize they can get A's in the future.  Until then, you don't know.\n\nSo anyway, I feel the old support levels are representative of the \"old\" Tesla and might not reflect a potential that we've now had a glimpse of.\n\nI still wish grown ups would take over the company and board, and bring on un-famous professionals to run things, make Musk the pitchman only with zero access to people or power.

It was my first time trading in almost 6 months and had good gains. Currently holding $5k and converted everything to SPDR Gold Trust. Hopefully, I can make another good trade this week, I think I was lucky this time though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: People were asking about my trade history. Here's my trade history for today, in ascending order (new to old).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chtoxfhgfbn41.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4adbb678f7daf8a334074a65b78a1a1a135d5aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuw6v9tgfbn41.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1502341ce8cba575615e7842bc2e26a9a55c93f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c8zyb6hfbn41.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=9414918dda254ffcef0c01ada310e355e5c6a61b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/556b43wtgbn41.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=8907dc05f861d5bbc0deeb9a60c4e6ea65395105\n\nEDIT #2: Most of my gains came from early morning at 9:40 AM weekly calls @ sold it exactly at 12 PM. I converted all my positions to 2-weeks puts, thinking it was up way too much for the day (as you can see on my trading history). I just went with gut feelings, no technical analysis.

In a cash acct, you can trade as many times as you want in a day...as long as you don\u2019t exceed your cash balance. I.e. if you a 10k acct, you could do 10 trades of $1k each, 2 trades of $5k each etc. As long as you don\u2019t exceed your 10k balance (which by the way, TD won\u2019t let you do regardless. Other brokers will let you trade with unsettled funds..TD won\u2019t).\n\nSo, if you trade directional options, cash accts work really well.... T+1 settlement. You can trade that 10k acct (split into however many trades as you want) today & the money is available for you to do all over again the next day.\n\nWith commons, you have T+2 settlement.
