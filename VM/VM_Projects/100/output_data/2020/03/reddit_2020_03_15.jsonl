{"title": "This is how you know if a stock is a buy", "selftext": "A lot of people buy stocks because it feels right and they think the company will be around for a while.\n\nWhen you buy a stock you\u2019re buying into the company therefore you want to look at several factors rather than just go with your gut, if you don\u2019t look at the following factors then you\u2019re better off buying mutual funds or index funds such as VOO and QQQ.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed:\n\n1. Pull up the balance sheet for the last quarter, the last year and the last 5 years. Look at 2 categories, assets (money/money making investments)and liabilities (debt/long term expenses)\n\nThe total assets should be 2x or more of the total liabilities. The short term assets should also be about 1.5-2x the short term liabilities. If the balance sheet looks good move onto #2, if not move onto the next company.\n\nTHIS ALONE CUTS HALF THE STOCKS MOST PEOPLE \u201cFEEL LIKE ARE A GOOD BUY\u201d\n\n2) Ok so you found a company with a good balance sheet, great! Now let\u2019s look at the historical earnings, look at these for the past 10 years. Are the quarterly earnings growing steadily like you want them to be? Or are there huge peaks and valleys showing a more volatile company? Are they trending downwards showing the company is losing money consistently? Or are they flat/slowly growing showing a steady but boring company?\n\nIf the historical quarterly earnings over 10 years are steadily growing, that\u2019s what you want. So move onto 3)...\n\n3) now let\u2019s look at the EPS, this is how much you\u2019re paying for the earnings you receive. Lower is generally better, anything over 20PE is considered high. Look at Ford to see an extremely high PE showing an extremely overvalued company, even at $5 a share!\n\n4) Does the company pay a dividend? This means the company pays you money, typically quarterly, to hold their stock. Not always necessary because a lot of high growth tech stocks don\u2019t but you make a ton due to natural growth, but a dividend is nice.\n\nThis will get you started. If you don\u2019t do this for every stock you want to buy then you\u2019re just buying stocks based on emotion and what you \u201cthink\u201d looks good on a chart, and you will lose money more often than not.\n\nEDIT: I feel the need to say this is NOT a one size fits all, this is just a good way to find out the value of a company. \n\nAmazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Tesla, etc. do not follow this formula, but this can tell you how to price companies like airlines.", "id": "fj6f6y", "created_utc": 1584298689.0, "score": 480, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Excellent advice on how to get started the right way.

Q2 is April, May, and June. There is zero chance that the US shutters factories for Spring and warm summer months. What I'm seeing as a bad scenario is more like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla spends the rest of Q1 building even more inventory, especially of the 3. The Y continues to sell out, of course.\n* Possibly the Fremont plant closes at the end of Q2, still with higher overall worldwide production than in Q4 (its already pretty close).\n* NV does not shut down as cases haven't been growing there to the same degree and the plant is more isolated. Battery inventory builds rapidly.\n* Inventory drops to near-zero (possibly zero)\n* The Fremont plant resumes in early June with pent up demand for the S & X allowing for a full 3 shifts of production.\n* Model 3 lines will have been improved with minor tweaks from the Y production and will resume at maximum levels.\n* The Y ramp will continue.\n\nIn this scenario, Q2 would likely see \\~100k units. This is bad, but not dire. Q3 and Q4 will resume a climb as the Y ramp continues and China hits 5k/week, yielding \\~100k units in the second half of the year alone.\n\nMy worst case scenarios now all center around the potential for people to carry a LOT of fear through the summer as to what will happen when this thing returns in October/November.
