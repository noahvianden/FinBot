Currently holding SPY 245p 3/23, GILD 81c 3/27, SPY 285c 3/30, BA 140p 4/24, BA 145p 5/25. Bought the BA puts yesterday at open so they are doing pretty decently.\n\nAs we all are currently observing, the bearish sentiment is the highest it has ever been. We know too well what the fuck happens when this phenomenon takes place. One-way sentiment is even stronger than during the \u2018stonks only go up\u2019 dynasty.

Millennial fucks (I am one) lack the foresight to understand that, sure, this virus will just get them a bit sick and they will be ok, but it might kill their parents, their friend\u2019s parents, grandparents, etc. \n\nIn closing (that last paragraph kind of got away from me, I\u2019m sorry), when a reversal does happen - and it will happen, completely unexpectedly at that, it will wipe out beargang as we know it.

Go easy on me. Two major components of extrinsic value on LEAP options (***long-term equity anticipation***) are:\n\n* **Time value** \\-- most of the value baked into a LEAP price\n* **Implied volatility risk premium** \\-- some of the value baked into a LEAP price\n\nThe reason short expiration options make great yolo day trading instruments is because there is minimal time value left, and you can get the brief types of exposures you want without utilizing buying power for time value. AKA you can leverage the fuck up. Here is a simplified example:\n\n* Jan 2021 Call: $10.00 per option, 0.50 Delta, 90% time value, 10% risk premium value\n* April 2020 Call: $5.00 per option, 0.50 Delta, 20% time value, 80% risk premium value\n* If you only plan on being in the trade for a day or two, you can get a lot more bang for your buck at buying 0.50 Delta for $5.00 instead of 0.50 Delta for $10.00\n* Again, hyper simplification, but this is the general idea\n\nLEAP Options tend to have a very flat volatility smile compared to front months, and they are very insensitive to changes in implied volatility compared to front months. I think this variance in sensitivity would be categorized as one of the Shadow Greeks (aka a Greek which can have a major impact on price, but can only be observed, not directly calculated. I have a textbook on this if anyone is interested).\n\nFor example, I was trading $SPCE calls when the stock was going fucking ballistic. I had LEAPs because I was planning on seeing the stock mooning over the year and I wanted to exercise. But as I watched the implied volatility smiles move day to day, I noticed the front months would get super exaggerated. I graphically illustrated what I saw in this link below, and it shows you how a stock can behave and why you might witness the phenomenon that I described earlier and be scratching your head instead of understanding why it happened.\n\nIf anyone wants to monitor this stuff more easily in real time, at least in IBKR, open up the *volatility lab* and type in a ticker.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/2SMGJjA.png](https://i.imgur.com/2SMGJjA.png)\n\n\\*EDIT: It makes it easier when you think of an option has having 3 different values:\n\n* intrinsic value (diff between your strike and the underlying)\n* time value (how long until the thing expires)\n* risk premium (the lottery component)\n* As time goes on and you move closer to expiration, the ratio of time value to risk premium should 'invert'", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Solid advice, thanks dad", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04556911438703537}, {"body": "This post doesn\u2019t belong here.

So actually a calendar spread benefits only from time decay, and does not increase in value when volatility goes down.  \n\nThe original volatility harvesting strategy was selling covered calls. Since the price of the stock you own is not impacted by time or IV, when you sell calls against it, you get both the time and volatility premium. But that costs a lot of capital. So people replaced the stock with a long call option. \n\nTo harvest volatility in this manner requires messing with the strikes. Vega is highest for options that are ATM. You need to buy your long option deep enough ITM and sell your short option close enough to ATM to have a negative vega on the whole trade. Then you will be short volatility in the underlying asset.

Still, short-term VIX ETPs like VXX generally make better tools for tactical exposure to the VIX than midterm products (short-term means 1-month average term VIX futures). They tend to have a better statistical correlation to the VIX, but also lose more money from contango in their futures positions.
