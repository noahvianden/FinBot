Simplified: IV is a percentage value that explains how volatile the market believes your stock is. If I have an IV of 60% on a stock trading @ $10 dollars that essentially means that there's a 68% chance (one standard distribution, e.g. bell curve) the stock will swing up **OR** down by 60%. IV is directionless. It also plays a part in how the option is priced (extrinsic value/vega). \n\nSo yes, today, while my 240c made me good money my 225p got slaughtered. I still have 3 weeks on that put though. When, the market swings the other direction (IV on SPY is 60%), I will make money on that put. If it does not, and that put instead expires, I've priced out and bought accordingly so that I swallow the cost of the put with the gains from my call such is the point of a strangle.
