Assuming best case scenario.....", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "First, I hate when people round to a single decimal place when the number is that small. 0.1% can be anything from 0.05% to 0.1499...%. At 0.05%, if it gets rounded up to 0.1%, it's getting doubled. At 0.1499%, if it gets rounded down to 0.1%, its lower by one third. If it was 0.85% being rounded to 0.9% or 0.9499% being rounded to 0.9%, its not as big of a deal. But at 0.1%, the scale can be significantly larger. If you look at CDC data in the US for the last decade, the mortality rate is ~0.13-0.14%, which is what is being rounded down.\n\nSecond, most epidemiologists agree that the mortality rate is probably not as high 3-4%, because the number of confirmed cases is only capturing a fraction of the true number of infected people. They think it will end up being ~0.5-1.5% when all is said and done. America has only begun to really test in the last few days, and a lot of people with mild symptoms are still having trouble getting tested. This is artificially inflating the mortality rate figures that are being reported.\n\nSo, your initial estimate had influenza mortality rate at 0.1% and covid 19 at 2-4%, so let's use the midpoint of 3%, so your estimates had covid 19 as 30x more deadly than the flu. Using better estimates (0.13% vs 1%), it's probably around 7-8x more deadly. So, yes, it is significantly more deadly than influenza, but not as much as your estimates suggest. It is also more contagious, so overall, this is serious and should be taken seriously. But your numbers are way exaggerated.\n\nEdit: in case people are confused what I'm responding to, the person I'm responding to edited his post.
