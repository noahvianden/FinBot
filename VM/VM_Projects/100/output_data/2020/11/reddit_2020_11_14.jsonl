Right?", "selftext": "So, I\u2019m quite new to investing, but I think that I have a pretty solid-ish level of knowledge in this already. I\u2019m probably going to delete this, since this is pretty dumb, but let\u2019s get in to it...\n\nAlright. My latest post discussed about what are people\u2019s reasons why they are invested in the big-shot stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google etc. OR should I say those people who are in it for the long run, why do you think they\u2019ll grow even more? \n\nI know, that many people didn\u2019t comment on it, but I was still somewhat surprised that people weren\u2019t THAT Apple friendly. Sure, people weren\u2019t disliking Apple, but they weren\u2019t that optimistic about it, which made me a bit uncertain about it. Don\u2019t get me wrong I think Microsoft & the others (Amazon and Google) might have a bit more potential/room to grow than Apple, but they (Apple) aren\u2019t gonna dissappear, are they? \n\nBut I get it, the biggest companies change all the time etc, etc. But Apple is still like a good investment right? Have I just overreacted or some sort? My original plans where that $MSFT and $AAPL would hold a decent amount in my portfolio. That\u2019s still a good strategy, IF I diversify in other areas and I\u2019m not going to change these plans based on other people\u2019s opinions, BUT I shouldn\u2019t get too sentimental about it, which I mean by you should NEVER get attached to any stocks. If Apple starts to go south as a company then of course I\u2019ll get rid.\n\nMy point is: Apple is a good investment, which you can trust in, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThanks in advance.", "id": "ju663r", "created_utc": 1605376921.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "In 1995 (I think) my brother bought me 2 shares of apple and got the physical stocks for me as an Xmas gift. Yes a long time ago. \n\nI\u2019ve had those shares framed on my wall for all those years. I think each share was in the vicinity of 50 dollars each. Over the years the stocks have split and split again.\n\nThose 2 stocks are now 112 shares. The value of those stocks as of closing on Friday is just over 13K\n\nLong time to get there? Yes. Good return on your investment? Yes. \n\nI have another story. When I started investing for my company, I sold apple computers. I bough apple stocks. In 1997 I purchased 204 shares. Nothing much. I think I paid a few thousand for those shares. Nothing much. It wasn\u2019t worth much. \n\nWe just found copies of the certs we had deposited years ago and since sold them to help use for the business for cash flow. When I sold those shares I think it\u2019s value was about 50k. Not bad. We then calculated the value if we had held through all the stock splits, it would be valued at 1.2+/- million based on the current value. Those 204 shares would now be more than 8700 with all the stock splits. \n\nLooking at it further you\u2019d also get quarterly dividends on those as well they you can either use for dividend reinvestments or for whatever you\u2019d like. \n\nApple is a good investment but it\u2019s not immediate. You need to be willing to hold on through the downs, but if you can you pick up more in the downs and the celebrate the highs. \n\nI\u2019m 45 now and apple is still a part of my portfolio but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I\u2019d put a lot more into.

You need to not panic and you need to hold on. \n\nI bought when they were on the verge of bankruptcy. They\u2019ve held on to become the most valuable company in the world. People will tell you that it\u2019s overvalued right now. I don\u2019t buy it. They just split their stock in August when they were riding at 480 a share or so. Sure watch for the dips and buy at a lower rate, but realistically unless the shares drop 10 bucks or more, and you\u2019re investing a ton of money, that difference in price isn\u2019t going to get you more of those shares. \n\nA better way to do it is to find a broker that allows dividend reinvestments and have anything you earn quarterly put that money back into more shares, even if it\u2019s only partial shares. \n\nGood luck!", "score": 143, "replies": [{"body": "Great write up. \n\nOne thing to consider: just because Apple has outperformed, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll continue to outperform.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Apple isn\u2019t a growth stock, but it\u2019s unquestionably a blue chip at this point. \n\nAnd for a blue chip, hot damn does it print cash", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "It doesn't print cash compared to what you pay for it though.

{"title": "Buy calls", "selftext": "I suspect Citron had built up the short/put positions leading up to this week and earlier part of this week when NIO was $37-$44, and NIO continued to surgeon the past two days, to $48 and $54 at the open today with the exceptional EV growth in China as validated by XPEV and LI, Andrew Left had to release this hit job  before NIO price gets further away from his short/put strikes. The Citron's thesis is based on a sole factor that Tesla will set the price of its Model Y where it will undercut the sales of NIO EVs. I can tell you that is totally misguided, mistaken and not aligned with facts and reality. \n\nLet us look through the numbers and you can draw the conclusion: NIO EVs are currently priced between 350k - 570k RMB ($53k - $95K,  $45k - $85k with BAAS), while the EVs from XPEV, LI, BYD and Tesla Model 3 are priced $250k - $400k RMB ($38k - $61k), with Model Y going from $50k to $80k. For buyers who are price conscious, there are many options in China whereby they can easily save $16k - 30k. But the reality is people are lining up to buy NIO, paying significantly more for NIO EVs, and that should tell you the price is but one factor, and insignificant factor when it comes to choosing NIO over others. NIO has built up its own EV ecosystems inside China, starting with the best EV (design, quality, technologies), comprehensive range extension mechanisms - swappable, upgradable, fast charging and mobile charging, and life enhancing / social fabric forming NIO Houses/Spaces, along with NIO Life. The pioneering BAAS remediates the anxiety over battery and affords NIO owner base cutting edge technology and advancement in battery and others. \n\nThe proper way to look at why people choose NIO while paying more and why NIO is growing over 100% - 200% YOY is that NIO brings about a value proposition that is far and above any of its competitors, a value proposition that its competitor is unable to match unless they change their business model, and a value proposition that has been and is being recognized by more people. \n\nAndrew Left is in it all for a quick buck, and he is the one that got convicted by HK SEC for spreading false information and stock manipulation, and got his fund confiscated and himself kicked out HK market. Andrew Left, a guy with no moral or conscience, became concerned all of sudden that NIO price is too high. He got trapped as NIO price continued to zoom up after he opened his short / put positions, and the ER next Tuesday will easily lift NIO to above $70, judging from over close to 50% rise of EXPEV and LI after ER this week. Therefore he has to do something quick and dirty by releasing this hit job that really has nothing to try to get himself out of this bind. It is comforting to see NIO closes at $44.50, $3 higher over the close of last Friday. I bought more today with this kind of discount, and I hope and believe more traders  will jump in Monday and Tuesday to pick up more calls leading to the Q3 ER. We know NIO delivered 12205 EVs in Q3, and I am seeing NIO to guide fore 16500-17000 for Q4, and that will be another doubling YOY. By Wednesday, Andrew Left and Citron will all become a blip in the rise of NIO, as he should.

{"title": "$SE: Short Vol, Long Delta - The Hummingbird Spread", "selftext": "$SE, or Sea Limited, is an internet and mobile platform company. The firm engages in the provision of online gaming services. It currently has platforms like Garena (gaming platform), Shopee (e-commerce), and SeaMoney (digital currency). Furthermore, this company is based in Singapore and has seen tremendous growth throughout the year. ADR/OTC products seems to have a bit of lag (for example, look at $TSLA and $NIO relationship) behind its industry counterparties. $SE may see growth like $AMZN and other tech companies, but in Singapore.\n\n$SE is due to report earnings this Tuesday. The implied move of $SE is 15%, meaning people are expecting the stock to move from $180 to either $155 or $205. Historically, this has never happened before in an earnings. Current revenue/EPS projections do not justify such a movement, either.\n\n$SE also has the most popular game in the world right now -  Free Fire. Want to know an interesting fact about fire? Fire is bad for hummingbirds, and has destroyed many of their homes. How can we use this information to generate alpha?\n\n[\\\\\"Hummingbird Spread\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/50ucs86hp9z51.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=c54fd28443a1d627d9c2413b5e0e5469ae30ac9d)\n\nCan't see it yet?\n\nHere, the light gray area represents the movement of 1 STDEV (encompassing \\~68% of the likely move). Taking the integral of this region (which is the expected value of the trade), we end up seeing a \\~3.2% ROI.

{"title": "20 Days till everyone's money rotates back into Tesla for 5500%+ Gains?", "selftext": "Before everyone says this is a pump and dump, I'm offering two different scenarios.\n\nS&P inclusion is the one of the only things that can pull tsla's SP out of the trading pattern that it's in.  For the most part, them crushing earnings and deliveries, fsd beta, etc is just them being themselves which is what everyone expects from them.  IE: Priced in. (disclaimer, I'm about 90% tsla)\n\nWe had the run up for q2 s&p inclusion, wolf was cried.  Didn't happen.  People will say/think ah, just another time that it won't happen.  If that's what happens then we have a play for that.  If the stock actually runs up, we sell the news.\n\nIV is extremely low right now so options are cheap\n\nVolume 3 days prior will be a big indicator too for if inclusion is happening, just have to subtract the fomo volume to see if it's real index funds purchasing permanently\n\n12/4 is the magic date that's 2 weeks before inclusion\n\n1.  Get into tsla in whatever form you want.  Shares, calls dated 12/11 or later, leaps, etc.\n\n2a. Stock runs up, IV spikes, sell ALL prior to 12/4.  Take profit\n\n3a. Stock tanks on no inclusion, pile back in on the massive drop.  Do what you will after that\n\n3b. Inclusion happens but you sold everything, FOMO back in ASAP.  The run up should continue at least past the first 5 minutes of Monday.  It'll probably gap up 20-30%, doesn't matter.  Get in.  Do what you will after\n\n2b. Stock does nothing at all, IV stays flat, everything trades sideways.  Sell a portion of your tsla holdings and yolo into some deep otm calls.  If today is 12/4 and iv was exactly the same, you can get some 550c for 18 cents for one week out which is inclusive of the whole index rebalancing plus time since you buy at almost close, and have the option to sell immediately on gap up or hold for more gains trading for time decay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR\n\nBuy TSLA Calls/Shares/LEAPs\n\nSell after run up close to 12/4\n\nor\n\nIf no run up, YOLO some 12/11 550C (only 18 cents per share at current IV for 1 week out)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf IV stays perfectly low and you yolo 12/11 550C, and it goes ITM at open, 5500% gains.

Then if it plummets you buy the dip and ride the bounce for some profit. Should it get included it will rocket so you will lose out on the put but the shares and calls you got should greatly outweigh that loss - obviously you gotta close losing positions at the first second the market opens to limit losses.\n\nIf you don't own anything I'd just buy some calls around 4/12 with a 2-3w expiry.

SP should continue to go up past the first 5 minutes of Monday so you'll lose the gap up but still get gains.\n\nIf there is no run up and no IV spike, convert a couple shares or calls into a ton of deep otm weeklies.
