Yahoo finance says Toyota current market cap is $195bn with P/E ratio of 8.59, so that backs out to earnings of $22.7bn.\n\nTesla current market cap is $476bn with P/E ratio of 960, so earnings of $0.5bn.\n\nThe argument you\u2019ve presented is that to grow to an equivalent market cap by 2025 they have to go from $0.5bn to ~$20bn which is where you get 40x from. However if Tesla actually grew at that pace there is no way they would be valued on a P/E of 8.59 in 2025 because the future growth from 2025-2035 will be higher than Toyotas growth from 2020-2030. I\u2019m not sure Tesla will ever be valued on a multiple of 8.59 at any point in the next 30+ years to be honest, given the sector they operate in and the anticipated exponential growth opportunities of EV\u2019s/battery storage/driverless vehicles. This is why I say it makes sense to focus more on just absolute earnings than the P/E ratio equivalence.\n\nEven if we stick with the 40x multiple, Tesla could still achieve this level of earnings increase without needing to increase revenue by the same 40x amount if they instead can increase gross margins.
