That's why for the biggest IPOs, the public never has access to shares at the reported IPO price. Market value increases in response to the institutional purchases, before the shares hit the market. \n\nIn Ant's case, it appears the institutional buying period could last multiple days, but it began at the beginning of China's most recent trading day, which was last night in the US. Looks like share price has already increased 50 percent, meaning its market cap has busted USD$50 billion before the first share is sold on the exchanges. \n\nBTW, the shares will only be available on the Beijing and Shanghai exchanges. If American investors want exposure, there are ETFs that will hold it, but the best exposure will be to own shares of BABA.
