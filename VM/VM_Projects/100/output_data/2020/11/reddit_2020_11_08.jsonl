Here's some info on student/recent graduate positions to get your feet wet. Depending on how close you are to finishing your degree you may even find some things you can apply for now.

If the republicans don't get control, then a whole bunch of shit like tax reform can get done and fuck them out of their gainz. \n\nOn e!ection night, stonks mooned when trump was in the lead overnight, and they also mooned again when biden was in the lead. This tells us that the real concern for hedge funds wasn't the president. In fact, stonks started mooning, because the battleground senate races were going in the direction for republicans. This is the reason why stonks went up for trump being in the lead overnight, and then stonks went up even more for when biden was in the lead, because: THE PRESIDENT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER\n\nso where does this leave us. Well, we gotta look at what happens with this runoff e!ection between jon ostrich and David tendie (loughlers a cunt, so she's fucked). \n\nOstrich is currently trailing Tendie by around 100k votes, and Shane will most likely support Tendie, because he's worried about the debt (fuckin tard, we're doin WW3 before paying up) so that will put Ostrich another 100k behind.\n\nSo, we have to worry about if Ostrich can make up 200k votes. My perspective is that Ostrich can probably do this\n\nFrom looking at voter registration here:\n\nhttps://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/voter_registration_statistics\n\nwe got about 1.1 million democrats voting in age bracket 18 - 34\n\nit's known that about a 19% increase can be observed in young liberal voter demographics when they recognize shit actually matters. Democrats will be able to capture this, because they can paint the story about how everyone will get more biden bucks if they vote democrat and cuck mcconnell. So that would put Ostrich in the winning position\n\n\nTherefore, stonks are gonna crash, because that 7% boost from the hedge funds celebrating is probs gonna turn into a 14% crash from the hedge funds dumping their post-celebration shit bags onto you!\n\n\nwhat's my position?\n\n\n1) green new deal and weed stocks for the upside (e.g. ICLN, NIO, ACB, & tsla or the equivalent to tsla like SBE or hyln)\n\n2) boomer investment bank stocks for the downside (e.g. goldman sagging ballsachs)\n\ntimeline:\n\nThis next week we'll be green because biden actually got confirmed, likely spy will break above resistance by like 2% or some shit. Then it will flag around for the next month, and then it will become apparent to the hedgefunds that the SJW's will have sufficient support for Ostrich to capture the 19%, and then it will drop 3%. On this day is when we should take our positions for the 10% crash to follow, because it will likely coincide with more covid lockdown FUD\n\nGood luck", "id": "jq2901", "created_utc": 1604796707.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That kind of thing can get in trouble.

In that case you have to call it a 100k gain under QOZ deferral.
