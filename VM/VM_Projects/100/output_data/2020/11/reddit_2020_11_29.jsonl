For beginners, I recommend the Cash App for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Once you buy Bitcoin, withdraw it to a non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your Bitcoin. don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. \n\nNot your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it from. \n \nI recommend using [Mycelium Bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) for Android.\n\nMake sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. \n\nNever sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work.\n\n[Spend Bitcoin here](https://Purse.io) - Buy anything from Amazon using Bitcoin and name your own discount from 5-30%\n\n[List of stores that accept Bitcoin](https://www.acceptedhere.io/)\n\nWhen spending or transferring your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (The fee goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). \n\nCheck https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your transaction fee. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. Some wallets don't offer this option. Don't use those wallets. \n\n[Bitcoin deep dive] (https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html)\n\n[Buy The Bitcoin Standard book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119473861)\n\nPlus there's a second layer called the [Bitcoin Lightning Network.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network#:~:text=The%20Lightning%20Network%20is%20a,to%20the%20bitcoin%20scalability%20problem)\nNearly free and instant transfers based on Bitcoin.\n\n[Phoenix wallet is the best Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.phoenix.mainnet)\n\nAnd finally, a warning from Jameson Lopp. \"Every bitcoin that is held by an institution is a bitcoin that has had its security weakened by being subjected to bureaucratic and political decision-making. \u201cNot your keys, not your bitcoin\u201d rings true because when you have to ask someone for permission to transact, you are no longer in a position to resist censorship.

SPY fell out of its uptrend channel around 9:30 AM ish MST and dipped to its low point of the day, 362.58, before quickly rebounding. SPY reached a high of 364.18 and closed at 363.67.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/e4ge9fwnl7261.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab5da8a655f9f863a015293dfd4a043fcf29111)\n\nSPY has been consolidating since 11/24 midday. It is currently at the top of its consolidation rectangle, as highlighted below. We shall see if SPY can break out on Monday or if it will bounce off resistance and head back down to 361 ish and below. We could have one more day of consolidation, based on past charting.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/k1dct1fyl7261.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=868e9285d8a2b311db1ac386cda29c6b363b9939)\n\nFrom 11/25 Recap: \u201cSPY consolidated from 11/9 - 11/13 before breaking out 1.5%. She consolidated for about 2 days and 9 hours, from 11/13 - 11/17 (over the weekend). However, after consolidating, SPY fell about 1.14%. After the fall, SPY consolidated for about 5 days and 17 hours from 11/18 - 11/24 (over the weekend). Spy jumped about 1.46% before the current consolidation channel.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonday will be the start of SPY\u2019s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/020y89jnm7261.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d438b4dfe8d9db618a865fea7f284fef6bc5ab3b)\n\nAs stated in an earlier analysis, I'm bullish on SPY if it stays above 358 ish. SPY continues to toy around with a w-shaped recovery as highlighted below. On the daily chart, I'm looking for PSY to break through resistance and find new support. If support looks healthy, you could sell your wife's wedding ring and look at a late Dec. 380c. lotto.\n\n[1d chart](https://preview.redd.it/7epbtq32n7261.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c6775f740717f7413f7a6a515c75bc6b7e45d1)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*EASY MODE ACTIVATED\\*\\*\\*\\* or Merry Christmas You filthy Animal\n\n**11/30 - 12/28 AMD Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa\u2019s Nice List?**\n\n* If AMD punches through 87.18 resistance finds and news support, you could look at a 90c exp. 12/11 and hope that it hits between 90-93.2+ and trim.

They're a bunch of stubborn boomers that have collateral in the billions. It wouldn't be crazy if they made a $200 million bet on Gamestop becoming the next Blockbuster when it was under $6. They've made similar bets in the past like their $400 million short on Nintendo back in 2018.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7ttqxuym8261.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b39a443a7d7cdc8d62ede4680a5b540af920f1d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course that $200 million bet would have turned to a $500 million (and growing) that they owe. They might not get a margin call, but surely there's a point where their risk management and exit strategy tells them they have to cut losses instead of paying $100K daily in interests (\\~7% APR fee) on a losing position that's getting bigger and bigger.\n\n**Note:** the short squeeze is just a bonus so don't be a paperhand retard. There's more to the GME play than just hoping the short sellers pay for your lambo. GME is unusually undervalued compared to its peers (0.13x revenues if you're basing it on TTM revenues), it can go up without a short squeeze. These boomers still think that digital consoles are going to kill Gamestop even though Microsoft threw them a safety net and that disc consoles are still the vast majority of sales.

GME is unique in that it\u2019s probably the biggest upswing that\u2019s ever happened in these sorts of companies.\n\nI\u2019m not sure they deserve to survive relatively unscathed given their fatal mistakes. They really should have known better. Fucking professionals that get paid 7 8 9 figures die this. I guess Gabe had to sell a good portion of his fund, but it\u2019s a small price to pay for still keeping a multi billion dollar fund. In the grand scheme it\u2019s still going to be a large fund after this so he\u2019s really really lucky.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned from this, and it\u2019s not surprising if you really think about it, but what\u2019s surprising is the fact this actually, really successfully happened and the power that WSB exhibited in actually getting together and uniting in their love for a common stock etc. that fish meme that\u2019s been going on is very appropriate. Alone we die, together we are stronger than anyone ever expected. The top 1% own 38% of the stocks. That still means the bottom 99% own the majority, and if they unite they can wield some real influence. This whole battle taking place is sort of like that proxy (even tho I\u2019m sure there are plenty 1%era in WSB).\n\nJust think, there\u2019s over 6 million people on WSb now. If each one has an average of say $25k invested in stocks to invest (which could be aggressive or conservative I really don\u2019t fucking know) in some form of cohesion unity and teamwork like that of a hedge fund making investment decisions - that\u2019s a $150 BILLION AUM HEDGE FUND. That\u2019s the largest HF in the world aside from maybe Bridgewater.
