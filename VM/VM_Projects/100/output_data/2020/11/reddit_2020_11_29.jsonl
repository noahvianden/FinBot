For beginners, I recommend the Cash App for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Once you buy Bitcoin, withdraw it to a non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your Bitcoin. don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. \n\nNot your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it from. \n \nI recommend using [Mycelium Bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) for Android.\n\nMake sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. \n\nNever sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work.\n\n[Spend Bitcoin here](https://Purse.io) - Buy anything from Amazon using Bitcoin and name your own discount from 5-30%\n\n[List of stores that accept Bitcoin](https://www.acceptedhere.io/)\n\nWhen spending or transferring your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (The fee goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). \n\nCheck https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your transaction fee. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. Some wallets don't offer this option. Don't use those wallets. \n\n[Bitcoin deep dive] (https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html)\n\n[Buy The Bitcoin Standard book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119473861)\n\nPlus there's a second layer called the [Bitcoin Lightning Network.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network#:~:text=The%20Lightning%20Network%20is%20a,to%20the%20bitcoin%20scalability%20problem)\nNearly free and instant transfers based on Bitcoin.\n\n[Phoenix wallet is the best Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.phoenix.mainnet)\n\nAnd finally, a warning from Jameson Lopp. \"Every bitcoin that is held by an institution is a bitcoin that has had its security weakened by being subjected to bureaucratic and political decision-making. \u201cNot your keys, not your bitcoin\u201d rings true because when you have to ask someone for permission to transact, you are no longer in a position to resist censorship.

SPY fell out of its uptrend channel around 9:30 AM ish MST and dipped to its low point of the day, 362.58, before quickly rebounding. SPY reached a high of 364.18 and closed at 363.67.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/e4ge9fwnl7261.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab5da8a655f9f863a015293dfd4a043fcf29111)\n\nSPY has been consolidating since 11/24 midday. It is currently at the top of its consolidation rectangle, as highlighted below. We shall see if SPY can break out on Monday or if it will bounce off resistance and head back down to 361 ish and below. We could have one more day of consolidation, based on past charting.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/k1dct1fyl7261.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=868e9285d8a2b311db1ac386cda29c6b363b9939)\n\nFrom 11/25 Recap: \u201cSPY consolidated from 11/9 - 11/13 before breaking out 1.5%. She consolidated for about 2 days and 9 hours, from 11/13 - 11/17 (over the weekend). However, after consolidating, SPY fell about 1.14%. After the fall, SPY consolidated for about 5 days and 17 hours from 11/18 - 11/24 (over the weekend). Spy jumped about 1.46% before the current consolidation channel.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonday will be the start of SPY\u2019s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/020y89jnm7261.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d438b4dfe8d9db618a865fea7f284fef6bc5ab3b)\n\nAs stated in an earlier analysis, I'm bullish on SPY if it stays above 358 ish. SPY continues to toy around with a w-shaped recovery as highlighted below. On the daily chart, I'm looking for PSY to break through resistance and find new support.

They might not get a margin call, but surely there's a point where their risk management and exit strategy tells them they have to cut losses instead of paying $100K daily in interests (\\~7% APR fee) on a losing position that's getting bigger and bigger.\n\n**Note:** the short squeeze is just a bonus so don't be a paperhand retard. There's more to the GME play than just hoping the short sellers pay for your lambo. GME is unusually undervalued compared to its peers (0.13x revenues if you're basing it on TTM revenues), it can go up without a short squeeze. These boomers still think that digital consoles are going to kill Gamestop even though Microsoft threw them a safety net and that disc consoles are still the vast majority of sales.

GME is unique in that it\u2019s probably the biggest upswing that\u2019s ever happened in these sorts of companies.\n\nI\u2019m not sure they deserve to survive relatively unscathed given their fatal mistakes. They really should have known better. Fucking professionals that get paid 7 8 9 figures die this. I guess Gabe had to sell a good portion of his fund, but it\u2019s a small price to pay for still keeping a multi billion dollar fund. In the grand scheme it\u2019s still going to be a large fund after this so he\u2019s really really lucky.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned from this, and it\u2019s not surprising if you really think about it, but what\u2019s surprising is the fact this actually, really successfully happened and the power that WSB exhibited in actually getting together and uniting in their love for a common stock etc. that fish meme that\u2019s been going on is very appropriate. Alone we die, together we are stronger than anyone ever expected. The top 1% own 38% of the stocks. That still means the bottom 99% own the majority, and if they unite they can wield some real influence. This whole battle taking place is sort of like that proxy (even tho I\u2019m sure there are plenty 1%era in WSB).\n\nJust think, there\u2019s over 6 million people on WSb now. If each one has an average of say $25k invested in stocks to invest (which could be aggressive or conservative I really don\u2019t fucking know) in some form of cohesion unity and teamwork like that of a hedge fund making investment decisions - that\u2019s a $150 BILLION AUM HEDGE FUND.

{"title": "Is the WallStreetBets sub-reddit fools gold or are we a diamond in the rough? I think the latter", "selftext": "They always make fun of us ~~traders~~ gamblers here at r/WallStreetBets, but who \\*really\\* has the last laugh? Is it us Chads while we eat our crayons on the way to the Lambo shop? Or are the virgin traders truly better than us?\n\nI'm going to show you something. Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.\n\n**Here's the kicker**. \\*Most\\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of \"mooning\". If you are new to the industry of printing tendies, grab a tequila on the rocks and have a drink with me while I go through some sentiment on the WallStreetBets forum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not even going to start with PLTR (Palantir) because that would be too obvious. Let's start with XPEV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**XPEV**\n\nLook at this sentiment chart. The stock wasn't even mentioned a single time until some autist found an alternative EV company to gamble on after it shot up 10% in a single day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un64jt1z47261.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=311103e4373fa04790226cebe751d1d35ca9aa9b\n\n1st wave sentiment peaked at 3% of the sub-reddit's comment volume. What happened next? The stock stayed flat for 7 days and you autists completely forgot about it. Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CRSR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8\n\nNext up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LI** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0\n\nNext we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PLTR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02\n\nThe PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhat's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before.

WSB is definitely a credible 'thing' when it comes to gauging sentiment and momentum- and don't think for a second the mainstream market makers haven't noticed, but we're practicing in an environment with unusual conditions. The reversion to the mean for us will be ugly. Several of you who have made easy money will 0ff yourselves when you give it all back.\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nStonks, like poker, are a game of optimizing your decisions over time. Flash in the pan superheroes operating on fools courage and dumb luck vanish a year or two later.... The great survive, because they understand this one, single concept. Stonks, like poker did in 2003, are going through a mainstream boom where decisions aren't based on fundamentals, but being slightly better than the retard next to you. This is not sustainable, because money always flows upward and eventually, you run out. Stonks, like poker did during the mainstream boom, are enjoying an easy money phase for those who have at least some experience and aren't mentally retarded. And what we're seeing now with stonks, as with poker, will eventually change as smarter people optimize the game and you're cut out. What will happen with the 'game' that is stonks, as happened with 'the game' that was poker, is that the optimization process will ruthlessly continue upward. Right now, we're in an inefficiency phase where herds of literal retards are given positive feedback on otherwise inoptimal decisions, allowing them to profit mindlessly, right along with those who understand the rules of the game. The democratization of information that is the internet has finally come into its own and its ability to move markets is now 'a thing'. Gone are the days of pumps and dumps being done by rogue Chinamen in Yahoo chat rooms. Now, they're done here and so far, the ride has been nice.\n\nHere's what comes next\n\nStonks, as with poker, will eventually cull the weak and mediocre. Former stuperstars will be unable to cope with 'new trading' as their old rulebooks no longer apply. Fundamentalists who were early to discover the basic physics of 'the game' will no longer be able to win on that alone as more nuanced, dynamic strategies are applied that are much harder to get ahead of and require a lot more cognitive (and computer processing) horsepower to manage for profit.\n\nThe thing is, this process could take YEARS to unfold, before some particle physicist working at Renaissance is able to figure out the +ev trade, beyond just having an intern scan WSB for clues and watching the velocity of retail orders to frontrun. Its possible the tardfarm that is WSB could continue to produce tendies for us all for quite some time, but the party will eventually come to an end. The fleas believe they're all kings of the world... until the dog begins to scratch. So few of you have ever seen a 1999 or an October 2007, you just don't understand. You saw March of 2020, and you think you know... You don't. One day, stonks don't go up... for a while. They go down. Fast... and all your money goes away with no hope that it comes back any time soon if ever.\n\nThere is another side to this and for many of you it a return to day jobs, to desperate pangs of regret and for a tragic few, dangling from a n00se... Make sure your parents post the reason why in the obit, so it can be posted here as a cautionary tale. \n\nJust wait. You'll see.

Either way wsb hype will lag behind actual stock movement. Usually the shit has peaked by the time autists are name dropping it left and right on here, and by the time your average lurker/normie buys in it's either a dud or you can get one or two more climatic orgasms out of it. \n\n2) Meaning you can either diversify in anticipation of a wsb shout out, which would result in at least some autists throwing away their 401K to buy in and elevate stock price, or develop some great pull out game. \n\nAssuming you get in early enough, you can ride that curve as long as you recognize that the majority of the time *you're probably in a fucking over hyped, over speculated bubble,* and your window of opportunity probably isn't jack. \n\n99% of this shit will never be Tesla. Hell, Tesla might even end up being fuck all with normie companies seriously getting in on the electric vehicle game now. If you play the stock version of Vatican Roulette and have great pull out game, then you can still come out ahead *before* it turns into 80s Argentina. The key with that is to be more humble than greedy, (which......the fuck am I even saying on here? Self control? lol), if you dropped 10k and only came out with 15, don't even trip. You still came out ahead. Wallow in your dopamine hit, cause the realistic chances of getting to 20-30k are dogshit, at best. Assuming wsb isn't talking out their ass and you lose it all. At least that's the mentality you should have imo. Wsb *will* pump some other bullshit up in the near future. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.\n\n3) The democratization of the stock market will get sorted out and stabilized eventually, but will be an utter shitstorm for the world economy in the meantime. Of course, I don't have a crystal ball, but I can tell you that entire countries, if not the majority of the world, have been fucked in the ass repeatedly by *very smart people who actually know what they're doing.* Or at least thought they did. Then turn around and give this power to a bunch of normies who think free money goes brrrrr. That's like putting a dude who's never driven a car in the cockpit of a 747.
