And it's covered 92,000 miles. And is 7 years old. For the exact same price, I just bought an 8 month old 530d with 6000 miles on the clock.\n\nTesla's seem very expensive second-hand because they maintain value so well. EVs have thousands of moving parts fewer than ICE vehicles, and Tesla's maintain value (and battery capacity) much better than a lot of the competitors. They're expensive, but for a reason. On top of that, if you bought FSD a few year ago, your car would now have gained $6,000 of value purely from the updated software, which largely off-sets price depreciation.\n\n> People just cannot afford them, and companies would rather spend three quarters of that on a diesel 3-series.\n\nI agree they're too expensive for a lot of people. I'd have a Tesla today if they were half the price, which is why they are aiming to have a $25,000 car out in about 3 years' time.\n\nAlso something to keep in mind is that they're aiming to have autonomous cars on the road very soon. As soon as this happens, people are going to stop buying cars and just using ride hailing. The expectations are that car sales will decline by 80% as soon as this happens, at which point high prices don't really matter as much anymore since it will be companies buying those cars.\n\nThat said, companies who spend three quarters of the Tesla price on a diesel are just shortsighted. Tesla's are much cheaper to operate and maintain, less likely to break down and maintain value much better. Over a 3-5 year ownership, especially with high usage, Tesla's are much cheaper. You can already see this in the taxi market for example, where (at least in my country) practically every large taxi company uses exclusively Tesla's.\n\n> I'm assuming in China, these EV's are cheap as fuck, which is why their market is doing so well?\n\nYes, which is why it's an unfair comparison. For example, the best sold EV in China is the Wuling Mini EV, but Wuling only sold 28% more Mini EVs than Tesla did Model 3s, even though the Model 3 is almost 9 times as expensive. So Tesla made about 6,5 times more revenue from the Model 3, which also has a much higher margin percentage (the Mini EV has \"low gross margin and weak profitability\").
