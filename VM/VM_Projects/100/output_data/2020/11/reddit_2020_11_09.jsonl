IMO they are unlikely to do something that will force those people to buy TSLA shares at prices that might become vastly inflated on news of index inclusion, only to fall back significantly sometime later. \n\nAt this point, who cares?

S&P needs about 15% of shares, they have to pay a lot to get the shares from those hands. They are hoping the stock is overvalued, so at some point, they could include Tesla at a lower price.\n\nI suspect Tesla is quite undervalued. Next year selling 1m vehicles at 45k per car. 2022 2m at $45k per car, 30% gross margin... That's $27B gross profit, not including energy business. After that point, FSD ride sharing will kick in.

I have a question about the Tesla Semi. \n\nDoes Tesla have plans to install charging infrastructure for the Semi in order to free up regular superchargers for cars? I heard that it takes 4 superchargers connected together to charge 1 semi. \n\nMy next question, I heard that there is a significant amount of electricity required for charging multiple semi's at the the same time, so grids will not be able to provide sufficient power for these requirements. Is this true? I know that charging will generally be done overnight when the trucks aren't in use, but for long haul journeys this won't be possible. Thanks", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "We haven't had a lot of clarity on what Tesla will do for semi supercharges. It seems likely that Semis will need a new dedicated solution due to physical space and power requirements. My suspicion is that the first customers will be using semi's for local distribution where they can all charge at one location (possibly owner owned, possibly at lower charge rates / overnight). Then the eventual semi supercharger rollout will occur as long-distance customers need them.\n\nRegarding the grid - this is a huge potential hurdle, but not inherently unsolvable. There isn't a major issue with generation capacity, but what is an issue is primarily distribution capacity, and secondarily how well the grid can handle ramp rates. It becomes even more of an issue if Tesla semi's start to travel in FSD-enabled \"trains\" with multiple semi's arriving and needing a charge simultaneously.\n\nSolving distribution capacity requires locating semi supercharges near major transmission lines, and/or installing major transmission infrastructure including transformers, cabling, etc. Consider that an average house has a peak demand of 10-20 kW (the peak demand for a neighbourhood will be somewhat lower because not everyone will turn on their heat and microwave at exactly the same time). Whereas supercharging a single semi will likely take 1 MW to keep timeline reasonable. A semi-supercharger with 25 stalls = 25 MW peak rate, and will regularly be ramping by +/- 5 MW within 10 minute increments as multiple vehicles start/finish charging.
