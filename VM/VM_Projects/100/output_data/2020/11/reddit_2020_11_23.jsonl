The last movie was terrible (and I say that as a pretty lenient Star Wars fan who enjoyed Force Awakens). \n\nPeople are excited about Disney+, but Disney is competing in an ever expanding range of entertainment choices for kids. Kids today have anime, video games, Twitch, Youtube videos, etc to entertain them.
