{"title": "Largest U.S. Pension Bought Up EV Stocks Nikola and NIO, and Zoom", "selftext": "The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.\n\nCalifornia Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola \ufffc (NKLA) and NIO \ufffc (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications \ufffc (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla \ufffc (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.\n\nCalpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.\n\nA short seller\u2019s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers\u2019 deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.\n\nNIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.\n\nJ.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company\u2019s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.\n\nCalpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.\n\nThe pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.\n\nZoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.\n\nCalpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.\n\nTesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday\u2019s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.\n\nThe electric-vehicle giant\u2019s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nIt is good to see pension fund still buying tesla. This is bullish to all the tesla shareholders.\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "jumgtz", "created_utc": 1605449632.0, "score": 894, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 253, "comments": [{"body": "They bought Nikola? \ud83d\ude02", "score": 939, "replies": [{"body": "Imagine getting payed to read and follow WSB", "score": 451, "replies": [{"body": "Do you mean something like https://www.makealivingwriting.com/humor-writing-markets-that-pay-you-to-make-people-laugh/", "score": 66, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33964860439300537}, {"body": "and getting to play with nearly $400B of Grandma's/Grandpa's money.", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Sucks to be them.

{"title": "71k YOLO $BABA 290c 02/19/21", "selftext": "I was planning to wait a bit longer before entry, but I just couldn't resist as I witnessed some weird option price movements near the closing bell on Friday and honestly, $BABA is a steal at the current prices.\n\nI'm sure most of you are aware of Alibaba ($BABA) - currently, the largest Chinese company, the Amazon of China and the NIO of e-commerce. Recently, Alibaba, along with JD.com hit record sales numbers from the Singles Day event, but despite that, $BABA's share prices plummeted due to 3 reasons: PFE's vaccine news, Ant Groups' fail IPO and China's new anti-monopoly rules. These events sent $BABA's share price from near $315 levels down to $266 in just a few days - then slowly sliding it down to $260/share (-21% drop). What was it that the investors were so fearful of which triggered this downward slide?\n\n1. Alibaba holds a \\~33% stake in Ant Group, a fintech company (largest in the world - even bigger than Stripe), was set to IPO with a $313b USD valuation. This would be very beneficial for Alibaba and the multitude of enterprises that Alibaba has stake in. Unfortunately, this move was stopped by China due to a few reasons: lack of regulation and the possible increase in monopolistic competition. Hence, they drafted some monopoly regulations for review.\n2. What are these monopoly regulations and the proposals thought out by the regulators? The regulators claimed that the e-commerce market is fierce and it was merely a few products that dominate the e-commerce platforms. As a result, they believe that 1 supplier per platform would be appropriate to allow for more entrants into the market.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just Alibaba who was hit with this monopoly rule. Other big players like Tencent, [JD.com](https://JD.com), Meituan and Pinduoduo were hit by these waves, but their stock prices quickly rebounded (some unphased) after the fears were quickly wiped off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tencent](https://preview.redd.it/bf1ru4s3fbz51.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0de9f7fee9e4a28168ceecd386a52aa7a81805)\n\n[Pinduoduo](https://preview.redd.it/lwuioff6fbz51.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=5285f0d24ed79bdfa22e1ef1f01011f629647495)\n\n[JD.com](https://preview.redd.it/3xbrma7afbz51.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ea047a522bd1f8c7b241fd063e944c63d06dd11)\n\n[Meituan](https://preview.redd.it/tn29nfcujbz51.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=8484b390c60dd655c6c8013aaef21d52f3cb166e)\n\nWhile $BABA still seems to be a sinking ship after the news.\n\n[BABA](https://preview.redd.it/bs7xv52ifbz51.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da96f6d51ff15a203318d9531c9d6748567afa6)\n\nGuys, $BABA at these levels is a steal. This is a monster of a company that only has great outlooks for the future. I personally believe that these monopolies laws might not come into fruition because it would be incredibly difficult to provision 1 supplier per platform rule with so many merchandisers out there. One may argue that even if it does get drafted, it just means a weaker barrier to entry, so more companies will be able to bring in new products to compete against the *better* brands; thus, increasing quality, competition and customer acquisition and retention. Regulation = bearish - doesn't always equate.\n\nSome more info about BABA for you value investors out there:\n\nBABA's PER = 28.02, EPS (TTM) = 9.31, 717.383B MC\n\nAMZN's PER = 91.48, EPS (TTM) = 34.20, 1.57T MC\n\nJD's PER = 626.39, EPS (TTM) = 0.15, 139.745B MC\n\nBABA is incredibly underpriced.\n\nAlso, I did mention this in the beginning, but what was it that I witnessed that made me enter this position? $BABA was red the entire day on Friday, bottomed at -2.5% then closed at -1.3%. It didn't see green even once. Despite that, their OTM option prices strangely rose by a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$BABA 02\\/19\\/21 calls](https://preview.redd.it/tbzgkzdvhbz51.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf44529f02f8a57b9721286f9f754059a6699da)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$BABA 02\\/19\\/21 calls](https://preview.redd.it/jnp860kzhbz51.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=3418dd587e086aace1cf4705064e8edb639eb3f1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$BABA 12\\/18\\/21 calls](https://preview.redd.it/4b8bi6z3ibz51.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b6d7ab3e3364c4d1591bd69db5209b6fefc3f7c)\n\nThe IVs on these average at around 65%, but currently they sit at 40%. Probably the near the bottom which signals for a great entry.\n\n[More bullish sentiments from option traders](https://preview.redd.it/pqll1o1eibz51.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=918d67c20138035e4f2f82b1547fa86885242d46)\n\nThe fear levels were extremely high on Friday, and China will keep their ears open for public's opinion until Nov 30, so it still might be a dangerous time to enter. But I just couldn't resist after seeing those types of option activities. Fear levels dying down over the weekend and JD's earnings report that's being released this coming Monday might also show a gap up starting Monday.\n\nDon't take this to be financial advice, but my forecast for $BABA is at least back to $310 levels before 02/19/20. You also have $BABA's earnings coming up in the 2nd week of Feb, so the IV will be insanely high this time to increase the value of your contracts even more.\n\n**Position: $BABA 290c 02/19/21**\n\n**Proof:**\n\n[$71k $BABA 290c 02\\/19\\/21](https://preview.redd.it/hj9xdmiklbz51.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d2883639e2712218664d0e3099ed57ddf15055e)", "id": "juexh1", "created_utc": 1605409719.0, "score": 457, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 292, "comments": [{"body": "This is some good shit, I hope you print.

It doesn't move like AMZN or other FAANG stocks. P/E is 28-ish which is ridiculously low for a tech stock like BABA. People are saying it's criminal and that eventually the P/E will rise considerably. I don't agree with that only because at the end of the day, it's a Chinese stock and will therefore always be discounted. I've seen one year price targets for BABA between $450-700. This is **highly** unlikely. The business will continue to grow massively but I don't think the stock price follows as fast. If the stock price drops to $250 next week, buy calls far out as close to the current price as possible. Even if the contracts are expensive, you're very likely to hit on them even if you have to wait until expiration. BABA should be back to $300 in a year, but I think the max is $350. I just don't see it higher than that. So why take the risk of buying a $300 call option (breakeven of $326.90) for $2,690 when you can buy the $265 call option for $4,140 (with a breakeven of $307.11), you know?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Fundamental analysis on the same price basis is just funny.

I am not 100% certain that was the reason (I don't think anyone is), but if you compare tech vs value stocks, the techs all dipped on Nov 9 when PFE's vaccine news was released. \n\nYou can probably make educated guesses as to why this was the case. $BABA, like $AMZN, is a COVID stock. It performs well under COVID and this was evident during their earnings releases - so per speculation, I believe this was why $BABA dropped from 299 -> 290. \n\n$MRNA also released their vaccine results yesterday and tech did another dip yet again, but quickly recovered. But should tech be frightened due to COVID vaccines? Well PFE's vaccine news was pretty unexpected and value stocks had massive surges, but sector rotation ended rather quickly which I think the investors caught on. Tech came back and value stocks dropped. People are starting to realize that vaccine, even though it's great news for society and value stocks, we are not certain when we will actually be able to get back to status quo. Until then, techs will continue to dominate. As such, the good news of vaccines will have lesser and lesser impact on the stock market. Come vaccine news and its resounding efficacy brings other foreseen, yet unaccounted problems like, distribution and logistics, people fearing the authenticity of vaccines results, approval and timeline and most importantly, resulting business recovery.\n\nThe $MRNA's news on Monday could have partially impacted $BABA's stock performance, but I think the main culprit is still clear as $BABA is continuing to depreciate post vaccine release: the CCP. CCP can crush any Chinese businesses at any given time and people are fearful of what Xi might do to $BABA after what Jack Ma had said. \n\nMy personal opinion is that $BABA is still here to stay. $BABA increases China's annual GDP by 4.8% and attracts so many foreign customers and investors alike. It also helps them find other Chinese stocks like NIO, GSX, LI, XPEV, etc. Further, it helps fight US e-commerce giants like $AMZN and $EBAY. $BABA is here to stay, but still, people are fearful. Give it time, and fear will disappear. CCP will not let $BABA fall, but they just wanted to show Jack Ma who's actually in charge here so that he can take better precautions and not snub the Chinese government going forward.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Damn that was insightful!

{"title": "If WSB is a casino, you should probably build a strategy. Here is my perspective.", "selftext": "TL;DR it takes too much work and mental stress to become consistently profitable. Get a day job.             \n\nBelow are some of the guidelines I make for my own personal investments and I am sharing my investing perspective so it may help others improve their trading views through the perspective of an idiot.         \n\nWhat I think every investor should know/learn about:         \n\n\u2022It usually takes years before traders become profitable, but it can be a great source of income if you can game the market.        \n\n\u2022It is important to remember that there is always a winner and a loser in a trade. The banks are usually the winners.       \n\n\u2022When you go to the casino always find a way to bet on the casino winning.       \n\n\u2022Only sell puts when they are covered and you intend to buy stocks from it to use as a potential swing trade or long hold. You don\u2019t want to get caught trying to work the verticals after hours.              \n\n\u2022Indicators are great outliers for trading, but should really only be used as a basis to judge your trades at the end of the day. you want to avoid getting VWAP, MACD and IC fucked because when you\u2019re trading at the bottom of the channels sometimes it just keeps going...         \n\n\u2022Sitting back and going cash heavy is never a bad move. Sure you miss out on some opportunities but you certainly don\u2019t want to feel the bite of overbuying during an institutional sell off.          \n\n\u2022Consolidation can take weeks before it rockets or blows up. Place consolidation calls 1 month out and swings 2 weeks out. Theta usually burns during the last week more than any other time, so doing 2 week trades is usually best unless you expect the market to turn the next day(don\u2019t buy calls for next Friday exp if tomorrow is the only up day you expect) because other people are probably thinking the same thing and selling their options at the same time as you.           \n\n\u2022Generally speaking, most people lose money by buying a call or put and holding it until expiration. If you\u2019re lucky enough to ride a daily wave or gap consider selling out or pulling profits to gamble with house money. How many degenerates have been up 100+ only to be down 90% the next day?         \n\n\u2022Know the rules(really though, read the rules on exercising options as they vary from platform to platform).      \n\n\u2022make your own guidelines, and look for keys or tell tale signs of a head fake.        \n\n\u2022If you\u2019re new to trading stocks you should probably stick to trading stocks until you learn what a bid/ask spread is, learn how markets move, and learn how all the small things can make industries move on a macro level.          \n\n\u2022Learn how to time the market and compare charts for consistent moves made during specific time periods. Break it down per 1,5,15,30,60 minute charts and daily charts mon-Friday for years. Try to find tendencies and consistencies in charts and graphs. If you think you can read charts and patterns choose a random day of that stock that you have not studied and day trade it using Webull on normal time playback(not on fast forward so you suffer the misery of watching it move slowly for minutes on end only to miss the timing of the jump or bottom).          \n\n\u2022There is nothing wrong with holding onto cash and just watching/studying the markets. Look for how different things like hurricanes, war, tsunamis, inflation, deflation, bond yields and exchange rates effect the market in the mean time as that is what has been driving this market on a macro level.       \n\n\u2022my personal holdings strategy is 80% cash, 10% stock, 9% options and 1% leverage. It can change to 90% cash and 10% options with a 5-5 or 8-2 split when I am not holding onto stock and run bearish. I do not want a normal market as that would kill my strategy(a market that lacks volatility).      \n\n\u2022If leverage is too expensive to buy on your positions, find a stock that has been outperforming based on that sector and short it(assuming you\u2019re call heavy). They usually have the lowest IV but the largest amount of movement. Puts on triple leveraged is also a pretty decent money mAker when looking for leverage(costs more but has a tendency of having larger payout percentages).        \n\n\u2022Learn about psychological manipulation and the way institutional investors move the bid/ask spread to create artificial support and resistance lines before canceling their buy/sell orders and letting the stock run. Sometimes they will kill the price after a few minutes just to create a different bid/ask spread with backup orders(my theory is that this is what creates VWAP and MACD flops on a macro level).         \n\n\u2022create your own rules that will help you refine your investments. Having too many rules doesn\u2019t limit your trades, rather it increases your ability to invest by increasing success and through this creating confidence required to make the right trade.        \n\n\u2022Look at daily bond yields and volumes of bonds bought/sold and at what prices.      \n\n\u2022Watch currency exchanges as currency rates will clearly make a difference in profits that rely on imports/exports(almost every company).     \n\n\u2022When trading wedges, sell out when one set of options covers the cost of the entire wedge(calls and puts) +10%, and hold the other side until the stock goes the other way. I view it as buying the consolidation, profiting off of movement, and banking off of a head fake.       \n\n\u2022sell options within the first 15-30 minutes of market open if the stock spiked to take advantage of volatility.       \n\n\u2022buy options around 2-3et as that will usually be the cheapest time , but the last half hour can also be a great time depending on which part of charts you like to work.        \n\n\u2022Close options as a day trade if I profit 100% or more in a day.        \n\nPersonal rules:        \n\n80% cash, 10% stock, 10% options with 90% cash-10% options if I am bearish.       \n\nDon\u2019t overpay for an option just because you think you can scalp a quick 50%. It\u2019s not worth getting macd or vwap fucked.        \n\nIf you have to pay more than the price of 1 stock for a weekly option that is 50 cents or .2% otm it is not worth buying in my opinion(don\u2019t hold options for more than 1-3 days at the most because you don\u2019t want to ride the waves if you know a down day is coming).       \n\nBe happy with 5-10% returns. Sure some people might be making more, but you just need to hit the right rotation to outperform them.        \n\nDo your research. Don\u2019t jump on hype/meme stock.       \n\nInverse Cramer except when he is giving advice to service members.       \n\nAlways buy leverage because breaking even on bad days is worth sacrificing 10-30% worth of gains to make sure you break even if the market turns.       \n\nKnow the who(who is the ceo and what have they done), the what(what does the company sell and who are they marketed towards), when(when do you plan on buying and selling), where(where are they based out of), why(why do you think this company will outperform the other companies in the same sector), and how(how did you hear about the stock? Sources matter as they will give you an idea of how accurate they have been in the past).         \n\nBuy on bad news and sell on good news. Most of the time billionaires already got the news and sold out by the time you hear about it and panic(causing more panic and a great buying opportunity).           \n\nThis is not investment/financial advice and is for entertainment purposes only.             \n\nEdit: food for thought: ever wanted to exercise an option afterhours and sell it in early premarket 4:30 et to buy and dump the position?
