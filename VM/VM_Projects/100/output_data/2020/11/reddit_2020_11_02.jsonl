Clearly credit, but with what market or underlying assumptions?\n\nAs a self-check to see if you really have the basics down, suppose you are considering a -1 TSLA 470/465c Dec monthly for a $1 credit.

A $1 credit is too low for a $5 spread, which means it has a bad risk/reward. Metrics to consider are all the greeks, particularly IV and vega. Higher IV on entry is better. But let's say you did the trade anyway. A good exit strategy exits early at 50% profit, 100% to 200% loss of credit earned, and hold no longer than about 12 DTE. Don't hold to expiration voluntarily, only do so if you have no other choice. If that spread expires with TSLA at 469, the long call is worthless and can't be used to offset the $46,900 worth of short TSLA shares the assignment of the short leg will net you.

Because you can only exercise the long leg, you have no control over the short leg. Under certain circumstances, like both legs of the spread expire ITM, but you fell into a coma and couldn't do anything about the position voluntarily, then maybe your broker will automatically exercise the long to cover the very likely assigned short for you.

It's much more useful to consider time and moneyness (delta). Those, assuming little or no change in volatility, are the primary influences on distribution of outcomes.\n\nFor example, if you have around 30 days to expiration on a 30 delta call, you can estimate a roughly 30% chance to expire ITM (delta is approximately equal to the probability of ITM for a short). The accuracy of that estimate falls off as you approach expiration, for example, a 30 delta call on expiration day has less than a 30% chance to expire ITM. IV also influences the accuracy that estimate. Rising IV increases the probability of expiring ITM.\n\nVolume and OI have more to do with how cost effective your entry and exit trades are. The lower the volume, the \"fuzzier\" the market is about the true value of the contract, because there aren't enough completed trades to \"discover\" the price. The fuzzier the value, the less credit you may collect at open (vs a higher volume contract), and the more you may have to pay to close.
