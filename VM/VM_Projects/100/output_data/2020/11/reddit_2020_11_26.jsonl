And what makes this extra cool is that you donated to a charity that's highly effective. This is one of [givewell.org](https://givewell.org)'s recommended charities. Givewell goes beyond [charitynavigator.org](https://charitynavigator.org)'s service of just evaluating the finances of a charity and how much overhead they have (although Charity Navigator is working to catch up by making an impact score). Givewell evaluates how inherently efficient a cause is at helping. It doesn't matter how financially efficient a charity is if their goal is to give donuts to cops, as a contrived example. All of this goes along with the philosophy of effective altruism: doing good most efficiently. If you are interested in maximizing your impact, look into \"Effective Altruism\". There is an EA group on Facebook. You can also check out Will Macaskill. He has been on Joe Rogan's Podcast, along with Sam Harris's podcast, Tim Ferris' podcast, and many others. I would recommend listening to him on Tim Ferris' podcast for a good introduction. I don't know as much about [openphilanthropy.org](https://openphilanthropy.org), but I know they are a name that gets brought up a bit in the Effective Altruism community. They have some overlap with Givewell in that they try to identify effective ways to donate money, and then they donate lots of money themselves (they are funded by a co founder of Facebook and Asana). Also check out [givingmulitplier.org](https://givingmulitplier.org), they will match a percent of your donation. I have no affiliation with any of these groups or people other than that I would like to help others and donate some of my time and money.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17759501934051514}, {"body": "This is awesome.
