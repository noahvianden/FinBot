{"title": "APXT: Merger with AvePoint", "selftext": "\nAPXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022.\n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.\n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.\n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,\n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $13.90 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.", "id": "k23o04", "created_utc": 1606492570.0, "score": 482, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "The CEO has a very unfortunate name", "score": 203, "replies": [{"body": "This could mean more meme potential.
