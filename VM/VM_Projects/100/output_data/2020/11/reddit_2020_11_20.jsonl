If you look at their S-1 and other information they have about this portion of their business things are much more insidious than they appear on the surface. Namely FDE engineers often end up staying at companies well beyond the initial implementation phase (i.e they are selling bodies) and FDE contracts account for much more of their revenue then their software licensing.\nIf you believe their books (which I don't see a reason not to) then the margin on these FDEs is minimal if non-existent. All of their margin is on their software licensing (about 80% margin vs R&D which is just OK, not fantastic for a software company).\n\nSo valuation. It comes down to whether you believe this business model can and will change. If it doesn't change then the currently $35B market cap is completely unjustified.\n\nHowever if you believe they can turn their product into something that can be a) used off the shelf or b) implemented more quickly and scaled using system integrators then maybe it could justify it's current valuation assuming a constant growth factor of 40-50% YoY.\nI think this is the most likely avenue to increased growth but I also don't believe they have the culture or expertise necessary (I don't have a high opinion of their engineering talent).\n\nThere does exist a world where they can offer their platform as SaaS and have it plug into GCP/AWS/Azure integrating with existing data-lake and data warehousing solutions with no consultants needed and then uses heuristics and models to suggest how to bring the data to gether. This would be the most scalable play and the only one that can justify their valuation as it would expand their market to the entire market of companies that have or should have data engineering teams.\n\nThe truth is I have very little confidence they can pull through on the last one, it just runs so counter to everything they have done so far and my understanding of their company culture and future goals.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "As an aside I am not saying their stock price won't go up, hype suggests it almost certainly will so if you are a hype trader cashing in on this is a good idea.\n\nPersonally though this isn't my cup of tea.

Say you wanted to implement a fraud detection system. This is bread and butter of PLTR so it makes for a good comparison to other ways you could do this.\n\nLets assume you are on GOOG GCP stack. You have available to you a number of primitives that can get the job done and you can drop in some other vendors or OSS software to fill the gaps.\nFor storage you have BigQuery which is columnar data warehouse, you have PubSub for streaming. Dataflow for streaming and batch data cleaning and loading into BigQuery. You have Google AI Platform to run your models and you can plug in whatever visualisation tool you want, Google provides Data Studio but you could also go for something a bit more shiny like Metabase or Looker.\nYou would stream your transaction events into PubSub, have a PubSub consumer that takes each transaction and forwards it a model running on AI Platform to score it for fraud. Concurrently you would also stream all the transactions into BigQuery for later model training and model performance analysis. \n\nThis would give you effectively the same set of capabilities to solve the problem as PLTR's Gotham with products mostly from a single vendor (which is ideal for corps) but you would have to do the glue yourself or pay someone to do it. PLTR software is built like this internally too just wayyyyy less efficient and powerful but traded off for higher integration.\n\nThe big difference is PLTR service offering. In the GOOG heavy option above you need to hire data infrastructure engineer to get all those bits wired up together.
