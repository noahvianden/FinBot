{"title": "BABA Analysis", "selftext": "**ANYONE THINKING ABOUT BUYING BABA SHOULD READ THIS**\n\nI had some free time and went back to go look at the original footage of Jack Ma's speech two weeks ago, and for all that matters I'm Chinese.\n\nLet's just say it wasn't great, he openly made the branches of government regulators: the Chinese SEC, and BRC look like fucking idiots, and tried to quote Xi while doing it. It became viral a few days ago when the news of the suspension hit. People in general are pretty pissed online, and I think that that mood is intentional since it matches the government's stance on the issue.\n\nJack Ma, founder of BABA and \"de facto head\" of ANT did things like:\n\n\"labeling the global banking Basel Accords\u00a0as an \u201cold people\u2019s club,\u201d Ma said \u201csystemic risk\u201d is not the issue in China. Rather, China\u2019s biggest risk is that it \u201clacks a financial ecosystem.\u201d\u00a0Chinese banks are like \u201cpawn shops\u201d, where collateral\u00a0and guarantees are the hard currencies. As a result, some decided to go so big they are not allowed to fail.\"\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/jack-mas-blunt-words-just-cost-him-35-billion/2020/11/03/bd2ef486-1ded-11eb-ad53-4c1fda49907d\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/jack-mas-blunt-words-just-cost-him-35-billion/2020/11/03/bd2ef486-1ded-11eb-ad53-4c1fda49907d_story.html)\n\nI mean yes it's true these are actual issues, but calling them out for the entirety of the public and media to see is not how shit works in China. There have always been monopoly concerns for BABA both in their eCommerce branch as well as payment branch, which split into ANT.\n\nA lot of people don't know wtf ANT does to earn a 300B+ valuation. Essentially besides being the main competitor to Wechat Pay (basically PYPL or SQ but more widespread, every single vendor in China and aims to serve Chinese customers will accept this), and also having the world's largest money management fund at one point from all the cash from their users that they put on the platform, they've loaned 2T+ RMB to individuals and small businesses (8/2 split). Which is about 300B. This is through two services called Jiebei and Huabei, essentially it's just like you doing cash withdrawal from your credit card but obviously, all of it is electronic at 18% interest per annum (which is high in China). Here's the thing, ANT started this whole thing with 3.8B RMB. They leveraged up 100x+ by selling tranched securities on their loans which they packaged. So ANT makes a shit ton of money, \"risk-free\" leveraged to the tits.\n\nANT ABS 1B RMB\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PUJvl0Q\n\nFor every billion they loan out, 0.95B is recovered through selling the A and B Tranch at 6.1% and 7.5% interest respectively. Ant makes the difference between that and 18%. And can repeat that so on as they still have money. Which means 1/0.05 = 20x from banks and the market. This became closer to 100x+ after they used subsidiaries and other financial maneuvers to buy their own C tranch.\n\n\nThis is why the Chinese government is seriously pissed, there is a huge fucking default bomb that could lead to sector collapse since ANT sold off these securities to asset management and banks, and then used the money they gained from the securities to make more loans and make more securities. Thereby repeating the cycle precisely because the fintech company wasn't regulated at the same standard as Chinese banks. Now Jack Ma has the balls to come in and criticize the very thing that made his business possible in the first place?\n\nA day after Jack Ma had the meeting with the big 4 regulatory agencies (Central Bank, SEC, Bank and Insurance Commission, and Foreign Exchange Commission), they released a draft of new legislation called  \u7f51\u7edc\u5c0f\u989d\u8d37\u6b3e\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u6682\u884c\u529e\u6cd5\n\nThere's no Official English but it means\n\n**Laws Regarding The Current Management of Small Online Loans** (Draft)\n\nAmong the new laws, the chief one is that companies cannot leverage over 1x via bank loans, and leverage up to 4x through securitization, as well as the fact that the loan originator needs to provide over 30% of the amount.\n\nSo the reason BABA is dipping so hard is that this immediately fucks up the valuation of ANT, they need a serious injection of cash to stay afloat with their current loans. Which was precisely the point of the IPO. If ANT is valued as a bank rather than a fintech company (and that's what regulations suggest), then they're fucked. Now I don't think this means BABA is going to nosedive, but there are going to be better opportunities considering the headline risk.\n\n**TLDR: My warning for anyone looking to buy the dip is that it's not as easy money as you think**\n\nPositions:\n\nAVOID BABA for at least the next month\n\nEdit: Since price action has been nothing but positive for the market in general, very short calls will probably print. There may be more bad news in the horizon. It is my belief that JD is a better position that is similar in nature.\n\nLONG JD (holding 12/18 80C/ 85C/ 90C)\n\n\nLink to Jack Ma Speech\n\nhttps://b23.tv/oT3Epm", "id": "jnycsf", "created_utc": 1604502667.0, "score": 395, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "It's a strange but welcome experience coming in here and finding intelligible information.", "score": 208, "replies": [{"body": "That's so sad.

He clearly doesn't understand the premise surrounding these concepts and that should make you question why he got to where he is today. Then once you understand that; realize that what was given over decades to him can be taken away in an instant. (China companies are an extension of the government; not the other way around.)\n\nThen you must ask yourself whether you want to gamble on a stock where one of its leaders is quite ignorant, uninformed, and arrogant. Even more concerning is that he decided to thumb his nose openly at Xi. (Arrogance and brilliance may work together quite well as evidenced by other successful entrepreneurs we have seen in the past. However, stupidity plus arrogance leads you to dangerous results. Especially China. ). \n\nI am sorry that your BABA calls are in the toilet and you feel you must attempt to emasculate me on this subreddit to make you feel better.

{"title": "Puts on Nigerian Scam", "selftext": "Jumia (JMIA) is an African tech company which operates an e-commerce marketplace and an online payment platform. People have tried to frame it as \u201cthe next Amazon\u201d or \u201cthe Amazon of Africa,\u201d but this stock is the definition of a Nigerian scam. It has tanked since IPO due to continued losses and fraud allegations which it basically admitted were true, but is recently pumping again due to its earnings call upcoming on November 10th in a pattern that mirrors almost exactly what happened around its last earnings call in August 2020.\n\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s an easy short\u2014\n\n**A) Clear pattern of pump and dump before earnings along with a history of fraud**\n\nInsane amounts of call buying from Robinhood idiots who think this company is African Amazon pumped this stock up > $20/sh before the last earnings report, and that pattern is repeating today, with the stock up 120% since October 1. Last I checked, the put/call ratio was like .5 or something, which is insane. Last time, a horrible earnings report crushed the stock, taking away all of the gains from the runup, and this is likely to happen again for reasons I will continue to detail below.\n\n(This is a bit autistic because TA/chart reading is bullshit, but the picture so far is copying exactly what happened last time-- huge spike, starts to dump, dead cat bounce that doesnt quite reach full peak (this is where we are), massive dump during earnings)\n\nAdditionally, Citron Research (lol) has come out with a $100 price target (lmfao) on the stock, parroting the simplistic narrative of \u201cthe next Amazon\u201d that appeals to these stupid Robintwats. This is especially hilarious because Citron was one of the first to call out \u201cthe company during its first post-IPO earnings report in 2019, with claims of fraud and \u201cmaterial discrepancies\u201d in its S1 filing. Just a few months later Jumia disclosed it had wrongly inflated its order volume by around $17.5 million due to some fraudulent orders, even though executives stated they had no impact on financial statements.\u201d\n\n(for context, this was about 5% of their sales in that quarter, although it probably ran deeper than what they admitted\u2014 Citron claimed 20-30% inflation initially)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/04/23/jumia-africas-failed-unicorn-is-hemorrhaging-millions/?sh=56268a5764e4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/04/23/jumia-africas-failed-unicorn-is-hemorrhaging-millions/?sh=56268a5764e4)\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious that Citron is pumping the stock to enter a short position at higher prices, which is a tactic they\u2019ve used before (look at RVLV they pumped its IPO)\u2014 inversing Citron has been a super profitable strategy for me over the years (especially shopify) and there's no reason to doubt this will continue.\n\n**B) Unsound business model in the long term**\n\n**Supply chain generally sucks, which makes e-commerce unprofitable even though its growing**\n\nUnreliable postal service and lack of formalized addresses, no large transportation companies that have optimized costs and have large last mile delivery systems (aka UPS/FedEx), difficulty and extra costs like tax/tariff for cross-border transactions, largely underbanked population so cash on delivery is main payment system (even JumiaPay is only used on 35% of orders on Jumia platform).\n\nThat\u2019s why the company has been consistently losing money on every order. Because of these losses, they will need to raise capital again within the next year to continue operating (less than 1y of working capital left based on its current cash burn) \u2014> this means share issuances and further dilution at best, bankruptcy at worst.\n\nYou have to be able to sustain massive losses to continue to grow in the African e-commerce market\u2014 Jumia is too small, and with its history of fraud will never be able to get the capital it needs to dominate and become the AMZN/MELI of Africa. More likely is that 10 years later when Africa is more developed and e-commerce is more profitable (or at least less unprofitable), Amazon itself and Alibaba will takeover.\n\n**The current addressable market is not as large as you think**\n\nOnly high income/upper middle income urban citizens who have access to bank accounts can currently be served, and due to income inequality and the rural/urban divide in Africa, this is not that many people.\n\nBecause of the large amount of defective products/counterfeits sold in Africa through Chinese drop-shipping scams, these consumers often like to touch products and see them/pay for them in person. This requires more fulfillment costs and less use of Jumia payment platform.\n\nAdditionally, there has been no COVID bump in Africa like every other e-commerce company had this year\u2014 in fact, GMV (total value of goods bought on platform) dropped 13% YoY last quarter and their guidance saw \u201ccontinued softness\u201d due to COVID\u2019s economic impact.\n\nBecause of the shitty supply chain and lack of rapid growth, Jumia has been exiting more countries in Africa than it has been entering (left Tanzania, Cameroon, Rwanda, Congo, Gabon, etc) as it just can\u2019t grow enough to justify losing as much money as it does. This is also tough for the only bright spot in the business, which is the fast growing JumiaPay. There are tons of competing payment platforms in Africa and in order to scale and compete against them, JumiaPay needs the networks effects from a successful e-commerce platform, which is not likely to materialize.\n\nQuarterly results on November 10 will catalyze the dump just like it did back in August, because the numbers will continue to show that Jumia is not growing all that fast (revenue/GMV may even drop again), and it is losing a lot of money while doing so.\n\n**C) Massive unrest in major market will affect future guidance**\n\nJumia\u2019s biggest market is Nigeria. If you haven\u2019t been reading the news, throughout October, there has been massive unrest in the country due to protests against police violence. Protestors blocked streets and destroyed buildings, troops were deployed and fired on people, and curfews were imposed.\n\nThis unrest likely delayed fulfillment of many orders, caused cancellations, and lowered economic activity/demand. The company will have to disclose how results have been affected in the upcoming earnings call guidance, which will be another reason the stock will sell off.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/nigeria-protests-whats-happening-and-why-are-people-demonstrating-11603277989?mod=rsswn](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nigeria-protests-whats-happening-and-why-are-people-demonstrating-11603277989?mod=rsswn)\n\n**TL;DR:** puts on Nigerian scams\n\n**My recommendation:** Use today\u2019s exceptionally green day to buy cheap put options on JMIA in preparation for the inevitable dump\n\n**Positions:** JMIA puts, 9-12 strikes\u2014 9/10 are the most liquid, 12+ is safer though", "id": "jo4n9t", "created_utc": 1604522839.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Dear Sirs, I write today for to curse on your head and inverse positions.

You\u2019d be right if the stock only falls to like $14 but stuff that pumps hard also dumps really hard (I could go into detail on hedging flows which is what cause that but just take me at my word for now). My argument is that this will dump to $10 or less after earnings, and that move will be big enough for options to print despite high IV (which really just means demand for the options are high AKA market is assuming a big move)\n\n2) if you\u2019re scared of IV crush, just buy spreads \u2014 way more profit than shorting calls and pocketing small premiums", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> go into detail on hedging flows which is what cause that but just take me at my word for now\n\nsmooth brain here, where can I learn about this?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m referring to option sellers hedging their positions by buying/selling the underlying stock.

If so, do you know any good websites to get this info?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "yes, what you're describing is all information that is found on the option chain (public data). Take JMIA for example:\n\n1. Low amount of OTM calls -- this means that option buyers aren't expecting the stock to rise significantly from here. no significant hedging impact from option sellers bc not a lot of volume.\n2. High amount of OTM puts -- big drop expected. OTM puts have low negative delta, which means you have to sell a little bit of stock to hedge a sold OTM put. If the stock price drops (which is what we're expecting from earnings), gamma, or how fast delta changes, comes into play. delta becomes a bit more negative, and you have to sell more stock to hedge. this drives the price lower, makes delta more negative, and you hedge by selling more, etc etc and you see how these hedging flows can make a small drop in stock price compound into a much larger move.\n3. High amount of ITM calls -- most of these calls which are currently in the money were probably bought when they were out of the money by the pumpers (some also bought by people who are protecting short positions from squeezes, which is also bearish for jumia). Hedging flows have followed as above, and as the stock price rose higher and higher, market makers bought more and more stock to hedge, which caused the gigantic pump on the stock chart. \n\nRight now, MMs are sitting on a bunch of JMIA stock, which they're holding to hedge the insane amount of call options bought to pump this stock. I wouldn't be surprised if they have already sold some/all of this into the strength we're seeing in the market. Then, market makers would profit greatly from the dump in JMIA around earnings because all the calls that they sold would expire and they'd keep the premium without losing money from their hedge (the stock) going down.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the details!
