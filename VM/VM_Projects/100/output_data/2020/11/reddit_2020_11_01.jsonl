It fell when news confirmed that not only was Tiktok leaving, they'd already left!  And not just their US traffic, but non-US as well.  That's bad, certainly.\n\nReasons why FSLY is poised for a sharp comeback:  \n\n* Tiktok was 10.8% of revenues, but the stock has dropped 50% from peak.  That's overdone.\n* Fastly has just 300 customers so far, in a market with tens of thousands of potential customers.\n* FSLY scores 100 on a cloud stock \"rule of 40\" metric (above 40 is a buy)\n* Fastly concentrates on \"high quality\" traffic, aka the more complex and higher margin.  If they had to, they could easily fall back to do commodity traffic as a contingency, but they're not there yet.\n* FSLY just shored up their gap in perceived security feature with a acquisition that's already accretive to profits.  \n* FSLY is giving turned-down, conservative guidance which can sometimes create a nice coiled spring reaction if they beat.  \n* Some of their recent Q's disappointment was due to \"timing issues\" which is code for customers who didn't get their programming done on time.  Presumably those customers will come on line soon.\n* Fastly's technology is hands down the most superior.  It's actually overkill for many customers, but you'd rather have tech that's best of breed than the other way around.\n* Fastly is just launching something nobody else has, which is seamless computing at the edge.

2004-2016, there has been an interesting pattern. Not to sound like a political hack, but in the past 4 election cycles, the market rallies after a Republican victory and dips after a Democratic victory. But /u/SyanWilmont, what about the 2000 election? [Remember retards, the 2000 election was very controversial because Floridaman both sucks at voting and sucks at counting.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore) After the 2000 election, Florida reported a margin of victory of less than 0.5% for Bush. Due to the uncertainty of who won in 2000, the market decides to dip. This is an important lesson to learn since this election will be very controversial. If there is no clear winner reported by Tuesday, expect the election to be contested in the same way as the 2000 election and therefore a blood red Tuesday. \n\nCircling back to what happens to the market if a Democrat/Republican wins, if Trump wins the election, expect a small rally on Wednesday since 1) the market likes a Republican victory and 2) we will have more of the same, something that the market likes: stability. However, if Biden wins, expect the market to dip. Like I said, I\u2019m not trying to be a political hack here, but based on the recent election cycles, a market dip always following a Democratic victory. To add more fuel to the fire, we all KNOW that Trump will NOT take the news of his defeat well at all. In my opinion, Biden barely winning the election is the worse case scenario for everyone in the short term. Republicans will absolutely contest the results of the election and Trump will not go down without a massive fight. In this scenario, stocks WILL go way down until after inauguration day, and even then I believe we will have civil unrest for a good while (Civil War 2 anybody?) However if Biden wins in a landslide, we will still experience a dip according to past market data. Of course, Trump and co will be angry but it\u2019ll definitely be not catastrophic as the \u201cBiden barely winning\u201d scenario. \n\nRegardless of who wins, I still expect the market to dip as the week continues. US COVID cases are rising and the Europoors are locking down. Play this week very carefully guys.\n\nTLDR: SELL EOD MONDAY, Cashgang/Beargang rest of the week.

For Democrats president, you should mainly play calls during his period. The FRB has enough money to cover the US depression and Powell will release the money regardless of whoever becomes the president and the FRB collects all money back later because there always be the deals between Powell and the US government to cover the economic fails. like, unleash the FRB to fund an unlimited amount of cash to banks and collect all that interest.
