It fell when news confirmed that not only was Tiktok leaving, they'd already left!  And not just their US traffic, but non-US as well.

That's overdone.\n* Fastly has just 300 customers so far, in a market with tens of thousands of potential customers.\n* FSLY scores 100 on a cloud stock \"rule of 40\" metric (above 40 is a buy)\n* Fastly concentrates on \"high quality\" traffic, aka the more complex and higher margin.  If they had to, they could easily fall back to do commodity traffic as a contingency, but they're not there yet.\n* FSLY just shored up their gap in perceived security feature with a acquisition that's already accretive to profits.  \n* FSLY is giving turned-down, conservative guidance which can sometimes create a nice coiled spring reaction if they beat.  \n* Some of their recent Q's disappointment was due to \"timing issues\" which is code for customers who didn't get their programming done on time.  Presumably those customers will come on line soon.\n* Fastly's technology is hands down the most superior.  It's actually overkill for many customers, but you'd rather have tech that's best of breed than the other way around.\n* Fastly is just launching something nobody else has, which is seamless computing at the edge.

2004-2016, there has been an interesting pattern. Not to sound like a political hack, but in the past 4 election cycles, the market rallies after a Republican victory and dips after a Democratic victory. But /u/SyanWilmont, what about the 2000 election? [Remember retards, the 2000 election was very controversial because Floridaman both sucks at voting and sucks at counting.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore) After the 2000 election, Florida reported a margin of victory of less than 0.5% for Bush. Due to the uncertainty of who won in 2000, the market decides to dip. This is an important lesson to learn since this election will be very controversial. If there is no clear winner reported by Tuesday, expect the election to be contested in the same way as the 2000 election and therefore a blood red Tuesday. \n\nCircling back to what happens to the market if a Democrat/Republican wins, if Trump wins the election, expect a small rally on Wednesday since 1) the market likes a Republican victory and 2) we will have more of the same, something that the market likes: stability. However, if Biden wins, expect the market to dip. Like I said, I\u2019m not trying to be a political hack here, but based on the recent election cycles, a market dip always following a Democratic victory. To add more fuel to the fire, we all KNOW that Trump will NOT take the news of his defeat well at all. In my opinion, Biden barely winning the election is the worse case scenario for everyone in the short term. Republicans will absolutely contest the results of the election and Trump will not go down without a massive fight. In this scenario, stocks WILL go way down until after inauguration day, and even then I believe we will have civil unrest for a good while (Civil War 2 anybody?) However if Biden wins in a landslide, we will still experience a dip according to past market data. Of course, Trump and co will be angry but it\u2019ll definitely be not catastrophic as the \u201cBiden barely winning\u201d scenario. \n\nRegardless of who wins, I still expect the market to dip as the week continues. US COVID cases are rising and the Europoors are locking down. Play this week very carefully guys.\n\nTLDR: SELL EOD MONDAY, Cashgang/Beargang rest of the week.

For Democrats president, you should mainly play calls during his period. The FRB has enough money to cover the US depression and Powell will release the money regardless of whoever becomes the president and the FRB collects all money back later because there always be the deals between Powell and the US government to cover the economic fails. like, unleash the FRB to fund an unlimited amount of cash to banks and collect all that interest.

{"title": "Bloomberg: The US stock market could be headed for a lost decade", "selftext": "\"When the history of the modern financial era is written, there\u2019s one comment that\u2019s almost certain to merit inclusion: \u201cStocks only go up!\u201d\n\nSports-blogger turned day-trader Dave Portnoy\u2019s pithy observation this summer was designed to both amuse and provoke. But if you\u2019ve put money into U.S. stocks since the market bottomed out in 2009, the chances are you think Portnoy is basically correct.\u00a0Plenty of professional asset managers would concur.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the most important question for those considering investing savings today, when stocks are by some metrics among the most expensive they\u2019ve ever been, is whether Portnoy\u2019s philosophy is about to be turned on its head. In other words: \u201cwhat if stocks don\u2019t always go up?\u201d\n\nThere are reasons to think this fantastic period for the U.S. stock market might soon be followed by a prolonged hangover, possibly lasting a decade or more. Such a stretch of disappointing equity returns would have profound implications for millennials and generation Z.\u00a0The standard advice around financial planning and retirement saving that\u2019s worked so well lately \u2014\u00a0put your money in an index fund that tracks the market and forget about it \u2014\u00a0might no longer work so well.\n\nIn the past decade, investors who bought an index fund that mirrors\u00a0the S&P 500 Index and reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 13%\u00a0average annual return, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nEven a deadly global pandemic that\u2019s triggered a deep\u00a0recession and widespread unemployment only briefly interrupted the ascendancy of U.S. stocks. The Federal Reserve rode to the rescue once more, and the S&P 500 hit fresh record highs (though lately investors have since grown cautious again).\nYoung investors\u00a0may conclude that bumper returns are all but guaranteed in the years ahead. If only steadily rising stock prices were always the case.\nConsider the FTSE 100, an index of some of Britain\u2019s preeminent pharmaceutical, energy, mining and consumer goods companies. In price terms (ignoring the impact of reinvesting dividends for a second), the U.K. benchmark is lower now than it was two decades ago. It\u2019s not alone.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark also remains beneath its dot-com-era peak while the MSCI emerging markets index topped out in 2007 and has yet to recover. The market that really refutes Portnoy\u2019s assertion though is Japan: The Nikkei 225 index remains about 40% below its 1989 peak, when a massive financial bubble burst.\n\n\"Stocks Only Go Up\"?\n\nFollowing a financial bubble Japanese investors suffered years of poor returns\n\nCould the U.S. market face a similar fate? There\u2019ve been bleak periods before, most famously in the two decades that followed the 1929\u00a0Wall Street crash.\n\nLong Hangover\n\nU.S. stocks took a long time to recover from the 1929 Wall Street crash\n\nAs recently as 2012 the S&P 500 was below its 2000 peak. Value-orientated asset managers like GMO\u2019s Jeremy Grantham think\u00a0something similar could happen again, but it\u2019s not just well-known Cassandras who worry. Hedge fund\u00a0billionaire Ray Dalio\u00a0of Bridgewater Associates and Blackstone\u2019s vice chairman Tony James\u00a0have both warned about a\u00a0\u201clost decade\u201d\u00a0for equity investors.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019d followed GMO\u2019s advice in 2013 to steer clear of American large-cap stocks and load up on emerging market shares, you\u2019d have missed out on seven years of stellar returns.\u00a0So what\u2019s different now?\n1. Extreme valuations\nEquity\u00a0valuations have grown even more extreme. During the pandemic, they have become completely divorced from economic fundamentals thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s largess.\u00a0A stock market bubble pulls forward expected returns from the future, setting investors up for probable disappointment later on. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly when past returns are most glorious that future prospects are most dismal,\u201d investor John Hussman, another famously bearish investment manager\u00a0wrote recently. He\u2019s described today\u2019s menu of choices for passive, long-term investors as\u00a0\u201cthe worst in history.\u201d\n\nExpensive Stocks\n\nU.S stock valuations aren't at dotcom era levels, but they're certainly not cheap\n\nThe CAPE ratio uses a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings to smooth out short-term noise\n\n2. Ultra-low interest rates\nLow interest rates are often portrayed as bullish for stocks because\u00a0they boost the value of future corporate cash flows in today\u2019s money and reduce the cost of servicing\u00a0debt. But with U.S. short-term\u00a0rates now at zero, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to juice the stock market. Ultra-low rates also reflect pessimism about future economic prospects. \u201cWhen real rates are low, future returns on equities and bonds tend to be lower rather than higher,\u201d Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton wrote in Credit Suisse\u2019s\u00a02020\u00a0compendium of past market returns. \u201cInvestors should assume a sober view of the likely excess returns equities can generate from here.\u201d\n3. Profit margin reversion\nA key determinant of equity returns, profit margins have been unusually high over the past couple of decades. But corporate profits have now suffered a massive hit due to the pandemic. Even without the virus, those oversize\u00a0earnings should eventually dwindle as competitors spy an opportunity. Monopoly power may hinder this, but dominant tech companies are\u00a0starting to face more competition\u00a0and stricter antitrust enforcement. Globalization is also\u00a0in retreat and workers are demanding are a fairer split of the rewards of capitalism.\n4. An aging population\nThis is often considered a key reason for Japan\u2019s prolonged stock market slump.\u00a0Although the U.S. is aging less rapidly, the demographic changes underway are bound to have an impact on future equity returns. An aging population may be less productive, lowering potential economic growth. Furthermore, by 2030 the large and asset-rich U.S. baby boomer generation will all be over the age of 65, and they may need to cut their exposure to risky stocks or sell financial assets to fund their retirement, weighing on prices.\n\nWhile this all sounds bleak, it\u2019s some comfort that over the very long term stocks have tended to go up. In nominal terms, one dollar invested in the U.S. market in 1900 was worth $58,000 by 2019, according to the Credit Suisse market returns study, or an annualized 6.5% return when adjusted for inflation.\u00a0In the meantime, there are a few things young investors can do\u00a0to avoid being caught out by a duff decade for U.S. stocks.\nFor starters, if returns are lower I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll also need to save more to build wealth. Consider adding some exposure to non-U.S. equities, which may at last be due a period of outperformance relative to the U.S. And by reinvesting dividends you can still obtain decent returns even if stock prices go nowhere. (The FTSE 100 has fallen 19% since the turn of the millennium, but investors who reinvested dividends received a 63% return in that period.)\nHopefully, the gloomy scenario I\u2019ve painted won\u2019t materialize and U.S. companies will develop new technologies that power the economy and the stock market to new heights in the next decade. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, you\u2019ll be prepared.\"\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-31/personal-finance-what-if-stocks-don-t-always-go-up-advice-for-young-investors\n\n\u00a0", "id": "jm5gzw", "created_utc": 1604249498.0, "score": 557, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 261, "comments": [{"body": "I like the silver lining at the end, \u201c$1 invested in 1900 is worth $58000 now.\u201d Wow if only I had invested back then...", "score": 297, "replies": [{"body": "I would\u2019ve just had to start investing 96 years before I was born, sad that I didn\u2019t have that kind of foresight", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Or you could've invested when you were 4 and lived life like a king in 2120", "score": 45, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6776259541511536}, {"body": "Or you can think in terms of what kind of legacy you could leave to your descendants with a tiny bit of personal sacrifice", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Impossible, that would require me to think more than 5 seconds into the future", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "exactly! the furthest into the future i've ever thought about is the beginning of next earnings season.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39355573058128357}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17733971774578094}, {"body": "Honestly, this is why I heavily invest, I often tell my wife it isn\u2019t us that will benefit, it will be our grand children and great grandchildren.
