{"title": "Palantir Valuation - Opening the Black Box", "selftext": "This is a crosspost from r/wallstreetbets but thought you guys might like it too. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it  would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.\n\nI can't post images here so you can go to the wsb post or the link at the bottom to see images. Disclosure, am long $PLTR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Palantir  Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and  powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients\n* PLTR  has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government,  particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military\n* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients\n* With   \\~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future   opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a   binary outcome to us. Will they or won\u2019t they bring more customers on  to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company\u2019s outlook,  and  as a result, valuation, significantly\n\n**Company Background and Summary:**  Palantir\u2019s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its \u201cfull  stack\u201d approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**   controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a   partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,   existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a   one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which   will be key in its growth as a company.\n\nPLTR\u2019s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.\n\n**Gotham:**  Palantir\u2019s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives  in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify  patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute  responses.\n\n**Foundry:**  This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their  data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large  datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily  targeted to commercial customers.\n\nDespite  having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer  and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach  they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC)  has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019.  The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of  revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR\u2019s ability to  prove  and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR   platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,   integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,   enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \\~AI\\~ among others.\n\nThe  revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year  2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this   revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**   \u2013 mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131   at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and   operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual   for a company in high growth mode.\n\n**Palantir\u2019s Business Model:**  PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement  from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long,  with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running.  Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the  project. PLTR\u2019s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and  Scale.\n\nAcquire  \u2013 PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little  to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing  ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire  phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in   revenue in a calendar year.\n\nExpand  \u2013 This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in  revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those  generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having  negative contribution margin throughout the same period.\n\nScale  \u2013 With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company\u2019s  ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy.  Palantir\u2019s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and  configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use  on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.\n\n**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:**  Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up  analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and  government sectors.\n\nCompany  management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial  customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial  companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying  $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies  PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.\n\nFor  government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their  assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US  and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT  spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has  penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market.\n\nSell-side  estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down   methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to   Palantir\u2019s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM   levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% \u2013 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.\n\n**Government services:**  Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the  results of a recent lawsuit \u2013  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against  the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available  products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In  1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in  FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as  the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large  customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its  attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is  unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US  government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into  commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme  for future  cross-selling opportunities.\n\nGovernment  contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at  least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has  indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts  totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the  funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little  certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent  potential upside to our estimates.\n\n**Commercial services:**  In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform \u2013 a centralized data  OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to  manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the  commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and  leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.\n\nWith  ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful  opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales  cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR\u2019s  complexity,  but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can  grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and  becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its  customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater   than 20% of total commercial revenue.\n\nWhile  the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over  the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in  growth software \u2013 131 (including government entities). Today,  product  market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off  situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated  around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial  services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial  segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a  few contracts per quarter and year.\n\n**Quarterly Earnings recap:**  Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public  company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as  revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most  impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019.  Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter.\n\nThe  company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the  full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of  app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market   fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these   solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers   in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a   not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a   customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be   crucial in diversifying the customer base.\n\nAdjusted  operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a  year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater  efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to  generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force  and account management teams.\n\n**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:**  Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates.  Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a  premium.\n\nThis was post-IPO and no longer relevant\n\nFor  core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth  estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range  of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently  trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables  market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake).  Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV /  Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant  premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the  total of both trading multiples.\n\nHowever, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR\u2019s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.\n\nThese  two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue   visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does   the stock deserve its premium?\n\n**Valuation:**  We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this  company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF  multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in  2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e  FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.\n\nWe lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:\n\n* Number of **net** customer adds \u2013 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025\n* Avg.   Revenue per Customer growth \u2013 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.   From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e\n* Gross Margin % \u2013 a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter\n* Opex Margin % \u2013 a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter\n* Capital Expenditures \u2013 continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex\n* Free   Cash Flow Multiple \u2013 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth   software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS   multiples\n\nFor  purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid  of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As  you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from   customers has a very large effect on the calculation.\n\nThen,  depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on   different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range   of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the  FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an  equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \\~$3 to the  stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin  similarly adds  \\~$3.\n\n**Key Risks:**  Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one  of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a  massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary  opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this  company\u2019s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within  large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high  costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter\u2019s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.**\n\nCustomer  concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made  some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the  largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the  first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.\n\nCompetition  is significant. PLTR\u2019s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it  at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some  organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and  would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools  from other software companies outside of PLTR.\n\nRecent  and near-term expected hiring doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in   significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20   and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing   this decline.\n\nPalantir  is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now  hitting it\u2019s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the  company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash  flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the  company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical   quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more   information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of   the business appropriately.\n\n**Key catalysts:**\n\nIncreased  commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is  able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow  solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the  addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In   addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability   than we have currently modeled.\n\nThe  company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous  delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the  main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by  Apollo and more \u2018productized\u2019 offering have  resulted a lowered average  implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.\n\n**TLDR;**  Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play.  Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of  company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with  its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read  and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.\n\nIf you want to play with the model, I tried to keep it as simple as possible you can download it here at the bottom of the page for free: \n\n[https://millennialmkts.com/2020/11/22/palantir-valuation-opening-the-black-box/](https://millennialmkts.com/2020/11/22/palantir-valuation-opening-the-black-box/)", "id": "k08f2v", "created_utc": 1606235920.0, "score": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "Reading their products page it seems more like a services company than a software company..

Read on Palantir's Glassdoor. Was submitted two months ago:\n\n\"**Recent layoffs have most questioning the direction and effectiveness of leadership. Many of my friends on events, recruiting, and operations were laid off without notice. I heard they lost access to their laptops same day without being able to hand off work or say goodbye. Leadership said \u201cdownsizing\u201d was due to decreased hiring goals but they let go some of the best who I know had active work. Individuals who started long before me that were here 5-10 yrs. A lot of top performers that made positive change at Palantir in advocating for diversity and working with engineering. They laid off leads but kept newer hires. The logic seems to be about short term bottom line. Most of us can\u2019t wrap our heads around how they picked who they did unless it\u2019s in preparation for an exit. My recruiter friends told me even the recruiters feel the same. No one knows who\u2019s next. Leadership said at a townhall that they worked with the downsized individuals looking for other positions they could rotate to but I heard this isn\u2019t true. When leadership is repeatedly asked about diversity, female leadership, and the lay offs, nothing gets a real answer. They sent an email about the recruiting layoffs with reasoning that didn\u2019t tie to the people that were let go. Growing tired of the same old story.
