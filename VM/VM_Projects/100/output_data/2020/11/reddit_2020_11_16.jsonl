BABA probably gonna make you sweat, though...\n\nIt really does feel like you've mastered the risk:reward on this.

More?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "100% understand what you are trying to say, but one thing you have to remember is that if you are wheeling or selling puts on FSLY it also means you should be comfortable owning 100 shares of the stock.\n\nThe next thing about your scenario is that if you sold puts at the very top, which is unrealistic, but might happen who knows, you are still better off owning the shares after being assigned from a failed CSP instead of just having bought the shares outright. For example, lets say the top for FSLY was $100. If you bought shares at the very top at $100 and the stock drops to $70. You are down $30 per share. If you sold a put for $5 that means your break-even was $95 and now you are owning the shares with a cost basis of $95 instead of $100 (still saved 5%).\n\nLastly, lets say you did an earnings yolo and the stock got smoked, which it did. The implied volatility from earnings would have offset an even greater amount. Using the example above you probably could have sold the option for double, so your cost basis is $90 instead of $100 vs buying the shares outright.\n\nIn the end I like to think of it as this. If I am selling a CSP it means I am willing and should expect to own the shares. In the scenario you mentioned, will probably take 2-3 weeks to re-collect your premium and regain profitability. FSLY dropped 12% on earnings from $72 to $63 two weeks ago and it's already back above the pre-earnings price sitting at $77 right now!

Reason for this is that the call option you just sold(sell to open) will depreciate in premium only when the underlying stock drops in price. some people think it's best to sell calls when underlying stock price has dropped(for call spread, that is) but this is a big mistake. You care most about the premium at the time you are selling(assuming it's a naked call or covered call, or bull call spread)). The call option price will be high (hence your profit from selling will too be high) when the underlying price is high. assuming everything else is the same for IV and other factors, you want to sell a call with large enough delta that has had a recent run up in price and you think it will go down relatively soon before the expiration(if you are hoping to cash out due to burst shot up of underlying, it's best to buy the call back before expiration. reason for this is mainly if you are selling in the money calls in hopes to catch a quick drop in price, then buy it back for half of your original premium received, you don't want to risk holding it anywhere near expiration because there is much higher chance of being assigned for deep in the money calls.) Deep inthemoney calls will have highest delta, and so with slight movement of underlying will cause teh call price to drop pretty fast, hence you can go in selling, athen quickly cash out when it's cheaper, by buy to close(i.e. buying back the option you had sold). \n\nFYI. You can also lower risk even further if you do this with a leap call: Reason: out of the money(around 5% to but less than 10% otm call leaps have higher deltas than ITM calls(unless ITM for more than 10%, then ITM call leaps have higher delta). So you have two things going for you if you are selling calls, uncovered, or even convered, but want to keep that stock, yet be able to reap premium by selling calls on it): its OTM and therefore it will not get assigned. It's call leaps and so even if it did \"go up in price, and work against your intention, you have plenty of time to let it drop in price before you need to worry about getting assigned. Only thing is your theta, time decay will do nothing for you - but this strategy isn't about hoping to benefit from time decay in the first place.) You can do this with put options too, which can be very goo d if you want to own the underlying anyway at discounted price, but also benefit from selling puts, then wait for its price to drop, then buy it back for 50% profit. Things to note: Put options work inverse of call options(mathematically, it's literally an inverse function). Therefore, delta for puts work inversed; PUT leaps do not move much at all when the underlying stock moves. It's same for ITM or OTM put leaps. SO do not sell put leaps in hopes for quick premium depreciation, so that you can buy back cheaper. It usually takes underlying to move 3 or 4 points before the put leap premium will even start moving. So for the discussed strategy, using puts, you want to sell 90day or under puts. You want to sell puts when the stock has recently just dropped in price by decent amount(on the same day/hour of price drop). then you will buy it back when underlying has increased, and therefore, put premium has dropped. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings to note; I think selling put options is easier for the said strategy because it goes \"WITH THE GRAIN\" of how stock prices work: stock price will generally be going up for any given Radom day, more than price drop. Hence, you can expect the put premium to drop with relatively high confidence, given reasonable period of time, say a 2-3months. You do however have to wait for the right day to sell, since stocks dont drop 5% or more very often. Also, with put options, in worst case scenario, if you sell put on a stock you want to own, if things go sour, you will end up with a stock for a discount!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nlastly: you want to consider gamma - rate of change of delta. if that call or put you sell have high gamma, you want to make sure you buy it back(cash out) before the delta has moved away from your originally favored delta value. Example: you sell a call with delta of .7 with high gamma. your stock dropped in price, so you made 30% gain. Now, you want to wait until you can get 50% profit: you must make sure the delta is still in your favor: because if it had high gamma to begin with, then with relatively decent underlying price change will push the call's delta pretty far out, say 0.5 or less, and so being able to wait to earn that next 20% profit will take much longer (because with say a delta of 0.4, for every dollar move, your call premium will only drop by 0.4 or 40cents on a dollar). \n\nIf you are serious about options trading, I don't think this is the right place to learn. I think it's great to use this platform as \"supplemental, feedback, support, but its best you don't jump around and learn this strategy that strategy at random. Try to pick a book and read all of it reason being is that you will have a full picture where its total sum is greater than it's parts. \n\nBut then again, i myself is a newbie as I have only been learning /trading options for 1 month. But once I studied and tried to understand the entire picture and why option price work the way they do, for both call and puts, learning the details of the actual strategies came in matter of days.  whereas before that, i kept jumping from website to site, YouTube video on options here and there, and I just felt like I was barely making trades but never felt very comfortable.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05962374433875084}, {"body": "ONE key point to consider on this said strategy of selling then closing out for quick profit of 50% or more: : While I too use the said strategy of selling then waiting for option premium to drop , then buying it back, remember this: \n\nIf you can monitor the underlying price everyday in hopes to cash out of options for a quick profit, it's best you do with the actual stock. Think about it: to buy 100 shares of that stock on a intraday margin would be  pretty affordable as long as you pick a volatile stock, then if the underlying drops by just 2 dollars, you'll gain 200$ profit. No commission fee. YOU don't want to day trade with options: reason: to day trade an option, you are always looking for an option with high delta, since it has to move fast in accordance to the underlying stock. Which option /asset has the highest delta? The underlying stock, of course- it has a delta of1. no option has delta of 1 unless really deep ITM, at which point, it will cost you around 60-75% of underlying plus commission. In addition if you day trade stock, you can trade through extended hours. one risk of option day trading is, you cannot do anything if some bad news happens and causes your option to move towards losing direction. Again, i understand trading underlying may require more capital but not really unless you are selling naked calls only).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.047865256667137146}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06482469290494919}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3843812644481659}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2860458493232727}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.006065698340535164}, {"body": "Anticipated move is 22%.

Over all the trades of this type, not just any one trade?\n\nOnly you can know since it depends on the entire series of trades you will make since any one trade, in isolation, will always look 'good'. Keep all the risks low, and get the highest premium and you can be fine because on the one you get hit your prior gains will cover you, and then some. Misprice your trades or risks a little, and yeah, you've done a lot of work for a loss. And if luck wants to bite you in the ass, a big loss early on.\n\nTo put the most basic analysis around the above if your 'real' ROI is 2% and you can box risk so that you 'win' 51/52 times (and actually have the opportunity to play 50+ times) you make a small profit. Same ROI but your win rate is 50/52? Big negative return. In either scenario what happens if the losing trade is your second trade? You may not live for tomorrow.\n\nAlso, do not rely on the brokerage's canned probabilities, do your own diligence and analysis.\n\nGL\n\n\\[TLDR\\]  Bottom line for me, to do these trades properly requires a strategy that involves significant time commitment and a high number of trades. As such I can get better returns on my time, brainpower, and capital elsewhere. The very few times I have done this trade have been highly opportunistic and usually part of a larger trade in a stock I know well with even lower than average probabilities of being breached than the norm for this type of trade.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recovery"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Risk is huge but I like it.

Palantir powers a software platform used by Airbus (Skywise) that is slowly making waves in the industry. The predictive analytics they offer have already saved our company massive sums, and they aren\u2019t even in their \u2018final form\u2019 so to speak (developers still working on validating and integrating all of our aircraft data and implementing the necessary monitoring systems on our entire fleet). Legacies especially were quite resistant to their software and have been working (as was my airline) for years to develop something similar, but the Skywise platform is just so intuitive, relatively easy to implement, and demonstrably effective (especially as more airlines adopt and more data is collected) that it will more likely than not be a game changer, if it isn\u2019t one already.\n\nThis is something our company has struggled to do for years. A lot of our systems and software are homebrew and because of high turnover it turned into a sort of Frankenstein\u2019s monster, complicating the already insanely difficult task of bringing all of our data together and using it to manage scheduled maintenance while still anticipating and accounting for unscheduled maintenance, all within the confines of a busy flight schedule and bare minimum spares and manpower investment. Upon adopting the Foundry/SkyWise platform, within a year, Palantir/Airbus/our developers solved a problem that had been stumping us for a decade. \n\nI can imagine a million scenarios and systems within our industry and out where a similar platform could produce similar effects, and have been long PLTR since the moment I heard they were IPO\u2019ing.

You can then sell the contract to close the position and make money off the trade. \n\nThe same thing is true for puts. A put is when you think the stock is going down. If you think the stock will decrease then you are long on puts. Meaning you BUY a put. (We will not get into shorting/selling contracts here because they are extremely dangerous to gamble with). Let's say the price of the stock BA (Boeing) is at $195 and your strike price is $190, as the stock price decreases towards that strike price, your contract will go up in price and you can then sell the options trade for a profit.\n\nThat's the basics and there's plenty of free resources out there to learn more.

From an old AskReddit post:\n\n> I worked at Boeing for about 1.5 years in the 2008-9 time period and I can absolutely guarantee this happened.\n\n> First, Boeing's corporate culture is the worst shitshow I have ever experienced. All large corporations have a lot of internal issues and problems but nothing like the Lazy B. It was like working in a company designed by Kafka. I signed up at Boeing as a programmer. When I showed up at my first day of work, the first words out of my supervisor's mouth were, \"I don't know why you are here, we have no need for programmers.\" (The Boeing interview process is done so that at no point, do you ever have contact or communication with the team you will be working with.)\n\n> So, basically, I was cutting and pasting cells in Excel spreadsheets and doing ad hoc project management during my time there. They did have need for a programmer, but I didn't have access to install any programming software on my machine because no one knew who the local IT person was. No one. It was a year before I was able to figure that out and only because I was bored one day and was walking around the building and found the guy's cubicle by accident.\n\n> To be fair, the aging aircraft division that I was in was notoriously bad, even for Boeing. It was where they put people that the union wouldn't let Boeing fire. I would conservatively estimate 30% of my co-workers were full-blown sociopaths who would actively work to sabotage and ruin other people's work. Another 50% of the people there blatantly goofed off all day, reading the newspaper or books with their feet up on their desks (literally). The remaining 20% were people who actually cared about airplane passengers not dying and worked themselves half to death to keep things afloat. I'll give a quick shout out to Anastasia, James and all the contract workers who actually did their jobs. There are probably a few thousand people around the world who aren't dead because of you.\n\n> Anyhow, James (or was it Jim? It's been a while.) was a grouchy old engineer they stuck me next to. He was close to retirement and clearly wasn't too stoked about losing half his cubicle to an unwanted programmer that showed up one day. James had a bunch of photos of an old 747 and structural diagrams pinned to his cubicle wall. One day, I asked what those were.\n\n> They were pictures and failure analysis diagrams of\u00a0JAL 123, the single worst single airplane disaster in history. 520 people died. It was because a couple of Boeing engineers fucked up. That 747SR had had a tailstrike incident on takeoff that damaged the rear pressure dome. A team of Boeing AOG (Airplane On the Ground) mechanics were flown out there to fix it. To oversimplify, they rushed and accidentally did the equivalent of 1+1=1 on one of their stress calculations. It was an error very similar to the infamous\u00a0Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. 12,318 flights later, (well before what should have been at least 25-30,000 flight cycles that the crack inspection cycle would have assumed) the rear bullkhead ripped out mid flight and severed all hydraulic control lines. The plane lost all control and flew in a rollercoaster trajectory for 32 minutes before running into the side of a mountain. Many of the passengers had time to write goodbye letters to their loved ones. James had those photos and diagrams on his cubicle so that every day, he could look at them and remind himself of why his job was important and why he couldn't cut corners.\n\n> James was clearly an incredibly knowledgeable and talented engineer. He was the widely acknowledged expert in the entire department. If any other engineer had a question, they would always come to him for advice. So why was such a good engineer relegated to a department full of fuckups and malcontents? Because he wouldn't cut corners on safety.\n\n> This was the final stages of the 787 rollout, which was behind schedule and full of issues. James had constantly raised red flags about safety corners Boeing was cutting on the 787 rollout. Things like putting the plane out before there was a good understanding of crack propagation speed, nondestructive testing protocols and repair protocols for all the carbon fiber on the plane. These were extremely serious issues that Boeing swept under the rug to get the 787 out faster. Because he wouldn't toe the line on this, James got exiled to the shitty little backwater I ran into him at, where he was counting the days until he could retire and spend his time SCUBA diving out at Edmonds.\n\n> To this day, I refuse to fly on a 787. I'm sure that the Dreamliners that came off the assembly line after about a year or so were fine but there's that first year of production that, as far as I'm concerned, are ticking time bombs. I talked to many engineers who had worked on that program to know just how badly they rushed that initial production.\n\n> So, as far as I'm concerned, fuck Boeing. This was inevitable.
