As BTC has risen in price, it also became increasingly more risky to invest in. The higher its price goes, the further it can fall.

As the game goes on and the blinds increase, you\u2019re dealt a 2-7 off-suit hand. Despite this, you feel compelled to make the most of the surmounting blinds. You bluff big pre-flop, hoping to wean your opponents away from their undoubtedly superior cards. But they call your bluff and raise it, forcing you to fold.  \n\nEven though all you stood to gain was the ante, the game\u2019s imminent conclusion had you backed into a corner and forced you to bluff. Because the only moves in poker are check, bet, and fold, its easy to see why playing from a position of strength can be a major asset to help secure future gains.

{"title": "Just like $MCD is a real estate co., who happens to sell burgers; RKT is a tech company who happens to sell mortgages.", "selftext": "Good Afternoon,\n\nHow are my beaten-down RKT retards feeling after the ass pounding this past week? I am fairing fine because mentally I knew this was going to happen, which is why I've carried a giant bottle of lube around in preparation for this recent \"packing of thy fudge\" if you will.\n\nBut if you disappointed RKT retards want to feel better about your torn-apart assholes, then I encourage you to click the link below:\n\n[https://www.nexsystech.com/](https://www.nexsystech.com/)\n\nNexsys is in the Rocket FOC (family of companies); they offer two revolutionary products:\n\nClear Sign - this is a digital platform that is on par with Docusign's product - you know Docusign, the over $40B dollar company whose sole purpose is to digitally sign documents THE SAME way that the Clear Sign platform allows lenders to engage in Eclosings. Clear Sign is tailored for the mortgage industry - it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all digital signing package from a company who doesn\u2019t know mortgage closings from mini marts. Eclosings, outside of RKT are very rare but will soon be the industry standard providing immense growth for this product which is already certified for legal use in 25 states (will soon be all 50 states).\n\nThe next product is:\n\nNexsys clear HOI- This technology platform makes it easier to connect insurers and mortgage lenders (yes they are selling this to their competitors). It is a one-stop homeowners insurance verification site that streamlines and automates the process.\n\nNexsys is also going to launch another product for lenders (again, their competitors) which will pull insurance information from a direct API into your LOS or use Nexsys' online portal. It\u2019s connected to any insurer in the network, and real-time updates can be made in seconds rather than days. The product will allow for users to initiate policy updates such as mortgagee changes and effective date changes with their APIs or portal.\n\nNexsys is offering another product, aimed at insurers, which will enable insurers to do the following:\n\n* Free up agents\u2019 time, call center inquiries and B2B, portal maintenance by automating third-party requests; Kick the processes and expenses that don\u2019t generate business to the curb.\n* Communicate to your lenders with consistency. Insurers message and your policy information are sent using the same format every time, eliminating potential data input errors and other delays.\n\nWhy is this important you ask? Well if you are retarded enough to buy RKT at $30, then you are probably retarded enough to not understand why this is eye opening.\n\nRKT is selling their products TO THEIR COMPETITORS - which tells you where RKT's true focus lies: technology, NOT mortgages and if you don't think they will continue to invent and sell more industry-disrupting products like this, then you are highly mistaken.... and retarded. Also there is a big focus on helping insurers with these products - what company does BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY own in insurance?  GEICO - this is a platform not only for mortgages but will also be used for auto. Hmm I wonder who ROCKETS big partnership will be with, which they are waiting until early 2021 to unveil... I also wonder the secret company Warren Buffett is investing in and chose not to disclose in the filing of last quarter's 13F.....\n\nJay Farner said it himself in an interview with CitiBank: we are a technology and marketing company that happens to also sell mortgages (I will do another write up on their digital marketing tech which they also sell B2B).\n\nThe fact that RKT is willing to sell their tech to competitors is eye opening - and if you notice none of the Wall Street analysts talk about this. They think RKT is just a mortgage company.\n\nThere is an information edge here that the market does not realize. For example, those of you who invested in RKT, did you know they were selling disrupting tech to their competitors? Probably not... and neither does the majority of the market.\n\nTheir tech provides simple, fast and trusted digital solutions for COMPLEX personal transactions. Millennials, who will soon make up the majority of the market, do not like anything complex. And this is why they constantly innovate, to satisfy the needs of their customers (dumb ass millenials). They've been leveraging decades of technology investment and innovation to drive industry disruption and deliver an unmatched customer experience in the largest consumer asset class in the us, supported by 3 percent annual home price appreciation \\*knocks on wood\\*\n\nAlso if you haven't listened to Farner's confrence with Citi, check it out, it is worth a listen. Enjoy your weekend fellow bag holders - and know your bag will only get lighter. Eh who knows maybe we are all fucked and should have just invested in EV instead.\n\n[https://kvgo.com/citifintech/rocket-companies-november-2020](https://kvgo.com/citifintech/rocket-companies-november-2020)\n\nTLDR: suck my balls if you can't read what I took time out of my day to write.\n\nEDIT: r/ \n\nlevel 1[UBCStudent9929](https://www.reddit.com/user/UBCStudent9929/) fucks his sister \n\nAlso I have 8,000 shares at $19.53  \n ", "id": "jyeyu8", "created_utc": 1605980681.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Just like Instagram is a tech companies that happens to sell soft-core pornography and hooker services", "score": 166, "replies": [{"body": "WeWork?

The question is who will be on the hook for the thousands owed by renters?\n\n\u201cSince the order does not cancel or freeze rent, all of the tenant's back rent will be due come January 1.

Meanwhile there are tons of companies hiring right now: Amazon, Target, Costco, Kroger, Unilever, Facebook , Phillips, GSK, Wells Fargo, UnitedHealthGroup, Spectrum, Anheuser-Busch and more.\n\nFor the month of October, there were approximately 638,000 job openings. In terms of the unemployment rate, the rate had dropped to 6.9% back in the month of September.

Hell if I was a renter, knowing I could get away with this, I would sit on my ass and live rent free for as long as the government would let me. This gives them no incentive to try. Meanwhile no entrepreneurs will ever want to buy rental properties or invest in real estate again - the government is removing the incentive on both sides of the house (pun intended)\n\nNot going to lie this is a fairly large unknown but with how little inventory there is, coupled with the growing economy and enormous demand for housing (especially sub 200k houses, which the majority of these rental homes are) there are tons of pre approved buyers and accredited renters willing to step in. \n\nMight just provide a good buying opportunity.

The people saying HD maps are a problem is TSLA,  the ones choosing not to use it. Obviously they will say it's inferior since they aren't using it. This IMO was a cost-cutting measure for their cars, not really a performance issue or difficulty with HD maps themselves.\n2. TSLA clearly is ahead in creating a \"fleet\". Waymo doesn't make cars, they are building a driver. They have to partner with car companies to create their \"fleet\".\n3. I think Waymo has a real chance in \\~2 years of being DaaS - Driver as a Service. They will need to focus on creating a functional ecosystem for this to work though - which will include HD maps. They then need to sell packages to all other car manufacturers of their HD maps, Driver Software, and possibly a lightweight lidar system.\n4. I'm not worried about TSLA because it's clear they are fully vertically integrated. IMO, this is TSLAs greatest strength - they have identified a huge market around batteries & electricity and they were the first mover. This includes EV  vehicles, battery technology, in home batteries, & solar roofing. FSD is just a bonus on top IMO. I think eventually TSLA will switch to a hybrid Camera/Lidar system, too.\n\n**tldr;** I don't know enough about HD maps and FSD in itself to really provide evidence, but I don't think TSLA/Musk has provided evidence that HD maps are actually difficult either.
