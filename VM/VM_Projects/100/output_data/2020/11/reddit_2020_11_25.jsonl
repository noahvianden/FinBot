{"title": "SPCE is far more than Space Tourism, allow me to shed some light", "selftext": "Hello, World!\n\nThe moment is finally upon us for SPCE to start making serious moves and this is pre-revenue, pre-flight, and pre-publicity. So what is all the hype, why are people confident in its future, and why are they right? One this is for certain this is NOT, I repeat NOT, just a space tourism company.\n\nLet me first introduce you to the staff and some key players:\n\nFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\nNoteworthy Investors:  \nVanguard  \nBank of America  \nMorgan Stanley  \nARK  \nBoeing  \nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)\n\nPartners:  \nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nUnder Armour (suits)\n\nTimeline of events:\n\n1. Q4 2020 - Q1 2021: A final round of test flights which were supposed to occur during the window of November 19-23. This was delayed due to the New Mexico lockdown. COVID depending this test flight could still possibly happen before the end of 2020, if not very early 2021. This test flight will mark FAA approval and will be carrying a revenue generating payload, being the first revenue to be generated by the company...well...ever.\n2. Q1 2021: Sir Richard Branson himself will take a flight up marking the start of commercial operations, the start of publicity and marketing, and the re-launch of ticket sales. So far roughly 600+ tickets have been sold and these will be the first clients to go up. Notable clients include: Leonardo DiCaprio,\u00a0Tom Hanks,\u00a0Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie,\u00a0Russell Brand, Lady Gaga,\u00a0Katy Perry,\u00a0Justin Bieber,\u00a0and Ashton Kutcher. The interior of SpaceShipTwo has 16 cameras which will be engaged during the duration of the flight and will capture these stars, quite literally in the stars as they float around in microgravity for several minutes. This will be recorded and surely uploaded to their social media. I imagine some of these individuals like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga will attempt to shoot a music video using this footage. Ticket sales will also resume again at this point.\n3. 2021: For the rest of 2021 Virgin Galactic will be sending clients to space all the while they will be pushing profits in R&D for future endeavors, such as the hypersonic point-to-point travel which will be discussed later. They will also be building out more Spaceports and ships in order to conduct more flights. According to the last investors meeting, each spaceport is predicted to generate $1B/year.\n4. Around 2025: The hypersonic point-to-point ship will be complete and ready for commercial operation. This will revolutionize human travel. To put it into perspective, the International Space Station circles the globe in 90 minutes, and when this plane is complete, so will we. Preliminary indicators suggest that a trip from NYC to Sydney, Australia would take roughly 30 minutes.\n5. The possibilities are as limited as space and I won't make your eyes bleed as we talk hypotheticals. I do however want to address highly likely revenue streams we could expect.\n\nRevenue Streams:\n\n1. Space Tourism\n2. Hypersonic point-to-point travel\n3. Space Force [https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/](https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/)\n4. NASA Contracts ( astronaut training, payloads, taxi services, etc)\n5. Booster Services \n   1. Now, there is no news on this, but this is my prediction and what I would attempt to achieve. As hypersonic travel becomes the standard way for humans to traverse the globe there will need to be a way to make it possible and affordable for the general public. Virgin Galactic cannot achieve this on their own and current airlines (Delta, Southwest, etc.) cannot convert to Spaceship companies either. With Virgin Galactics unique approach and design, they could  become a booster service for airlines. Airlines will need to design a space plane that is capable of hypersonic travel and Virgin Galactic will use their mothership to carry these planes to sub-orbit.\n6. While Virgin Galactic is currently operating in the sub-orbital space, I am sure they will begin working on deeper space projects for asteroid mining, moon operations, etc.\n\nCommon Objections and Rebuttals:\n\n1. Who would be able to afford this and even if they could, why would they?\n   1. There are around 42 million people in the world with a net worth of $5 million where $250k is extremely affordable. The price of the ticket is the same price of chartering a yacht for the weekend. Except instead of playing on a boat for two days, you go to space for a few minutes. Yes, the complete trip lasts around 90 minutes, but we are talking about going to Space. Virtually anyone would say that's something they long to do because that is human nature, if you look at people with high net worth they spend their money on much more ridiculous things. Not only is it human desire to want to go, it has the \"Johnson's effect\" as well. The Johnson's effect is an old sales analogy, where someone in your neighborhood would say \"Oh did you see the Johnson's got a new Porsche?\" Inclining you the observer who has the capital to feel the competitive nature and want to also have said clout. So yes, there is very much latent demand on this service. As explained earlier there are already 600+ pre-sold tickets including highly renown individuals and 900+ who have reserved a slot for a future ticket purchase. Note that these ticket sales only stopped because Virgin Galactic stopped them and will resume ticket sales Q1 2021. Virgin Galactic could currently handle 50 flights per year per plane and has recently finished their second plane, meaning they can handle 100 of the 1400 pre-purchased flights over 2021. So, even as Virgin Galactic scales, there is enough customers already to cover operating costs and the development of new planes for several years.\n2. Wow so you get to go to space for all of two minutes?\n   1. People who say this are people who can't afford it. That might sound harsh, but it is that simple. Very few humans would pass up on this opportunity for such a magical thing if they could actually afford it. \n3. It's not really \"space\"\n   1. Who cares? You get to experience microgravity and float around. You get to see the curvature of the Earth. You get to officially be called an astronaut. The media will not be attempting to point out this very minute, arrogant point. Again, only people who can't afford it will be pointing it out purely out of jealously or disbelief in the Space Age that is upon us.\n4. People only invest in this because they can't invest in SpaceX.\n   1. Not true. First off, they are completely different markets. SpaceX is orbital, Virgin Galactic is sub-orbital. A SpaceX tour would take you into deeper space for around a week and costs somewhere around $52 million. Secondly, even if SpaceX is a direct competitor I hardly see how that's a bad thing. Competition drives commerce, and to have Elon Musk being your direct competitor, that would only bolster Virgin Galactic. Thirdly, there is potential for partnership between these two companies in the future. A collaboration of completely different and unique technologies to overcome the challenges of the Space Age. Finally, SpaceX news and Elon Musk hype will mean space news and space hype, also helping Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat I imagine by 2035:\n\nSpaceports all across the globe, connected by the Virgin Hyperloop (for those who don't know it's another Virgin project that allows humans to travel faster than the speed of sound through tunnels). At this point, Virgin Galactic will already be partnered with other major airlines who have created space planes, very much reducing the cost and barrier to entry. Meaning any human who would have normally have flown \"first-class\" will now have the ability to end up anywhere on the planet in under an hour. Virgin Galactic will also partner with shipping companies and if you're impressed with 2 day delivery, how does 2-hour delivery sound? Packages moved via space plane, then into a hyper loop to your distribution center, and finally automatically driven to your home via autonomous AI. All the while Virgin Galactic is innovating new technologies for deeper space missions, working with the Space Force, and continuing space tourism.  \n\n\nThis is not some flashy new technology, this is the revolution of human travel.  \nThis is not sci-fi, it is simply sci.  \nThe future truly is now and we all have an opportunity to be a part of it.

The need to get to australia in 3 hours versus 20 is usefull, but not for flights costing 10-100x as much (they aren't going to be building fleeets of these things off the bat)\n\nCargo shipping is an interesting idea, but there likely is better option than what you're suggesting. \n\nOrgan transplants medical devices etc. Make up a minuscule portion of all shipped goods. Also most shipped items going over seas don't require immediate delivery. You can currently fly any package you want and get it within a few days to even the most remote places and often times faster. \n\nId imagine there is a huge amount of technological improvements that need to occur before this will even be considered for the uses you say. Maybe that can be done though the government contracts. If anything this seems like a really long hold.

{"title": "Palantir will crash after lockup period", "selftext": "For Palantir, though, years of venture-capital investments have created more than enough shares to launch public trading: roughly 1.64 billion, though that grows to 2.17 billion in a fully diluted formula that includes vesting options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I write this, about 497 million shares are outstanding. So, my quick math tells me that about 23% of all shares fully diluted are currently outstanding. About 1.7 billion shares could potentially hit the market after the lock-up.\n\nWith all this as background, here's how to put this in perspective:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A flood of new shares can come onto the market if the owners of those shares decide to sell. If the share price has soared since the IPO, then early investors may want to reap the rewards by selling some of their investments, or if the price has tanked, then they may look to reduce their exposure. However, it does not mean they will sell either way as they could look to retain shares in the hope of prices heading even higher, or because they believe shares could recover any value lost in the early days as a public company.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"...if there is a sharp increase in the number of available shares available in a company then this pushes the price of a stock down. It is not unusual to see a stock's share price fall on the first day that the lock-up shares can be traded. In fact, if other investors (not subject to the lock-up period) begin to sell in the days before the lock-up expires, then this is a sign that they expect the share price to fall.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, depending on the exact timing of the reporting of results, traders can start to play with the potential dips and the price stabilization shortly after.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn theory, investors could short PLTR perhaps 7-10 days before the lock-up expiration. Or, traders could use short-term options - especially puts - to play the downside opportunity. It's unclear if there's enough downside potential to make this work. Then again, even a small dip could magnify profits because of option leverage. Please note that I'm talking here about short-term trades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLockup ends Dec 31st", "id": "k1185o", "created_utc": 1606339432.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Look man, I'm mad that I didn't buy into PLTR too but you don't see me writing cope posts about it", "score": 173, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s not too late, you can still double your money, PLTR to the moon \ud83d\ude80", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "If I see a seeming DIP to 27 in the next trading day, I'm in for 5k shares.\n\nAs per OP hysteria, nobody will dump the stock when it's doubling every week.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30807599425315857}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24713614583015442}, {"body": "THIS is the way", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07251723110675812}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21256119012832642}, {"body": "Ban", "score": 125, "replies": [{"body": "Hold the fuck on.
