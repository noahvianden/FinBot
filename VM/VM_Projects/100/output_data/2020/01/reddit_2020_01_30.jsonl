They might both be leaders at their industry, but competition is drawing in closely.\n\nJust look at Tesla, they are dominating the EV segment, however, they don't exactly have enough factories to supply the world, their designs don't appeal to everyone (just look the the truck, and then also take a look at their most [popular model 3](https://www.rdforum.org/index.php?attachments/48193/). Looks like the upper area got stung by a bee). \n\nNow let's look at sales. In yesterday's call they said they will comfortably surpass 500k sales in the next 12 months. Great, but even if they double that and sell 1m, they are still only 10% at the level of their competitors. 10%. And, Apple, and even Google are in the EV game as well. They have so much cash, they can scale quicker, and everything Apple touches seems to be gold. Forget Google, their wamyo or whatever looks like crap, but Google is good at half-assing every new product release. \n\nNow add all Tesla's other products, there are some issues with the panels, but overall the products look great and will probably do well... in 5-10 years.\n\nOutside the US (and soon China), Tesla still has some issues, will the truck even be allowed on the roads outside US? How will it work with the Tesla charging stations, etc.\n\nThere's just so much, it's actually quite accurate to compare it with BYND's stock hype (not the company obviously).\n\nEdit: just for anyone wondering, I like Tesla, I like them a lot, but the stock is wack and overhyped.
