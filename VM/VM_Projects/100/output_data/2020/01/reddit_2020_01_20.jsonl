In other words, the car accelerates if, and only if, the driver told it to do so, and it slows or stops when the driver applies the brake.  \n>  \n>While accidents caused by a mistaken press of the accelerator pedal have been alleged for nearly every make/model of vehicle on the road, the accelerator pedals in Model S, X and 3 vehicles have two independent position sensors, and if there is any error, the system defaults to cut off motor torque. Likewise, applying the brake pedal simultaneously with the accelerator pedal will override the accelerator pedal input and cut off motor torque, and regardless of the torque, sustained braking will stop the car. Unique to Tesla, we also use the Autopilot sensor suite to help distinguish potential pedal misapplications and cut torque to mitigate or prevent accidents when we\u2019re confident the driver\u2019s input was unintentional. Each system is independent and records data, so we can examine exactly what happened.  \n>  \n>We are transparent with NHTSA, and routinely review customer complaints of unintended acceleration with them.

See $24k YOLO below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MARKETSHARE CREEP**: As the collective US/EU retail industry looks around and wonders if they should be establishing or growing their competitor's cash cow, they'll be looking to strategically invest elsewhere. There are only a handful of major IaaS providers: Microsoft, Google, IBM. Microsoft has greater IaaS market share than every other remaining hypersized cloud player combined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Player|2018 IaaS Market Share / Year Prior +/-|\n|:-|:-|\n|Amazon Web Services $AMZN|47.8% (-1.6)|\n|Microsoft Azure $MSFT|15.5% (+2.8)|\n|Alibaba Cloud $BABA|7.7% (+2.4)|\n|Google Cloud Platform $GOOG|4% (+0.7)|\n|IBM Cloud $IBM|1.8% (-0.1)|\n\nSource:  [https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018)\n\nFor the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of \\*\\[the new\\] big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.\n   * Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform by Microsoft that can be run fully disconnected and power containers (Kubernetes, Docker), other PaaS platforms (Pivotal CF, Red Hat OpenShift), and more. The solution has a multi-year head start in the availability in the marketplace, ahead of AWS competing solution Outpost - of which does not support fully disconnected scenarios.\n* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.\n* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform. Microsoft has enjoyed steady climbs after most favorable earning events, provided its largely institutional (\\~73%) ownership isn't panicking.\n* **ADD per** u/ryryshouse6 **THE GREEN BUTTERFLY AFFECT:** As ETFs, funds, and retail investors will continue to gravitate toward environmentally-friendly companies, $MSFT serves as a very attractive Software Service option for managers to justify taking or increasing stakes with $MSFT.
