It can very easily go up to 40 or higher. Not having entry rules can cause you to get in too soon. Remember spikes can build over multiple days, there are sometimes Foreshock Spikes leading up to the Major Spikes..My personal go to is to use the fall below the 10 day SMA average threshold to determine the Spot VIX has peaked. You can also use MACD divergence, 9 day SMA, and others. Back testing will show these indicators are very good at determining the VIX has peaked and is beginning to revert to mean.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "But it\u2019s a synthetic short so your losses would be capped by the debit of your bear spread, and your max loss would only occur if the Vix 90 days later was higher than when it was when you put on the trade.
