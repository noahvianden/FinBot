{"title": "Why NIO is a Better Investment Than Tesla", "selftext": "Other than the fact that Tesla is a great company and will undoubtedly do well worldwide in the coming years, I think NIO will give them a run for their money in China and hopefully the rest of the world.\n\nNIO has the opportunity to stand on the shoulder of a giant and do what Tesla has done, but do it better. Let me list off a few points of what's made me bullish as fuck on them:\n\n- Gone from concept to mass production faster than Tesla\n- CEO and founder William Li believes they will turn a profit faster than Tesla\n- Has NIO Formula E Team, a professional European sports car racing team that has set multiple records at world-reknown racetracks\n- Backed by the Chinese fucking government\n- First production car to have an interactive proprietary artificial intelligence, NOMI\n- Has their own clothing collection, NIO Life\n- Fucking in-seat massagers\n- 5 minute battery swap stations\n- NIO house, a showroom on the first floor with 3 more floors of community center space, look it up!\n- 200 planned NIO House/NIO Space showroom openings in 2020\n- Developed a driverless car while waiting for driverless tech\n- Can literally use Tesla's shared IP to get a competitive edge \n- Shared environmental preservation sentiment as Tesla, their name in Chinese literally means Blue Sky Ahead \n- NIO Service, can charge your car/swap the battery for you while you sleep if your home does not have a charging station\n- Cheap as fuck right now because people think they're going to run out of money\n\nThey're about to be even more heavily discounted over the next few weeks due to some hick ass bat soup disease. Gettin my money ready to wade deeper into the communist waters of China. You should to! Imagine being able to get into Tesla when it was this cheap. \n\nTesla is more than a car company you say? So will NIO be I believe. They, like China, have a far future in mind. They're looking to the horizon while others are looking at today. It's a company I have come to love and will stand by.\n\nGodspeed retards.\n\nEdit: spelling", "id": "eu3yoq", "created_utc": 1580025278.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "Jan 2022 $5 calls are cheap as fuck", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Yes!
