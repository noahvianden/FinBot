{"title": "Why NIO is a Better Investment Than Tesla", "selftext": "Other than the fact that Tesla is a great company and will undoubtedly do well worldwide in the coming years, I think NIO will give them a run for their money in China and hopefully the rest of the world.\n\nNIO has the opportunity to stand on the shoulder of a giant and do what Tesla has done, but do it better. Let me list off a few points of what's made me bullish as fuck on them:\n\n- Gone from concept to mass production faster than Tesla\n- CEO and founder William Li believes they will turn a profit faster than Tesla\n- Has NIO Formula E Team, a professional European sports car racing team that has set multiple records at world-reknown racetracks\n- Backed by the Chinese fucking government\n- First production car to have an interactive proprietary artificial intelligence, NOMI\n- Has their own clothing collection, NIO Life\n- Fucking in-seat massagers\n- 5 minute battery swap stations\n- NIO house, a showroom on the first floor with 3 more floors of community center space, look it up!\n- 200 planned NIO House/NIO Space showroom openings in 2020\n- Developed a driverless car while waiting for driverless tech\n- Can literally use Tesla's shared IP to get a competitive edge \n- Shared environmental preservation sentiment as Tesla, their name in Chinese literally means Blue Sky Ahead \n- NIO Service, can charge your car/swap the battery for you while you sleep if your home does not have a charging station\n- Cheap as fuck right now because people think they're going to run out of money\n\nThey're about to be even more heavily discounted over the next few weeks due to some hick ass bat soup disease. Gettin my money ready to wade deeper into the communist waters of China. You should to! Imagine being able to get into Tesla when it was this cheap. \n\nTesla is more than a car company you say? So will NIO be I believe. They, like China, have a far future in mind. They're looking to the horizon while others are looking at today. It's a company I have come to love and will stand by.\n\nGodspeed retards.\n\nEdit: spelling", "id": "eu3yoq", "created_utc": 1580025278.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "Jan 2022 $5 calls are cheap as fuck", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Yes!

Nokia is it's own company. \n\n\n> They have LinkedIn and Skype which are okay, I don't think many people use Skype anymore, you can do all that with facetime on your phone. They own hotmail -? Who cares.\n\nLinkedin is one of Microsoft important (not most) businesses. It's still consistently growing and bringing in great revenue. It's also not just business related social media website but also a great learning platform for IT, developers, designers, analysts, etc. Skype is dying but that's not really an issue, it's just a service that makes money serving ads and was never really a large part of Microsoft's revenue. It'd be nice if more people used it and that business adapted much earlier, but if you were to look take a look at all the other major companies who do a shitton of different things you'll find a bunch of things that used to be relevant that are declining or are already cancelled because there's better versions of their services/products out there. Hotmail/outlook (and OneDrive) is still widely used, it's just extra cash for them. \n\n> And then lets look at their products. I'm a PC user so yes Windows is great. But for tablets, I've never even considered the Surface. With Ipads being so awesome, I've never thought of any other tablet. \n\nSurfaces are not great for personal use but for certain enterprise users it's a great balance for them.

The total software sales are and exclusives games only account for a small fraction of that. Not that Xbox has more I'm just saying. Xbox is still a major brand, it's growing and profitable.\n\n> And why does internet explorer still exist lol...\n\nThere hasn't been a major release of Internet Explorer in about 6 years.\n\n> Bing is a joke.\n\nBing is far from beating Google.

As lo\n\n> Don't know much about azure but I hear more about Amazon's AWS in cloud news.\n\nI don't think you pay enough attention to he news. Azure is in the news A LOT. They have landed a lot of big deals and people are always talking about how much it's grown in market share. Amazon was around first and dominated the space. \n\n> Sorry if I offended anyone, I'm just very unimpressed by their product line and acquisitions.\n\nI'm not offended but your post has a mix of ignorance (I'm not saying that in an insulting way, I just mean you have a naive view of certain things or don't know a whole lot about certain things and brush it off), and using of your personal opinon of the product as a user instead of as an investor on a stock community. Microsoft may not be number #1 in all these business but you don't need to be #1 to be a good investment or to make a shit ton of money. Not everyone has to beat McDonalds, Pepsi or others to be #1. If you are growing your market share or even growing at all and your bottom line is huge and gets better and better who cares if you are not #1 at everything you do.

We've been learning how to contain and control diseases pretty much since we stopped believing that diseases were a punishment from some random made up deity.  Our ability to learn about, adapt to, and ultimately change the environment around us (rather than us having to change the environment or risk extinction) is why we have come to be the dominant species on the planet (and are subsequently destroying it but that's a whole other rant).  \n\nThe National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases announced two days ago that they already had the genome of the Coronavirus sequenced and that none of the cases had shown any signs of mutation.\n\nSo again, yes could this disease be incredibly dangerous w/o containment?  Sure, but that's we humans do... we contain and eliminate threats to our species.  \n\nAs a side note:  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html - That's the CDC's records of how many people have died from the flu each year since 2016 and their estimates of deaths from the 2017, 2018, and 2019 flu seasons.
