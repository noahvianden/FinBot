{"title": "[Learning] Buying AMD $55 call expiring Jan 31 - Walk me through your logic?", "selftext": "Hey y'all. New options trader here. I'll lay out my line of reasoning for wanting to buy this call, and whether you agree or disagree, I ask that you please explain why. I've gotten a pretty solid understanding of the basic concepts of option trading, but I'm really trying to understand how to apply that in real-world application.\n\n\\*\\*AMD current price: $50.83\\*\\*\n\nBased on the extensive research I've done, AMD's gain has consistently defied both analyst and investor expectations over the past year. Every recent article seems to be nothing but good news about the company, from management hires to new technology and increased investor confidence. 2019 Q4 earnings are set to be reported on the Jan 28th - three days before this call expires - and EPS is estimated on Robinhood to be $0.31, which is $0.10 higher than Q3s actual.\n\nThe only piece of information I've found that makes me hesitate was a single sentence in an article from an analyst who gave AMD a hold rating, who said that their main bull run is over. However, it seems like anyone who has said that in the past year has been wrong.\n\nSo, does this seem like a relatively good pick at this point? Why or why not? I know Delta and Theta aren't great, but are they bad enough to not buy this call?  \n\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for the massive amount of replies to this. I've already learned a ton more, which is exactly what I was hoping to do! As it stands, if I do buy this call, it would be with the intent of 100% selling it back before earnings are announced for hopefully a small profit. Not at all planning on holding it to expiration.\n\nEdit 2: I bought it at $1.07 for the reasons listed above. It jumped up to a $30 profit almost immediately this morning and I learned my lesson about not being greedy...currently at a $3 profit. In Su\u2019s name I pray. \n\nEdit 3: Sold the option for a $16 profit and bought the exact same call when it dropped down to $1.10...price of underlying stock has moved 2%+ since Intel announced earnings and its now at $52.63. Can\u2019t wait to see how much this premium is worth when the market opens again!\n\nFinal update: sold that for a $22 profit. Chump change for many, but it worked out in the end!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vr3kspqpelb41.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9991ef85806847738d3169996640f3cf6b9f836f", "id": "eqlhrt", "created_utc": 1579377731.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "It is relevant :D I bought 55s for 2/7 and was about to check how tf you had higher earnings than me thus far", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I have the same", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07977282255887985}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10030250996351242}, {"body": "That seems like a smart idea. \n\nI\u2019m also realizing that, because I\u2019m not really at a point where I can have a decent amount of funds to invest, that I\u2019m looking for cheaper options that are also inherently more of a long shot. \n\nI might buy a $51.5 call for $70 or a $51 for $90 that expires on the 24th instead.

The volatility gives you a good reward/risk. If the credit is small, just get more contracts within your limit. I would sell the put vertical spread OTM ($20-$30 forTSLA), then sell the call vertical spread. To maintain control, these I do, do only a short time 2-7 days. If the underlying moves fast to the call/put cliff, I can get out with little to no loss. Otherwise I place a closing order to keep 50% of the credit. Leave a little money on the table because if you make it to near expiration you want to reduce the risk of a big move and assignment. You need a good platform to constantly analyze the trade graph.

I would always recommend using spreads over just buying a call or a put -- they're just too risky. With a bull call spread, you are less exposed to Theta decay also.\n\nHe could also do a put credit spread. /u/Yamaha9 This strategy involves selling one put and buying another at a lower strike price. This strategy won't net you as much money as a call or bull call spread, but is more likely to succeed. With a put credit spread, you will make 100% of the premium as long as the stock price is above the strike price of the put you sold at expiration. Thus you will profit if the stock price goes up, or if the price stays the same, or even if it goes down (as long as its above the strike price of the sold put).", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "What sort of price would you be looking to sell the put leg? Thanks.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Depends on your goals and risk tolerance. For me, I like to look at delta to help decide which strike to use. I usually look for a delta of -0.25 or lower. If I stick to this rule, then my trades will have roughly 75% chance of success. The closer you get to the money though (I.e. selling your short put closer to the current stock price) the more premium you can collect. So if you are really bullish, you could sell the put closer to the money or even at the money. The closer your short put is to the money though, the riskier it is and less your chances are of success.\n\nAs for the width, again it depends on your risk tolerance. The long put protects you from losing your shirt if the stock price goes below the strike of your short put \u2014 since that long put is there to save you, your max loss is equal to the difference between your short and long put, minus the premium you collected from opening the position. So the wider you make it, the more premium you can collect, but also the more you can lose.\n\nAnother thing I like to do sometimes when looking for good put credit spreads to open is to look at the ratio of max profit (premium) to max loss. Typically I\u2019m looking for that to be around 1:3 or better while still having a delta of around -0.25. \n\nYou will collect a lot more premium placing credit spreads with expiries farther out though. I usually try to aim for about 45 days away as from what I have read that is the best timeframe to use to collect the most premium. If you try a put credit spread within a really short expiry you will see that the profit is not very good unless you make a riskier play with the short put closer to the money.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks this is really useful.\n\n>\nYou will collect a lot more premium placing credit spreads with expiries farther out though.\n\nI think this is sound advice, especially for those of us just starting out.
