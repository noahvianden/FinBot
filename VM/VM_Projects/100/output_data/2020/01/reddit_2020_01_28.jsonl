More money is made in the auto industry financing cars, from bank fees, than selling them. Buying new cars in the US for the median household is financial suicide. When the loan default rates get to a certain point and the credit freeze takes hold, it's over for the US auto industry. The dollar is going down, the most money will be made in exporting our cars to countries that actually produce the goods that fill our trade deficit, and these fantasy valuations will evaporate.\n\nEvery argument you have is qualitative. I agree TSLA's product is amazing, and rich people will have their cars. If TSLA survives they'll make an amazing product for a small number of rich people at a smaller valuation. But the projected volumes are insane based on what Americans can afford, and its way overvalued.\n\nYou're argument on phones shows you're clueless. Have you been outside the United States much? Only US consumers are spending $1,000 on phones every 18 months - that's why they have $400 in the bank. Median income consumers in Australia, Thailand, China, UK, etc. aren't doing that. And if you didn't notice, phone prices skyrocketed in the US over the last 5 years because after two years you don't get a free phone anymore, and that's with a stronger dollar.
