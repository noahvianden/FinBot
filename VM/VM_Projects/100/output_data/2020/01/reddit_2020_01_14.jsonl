For example cars it's getting there but is only moving 650k per year next year but I think it could probably move 6m per year once it's scaled.\n\nFor grid level batter storage there is a vast capacity possible. Apparently Elon is giving a talk this year about how they will scale battery production to 1 TerraWatt which is like 30x of where they are now.\n\nThere's also solar roof which has been a real bastard to get working but they say the current version is cheaper than a normal roof + your electric bill, so you'd be a bit mad to buy anything else.\n\nFinally the Semi Truck is huge. People moving freight don't care about style or fashion, they just want cost per mile to be low. If tesla can offer something compelling there then that's another big market.\n\nAnyway yeah it's totally possible this is all hype and the fundamentals can't support it, however there is a lot of cool stuff coming down the pike.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["bubble"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Maybe the PE will eventually pass AMDs.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17970390617847443}, {"body": "sell.  there isn't $55 billion to pay out", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "The 55 billion is in the form of stock options, they can literally give out trillions as long as Elon can afford to buy them.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5064544677734375}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34529754519462585}, {"body": "When do more shortsellers give interviews on Tesla collapsing?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This guy gets shit done, you have guaranteed that this price will stay no problem.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20367632806301117}, {"body": "I was thinking abt getting a few stocks from Tesla cause there's no way it wouldn't go up, with tech being more and more \"invasive\"", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I think something's wrong with this math but it makes sense when you add the shares he currently owns, roughly 20% of all TSLA with 12 payouts of $346 million worth of shares.
