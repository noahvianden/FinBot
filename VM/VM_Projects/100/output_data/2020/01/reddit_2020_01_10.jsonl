I believe every single protection and system should have the ability to be easily overridden by the pilot because we pay the pilots to use their judgment and *fly* the plane.

The change here was to use significantly more fuel efficient engines, which is critical for their customers.  Their overall pitch to customers was a plane that's much cheaper to run but doesn't require any new training or new airports.  Customers could expect to just buy it, swap it in, make no changes on their end, and start reaping the savings.  For them, it was a promise of instant extra profits the minute the plane arrives.  Thus it should be obvious they were flooded with orders.\n\nThe new engines are larger and would normally have caused problems for airports if they changed the physical shape of the plane.  That led Boeing to kind of squeeze big engines in a less than ideal positioning onto the plane.  This apparently created a really poorly balanced aircraft.  So to deal with a plane that could easily flip out balance, they enhanced their autopilot software to try and predict that and take control of the tricky maneuvering of a wobbly plane.  But since their marketing pitch was for no customer changes or retraining, this software was supposed to be seamless, and Boeing recommended no pilot retraining.  \n\nAs it (allegedly) played out, the software relies on sensors, and problems with the sensors and the software logic caused the two fatal crashes.  Pilots might have been able to step in and deal with the crisis, but they hadn't received thorough training in how the revised plane and its new autopilot worked.  \n\nInitially there was an idea that Boeing could just improve the sensors and software as a quick fix.  However that would still mean delays and costs for retraining pilots, and undermines the marketing promise.  As we're now a year later, apparently a simple sensor and software fix wasn't enough.  And the regulators, who Boeing had been able to sweet talk, are now reluctant to do any hasty approvals.\n\nI personally don't know, but there are some who claim the engines combined with the plane's shape will always be wobbly and can never be made smooth.
