{"title": "The $65k I previously made from selling naked options on TSLA may or may not be all gone and more now.", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I appreciate the welfare checks after TSLA went up today. I had previously only posted about TSLA plays a few times, so it's flattering that you guys associate and know me for TSLA plays. I wasn't going to post this since I'm really embarrassed and ashamed that I let things get out of control. I feel like I let myself and everyone down.\n\nYes, I got screwed very hard. As I have been the past several weeks or so as it has been continuing up. I previously made over $65k at the peak of selling options (both puts and calls) on TSLA in 2019 in just eight or nine months, but that may or may not be gone now with TSLA's surge to the upside.\n\nI fucked up pretty badly and did not manage the trades like I should have. As with a lot of people here, I'm shocked and in disbelief that it hit $498.49. It'll probably break over $500 this week to reach another milestone.\n\nA couple months ago I did talk shit about how TSLA would not get above $400 or even $420 anytime soon. Boy was I dead wrong. You guys are more than welcome to talk shit to me now if you like. I'm happy that a lot of you were able to make massive gains. It did have to come at the expense of people on the other side of the trade.\n\nYou might be wondering if I still have short calls on TSLA. The answer is yes, and I'm not quite sure why. Stubbornness, inability to take a loss at the high even though it keeps making new highs, etc. Basically the opposite of bagholding a long position. Nobody wants to sell for a loss at the bottom similar to not wanting to sell for a loss at the top.\n\nEven the \"no way it will reach this point\" call strikes that I have sold ended up becoming deep in the money. If you'd like to capitalize on this information, some of the \"no way it will reach this point\" strikes that I have are in the $500s.\n\nThe really annoying part is having to pay taxes on gains that may or may not have all been lost and more in the first five trading days of 2020. Even though I did say to myself that I wouldn't sell naked calls as a new year's resolution, I ended up doing so anyways and I paid the consequences.\n\nIf others are in a similar boat after selling calls, I hope you're doing okay and that you didn't put yourself in a really bad situation. Taking a loss is tough. By the time we do, it gets way out of control and ends up being an even bigger one.\n\nDon't worry about me, I'll be fine and will continue trading. My trading confidence took a huge hit and the entire experience has been humbling. This was not how I was hoping 2020 would start. I guess you could let this post/update be a cautionary tale to manage risk better and not take on positions with potentially unlimited risk. More pain will probably come as I still have short calls that I have yet to close.\n\nI do still plan on messing with TSLA once the dust settles from the current positions. Best of luck to everyone out there. Might not post/comment as often since I want to focus on trading and getting on the right track first. Will still answer PMs and mod when I can though.
