My point is they are doing more than just making shows and movies they are also buying/forming production studios and purchasing a lot of real estate which helps them save and make more money since they can start making shows internally like how Disney, Fox and NBC does instead of solely relying on third parties to make their originals at marked up prices.

The consumers are getting much more even if they end up paying $100/month or more for everything and they reap the inherent benefits of streaming (on-demand, ubiquitous access, easy cancellation, mostly ad-less, progress tracking, etc.).

My only concern about these streaming services is piracy. Piracy is getting significantly easier, and learning how to do it is as easy as looking up a video tutorial that provides you point and click installers to automate it.

Content is EVERYTHING. Netflix started out as JUST a distributor - they didn't own ANY of the content on the platform, which begs the question, if the content owners start their own service, why would they put it on Netflix when they can just go straight to the consumer? Well that's basically happening right now - the big studios are slowly pulling their stuff back from Netflix, and will be putting it out themselves under their own platforms. \n\nNetflix rightly saw this coming years ago, and they started planning for it. They are way out ahead in terms of streaming, but they are behind in terms of original content - that's why they are investing so much into that. It's literally the exact opposite of \"running out of ideas\" - they have TONS of ideas and are putting so many things into production it's almost insane, but they're not just doing that because they need a hit or something  - they just need a solid base of original content that they own so it stays on the platform.

That is just not the case - at least, it's not the reason that they are producing all these shows.

Of course they could produce numbers that Wall Street would love, IF they wanted to, but is that really best for business? Is that the strategy that they are employing here? No - they're not just trying to boost their stock value for the next quarterly. They NEED content to survive - yes they need GOOD content, but they also just need content PERIOD. No studio out there has nothing but amazing content in their catalog - everyone has some duds, but that content likely still has some fans out there and once it is produced, there is virtually no cost in digitizing it for release on a streaming platform. All of this spending is reinvestment in their own business. Why do you think so many different companies are all getting into the content business right now? \n\nReally everything you are saying is wrapped up in this. It's not like this just occurred to them the other day - they rightly saw what was coming YEARS ago and that is why they have been investing so much in content. Obviously what they are doing isn't sustainable with their current subscription revenue, but if you don't think they have planned for various contingencies based on all kinds of revenue scenarios, you're crazy.

Theatrical distribution is still physical, but it's not reels of film, and the low cost of digital media and storage have made this VERY cost efficient compared to how it used to be. Home media distribution is the most costly since you are actually creating physical products and then shipping them around and trying to put them on store shelves, but even these costs aren't that much, but Netflix isn't in home media so they wouldn't have any of those costs anyways.\n\nSo, what you are saying about \"a bigger share of the budget went into production due to these savings\" is completely off base. That is the case for EVERY movie - all of their budget goes to the production.\n\nThat said, what makes you think Netflix doesn't have any marketing costs? Just because they aren't distributing films like the big studios doesn't mean they don't spend money on marketing. They absolutely do, but unless they use budgeting that aren't in line with the industry norms, then those costs would be separated from the actual production costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This creates an opportunity for Disney and Apple to differentiate by only sticking to better quality content. Even if they have less content, but if they are considered higher quality, people will be willing to pay.\n\nWow, you've solved the entire issue of the entertainment industry. Just create high quality content. THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT. IT'S SO EASY, HOW DID NO ONE ELSE EVER REALIZE THIS\n\nOk, sorry for being a dick, but again it's quite obvious you are speaking from the outside of the industry. If it were really that easy, why hasn't Disney (or anyone else) done this already? They've been in the content business for a while now, even though Disney+ is new - what is stopping ANYONE from just sticking to better quality content?\n\nThe thing is, creating \"better quality content\" isn't as easy as you think it is. It's not just some content machine where you put in a quarter and pull the lever, and boom out comes Game of Thrones. Like, no one is TRYING to create \"garbage content\" - what would be the point of that? It's just that you never know what is really going to land with audiences - it's always a crapshoot to some extent, and if you don't think Disney creates low quality content, then you just aren't paying attention. Look at John Carter. Look at how many shows they make every year that get cancelled.\n\nThe notion that \"creating high quality content\" is this easy thing that anyone can just do is so misguided it's ridiculous, and even when you DO make something great, people don't always watch. Look at Arrested Development as just one example - that was a show that was pretty beloved by fans and critics, but the ratings weren't strong enough, and Fox cancelled it. This isn't the only show that this has happened to, there have been a lot of other shows and movies that fit that criteria, so clearly it's not just as simple as making \"high quality content\". I work in the industry, and I consider HBO as having the best reputation for consistently making high quality content - but are they the biggest company in Hollywood? No - not by a long shot. They're successful, sure, but having that reputation for high-quality content hasn't made them the biggest or most powerful company in town, and even they can't guarantee a hit. They have had good shows that performed poorly (Enlightened) and they've had bad shows that performed well (True Blood) - but calling shows good or bad is completely subjective. There are TONS of hit shows out there that I think are crap, but that get really good ratings. The \"low quality content\" that you speak of may be the thing people are viewing the most on Netflix - you have no idea. \n\nend rant", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "First I do agree that you are being a dick but I am not offended.

You do not need to be in the industry of something that you invest in. While the information is not 100% accurate, you can make investment decisions based on it.\n\nI did not say that making higher quality content is the solution as you can see Netflix has done quite well for some time. In summary basically what I am saying is that since Netflix is offering a lot of shows and movies, they seem to care more about quantity. As you have mentioned that HBO has decent quality shows and is not that big, this is the opposite end of the spectrum. There is definitely a lot of space in the middle for someone like Disney to position themselves in between HBO and Netflix. \n\nWhile it is hard to make quality content, there is still a correlation even though its not a perfect one between quality of content and investment. Investment can be in many forms, relationship, culture, other intangibles, and money. HBO did not get lucky continuously each time they make something, but they do invest more into their shows. \n\nWhile calling things good and bad are subjective, if you want to even remotely start investing, you do have to have a sense of how a large portion of people who might represents suppliers, consumers, etc regard as an aggregate certain products. It does not matter from an investment perspective how good or bad a particular show is, but more how overall the company is. I just used Underground 6 as an example as on Netflix there are more of those than something like Black Mirror and Stranger Things.\n\nIf you feel otherwise that Netflix has good content, a good pricing to match those content, and competitive advantages that they can sustain, then you should invest in the company.

They started as just a distributor, and they realized that that moat will begin fading away and all these other content companies can start their own services with minimal effort. The content companies had CONTENT, but they didn't have a platform or users. Netflix had a platform and users, but no CONTENT of their own - and now that more and more studios are pulling from their own service, they are trying to build up their own original content to retain their users - they literally HAVE to, just to even be remotely on par with any of these other old-school media companies. And again, they're funding a large variety of content, to appeal to a wide variety of people, because of the whole \"content is subjective\" thing. The stuff that you think is low quality is going to appeal to other people, and the stuff that you like may not appeal to them. They have to cater to ALL their users - not just you or me. This really isn't any different from HBO or Disney, they operate the exact same way, but again the difference is that they all had a head start in terms of content, so Netflix is trying to catch up. \n\nTo put it another way, I wouldn't say they're emphasizing quantity OVER quality. They're really emphasizing BOTH, which is why it costs so much, good quality content isn't cheap and they're trying to produce a LOT of it - it's just that not every show is made for the same type of person.

Meaning that if their net income remained constant it would take 20ish years to make a profit off of your investment. That\u2019s a very healthy stock price given their earnings. Starbucks is sitting at like a 94 P:E which is absurdly high, that\u2019s an overpriced company to be concerned about. Microsoft is solid and its PE is sitting around the high 30s. Granted, their cloud business is priced in to the stock price and the cloud is expected to keep expanding.  \n\nI think Google is relatively safe to buy in to definitely, even at $1400, their services are pretty well established/depended on by society. Apple I can see being slightly risky due to ambiguity surrounding sales on future iPhones, even though they are trying to break in to finance and the streaming industry (jack of all trades is not necessarily a good thing - see GE). I haven\u2019t followed Apple news much lately so I could be wrong on them right now. But I would definitely buy in if their PE ratio drops below 15 again like they did in Dec \u201818 ($160-180 dollar price range). Microsoft and Amazon are potentially oversold territory. I don\u2019t know cloud services well enough. Microsoft seems to have momentum and their current CEO has clearly turned them around since Ballmer stepped down. Microsoft\u2019s services are entrenched in the business world as well along with government work/contracts. Visa/Mastercard may not be a bad option but I would wait for their stock price to come down,  because they have a relatively stable market as CC transaction processors, but they earn money so slowly that their stock is priced very high (PE is like 40 I think for a company with meh year over year revenue/income growth. Microsoft it\u2019s different because they earn more faster). If a crash/correction comes then Visa could possibly never reach its 52 week high again, or it would take a long time to catch back up to it which is an opportunity cost sink if you weren\u2019t throwing more money at it while it became cheap. \n\nMy top 5 stock picks:\n\n\nGoogle > Facebook (risky play due to government intervention, but if the final ruling is negligible then this stock is going to the moon based off how much they earn) > Apple = Microsoft (Apple at the current price I like more) > Visa/MC \n\nMind you I have a tech-heavy bias. You have to be mindful of innovation changing market conditions. Nokia was top dog in the 2000s but got shitted on very quickly once iPhones hit the market. Things can change very fast, coupled with companies trying to recover from a crash and they may never reach their previous 52 week high. It took Microsoft 16 years to reach their dot com crash stock price peak (stock peaked in 2000, crashes and doesn\u2019t recover until 2016).\n\nEdit: I see you want dividend stocks. The issue is that dividends are generally negligible amounts of money. Here\u2019s an ex:\n\nApple is paying a $3 dividend right now, their stock price is $300. If Apple kept the same dividend for 5 years you\u2019d make $15. However all it takes in a iPhone sales miss for the stock to drop to $280. You still lost money despite the dividend. The point I\u2019m making is that you should focus on the company\u2019s long term future. Dividends are irrelevant as they show the company has money they don\u2019t know how to use to reinvest back in to their business to boost the stock price. When times are tough, the first thing a business slashes is the dividend + bad guidance means the stock price plummeted which is a double whammy.

Tesla is the Apple of 1990, we are moving towards electric cars whether the oil industry likes it or not.  The gas industry has held electric cars like a beach ball underwater but they simply cannot do it anymore, we are at the beginning of a massive market change.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re definitely right about Starbucks. In Manhattan there is literally a Starbucks just around every other corner it feels like. I don\u2019t know enough about their business model honestly, but their stock is still very well in the very high territory that isn\u2019t worth touching imo. Starbucks doesn\u2019t make that much net income per stock (earnings per share), so it has ALOT of room to fall down. Also Starbucks still has competition with companies such as Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Keurig/K-cups, other cafes and other coffee sellers. I count things such as k-cups as competition since Starbucks only does coffee, no one goes there for the food. It\u2019s one thing if they were like Visa/MC where they had an entrenched oligopoly (arguably they do since Dunkin\u2019 is the only real competition). I do agree that they\u2019ll probably stomach the next recession since people are bad at money management and will keep buying Starbucks. \n\nI personally don\u2019t like touching companies that have unstable finances such as Tesla. It\u2019s the same as gambling, you\u2019re better off just going to the casino and putting all of your money on either black or red, at least you know your odds there and you\u2019ll have less time wasted holding the stock, hoping for it to go up. Tesla also as a short-squeeze issue with its stock price. It is the most shorted stock, so when they report good news and the stock price goes up - the shorters sell out  to take their losses. Causing the stock to prop up even higher due to less shorters. That\u2019s why Tesla\u2019s stock price has soared within this past month. \n\nSemi-conductors are probably the best industry as of right now. Computers aren\u2019t going away, and if anything there\u2019s higher demand for better processing power be it video games or managing large data. AMD, and Lam Research are pretty good companies in this field. There is a big susceptibility due to China having most of the mineral materials used in the chips.

We don\u2019t know how much net income they\u2019re going to reel in. If the $500 stock price is already priced-in for turning profits then the stock isn\u2019t going to climb that much higher. So you just ran the risk of Tesla\u2019s stock plummeting by not being able to pay their debt and in reward the stock\u2019s price increased by like 5%. You have to objectively attempt to measure what a company\u2019s stock price should be based off of metrics such as revenue, net income, working capital, equity, and economic significance. Tesla not turning a profit = cannot precisely measure their stock price outside of revenue growth, equity, and economic significance. It\u2019s all speculation how much profits they\u2019ll actually turn if they pull through. \n\nIn the meantime, money could\u2019ve been thrown at companies like Facebook and Google where the only thing holding their stock price back is fear of government intervention.

Microsoft as well being a well established company that\u2019s still expanding itself now in to the cloud business. Facebook and Google are gambles just like Tesla.

Idk). I'd look into ETFs to mitigate stock specific risks and get into more sectors, right now you're basically in a telecom oligopoly prime for disruption, a chipmaker that is presently outclassed and outpriced in the consumer space (Intel is fucked the day AMD gets their industrial pie, if they do), an overpriced coffee shop that will see an exodus with the first economic downturn, a sugar seller that people are turning away from over the years and Apple, which is lovely (albeit I can't get myself to buy more at this price). Doesn't take much to tip the balance in the wrong direction or to underperform. But yeah broad market index funds are the way, stock picking is the game (which is fun and that's mostly why I do it, but I barely begun earning). For what my personal opinion's worth, QQQ is what I've been buying lately for the FAAAM and tech exposure, FB is undervalued if you're not expecting significant regulation that can't be avoided, I'm tempted in selling my doubled AAPL since it seems ahead of itself, TSLA will be massive and outperform on a 10+ years horizon, TJX is a retailer I am eyeing that is (IMO) immune to Amazon and even benefits from the retail chaos (barely dipped in 08), APHA will be a resilient pot stock, NMX is the worse mirage I've encountered.\n\nHowever, why not a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio?
