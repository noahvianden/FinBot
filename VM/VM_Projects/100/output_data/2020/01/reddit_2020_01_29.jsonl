Government and private incentives for electric vehicles arent there yet.\n\nUmm, there were lots of very rich incentives.  It's just that they've gone away since they weren't really needed.  Tesla actually got hammered when news came about incentives being rolled back.\n\nAnd that's a key point: no sufficiently revolutionary business model needs incentives.  Demand and value take care of things.  When broadband internet came along, it didn't need half price government subsidies.  Everyone just wanted it, and boom we went from sparse dial up country to high bandwidth in every home.  Smartphones didn't need a subsidy plan to take over the world.  When electric cars have the right no-brainer proposition, incentives won't be needed.  I'd kind of hoped $150/barrel oil was going to do that but then oil crashed and has never come back.\n\n\n\n> It\u2019s still just not efficient enough for the vast majority of car owners to drive electric.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"not efficient\"?\n\n\n>  Why pump billions into r&d for a product that isn\u2019t the chosen market yet? \n\nYou,don't need to \"pump billions into r&d\".  Mature automakers just outsource and buy what they need.  That's very capital efficient.  \n\nNotice how practically every car suddenly got satellite radio standard overnight?  They didn't invent that.  Vendor had it worked out, and it just became pert of the supply stream.  Same with commoditized rear view camera and ABS brakes and now, all the various car-phone integrations.  Some white label electronics supplier offers it for $20/car license or whatever, and each of them gets to call it \"Hyundai Biue Link\" or \"Merdedes Touch Link\" or whatever.  It's all the same thing, just with a brand label on it.\n\nThe same could easily be with EV's.  You just drop in 4 DC motors (which have been optimized over their 100 year existence) and you order some battery packs from Panasonic, and you load a different body control module firmware and boom, there's your EV.  \n\nSeveral even have hybrids.\n\n\n> Just to compete with a company that is solely focused on electric and will kick your ass in r&d in the short run? \n\nWe could debate whether Tesla will kick anyone's ass in R&D, but even if we just agree on that for discussion, who cares?  GM, VW, Toyota don't sell R&D, they sell vehicles.  As long as it's sort of the same as every other car, that's enough.\n\n> Better to wait until the tech becomes more available or the buyers/incentives are there.\n\nI continue to believe the most powerful incentive is personal economy.  If an EV will cut your fuel bill by $500/month and an EV costs an extra $250/month, that's a no brainer.  No incentive needed.\n\n\n\n> As soon as government subsidies for eco friendly cars arrive in a big way, \n\nGovernments are all in massive deficit, they can't and shouldn't be handing out subsidies for rich car moguls.
