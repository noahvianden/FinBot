The bottom didn\u2019t drop out of the dollar before because the fed was able to sell the lie that this expansion in their balance sheet was a temporary measure. The federal reserve expanded their balance sheet from 800 billion to 4+ trillion. Fast forward a couple years, they start QT and start to raise rates. Since I knew the federal reserve would not act independent, i knew they would run in to save the stock market at any chance. Gold is at 1200 around summer time. Then a couple of months later during last December the fed hiked to 2.5% and it was too much for the market to handle. The market pulled back like 5%, which isn\u2019t even that much (just shows you how worried they are), and the fed comes out and says they\u2019re cutting rates. They\u2019re calling this a \u201cmid-course adjustment\u201d acting like they\u2019re going to go back to raising rates soon. Over the last couple of months the fed restarted QE 4, more stimulus for a market at all time highs. The balance sheet has expanded by half a trillion and will continue to grow. Inflation by definition is the expansion of the money supply. So If we\u2019re going to go off of that, the realistic inflation rate is 7%. \n\nSo now the fed is stuck. Rates will be at 0 soon and the fed will have no \u201cmonetary ammo\u201d to get us out of the next recession. You typically need 4-5% of rate cuts during a recession to lift the economy out of it. Without the stimulus of the rate cuts the fed can only do one other thing, and that\u2019s print money. The fed will either be forced to raise rates during a recession or send us into stagflation (high unemployment and inflation). The loss of confidence in a currency is one that\u2019s very hard to gain back. Hyperinflation and economics are also a psychological phenomena. \n\nIf we have trillion dollar deficits now, imagine during the recession, it\u2019ll be 2-3 trillion in the midst of it. Save some of your purchasing power in gold as the government either defaults on the debt or prints way more money to pay off the debt. \n\nWe\u2019ve seen big moves towards dedollarization.
