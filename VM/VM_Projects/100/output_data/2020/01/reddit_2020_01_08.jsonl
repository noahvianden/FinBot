Basically:\n\n3 things suddenly happened to the plane at 8,000 feet: loss of all communications with the crew, plane starts descending rapidly and catches fire.\n\nFirst of all, the communications: the plane still didn't hit the 10,000 feet speed restriction threshold which means it normally would be flying at the speed of 250 knots with a rate of climb between 2000-3500 ft/min. It would take a lot of time for it to lose momentum and hit the ground after the incident happened (at least 40 seconds). In almost every airplane crash in the past pilots did say something to the ATC, even when they had less time to respond. On top of that, the transponder immediately went off. The only way that's possible is the complete failure of both the electrical system and the standby battery within 10 seconds of each other (time it would take for the pilots to react). Which is almost impossible.\n\nSecond of all, the fire: engines wouldn't be able to cause such a huge fire since the elements which surround them are fireproof/can withstand high temperatures. The only thing that could technically be able to do that would be in the cargo or in the cabin. But nothing that would normally be allowed onto the airplane would cause the entire aircraft to turn into a giant fireball. Which means either someone smuggled high explosives or something hit it from the outside (like a missile)\n\nThird of all, the rapid descent: even if both engines lost all power, pilots would still be able to glide the plane to the ground, unless obviously control surfaces didn't work properly. In order to lose all hydraulics you would need to disable both A, B and standby hydraulic systems which are independent from each other, are all over the plane, and located in a way, that the plane would have to take damage from all sides for all of it to fail.\n\nIn my opinion, it was likely a missile. 737NG (not MAX) is a very reliable airplane with a bit less that 0.06 crashes per 1,000,000 flights. And the fact that it happened in Iran, with what's happening right now... for it to be a technical accident would be one in a trillion chance.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "hmmm it's Ukrainian(which Trump hates) plane crashing in Iran(which Trump hates).

Typically air defence systems are not fully automated and would still need human authorization to launch (well, hopefully they do atleast) however, I would assume that missile defence systems, or ICBM defence systems would be automated just because the timeframe from target detection to when that missile hits its target is a much smaller amount of time compared to a jet flying in with a potential payload. \n\nMaybe Iran has a make shift missile defence system of some kind that is completely autonomous, and it was turned on and told to fire at will since they were expecting retaliation. But instead it pinged an airliner that took off and shot it out of the sky before anyone had time to shut it down. \n\nOr the much more likely theory that is less interesting is someone didn\u2019t take the time to properly identify the plane, and shot it down. I\u2019d imagine knowing you just attacked the most powerful military in the world; and they are more than trigger happy, could get on you\u2019re nerves pretty fast and make you a bit on edge. \n\nHopefully this unbelievable story of an engine failure is right and no one is at fault for the plane going down. But if it looks like it was shot down, in a place that would make sense to get show down, during a time when they were looking for things to shoot down, then it was most likely shot down. \n\nHopefully this could serve as a warning, mistakes can happen anytime, anywhere. If things like this can still happen (if it happened) with normal missiles, then do we really need countries sitting around with thousands of nukes? Think about it, the only reasonable cause for a nuke getting launched would be boiled down to a mistake (and it\u2019s scary how many times we have already accidentally almost launched nukes)and once one nuke is launched, there will be more.
