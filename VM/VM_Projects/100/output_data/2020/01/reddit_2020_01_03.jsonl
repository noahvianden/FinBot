They literally had all the branding already there to sell it as an EV, due to 1) it being the environmentally friendly car of it's ear, and 2) it being the car with the cheapest fuel costs of it's era. \n\nThe fact that so many Prius owners are trading up for a much more expensive Tesla shows just how much money Toyota threw away because they refused to build a product that their Prius owners and others wanted. (The model 3 is the most profitable car in the US). It also created a brand new competitor for themselves, which will be hurting them for years to come.

Tesla doesn't make econonoxes. The environmental-conscious but richer crowd will pick up a Tesla and trading in their Prius no problem, but the poor ones won't.\n\nThe same reason Tesla has had success where others haven't, is their battery production capacity.

Just take a look at the financials. Literally everything is in the negative. PE ratio, net income, PEG ratio, EPS.\n\nElon Musk is basically Billy McFarland of Fyre Festival. Tesla has diluted shares and made a lot of promises. The stock price right now is driven solely by the public perception of Elon Musk. There are no financials to back up that price. The stock is dangerously over-valued right now. Shareholder money is being used as a giant band-aid in hopes that the company can stop hemorrhaging and turn it around.\n\nAlso as a consumer, take a look at the process to buy a Tesla car. You have to put your name on a waiting list for car that you'd be lucky to get in 1.5 years at a premium price. Oh wait, you also risk getting your ordered completely cancelled. How old is the model S and 3 now? 7 years old?  So people are waiting in line for a 7 year old car. And you don't even get much of a federal tax credit for them being electric cars anymore.

All it had to do was open slightly green and I was raking in tendies...\n\nBUT THE FIRST DAY I TRY TO DO SOMETHING WE GO TO FUCKING WAR!?!?!  \n\nOf course, I saw the AH rally and futures looking strong, I thought for sure I was gonna kill it tomorrow, but instead, I'm literally gonna lose every penny more than likely...  \n\nThis absolutely floors me though... I didn't touch SPY this entire bull market, not once.  I literally played roku mostly, and some other random stocks, but the first day I buy SPY calls, FD's at that, futures plummet because Orange man decided he wanted to provoke a war overnight instead of just letting me make some money... What a bunch of absolute garbage...\n\nPlease kill me.\n\nEdit:  Like the Autist I am, I doubled down on SPY calls this morning and its recovering!!  Wish me luck lol\n\nEdit2:  Im gay... And single handedly ended the Bull market...  Im sorry.  Im very sorry guys.\n\nEdit3: On the bright side, Cramer said its a bad time to buy so inverse Cramer and I might get lucky lol.  But really.  Cramer, the ultimate hype man extraordinaire turns bearish the day I buy Calls.  Literally insane I actually single handedly ended the bull market and started a war.  \n\nWent from up 25% two days ago to down 60% today. Im optimistic. Afterall, money is just paper anyway.  \n\n Final Edit 4: ok.  So.  Rode some dailies all the way up till just now.  Ended up selling on this spike down because I made like 20-30% and it dropped so I decided to take profits instead of holding while this dumpster fire unfolds.  Currently sitting at about down 40% overall, compared to my 2 days ago up 25-30% so not great, but better than my -60% earlier today.  Not gonna lie.  Its been a wild ride, prolly gonna do it again next week, I havent learned shit.  Im either going broke or gonna be rich.  Prolly broke.  But hey, its just paper anyway.  To the idiot that said \"this is on you for buying at ATH\" Its been at ATH for like 10 years bud.  \n\nFinal edit #2:  its my post, I can make as many edits as I want.  Fuck you.   Im dumbfounded I missed that massive drop right there.  Somehow sold my dailies for a gain and bought puts after to spiked down then back up, I bought puts at that top there.  So gonna ride these puts over the weekend as this dumpster fire political environment unfolds.
