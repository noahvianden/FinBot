{"title": "PSA: Comparison is the death of joy", "selftext": "There are a lot of people looking at some TSLA calls I sold yesterday and messaging me saying \"if only you had held them! You'd have made $700,000!\". I'm also getting messages from people new to stocks/options asking me how to improve their trading and results. These two types of messages go hand in hand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me start with this PSA: Comparison is the death of joy. My wife first told me about that Mark Twain quote and I love it, especially how it applies to stocks. I cannot time travel. And if I could, I'd be a trillionaire.  You will ALWAYS have things in your life that you wish you had changed. But the past is written already. Every time you suffer a loss, whether in life or in stocks, make sure you learn a lesson from it and move on. The only way we can improve our lot in life is to think about your current situation (current positions, in this analogy) and decide how you will move forward, accordingly. That's it. You can't be born to different parents. You can't hold a stock you sold yesterday. You can't change the past. But you can change your future by stop focusing on regrets and start focusing on what is going to happen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.", "id": "esf3py", "created_utc": 1579713785.0, "score": 719, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "I bet your wife's boyfriend would have held for longer", "score": 469, "replies": [{"body": "He\u2019s a prime slab of beef.

Plus you are essentially being asked to buy all the gasoline you might want to desire upfront.\n\n\n\nAlso vehicles are safer than they once were, and the Autonomy level 3 and perhaps 4 (I don't think level 5 can be ever obtained) will cut some slack to drivers. This means increased speed limits, given that we were stuck with the present one since we thought cigarettes were healthy.  So 100-120 mph highways will become a thing, we could go as far as adapting the German model with no speed limit at all.\n\nThis means that range anxiety suddenly becomes a concern once again and that the ability to have a 30sec splash and go opposed to a 30 min stop to recharge your vehicle (which inevitably becomes 1hr because of Supercharger congestion) suddenly matters again.\n\nAlso all vehicles sales (both ICEs and EVs) are going to be severely impacted by telecommuting as more and more people move to jobs which can performed from remote and boomer bosses who believe in strict control of employees die out or leave their executive jobs.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "By the time speed limit laws change, battery tech will make range anxiety non-existent.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "At what price point for the consumer?

As soon as people realize the hit their quality of life would take if we were to meet climate goals they'd quickly move to some other \"societal problems\" such as wealth inequality or fake news, media concentration and breaking up big tech.\n\nThe reality is that EVs provide less quality of life to the buyer, not more. Just ask all the Tesla owners who spend hours at Superchargers , a stark reminder of the 1970s oil crisis. Plus you are essentially being asked to buy all the gasoline you might want to desire upfront.\n\n\n\nAlso vehicles are safer than they once were, and the Autonomy level 3 and perhaps 4 (I don't think level 5 can be ever obtained) will cut some slack to drivers.

How about we pretend that you\u2019re right and absolutely no one cares about the future.

If you even did your research you\u2019d know that the $70k performance model 3 has the same 0-60mph performance as a $195k Audi R8. But at a fraction of the fuel cost and maintenance. EVs are so cost cost efficient that government agencies like policies departments are switching to electric vehicles because their cost of fuel and maintenance are so low.\n\n\n\nYou keep talking about 30s to fill up a tank. First off, as someone that his driven gasoline cars since getting my license it does not take 30s. Secondly you don\u2019t have any other option with gasoline vehicles. You have exactly one option: drive in your car to a gas station and pay 2-4x for the cost of fuel. EV drivers can fill up at home, even while they sleep for a fraction of the cost. There are Ben laws that make it illegal for apartments, condos and landlords to deny home charging solutions. \n\nAerodynamics. I hate to be the one to break your bubble but every car manufacturer takes into account aerodynamics. Yes, even gasoline car manufacturers. Even cars with poor efficiency like the M4 have had engineers studiously pour time into making it as aerodynamic and appealing as possible.
