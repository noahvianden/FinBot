Basic aerodynamic characteristics in airliners are regulated. It should have never passed the most basic analyses and testing at the design phase.\n\nThe reason for this is however simple. It is inherently unstable because of the move of the engine locations in order to have larger and more efficient engines. The main problem with the instability is that it contains a negative feedback loop. The definition of negative here is \"unwanted behaviour\". So in certain situations like a possible stall when you add more power you get the unwanted behaviour of the plane pitching up further which actually increases the chance of a stall occurring and also negates the purpose of adding power. Which  would involve more power being required to be added which results in an obviously undesirable feedback loop.\n\nThe only known types of planes which have a unstable feedback loop which must be compensated by computer are military based. In particular fighter jets this is why they have such fast roll, pitch rates (when they roll they want to roll further and faster). No other commercially/civilian available plane actually has instability corrected by computer for this reasons. When you have a commercial airliners and you roll them they \"centre the stick\" they automatically by design attempt to roll back to level again. Same happens on pitch, yaw and various other common flight characteristics and the 737 MAX is an exception to this rule.\n\nEven if it passes the US regulator in this case.
