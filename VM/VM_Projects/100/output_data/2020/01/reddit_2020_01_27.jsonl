{"title": "A serious discussion about the sentiment and direction of this sub: Both short and long term", "selftext": "**I will start by saying I have posted this in the daily discussion area, but since have been urged to make a separate post to ensure it gets seen and not buried.**\n\nI've been subscribed to this sub since April last year, and have enjoyed my time here as most of us have. However, the sudden and deserved (coming from a TSLA bull) stock price increase has attracted a lot of new subscribers and thus a lot of newfound euphoria. This euphoria was shared and tolerated at first, but now it seems to be the popular thought that it has taken away from the informative and unbiased discussions we used to have in this sub. The subreddit built by a community of TSLA shareholders seems to be overran with \"just bought x more shares\" and \"HODL\" bitcoin nonsense, all while posts/comments of significance are short-replied and brushed off. Other posts, as u/flufferbot01 has pointed out, offer fair criticism and may bring real concerns to shareholders, yet is dismissed without thought as \"FUD\". Are we becoming what some here have accused other subs as: an echo-chamber?\n\nSome have expressed their opinions of this matter within the daily thread post, while others have stated they have considered unsubscribing and removing themselves from the community due to its lack of discussion of anything except the stock price. I also received a private message asking if I wanted to start a new subreddit to get back to basics: fundamental discussion of the company. Is this how we proceed? Splitting the community?\n\n I, myself, am not a mod and cannot do anything to restore the sentiment of this sub apart from making a post. I can, however, suggest we create some additional guidelines to battle this repelling behavior.\n\n1. I'm requesting, with the support of others in previous daily threads, we ban the word \"HODL\" and phrases alike. This is a stock of a real company, not a cryptocurrency.\n2. Also proposed: adding post flairs to sort and encourage posts outside of the daily thread. This subreddit is growing and would benefit from such search features (even if optimized in the future).\n3. We all know what the stock price is, for most of us are also invested in the company and keep track of this. I do not see the merit in spamming the daily thread with green/red updates.\n4. Bearish arguments should be welcomed and not downvoted (and thus buried). Give some thought and discussion to those who do not share the same sentiment as you. Who knows, maybe you can learn or share some insight you never would have otherwise.\n5. Snobby comments about TSLA stocks isn't a good look. If you are invested in a company, chances are you are an adult. Act like one. If anybody serious about their investment were to visit this subreddit and see \"We don't invest in stocks, we invest in TSLA\" my guess is they will consider us an immature community and spend their time elsewhere. I, for one, hope the community grows in hopes more people bring focused discussion and opposing arguments.\n\nThese are just some opinions and suggestions myself and others have brought up in the past few weeks. Feel free to critique and add to them as you see fit. Believe it or not, this subreddit used to be a great source of information not limited to the price of the stock.", "id": "eutsfw", "created_utc": 1580156682.0, "score": 272, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Ah, didn\u2019t see you had the post up already... I also started a mod discussion about this.  Here\u2019s my suggestion:\n\nIt seems that there\u2019s 2 large \u2018groups\u2019 of users within this sub: those who are very focused on the short-term movement and the current stock price, and those who are mostly interested in the long-term movement/target and analysis/news that\u2019s valuable for the long-term story. I think we can satisfy both groups by using 2 different recurring threads. One focused on short-term trading and current stock-price. Another one that zooms out for the bigger picture view and focuses on everything that\u2019s relevant for the long-term of the company and the stock.\n\nAgain, this is just a suggestion: I would make it clear in the discussion of the Daily thread that it is the right place for short-term trade-related discussion (current stock-price, anything short-term option related, etc...). And then maybe add a new Weekly Big Picture Investor Discussion thread where we don\u2019t really focus on the day-to-day movement, but where people can discuss/analyse whatever is relevant in the longer term for both the stock and the company.\n\nI think that would take some of the frustrations away (as depending on your interests you only follow one of those threads, or both). Flufferbot also had a good idea on using flairs on posts to make it easier to find stuff that\u2019s relevant for you. Honestly: I\u2019d actually love it if people would stop creating new posts all the time and keep the discussions in the daily and weekly (if we ever do that) threads.

If the comment doesn't raise an idea, debate an idea already raised, or provide sources to further the discussion, it gets removed. Everything else is functionally an \"upvote with commentary\". \n\nThe issue is that if you tried to apply this to today's daily thread, for example, you would have 80 removed comments (I'm being kind at only 80) out of the first 200 shown. I counted. There would be an argument for probably 200 of the 425 currently there. In short, if we tried to apply this all of a sudden, it would mean a few days of absolutely nuked threads until people adjusted. That's a bit too hard of a sell, in my opinion, and would annoy people genuinely just hyped because *holy f--- look at what the stock price has done recently*. These comments are well-intentioned, just not **substantive**.\n\nIn other threads, I would prefer to moderate with this in mind, but not enforced as a set-in-stone rule.

Less than a year ago you posted \u201cPulling the trigger on investing!\u201d. You then commented on how there\u2019s already a subreddit dedicated for that (this one). There\u2019s nothing wrong with this post but it sounds like this is the kind of posting that bothers you. Consider the golden age fallacy and how what you perceive isn\u2019t necessarily a change in the subreddit itself but a change in your own perspective. I looked at the recent posts and relatively few were about recent stock moves. Regardless, you should expect that on a subreddit dedicated to the most controversial stock in the world after it doubles in a few months. So I\u2019d let the euphoria due to stock slide.\n\nI agree that snobby comments and downvoting good counter-arguments is bad. Imo the most effective thing to do is make on the spot corrections.
