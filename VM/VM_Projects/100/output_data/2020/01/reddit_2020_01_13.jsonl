What about when China/U.K./Germany remove the subsidies which have been demonstrated to be a MASSIVE reason for EV adoption?

Every country said they wanted to sell a million EVs by 2018 or 2019 and China is the only country to sell 1M annually; U.S. is in 2nd, way behind them, and no one else is even close. \n\nOther than Norway, the countries banning ICE vehicles are planning on doing it two decades from now at the earliest. France and UK are planning on it in 2040. This gives plenty of time to larger, better-capitalized OEMs with much larger scale to catch up to Tesla. \n\nSolar is another industry which is heavily subsidized by the government. Once subsidies end, demand drops immediately as it has in the past in Japan and especially Germany. Look what happened to Germany when they removed incentives; massive buildout at first and demand has been dog shit since they cut them out. China and Japan have both cut their subsidies and are moving to bidding processes. \n\nPersonally, I think growing solar and EV adoption are great for the Earth and I do want adoption to increase. However there are years of evidence which demonstrate how much both industries rely on government funding because the price is too high.
