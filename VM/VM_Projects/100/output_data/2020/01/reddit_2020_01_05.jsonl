There's a number of disadvantages to smart glasses I'll explain in the below points.\n\n* From what I gather if you already wear glasses you have to get a custom pair of smart glasses with your eye prescription. This 1) isn't cheap (factoring in a visit to the eye doctor & the new glasses cost), 2) it often takes a week or two for the glasses lens to be made, and 3) your eyes and prescription change overtime, meaning you'd need to throw away a perfectly good device simply because your eyes change. And because it was customized just for you no one else could use it.\n\n* If your prescription glasses are an electronic that needs charged, obviously you can't use your glasses while they're charging. Batteries in phones don't always last all day (especially on older phones, and if you're using very battery hungry apps).\n\n* Wearing glasses **IS NOT** actually as comfortable or easy to adjust to as you might think if you've never worn glasses before. They need to be adjusted properly to rest right on your head (which can be a tricky process for some). For some people (especially those new to wearing glasses) even the tiniest smudge or bit of dust on their glasses will drive them crazy until they wash it off.
