{"title": "Bearish Due Dilligence.", "selftext": "# Warning: Bearish DD\n\nSo I made some DD recently, but I don't dare post it on WSB (they will call me a permabear and a fag) so I thought what the hell, I will post it to r/stonkmarket.\n\nFor the past nine years, the equities market has seen one of the best percent gains since the Bull Market of 1948-1969. Corporate taxes are low, GDP growth is strong, and joblessness well below the Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU).\n\nHowever, quite a few ratios, economic data, and past performances are pointing to the conclusion that this bull market is close to its conclusion. For all data, I will be using the S&P 500 Index. Sorry Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Nobody loves you (well I love Nasdaq fuck Dow).\n\n**Buffet Indicator**\n\nNot to be confused with the Buffet Rule, the Buffet Indicator compares the Total Market Capitalization (Market Cap) of the stock market divided by the Total GDP.\n\n|Ratio = Total Market Cap /  GDP|Valuation|\n|:-|:-|\n|Ratio < 50%|Significantly Undervalued|\n|50% < Ratio < 75%|Modestly Undervalued|\n|75% < Ratio < 90%|Fair Valued|\n|90% < Ratio < 115%|Modestly Overvalued|\n|Ratio > 115%|Significantly Overvalued|\n\nAs of 8/1/18, the Total Market Cap is 142.8% more than the total GDP. This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n**Buffet Indicator Graphs**\n\n(images aren't allowed in r/stockmarket)? alright I guess ill imgur it but boo.\n\n[https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe](https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe)\n\nThe past 50 years of the Buffet Indicator. Notice 2000 and 2008.\n\n[https://imgur.com/E8AteXj](https://imgur.com/E8AteXj)\n\n29.3 Trillion in Total Market Cap vs. 20.4 Trillion in GDP.\n\n**Shiller P/E Ratio**\n\nThe Shiller P/E Ratio is a better measure of valuation than normal P/E. It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.\n\nShiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\\~ Years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1](https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1)\n\nThe grey bars mark U.S Recessions. Note 1929, 2001, and 2008.\n\nMEAN: 16.9 (We are currently 53% above the mean, indicating an overvalued market.)\n\nMIN: 4.78 (DEC 1920)\n\nMAX: 44.19 (Dec 1999)\n\nRANGE: 39.41\n\n**Price To Sales (Revenue) Ratio**\n\nThe Price to Sales Ratio (PSR), like the P/E ratio, is a way of measuring value. Instead of comparing a company\u2019s price to earnings, it compares a company\u2019s stock price to its revenues.\n\n|Price/Revenue Per Share|PSR Valuation|\n|:-|:-|\n|PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|\n|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|\n|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|\n|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|\n\nThe current for the S&P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation. The chart below shows that until the late 90s, P/S never topped 1.3.\n\nS&P500 Price to Sales 1955-2006\n\n[https://imgur.com/QbfwTTI](https://imgur.com/QbfwTTI)\n\nS&P 500 by Deciles 1986-Present\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j](https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j)\n\nThe graph above shows the S&P grouped into deciles (each of ten equal groups into which a population can be divided according to the distribution of values of a particular variable (in this case Price to Sales Ratio)). Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.\n\nThe normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.\n\n[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)\n\nThe flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the\n\nlonger maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)\n\nThe Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)\n\nWe are currently in a flat yield curve.\n\n**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like Robinhood can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway. Draw your own conclusions. This is my first DD. Feedback and criticism is welcome.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nSell everything, the stonk market is gonna crash /s\n\nEdit: will consider posting to wsb, but I won\u2019t be surprised if I get yeeted on.", "id": "973zxv", "created_utc": 1534208705.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "Good writeup.\n\nWhat do you think of the counter argument that many of the top S&P500 corporations make a good portion of their money overseas than in the past thus making the Buffet Indicator less relevant?", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "with the new growth in the usa they can offset this loss with domestic income", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3375401496887207}, {"body": "Was going to post this!", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04636109247803688}, {"body": "They were saying \"the new global economy\" every other sentence in 1929, no kidding.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3297457993030548}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5762060880661011}, {"body": "Love this.

Unemployment is pretty significant, i don't think inflation is wiping out **all** of the wage growth (guessing though), and inflation is indeed a little on the high side for now but it's definitely not out of control.\n\nI would say GDP growth is the main one that you didn't mention. GDP growth is pretty much everything. But there are many other indicators which all play a role together.\n\nDebt is indeed increasing which i'm sure will be a problem in future. It's actually not that high as a percentage of GDP though, and that's the only real way to measure debt accurately. It shouldn't be increasing though, that's the problem, and it'll hurt in future if that keeps continuing.\n\nYes, the stock market recovered, but the economy didn't immediately. Things were very slow for quite a while. It's only very recently that QE has been reduced and interest rates have finally started to go up, after a very very very long time of being as low as possible.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "There have been [recent reports](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wages-arent-growing-when-adjusted-for-inflation-new-data-finds-2018-07-17) that wages are still decreasing after accounting for inflation. Not really worth getting too much into, just figured I'd share. \n  \nGDP growth is a big factor, but that doesn't seem to have fundamentally changed. This past quarter's 4.1% is nominal and has been described as being [driven by the tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/wrapup-1-consumers-soybeans-seen-powering-u-s-second-quarter-growth-idUSL1N1UJ1FB). After accounting for the soybean bump, which we'll feel in coming quarters, the growth was 2.5%. \n  \nI'm not sure how you describe high debt-to-GDP, when the US is [at 105% and the highest it's been in over 50 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S). In addition, the [IMF estimates US debt will continue to rise over the short term due to Trump's tax cuts and not wanting the Fed to unwind stimulus faster](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2018/04/19/global-debt-tops-164-trillion-imf-warns/530893002/). \n  \nYour last statement pretty much just reiterates what I'm confused about though.

So why do you think it is?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Didn't know that about wage growth, interesting.\n\nThe 'highest debt-to-gdp ratio in 50 years' is still not a problem. The level of public debt in Japan 2013 was 243.2% of GDP, in China 219% according to the IMF, while the public debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of the 2nd quarter of 2016 was at 89.1% in the United Kingdom, 98.2% in France and 135.5% in Italy, according to Eurostat.\n\nThat puts the US in a high but not unreasonable position relative to other countries. It's very obvious that debt will be high after the global financial crisis. The world is still recovering. So 'highest debt in 50 years' is to be expected, and again, not really a problem. It's not unexpected, and it's completely intentional. It's like saying after world war 2 that the debt is high and the US is in trouble. Imagine missing out on the 50s! \n\nSecondly, debt is issued in US dollars, which the government can literally print. [Warren buffett explains this well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdVjyeV0Mg0)\n\nIt's not the amount of debt that matters, it's the direction. At a time like this, we really shouldn't be increasing it relative to GDP. The direction is what's concerning, and if it continues, the US will have problems down the line. But as it stands, it's manageable right now. The media is filled with sensationalized headlines of 'USA IN TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DEBT AND WE'RE ALL DOOMED' when really it's just a bit high, but manageable. The direction is the thing people should be concerned about.\n\nI did not say that the stock market is not a good indicator of the economy, and if you think that i fully disagree. The stock market is an *excellent* indicator of the economy, just not in the present. The stock market is tied to the **future** economy. The stock market will crash when the future starts to look less bright. And right now, the economy is strengthening. I'd go as far as to say it's only recently started strengthening! The fed have only just started to raise interest rates! The economy has been so unbelievably weak that interest rates must have remained low for a record amount of time (and they're still really low!). As that last link mentions, the fed is **unwinding** economic stimulus. That's not something you do in times when the economy is weakening!\n\nI get that things aren't perfect and there are problems, but there are **less problems than a few years ago**. The economy is looking better. Maybe not great, but better. That's what makes stock prices go up; the positive future outlook.

Again, if we say the market is a predictor, then it was pointing to a robust economy for a long time. Now we can agree that by most metrics the economy is robust. Certainly enough to support unwinding of stimulus. \n  \nThis leads me to two questions: (1) How long do we expect a \"strong\" economy? and (2) How far out is the market a predictor of the economy? \n  \nThe first question also requires us to establish what a strong economy looks like.

In general, I think it's safe to say that the economy turns because of the tightening of investments. The tightening of investments is usually brought on by losses.

{"title": "Micron, Market Makers, and You: Stop Hitting Yourself", "selftext": "Warning: long\n\nEdit: for everyone asking for a tl;dr, I'm not sure there is one, but it is high-effort, possibly educational, possibly humorous content\n\n**Micron's Price Movement**\n\nAs all of us are aware, Micron continues to trend down to oblivion. As we on the spectrum all know, this is equally due to 1) manipulation by the big banks; 2) Algorithms and/or ball-and-dick patterns on TA charts that for some reason people think give human traders any edge at all despite the existence of sophisticated algorithms that could high-frequency-trade any such edge, if it even existed, to oblivion; and 3) Market Makers manipulating the stock so they don't have to pay off owners of long options.\n\n*A Prelude on Low Volume*\n\nVolume on Micron's stock has also been [low](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/mu/historical): the 50-day average volume has been over 40M, but the daily volume for Aug 6-10 and Aug 13 was as follows: 28.7M, 21.8M, 18M, 34.3M, 31.2M, 24.6M -- all well below average volume. \"But that's still a lot of shares being traded-- 2.5% of the entire outstanding shares each day?!\" That's not a good metric to use. On average, about half of all volume across the entire market is done by high-frequency-traders bouncing the same shares back and forth, seeking very small arbitrage opportunities between differences in indexes and the underlying holdings that the index tracks (among other things). A lot of this volume is also passive indexing, news-driven algorithms, etc. Looking at raw numbers is a bit misleading.\n\nThe news on the latter half of last week generated relatively more volume (in this case, sellers)-- but there wasn't a flood of sellers, just a trickle. It's also worth noting that volume in August is typically low -- people go on vacations, there are fewer news events, etc. and that it's been particularly low for Micron. Supply/demand: prices go down when there are more sellers than buyers. In low volume environments, even a relatively small increase in sellers or buyers can cause odd or unexpected price movement.\n\n**MS-13 Thursday**\n\nJoseph Moore, A Bigger Idiot Than Everyone Who Shorted TSLA Into Earnings (With The Rest Of The World) Even Though It Was Public Information That They Hit Production Goals And Profit Numbers Don't Matter Right Now Because The Company Still Has \"Potential\", (\"The Idiot\") downgraded the semiconductor industry and the semiconductor market, including Micron, the perennially-undervalued stock, which sank even farther on this bullshit analysis.\n\nSo it must have fallen because people read this, bought into what he had to say, and sold--The Idiot duped people to get out of the industry, and was a huge wave of people selling, right? Maybe even The Idiot himself deigned to follow his own advice, and is taking on huge short positions expecting the price to go down? We do know that people can take analyst ratings far more seriously than they should, but was there a large number of sellers and/or shorts on this event?\n\nWell, we don't know about August numbers quite yet, [but short interest in Micron is low](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/mu/short-interest), at or near record lows, \\~4% and this short percent is reasonable for a company of it's market cap (used as a hedge without wanting or expecting it to go down). The low volume also suggests a wave of sellers didn't emerge (though maybe a few more than others) and IV in the option chain is still incredibly low, so the market is not yet fearful of a large move in either direction.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have no love for The Idiot, the \"services\" banks like his provide to their customers, and any recommendations that they have. The Idiot might well have good intentions and honestly believes what he's saying--or he may well intend to fuck with algorithms to help send it lower so he can buy in after the blackout period at a better price, or to allow his friends in other departments or banks to buy in lower (this behavior is rare, but not rare enough). I do doubt that he (or anyone else, really) is shorting Micron because they think it will go down (unlike TSLA shorts).\n\nRather than focus on what/who caused the selling, a better question might be: \"So where are the buyers that would bring this up/counteract the sellers?\". Possible answer: \"Everyone is on vacation and/or focused on all the other earnings plays going on right now and/or 'holy shit what is Zucc/Cook/Musk doing let me trade their stock that actually moves rather this stale snoozefest'\"?\n\n**Algorithms/TA**\n\nI don't buy into TA as an actually useful predictor of anything, except for this: some people, and therefore algorithms, think it is useful and so will trade based on it; therefore, especially in low volume environments, the ratio of buyers/sellers can change based on what TA \"predicts\": if a bunch TA traders think something is going to bounce, then they buy in at the bounce point, then the number of buyers outpaces sellers and--\"Hey! it's going up! Buy more it's in an uptrend! TA works!!!1!111eleventyone\"--a self-fulling prophecy with a dose of [survivorship bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/).\n\nThere are many types of algorithms that might be used to trade stocks. The sophisticated ones (i.e. and e.g., high frequency trading algorithms) generally don't rely on TA; there are, however, several technical-based algorithms (e.g. \"price persistence\", \"trend following\", \"mean divergence and convergence\") out there in real use; I have no idea how many people are using them, on what stocks, etc; I would posit that they are absolutely useless on super-liquid, high profile stocks and options chains like AAPL (which is basically a market unto itself) unless the algorithm boils down to \"buy low sell high\" which, duh, bull market in the tech sector, obviously it's going to be profitable (though how much are they giving up?). I would also suspect that Micron has been a golden goose over the past several months for anyone that does use \"trend\" algorithms, and, together with the very low volume on the stock, may help feed a self-fulfilling prophecy. \"Hey, look at this pattern, it's still in a down-trend, let's sell\" -> stock goes down -> \"Hey let's keep doing this and tell my friend to check it out\" -> etc -> \"Ok we're hitting support levels let's start buying\" -> \"Hey it really is trending up now lets buy more\" -> etc.\n\n**Market Makers**\n\nThere are lots of complaints about market makers (MMs) on this subreddit, viewing them as mustache-twirling bankers out to screw the little guy. But you should be glad MMs exist because they literally make the market! They sit and place bids and offers so when you come along at 3:21pm on Tuesday and want to buy a FB FD call, you have someone willing and able to sell to you, no matter what strike and expiration.  Do you think they are screwing you? Fine! You can take the opposite side of the transaction: you can instead sell the FD to them, and they will buy it. Market makers primarily try to make some money on the bid/ask spread (e.g., make money by buying at $105.02 and sell at $105.04); this carries a lot of risk--what happens if they sold a bunch of calls, and the stock continues to move up?--they need to hedge and remove their exposure to what the underlying is doing. They aim to be indifferent to what the underlying is doing (\"delta neutral\"). How do they do this? They hedge the call they sold you with other positions that eliminates their directional exposure -- they may buy stock, for example, if they sold a call and the underlying moves upwards. If they don't do this, they literally could run out of money and go out of business if the stock keeps climbing. For simplicity, I'll limit this discussion to them selling calls and buying/selling stock as their primary methods for hedging.\n\nThose of you with Robinhood may be familiar with the [\"Chance of profit\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95x9wa/only_3650_autists/) summary line. This isn't pulled out of nowhere, but calculated based on the option pricing chain -- using [an option pricing model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\u2013Scholes_model#Black\u2013Scholes_equation), you can literally calculate what percent chance the market is calculating for the underlying stock being at or above a certain price by a certain date -- Robinhood's \"chance of profit\" is literally the %chance that the market is pricing into the underlying reaching the break-even price on the option by expiration. This chance of profit isn't static; it moves with time, the price of the underlying, IV, etc. So while [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95zdd4/i_think_i_made_a_terrible_mistake_what_do/) has generously purchased a MM bottle service this weekend, [the market is pricing in a \\~47.5% chance of SPY being at or over that same strike (297.5) by December, 2020](https://imgur.com/UKC1mKy), which carries significant upward risk to any MM that sells it to you. \"Wait, what's that \"Delta\" column that shows up in that last picture?\"\n\n*Delta*\n\nDelta has a couple different meanings that (for simplicity) I'll say are all synonymous.\n\n1. It's the probability of the option being in-the-money at expiration;\n2. it's the slope of the option pricing model curve with respect to change in the price of the underlying shares; i.e. approximately how much the option will change in price for $1 movement of the underlying, if everything else stays the same;\n3. The equivalent number of \"shares\" of stock that option gives you exposure to at that moment in time.\n\nIt's important to note that the **delta of options changes significantly as the underlying moves around**. Also, 100 shares of stock, by definition, have a delta of 100: $1 change in the price of the stock = $1 change in price of your stock.\n\nSo let's say you go and [buy a 190 BABA call](https://imgur.com/OKj6yMy) for $500, September expiration, when the price of BABA stock is $180. The market is currently pricing in a 35% chance of BABA being at or above that price at expiration, so you have 35 delta. The MM that sold you that call has the opposite -- he's short the call, so he has -35 delta. The MM wants to be delta neutral, however, to manage his own risk and ensure he can show up to work tomorrow if BABA moons, so he quickly goes out and buys 35 shares of BABA, bringing him back to delta neutral. Soon after this purchase, BABA shoots up $5, making your 190 call have 44 delta, and the MM is now (+35 delta (from shares) -44delta (from the naked call he sold you) = -9 delta) delta negative and has to go buy an additional 9 shares to come back to delta neutrality. Next, the stock immediately goes down $10 to $185, and now your option only has 28 delta. Now the MM is (+44 shares - 28 delta from the short call = 16 delta long), so he goes and sells 16 shares of BABA to offload his directional risk. This may look weird (or familiar, to people in this sub): MMs actually buy shares as the stock goes up and sell shares as the stock goes down.\n\n*Market Makers Buy High, Sell Low!*\n\nThat's right, they live the WSB dream! They *have to do this to manage their own risk*: there is no mustache-twirling bad-faith/evil reason. If you buy a FB call and it shoots to literally the moon, they need to be able to give you the shares and continue to stay in business tomorrow -- so they buy more shares as the chance of it ending in the money increases, and sell shares as that chance decreases, so they are neither left bagholding shares if the stock goes down nor stuck for \"unlimited upside risk\" if the stock goes up. The upshot is that for any given single call contract, the most they will ever have to buy is 100 shares.  The costs of this hedging is sustained through the credit you gave them ($500), together with the fact that implied volatility in options prices overstates historical volatility (i.e., you overpaid for the option relative to the expected costs of the risk hedging they will have to do as the stock moves around); they also play both sides (sell puts, etc). Obviously, they don't make money on every trade on every underlying, but that's (the basics of) how they do it in aggregate.\n\n*Delta changes over time*\n\nJust to reiterate, and this is important, **delta changes over time**, even if everything else stays the same. As the time to expiration goes to zero, the delta on the option goes to either 100, if it's in the money, or to 0, if it's out of the money: at expiration of the call option, you either exercise and have 100 shares, or don't exercise and have 0 shares. So even if there is no price movement in the underlying, the delta on your OTM FDs will rapidly decay towards 0 even as theta eats their value to nothing.\n\nSo, MMs might have been contributing to the recent downswing in selling, but not with any malicious intent. Market Makers literally do not care about the direction of the stock and want to stay open for business (whatever the upside may be to \"manipulation\" to grind out a few extra pennies on the options they sold you, the upside is peanuts compared to the downside of the risk of ruin); the Micron stock price has been going down, so they have been (or should have been) appropriately selling further. When the stock is going in favor of your call, they have to purchase shares!\n\n**You**\n\n\"Me?\" Yes, **you** are to blame. \"But I'm bullish on this stock I just want it to go up--I even have two **shares** in my Robinhood account to go along with all the OTM FDs I buy!\". The meme euphoria in this subreddit for this stock after earnings is to blame (in part) for selling pressure: everyone who bought ridiculous OTM calls is to blame. \"This stock was going to redouble it's price in months, now that, finally, people would see that this industry wasn't cyclical! I'll get a cool 100k for my 7/20 $90 calls\" Your euphoria caused the price to tank with downward selling pressure. \"Why?\" Put it all together, man.\n\nYou bought ridiculous call strikes driven by euphoria; market makers did what they do and bought shares to become delta neutral, but this was at a time when everyone else was still adjusting post-earnings, so that volume was lost in the sands of rebalancing. Then, 6/25 came. More trade war fears, specifically involving the tech sector. Nasdaq plunged over 2%. \"Can't BTFD the dip with such high IV, gotta wait at least a couple of days\". Things settle down and you buy calls again: double down. You buy August 60's -- out of the money, and just where it was post-earnings; no sweat! The sheer amount of meme call-buying forced MMs to buy even more; it's summer time and volume is low; the stock price rises and things are looking good! We've climbed back from the low 50's to the upper 50's! Then, boom, 7/19 and more trade war news. It has nothing to do with the technology sector, but MU goes down regardless, and MMs have to sell. And dear god is theta a bitch.\n\nBy now you've fired all the bullets you're going to fire at this godforsaken stock. You decide to sit on the sidelines and let theta decay take over while you pray at an alter to Sanjay. Meanwhile, all the Chartist fuckheads notice, \"wow, look at that chart; the two data points on 6/25 and 7/19 form a line! And the pre-earnings peak, if you squint, is kinda sorta somewhere in the ballpark of that line! And didn't MU do the same thing last quarter? It'll be in a down trend for awhile I'll sell\". This, combined with the trade war fears, not only put additional marginal sellers into the marketplace, but also drove some \"cautious\" ITM options purchases to OTM. That means that, now as time passes, the deltas on those options shrink rather than grow, causing MMs to sell into a market with low volume-- and few organic buyers: everyone is on vacation or distracted by the other tech sector earnings-- and causes the value of your options to go lower still, further lowering their deltas in the classic MU cycle of self-loathing and despair. We're now deep into the doldrums of summer and the cycle continues: \"Look at the completely **un**interesting movement of Micron stock who wants to trade that? WOW what the hell is going on with Facebook look at that monster run its having!\"--and low volume helps to drive the marginal influence of algos/chartists; even on the upswings, buying pressure from MMs are muted with deltas on your calls smaller than GE's chances of getting back into the DOW.\n\nThen, last Wednesday, 8/8, all the Chartists came out of the woodwork -- \"MU is about to reverse, get in now GOGOGOGO\"; volume Wednesday was anemic -- the only days with lower volume in the past year were a few days in August 2017 and the day after Thanksgiving. The Chartists stopped selling/trading, hoping to confirm the reversal so they can start buying the newly-formed \"uptrend\" at the bottom, thus starting the self-fulfilling prophecy while everyone else was distracted by Elongate. You ignore all the wisdom granted by your past experience, scraping the bottom of your Robinhood account to hop on the meme train and reload one last time. Micron shares finished barely up on the day. You had a glimmer of hope. *This time, it would be different...!*\n\nThen The Idiot downgraded the entire sector, driving sells. Then more trade war news; more selling into the weekend. You suppress the urge to kill yourself. Then Monday comes--[it's up premarket! Then when the market opens, it shoots up over $0.60 from the previous close!](https://imgur.com/r/ronpaulshops/vwMin) ..and then, at the end of the day, for no discernable reason, [down](https://imgur.com/buqOWJb). That's the last straw: >!you're out. You finally give up on your long stock/call options because holy hell fuck this fucking meme stock, now inexplicably down to a forward P/E of 4.5. You sell out your entire position for a 75% loss at the literal bottom right before Micron begins a four-week rebound to $65. You put your meager remains into the current meme trend on WSB: buying AMZN FDs at all-time highs. It looks promising at first: AMZN never goes down! On expiration Friday, up 250% on your play at market open, Trump tweets a threat: he'll direct the Space Force to test EMPs over Seattle if the Seahawks don't stop kneeling. AMZN, being headquartered in Seattle, plummets in response to this news, despite the fact that the Space Force does not yet exist and without considering the possibility that Trump used \"EMP\" as shorthand for \"Electronic Music Player\": all Trump wanted to do was fill the stadium with beats so fresh, no one could possibly stay motionless. Your FDs, nevertheless, expire worthless. The next week AMZN rebounds to new all-time highs. All you have left is $ROPE.!<\n\n**Is Any of this Correct?**\n\nIn broad, oversimplified strokes, the mechanisms underlying how MMs operate are true. As for the story/\"reasons\" behind the MU price movement? No one knows anything and I know less than that.\n\n**What does it Mean if this Correct?**\n\nIt would predict that there will at some point be another runup prior to earnings when:\n\n1. Value investors get back from vacation, realize nothing fundamental has changed with this company or the sector and \"buy low\";\n2. Speculators looking for interesting and/or tradeable products reach the end of earnings season and look to the few companies that announce earnings off-cycle (and contrarian action would say to buy);\n3. We hit September and the buyback adds additional marginal buying pressure, driving prices up; or\n4. Either 1), 2) and/or 3) above add marginal buying pressure to the stock price; the Chartists mistake stars reflected in a pond for the night sky and reenter the market as marginal buyers on the \"uptrend\", driving the stock higher. At this point, the MMs are forced to buy more stock as all our calls gain more deltas, driving the cycle farther until people take profits or contrarians are willing to step in and take the other side of the price action, equalizing buying/selling pressure.\n\nI think it also means that cycle will this NOT repeat again in the next quarterly cycle, or it would at least be greatly muted (let's assume \"expected\" earnings and it doesn't move much post-earnings): the repeat this cycle of the \"downward trend\" is some nice coincidence that allowed chartists to see patterns in randomness. Buying pressure from the buyback should further limit any \"downtrend\" signal that the chartists are relying on, and who the fuck knows what'll happen why are you still reading this wall of text?", "id": "977npc", "created_utc": 1534247238.0, "score": 371, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "This post killed my dyslexic son", "score": 187, "replies": [{"body": "F", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "OP I read 75% of the post and just realized I'm missing out on the current flavor of the month by buying AMZN FDs while it's ATH.\n\nThanks for the $$$ tip!", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "F", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17641402781009674}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "A", "score": -2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4619598090648651}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20552222430706024}, {"body": "F", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20552222430706024}, {"body": "F", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20552222430706024}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05461607128381729}, {"body": "\"the two data points form a line\" i laughed out loud", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "I'll be here all week", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Lost my shit at the spoiler.
