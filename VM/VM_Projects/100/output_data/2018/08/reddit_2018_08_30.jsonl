I showed how incremental production/ deliveries result in profitablity not further losses basically because of same fixed costs. You're just saying losses will continue without even considering how much revenue they will earn on auto. Not counting the sales from energy storage and generation.\n\nNo, I showed how even if production increases to over 50k in the quarter, and the company dramatically improves the gross margins on the Model 3 from roughly 0% to 15%, they still will only generate about $450mm of incremental gross profit in Q3.  As mentioned above, seeing as how they lost over $700mm in Q2, that will not be enough to make them profitable.  Increased S/X sales will get them part of the way there, but even 5k additional sales at an ASP of $95k and gross margins of 25% will only plug about half of the remaining gap.  The company will need to come up with well over $100mm of additional profit from somewhere, and that is again assuming no increase in opex at all.
