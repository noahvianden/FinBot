That means you get from $73.00 to $84.00 = +$11 annually. The trade off with AAPL/tech stocks is typically capital appreciation (Growth) vs dividends... though it seems to be changing for AAPL.\n\n* JPM raised their dividend around 9-12% in each of the last two years. Lets say they raise the $0.56 by 9%, that brings you up to $0.6104 from $56 to $61.04 = +$5.04 annually.\n\n* DIS increased for the last two years around 7-9.9%. Applying a ~7% increase to the semi annual $0.84 dividend gets you from $84 to new dividend of $0.90 $90.00 = $6.00 annually.\n\nAssuming there are dividend increases within those ranges over the year or so, then just from these three examples there is a theoretical annual dividend increase of $22.04.\n\nThe problem may be that you have spread out your holdings and don't have enough shares of stocks that have a higher yield and then ensuring the picks would be consistently and sustainably increasing their dividends.\n\nIf you are planning on having very long term holdings then perhaps look into whether you can join a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) and automatically reinvest the dividends. Going through your broker, you likely would need the holding to pay out enough of a dividend for one share. (Example, share price $10, you need for the single dividend payout to be more than $10, otherwise you just get cash instead of auto buying one share.)
