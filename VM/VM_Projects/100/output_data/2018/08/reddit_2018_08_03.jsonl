I feel as\nIf most people want to \u201cget rich quick\u201d, and expect immediate gains post initial investments, which is fair, but that is not the point of a retirement fund. It\u2019s a patience game of 4-8% a year of growth, on average, until you\u2019re 58 or so, when it then becomes mostly bonds. Losing money happens in the tumultuous cycle that is the stock market. I bet if he held out and didn\u2019t realize his losses, he would be up on his investments overall by now. It is a slow growth process. Not to mention it is important to dollar cost average your investment for these plays over time (for any mutual fund or etf, really). It helps. But Look at the stock market over the past 20-30-40-50 years... that is your time line for retirement, (obviously in the future, though) the market has been a consistent linear line ever since it\u2019s inception. It is not a 5, or even 10 year play. Think long, long, long, term. It\u2019s a smart play to grow your money against inflation, plus gain a few points more. It\u2019s Not a get rich quick and retire early scheme. It\u2019s simple, effective, and safe. Our firm would do a mix of 70% target date,  10% bonds, 20% some sort of ETF based on aggression and risk comforts and perhaps remove some other allocations to retain 5% cash. Roughly. It\u2019s a retirement play with your retirement account, not to be used for your \u201cfun\u201d account well cuz... it\u2019s very boring haha. There are other safe substitutes for a target date fund, but to me, it is the most well-rounded option. \n\nIn regards to the growth fund vs. retirement fund, growth funds are also a great option, but they only include growth companies. We would set up clients with these all the time. But keep he mind, he is comparing one growth stock to one retirement fund. There could be other comparisons that show the complete opposite outcome.\n\nAlso, did not want to reply to the thread, am not much of an arguer and dont want to get into a back and forth.
