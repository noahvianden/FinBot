It's a monthly expiration date which some argue (and I don\u2019t have the data yet to argue against, yet, but I\u2019m colleting it as we go) that MU tends to finish within a very tight window of the max pain value for monthly expirations.  So buying $54 calls right now would be fairly cheap ($72 per contract) and if MU somehow did finish at $57 next Friday they would be up 3.16x ($300 vs $72) which is pretty damned good.  Of course as more people buy lower strike prices, the max pain value will change.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if MU max pain for 8/17 *on* 8/16 is probably going to be $55.  All that said on 7/20 max pain was $55, the day before MU was at $56.22, and with zero negative news at all MU finished that Friday at $55.02.\n\nI\u2019m not doing it, though, not calls at least.  I might consider spreads if MU can have a *few* flat/green days this week.\n\nFor the weekly values for the last few months MU has typically missed by at least 3%, and that\u2019s on the downside.  Plus max pain changes day to day depending on options outstanding.  Consider the 8/3 value.  Max pain for 8/3 *was* $55 at one point, and then by week\u2019s end it was down to $54 (and MU finished at $52.81).\n\nSomething similar has happened with 8/10 max pain.
