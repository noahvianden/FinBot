Now think about Donald Trump. The guy is a thousand times smarter.\n\nTrump invented a totally new concept in economics. The recession vaccine.\n\nStarting by setting expectations super low if he were elected, we had our first recession the day he was elected, with futures hitting a record -5%. But the market recovered fully within a day and then some. Since then, it's been a stream of scandals, fears about russian manipulation, tariffs, etc. Now the market is up over 50% despite us having had hundreds of recessions.\n\nSo at this point, whatever happens, the market will recover within 1 to 24 hours (except $MU obviously).\nThe guy is a genius. By injecting hundreds of microrecessions into the economy, like a vaccine, he has made the market and the economy invincible.\n\nPeople don't realize it yet, but he will be remembered in history books as the smartest economist of all time.\n\nLong live Donnie.
