After the deal is public the gap between the share price and offer price usually closes (eg the stock goes up) but not all the way to the offer price since it must reflect risks and uncertainties that the offer will actually be completed. The difference between the two is the markets assessment of he likelihood of the deal going through. The thing is it can take some time for equilibrium to be found and the stock price to adequately quantify these risks. So the stock will usually be volatile until then.\n\nI would find it extremely unlikely Musk would actually take the company private as you would need some type of financing for this plus the debt already on the balance sheet.
