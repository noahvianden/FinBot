The Oil Crisis (1973 and 1979) was absolutely man-made, though maybe not quite as predictable.  The 1987 crash seems to be a bit harder to nail down, but seems to be a combination of geo-political tensions building up and some seem to blame early computerized trading programs leading to overvaluation and quick sell offs.\n\nMy point is that many of the recessions and depressions the world has suffered range from nearly impossible to predict to \u201cwhen not if\u201d.\n\nAs for 2008 I had more than one friend who sold all their stock/long positions late 2007 saying something big was coming.  They also put off buying homes because they thought something, though none of them knew just how big it would be.  And as you\u2019ve seen from WSB favorite *Big Short* there were people who knew it was coming, plus the ratings agencies were sucking at the ass to ensure every bond/company had amazing ratings because that\u2019s what they were getting paid to do, hand out AAA ratings.\n\nAnd you see similar action today.  HMNY had a buy rating even as it was sliding into oblivion.\n\nSo my question is: do you think as a society that we\u2019ve really progressed beyond recessions and that except for corrections caused by the business cycle we will never see another \u201cunnatural\u201d recession again?

Hell it **could** last forever with perfect foresight.

The better thing to say, especially as a voice that has a vested interest in people putting money into stocks, would be to say that for the immediate and near future that we don\u2019t see any fundamental risks to the economy and that the prudent investment would be to bet on it continuing for now instead of trying to bet against it.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Was it a black swan?
