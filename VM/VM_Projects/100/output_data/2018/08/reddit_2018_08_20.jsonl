The Oil Crisis (1973 and 1979) was absolutely man-made, though maybe not quite as predictable.  The 1987 crash seems to be a bit harder to nail down, but seems to be a combination of geo-political tensions building up and some seem to blame early computerized trading programs leading to overvaluation and quick sell offs.\n\nMy point is that many of the recessions and depressions the world has suffered range from nearly impossible to predict to \u201cwhen not if\u201d.\n\nAs for 2008 I had more than one friend who sold all their stock/long positions late 2007 saying something big was coming.  They also put off buying homes because they thought something, though none of them knew just how big it would be.  And as you\u2019ve seen from WSB favorite *Big Short* there were people who knew it was coming, plus the ratings agencies were sucking at the ass to ensure every bond/company had amazing ratings because that\u2019s what they were getting paid to do, hand out AAA ratings.\n\nAnd you see similar action today.  HMNY had a buy rating even as it was sliding into oblivion.\n\nSo my question is: do you think as a society that we\u2019ve really progressed beyond recessions and that except for corrections caused by the business cycle we will never see another \u201cunnatural\u201d recession again?

Hell it **could** last forever with perfect foresight.

The better thing to say, especially as a voice that has a vested interest in people putting money into stocks, would be to say that for the immediate and near future that we don\u2019t see any fundamental risks to the economy and that the prudent investment would be to bet on it continuing for now instead of trying to bet against it.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Was it a black swan?

You dont plan on retiring ever? Shit you could contribute like $100/month to an IRA thats invested in an index fund and you'd have more than $62k eventually. Thats $25/week. You cant afford $25/week? Mcdonalds workers can afford that\n\nedit* I plugged it in a calculator for you. If you start with $100 and put in $100/month into any index fund (using 7%/year avg return which imo is a conservative estimate) in 40 years you will have over $250,000. \n\nHow old are you? Do you have 40 years left in your work life? If so awesome, $100/month will get you a quarter million dollars by the time you retire. Can you up it to $200/month? Thats only $50/week. I bet you blow more than $50/week on dumb shit already. Now you have half a million. \n\nOnly have 30 working years left? Thats ok. $100/month will get you to $118,368. $200/month will get you $236,735\n\nHell if you only have 15 working years left and can do $200/month you will still end up with $63,125.

Most of us here have \"grown up\" safe portfolios tucked away to grow while we make high risk bets with small percentages of what we actually have. We just dont talk about that gay shit here. \n\nIt sounds like you have the ability to save some money from each check and want to have a good bit of money put away some day. You want to be contributing to an account that just owns an index fund and grows slowly over time. \n\nMoney invested (into broad market funds, not individual stocks) doubles on average every 10 years over the long term. So If i put $50,000 into an index fund today, dont add another cent to it, in 40 years when i retire it will have grown to $800,000. For doing nothing. That is the power of compounding returns over long time periods. Now imagine if i added $200/month to that and allowed that to grow also? \n\nI dont know why they dont teach it much in school but I honestly believe what separates successful people who end up with a comfortable amount of money and losers is contributing consistently to an investment and letting it grow over time. You dont just have to be given a bunch of money or make 150k/year. In my example in the post before to you I showed how starting with literally $0 and adding 200/month into an account invested in the market will leave you with $500,000 come retirement time. You dont have to make much money at all to be able to save $200/month.\n\nI hate recommending this to you in here because it goes completely against what this sub stands for but go check out /r/personafinance and /r/investing and start reading/posting about how to get started with investing your money. Tell them how much you have, how much you can afford to add each month, and what your goals are and they will help you out a lot. \n\nThen in a couple years when youve got a healthy amount invested and growing in some safe shit, come back here and you can learn how to take 5-10% of that are have some fun losing it on options like the majority of the people here do.  \n\nTake this advice and become a happy person who can live their lives comfortably later into their lives.
