Each of these is a research topic in itself. One popular reason is the excessive power of labour over capital. Unions were becoming too strong and growth rates (increasing profits) suffered. Unions wanted to maintain high wages in a market that was struggling. Combined with the oil crisis (probably the biggest factor), states made an active effort to destroy unions and unionization. They essentially chose to decrease power of unions and workers to spur economic growth. If you know something about stagflation, governments essentially gave up full employment to combating rising inflation. Since the 1970s, governments have been implementing Neoliberal policies to do just that. Profits increased, but only for the richest since the 1970s. The lack of unionization and collective bargaining agreements coupled with the increased mobility of capital (ability of companies to move their production over seas, means that workers have not been able to adequately increase wages since the 1970s.
