Because, you used one of the riskiest strategies for what you wanted to be an in and out trade.  You didn't need the upside of a long dated naked call if you only wanted 5 min of exposure.  You were being greedy.  That's it.\n\nRetail traders, in most cases, need to get the direction or volatility correct to be profitable.  Buying an OTM call negatively exposes you to direction as that needs to go in your favor, and depending on what the spot vol is at entrance, you could be exposed negatively to that as well.  Vol is mean reverting, and if you buy OTM at relatively high vol, it has a tendency to contract.  Given the market over the past months, you probably bought on high vol.  I doubt you thought it was going to be ITM in 5 min, so you were looking for extrinsic exposure.\n\nYou need to have a better understanding of the structure of your position, and exactly what exposure you are trying to capture.  From your other posts, it looks like you were trying to capture delta based on TA.  This could have been achieved with any option on the chain depending on if you bought/sold.

My recommendation would be to look into longer dated strategies for a bit and see how the options price reacts to market dynamics.  Then scale down the time-frame until you're hitting that 5min carry time.\n\nAlso, you don't have to necessarily buy an option.  Buying options is usually a stock replacement strategy which is why I say just trading the underlying can be prefferential.
