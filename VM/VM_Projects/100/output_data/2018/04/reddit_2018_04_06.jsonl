{"title": "Trade War DD (seriously)", "selftext": "I've been looking at the trade war implication for most of the day and wanted to give you guys some of my thoughts. As a whole - I think this ends up getting settled without any tariffs being placed and I believe that Trump (yes, that fucking idiot) does have the upper hand. \n\nUS does have a massive trade deficit with China, but when you look at it on a value added basis, it is around half of the 350B stated number. This puts a cap on what the US can tariff until then end up just harming themselves. You can't tariff the iPhone. The US value add portion is closer to 85%, so lets just say most of it. If you look at the 2016 % breakdown, the largest exports are Planes (9%), Cars (~9%), Semis (6.5%), Soybeans (~10%). \n\nNow I think you guys know Soybeans were included in the last retaliation round from China. This was strategically picked. China loves their fucking Soybeans, it is a huge export, they get more tonnage from Brazil and the prices  should adjust according to market pressures that dictate commodities. Ex. Shortage of soybeans, prices rise, futures prices rise, crops are shifted from lower priced to higher, prices stabilize. It also directly attacks Trump's voter base. \n\nCars were also included. Now GM and Ford did 4m units last year in China, not a huge market and there was already a 25% tariff, so this brings it to 50%. You probably don't even lose all those units now as people were already paying through the nose to have a US vehicle. \n\nPlanes was limited to smaller body planes from Boeing, ones that take up a tiny sliver of the backlog. China knows they can't shift orders, both Airbus and Boeing are backed up for years. This is an idle threat, China needs those planes. \n\nAnd thats most of the 50B proposed. If they want to match the other 100B Trump is threatening, that is pretty well the rest of the total imports. We've already said they likely won't move any orders for planes - so they either pay up or fuck off. Semiconductors are needed for all modern tech infrastructure, something that China is a leader in and their is no good substitutes for Intel and NVidia in datacenter. They could shift memory buying away from Micron, but again as it is a commodity this would just shift sales around. WFE equipment for their semi build out includes critical US companies, and the US could choke out any expansion they want.  I would argue that this is actually one of the areas they could best narrow the deficit. Qualcomm is a wildcard here as China may take out their frustrations on them through blocking the NXPI merger out of spite, or the Chinese manufacturers join Apple in not paying Qualcomm for licensing. \n\nSo if we leave out those critical US goods that China needs, they need to get pretty fucking punitive to cause real damage while the US is 20% of total exports for China. \n\nIn the short term, this is extremely damaging. Most of what is happening the market is a compression of the multiple beginning to price a decline in global growth, and EPS estimates being revised as Capex and investment slows due to uncertainty. But most of this attacks Trump's voter base, and he is looking to look like a hero. I would expect more escalation, before it is done but he will eventually realize the long term damage, make a deal, twist the numbers, and look like a hero to his base of voters. \n\nGood luck everyone. \n\nLittle update:\n\nTop whipping boys:\nApple - Unlikely, brings too many jobs. \nGM - already happened, incrementally a problem.\nQualcomm - Biggest risk in my opinion. \nBoeing - Unlikely to do further. \nBroadcom - Unlikely, Singapore company formerly, very critical components.\nTXI - yes a risk, more legacy tech. \nMicron - Yes a risk.\nNike - would be very unpopular to do so in China. \nApplied Materials - Unlikely.
