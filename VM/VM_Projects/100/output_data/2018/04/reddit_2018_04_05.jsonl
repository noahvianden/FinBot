With 400,000 pre orders of the Model 3, there's a lot of dough to be realized for them in the future and all those people who put down those deposits haven't exactly ran out to buy a Chevy volt... you know why? Because there are critical differences in the products. Chevy slapped a Battery in a car just to say they have EV's... VW and others are announcing they are going to have EV products 3-4 years from now... long before they even get to the show room, Tesla will have figured out all these production issues... so you need to look at this business through a different lens... Tesla is re-inventing the entire supply chain and integration of power storage and supply. Do you know anything about Tesla's supercharger network? You can't even drive your Chevy volt out of your home zone whereas you could take your Tesla almost anywhere you want. I actually don't think I've even seen a Volt on the street whereas I see Model S and Model X all the time... The big investments into the supply chain, charging infrastructure and overall vertical integration into the manufacturing are what will keep the divide quite large between Tesla and other manufacturers now and in the future. \n\nAlso, the reason they require deposits is because it's how they are able to go to the bank and get financing for the production of these vehicles... are they supposed to just say \"hey, fill out this form if you're interested in a car from us and we'll make them\"? ... the fact that hundreds of thousands of people put $1,000 down to have the chance to buy their product in the future is a great insurance policy to ensure that if they make these products, people will be willing to buy them. Most businesses have a hard time forecasting demand whereas Tesla has a system to predict that based on deposits. So it's not a scam, it's smart business. No one in the world would go out and finance their operations if they couldn't prove there was a market for their product.\n\nI know you hate comparisons but in 1999 people thought it was absurd that Amazon was valued more than Sears based on sales and profit, etc.... look how that turned up.

But that is OK because these companies want to make money and will surely support Tesla vehicles as well so Tesla driver's don't lose anything.

Also early Tesla adopters have free access to the network and Tesla is working to keep costs as low as possible for new users... Otherwise, the other charging stations from other providers are placed more randomly because they are not all part of the same network... This means you can easily get stranded and have to do a lot of work to find a nearby charging station outside of the supercharger network. Tesla's chargers are also about 3x more efficient and faster than standard chargers that you're referencing. So no, the non-tesla stations are not an equivalent replacement. You would have to do significant pre-planning and mapping to make a trip off the super charger network whereas on the Super charger network, you are guaranteed to have available and RELIABLE options designed to make it possible for essentially unlimited range in your Tesla. \n\nThe deposits are not \"insurance\" but they are a much more reliable mechanism for forecasting demand than no deposit at all. Also, most people don't just have $1,000 to drop on something they won't be getting a return on for 1-3 years... so sure, $1,000 isn't much but it is enough to weed out false demand and give them something to leverage for manufacturing demands. There's a company called Nikola One which is not taking deposits for their EV trucks and claim hundreds of thousands of \"pre-orders\", which is just a form to fill on their website... that's not a very good way to actually measure demand... a small deposit puts a barrier up to prevent over manufacturing, which would be much more detrimental to the business than being a little slower than expected in delivering cars. \n\nAll I am comparing Amazon and Tesla on is the infrastructure investments which hurts their balance sheet and profitability early on in the business... Gigafactories, charging stations, R&D, etc are not going to pay back for a while but over the long term it will become a significant competitive advantage just like Fulfillment centers, AWS and other forms of software development gives Amazon it's competitive edge today...

The Tesla network is much more well thought out and organized. Either way, you are only validating that there is a large need for the charging network just like we need gas stations everywhere for fossil fuel cars. There will be many options in the future, Tesla's will probably always be cheaper, more efficient and optimized for longer trips where many other companies probably wont place charging stations outside of major markets... For example, I was in Whistler, British Columbia this summer and was amazed to see several Tesla charging stations in town. No other company is going to try to bring their EV stations to a market like that, which again, makes it harder to purchase an EV without those infrastructure components. \n\nConsidering they haven't delivered most of the cars yet, I'm not sure you can rely on those statistics. Either way, every Car Tesla has manufactured to date has found an owner... The backlog is so large that even if that number holds true, it will just move other people up the list and 30% of 400,000 is still a significant multiple more than any other EV car on the market. Regardless of whether someone put the $1k on credit or not still validates that there is a demand for the cars. .. I use my credit card like a debit card. Even if I didn't I am sure that most people who did use their Credit like that would have already asked for a refund to stop paying ridiculous interest on the deposit... not sure why that's relevant either way, 400,000 people put down $1,000 for the chance to buy the car in the future, pretty impressive considering you could have just went out and bought any other car and used that $1,000 towards a down payment... that says people want their product more than the competition... even if it turns out to be only 30% of deposit holders accept delivery, that is still 120,000 cars = $4.2B in sales... and once they can manufacture and deliver faster and catch up on back orders, they will get new sales pretty quickly just like they do for Model S and X currently... there is nothing wrong with an \"On demand\" manufacturing process versus just shitting out thousands of cars without knowing if they will be sold today or a year from now... most people don't realize how the car business works... Factories (Ford, GM, etc) sell cars at WHOLESALE prices to Dealerships (Franchises). So they can inflate production and sales numbers in a sense that the Dealers might not actually sell those cars for 3-12 months after they get them from the factory, but the factory can record those as actual sales because they were purchased from the dealerships...

He was using the Auto Pilot feature improperly, just as if you were breaking the speed limit and smashed into a wall... driver error. You could counter argue that Cars and manufacturers shouldn't make cars that go faster than 70MPH... isn't that a design flaw which enables the user to increase the risk of death or accident by improper use of the cars system? We know that the odds of survival in high speed crashes are much lower, so why are car manufacturers allowed to produce cars that are capable of traveling faster than the speed limit?  According to the crash logs, the car warned the driver to take control, which they didn't. Most other cars don't warn you when you're in danger, you just crash.
