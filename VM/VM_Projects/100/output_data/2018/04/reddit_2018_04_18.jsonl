{"title": "Real DD for Grubhub: Expect a massive beat on 5/1", "selftext": "A quick primer on what Grubhub is:\n\nGrubhub is an online and mobile food-ordering company that connects diners with local restaurants. Diners use their website or their app to order food from local restaurants, and then Grubhub will deliver the food from the restaurant to the Diners' residence.\n\n---\n\nTop line relevent data:\n\n- Average Alexa Ranking for Q1 2017: 4401.867\n- Average Alexa Ranking for Q1 2018: 2241.78\n\n- Organic Searches in Q1 2017: 6.911m\n- Organic Searches in Q1 2018: 13.341m\n\nGrubhub's website rank has halved in the past year, and their organic search hits have increased by 90%.\nReminder that Grubhub's business model is:\n\n- Customer goes on to their website\n- Customer buys food\n\nThis means that their revenue should be directly proportional to the traffic their website gets. Having your Alexa rank halve from 4400 to 2200 should indicate a traffic increase of 80-90%, and organic searches would seem to confirm this. This doesn't mean that Revenue will go up 80-90%, as not all visits buy something. I would conservatively estimate a revenue increase of 62% to $253m; the street expects a revenue increase of 46.9% to $230m. Also, if you take a look at when the analysts made their predictions, you see that all of them made their predictions a long ass time ago before this data was even finished.\n\nAs for the bottom line, know that Grubhub gets the overwhelming majority of its revenue from the United States, with the rest coming from the United Kingdom. This means they should be able to take full advantage of the tax cuts.\n\n--- \n\nReasoning + Proof of position:\n\n- Netflix previously reached an ATH on March 5th at $331.44. After it beat its earnings, it surpassed this ATH and hit $336.\n- Grubhub's ATH is currently $110.53 reached on Marth 12th. Similar performance after a beat should land it at $112.\n\nGrubhub reports premarket on 5/1, so buy the 5/4 calls.\n\nPositions:\n\n- 2x $102 5/4 Call\n- 2x $103 5/4 Call\n- 8x $104 5/4 Call\n- 2x $105 5/4 Call\n- Proof: https://imgur.com/a/Ci0lr\n\n---\n\nSources (Note: I cannot upload the csv files showing raw data so ill just snip the chart form of the data)\n\n- Alexa Rankings: https://i.imgur.com/ftdWikW.png\n- Organic Searches: https://i.imgur.com/H8jp5tO.png\n\n---\n\nTrack record: \n\nOnly other \"real DD\" I posted was this [OSTK put post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/84nlza/short_ostk_actual_dd_trade_proof_inside_earnings/), but will do more later if this one works out.\n\n---\n\nEdit: full disclosure if $GRUB somehow hits $112+ **before earnings** im selling my options \n\nAlso, at time of this post (9:00AM PDT, noon Eastern) $GRUB was trading at $102.33\n\n---\n\nEdit: rip me", "id": "8d6s60", "created_utc": 1524067497.0, "score": 270, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 186, "replies": [{"body": "I actually posted about a great stock last night, realized what I had just done, then quickly went back and deleted the post before something terrible happened to the stock.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Too late, I already saw it and bought MU", "score": 42, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2773362100124359}, {"body": "what stock, fag? pm me", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "$vrx", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31017765402793884}], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2264278084039688}, {"body": "- Owns Grubhub Shares In Paper Trading Account", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1185549721121788}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03605696186423302}, {"body": "Damn.

Ofc not all hedge funds actually have hedging strategies in modern times, but that's traditionally what they were about and how they got their name. And even today most hedge funds that are interested in long term positions definitely have hedging strategies. \n\nK let's use a real life example:\n\nI scanned for a $20 stock with about 30% IV 60 days out. I found one - ticker: GHL. One standard deviation for June 15th would be a $2.66 (13%) range, and the $20 puts for June 15th have the bid/ask range settling at $1.20. Fair value is actually $1.00 but let's assume $1.20 to be as generous to you as possible.\n\nSo you buy 10 companies with exactly these numbers and youre right 50% of the time with simple put hedge play:\n\n2.66 -1.20 = 1.46*5 = $7.30 profit\n\n1.20 * 5 = $6 loss\n\nTotal: $1.30 per share profit when you're right only half the time.\n\nThis is simple shit kid. IV affects the option price and standard deviation of the stock at the same time. The only time this would be bad is if you expect IV to fall dramatically off a cliff in the very near term and never come back. At which point, you should hedge with an option spread instead of buying shares at all.\n\nOf course the standard deviation is a very conservative estimate too. GHL has earnings on 5/3 and their last ER the stock moved up $3.74 (22%) in just a few days. So if you buy good companies you've done DD on your risk/reward is almost for sure even better since when you hedge your loss is fixed and you returns are potentially infinite.\n\nGot any more excuses for me to debunk?
