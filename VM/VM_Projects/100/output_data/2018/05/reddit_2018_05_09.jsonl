Hoe do you decide?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It looks like I buy a lot of calls, but tbh my strategy is more variable-net. In this current market environment, my decision (to go net long vs neutral/short) was primarily driven with top-down analysis, and I chose the single-names based off bottoms-up. Someone else asked how I avoided the \"volocaust\" of February - that's because at that time, I didn't think it made sense to be net-long, and I actually had more puts/shorts than I had calls.\n\nThe only reason I'm net long at the moment is because I think there's a lot of untapped beta that will bolster returns going forward. I am not claiming I'm at all the best single-name stock picker, but I think the current market environment is such that beta will boost all long bets; a rising tide raises all ships. I think one could easily do just as well buying calls on the QQQ, but I used my judgement on which single-names might accelerate faster than others.\n\nMy top-down view was based off 1. the pullback of CTAs from equity markets since February, resulting in long-depressed volumes, and 2. strong but non-reactionary earnings, resulting in valuation compression going forward. If you truly believed that we're on the cusp of a correction, valuation compression could possibly be the \"new normal\", however, my perspective was that once the market was more at ease with the earnings releases, volume would come back, CTAs / risk-parity funds might re-enter the space further bolstering momentum.\n\nIn terms of exit, my strategy is to hold until valuation reaches pre-compression levels.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01966850273311138}, {"body": "And what calls are you buying moving forward?
