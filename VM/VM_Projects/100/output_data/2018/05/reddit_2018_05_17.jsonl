{"title": "Just finished blowing up my first account...", "selftext": "This happens to a lot (most?) people, but I don't ever see any posts about it. Nobody ever hears from the losers, but we should expect 50% or so of our participants to be losers. So I'm swallowing the pride and posting about my losses.\n\nActually before I start I should say, I didn't \"blow up\" my account; rather, it has been a slow bleed over the past few years. If you the reader find yourself bleeding out slowly maybe some of what I have to say can be useful to you. \n\n------\n\nBelow are some reflections and lessons learned regarding my adventure down the options path. When I started in 2015 interest rates were basically zero; today I'm flattening what positions I have open and moving my \"mad money\" (obligatory Jim Cramer is a faggot) all to IG bonds and USTs. 3% a year is better than what I've gotten for the past few years.\n\nI started in mid 2015 with just under $15,000. When I started this journey I made a mental stop that I would flatten and get out if I ever drew down by 50% - that was my hard limit. I will probably be back at some point in the future but for the near-term I have other things in life to focus on: career, family, friends, personal growth, and so on. \n\nMy introduction to the world of options came very early on from the TastyTrade crew, like many on this sub. I still maintain all these years later that I have never learned more in 2 years about anything than I have about finance from Tastytrade. I appreciate their research, their content, and their desire to make this world better for you & me despite having lost money trading options \"a la TastyTrade\". I don't believe that my individual performance reflects negatively on the content and product they create. \n\n-------\n\nI began in the summer of 2015 just before Brexit, and made a cool 10% or so selling credit spreads and Iron Condors during that volatility inflation. I didn't know the intricacies of what I was doing - just that \"Iron Condors are good and you should sell them\". Thinking I am a genius and stumbled upon a winner I just kept doing what was working most of the way thru 2016. I had some up months and some down months, but the essence of my strategy was simply to put on defined risk spreads with >50% POP and hope for the best. \n\nKnowing that the 2016 election was going to be a shitshow miles in advance, and also knowing that the P/E multiple was historically high, I was among the crowd that expected a big drop in the markets given a Trump election. Well, I was very wrong, and experienced my first series of bad trades: I bought put verticals on the equity indexes ahead of the election, entering positions way too big for my account size, and had my lunch during the \"Trump Bump\". I went into 2017 with a loss on my portfolio, down to ~$11,000. \n\nWe probably all remember the markets of 2017. Ultra-compressed volatility, very slow grind upwards on little volume or news why. \"don't fight the fed\", \"buybacks\", whatever. It doesn't matter the \"why\". I was still selling Iron Condors every month, and battling the ITM call sides like clockwork. I would have had a more enjoyable time blowing that money at the strip club. By summertime I decided that that wasn't working anymore, so I dove deeper into \"strategies\" - still defined risk, but complex spread strategies that were a) too big for my account still and b) more complex than necessary anyway. Think Broken-Wing Butterflies, Diagonal Spreads, etc. Pick a few losers and be wrong about volatility expanding (it didn't all year) and you've got the recipe for another big draw-down. \n\nI said \"fuck it\" and joined the long-only crowd about Thanksgiving 2017, and combined with my lucky pick on being short UST's since around then I didn't have the worst year in 2017. Down small. At the end of the year I decided that what I was doing generally wasn't working - that spread trading was essentially a zero-sum game and that if I was going to make any money trading options, it had to be naked. So as you can see the motif by now, I was right but for the wrong reasons. \n\nI started 2018 long equity deltas and short bond deltas, with about $10,000. Thru January so-far-so-good. Volmageddon happened, but I wasn't hurt too too bad as my positions were defined-risk debit call spreads (or put spreads on TLT). I took this opportunity to get into naked options via the Sector Spider ETFs. Sold some straddles, some naked puts, etc. Feb-April and did okay, maybe broke even. However, I was still trading too big: I'd have 4 winners get wiped out by 1 loser and have to start over again a month later. Notable bad trades include short call in XLI at the second of the double-bottom in march, and the call side of short straddles in metals and oil. \n\nCombine those run-of-the-mill bad trades with a bad earnings play in AAPL, and losing my shirt on SLV, GLD and XOP this week brings me to $7,000 almost on the dot. So I flattened today. Being wrong = being wrong no matter how right you think you should be. \n\nI'll be back (probably) at some point but for now I'm just doing a 1-lot covered call on TLT while holding shares in the meantime. 3% APY paid monthly is better than I've done so far in my options trading career. Getting some extra juice from the short calls as interest rates continue to rise isn't so bad either. In the meantime, I've learned a ton not just about finance, but about myself and about decision making. TastyTrade doesn't promise success in trading options, but they maintain that you'll learn a lot about making decisions and about statistics. I can say for certain that that has been the case for me. I've re-ignited a desire for learning and knowledge I haven't had in over a decade - for that I'm grateful. \n\nTakeaways from the last ~2 years:\n- Trade your account size, not your ambition. Many (most?) of my losing trades would have been less lose-y or even profitable had I held to expiration. I flattened out of trades going against me too early many times because the losses were unacceptable.\n\n- Don't touch positions once you put them on. Rolling up/down/into anything 99.9% of the time results in the same position for a worse price. In other words: let's say you sold a strangle for $1.00. Your call gets tested, so you roll the put up to a straddle for an additional $1.00. Well the elephant in the room is that that straddle's market price today (ignoring your current positions) is $3.00 - you basically got paid $2.00 for a $3.00 straddle. Now you're in it to expiry for sure you stupid idiot.\n\n- Spreads trade nothing like naked options. Naked short options are almost always paying you extrinsic value via theta as time elapses, whereas an underwater credit spread can result in extrinsic value and theta working against you. Holding underwater (theta against you) credit spreads in my experience does not yield results - better to close and re-deploy. \n\n- Static delta is nothing like dynamic delta. My biggest mistake (other than trade size) was thinking of delta as one thing, as opposed to thinking of static and dynamic delta as two separate beasts. Because my account is so small I couldn't really take any significant static positions in any underlyings; adding or subtracting \"some delta\" to get more or less flat via spreads does not work. Markets move - your dynamic delta moves too. \n\n- Have core positions. This ties into the point above, but having an idea of \"what to do\" with options is much easier when you already have a core position. Too often I didn't know \"what to do\" but instead of doing nothing i \"went neutral\" via an IC or similar. OPTIONS ARE NOT CORE POSITIONS (except synthetic longs/shorts) - the deltas change and can change rapidly as markets move.\n\n- Duration is your friend. Every time I decided to get cute and trade options with <7 DTE I got burned. I'd win a few small spreads to get some confidence and then give it all back on a spread moving against me. \n- As always , the standard advice applies: Trade small, keep a journal, have an opinion, have a plan. \n\nAnyway guys thanks for everything. I've had a good time and other than stress my life hasn't been impacted negatively by trading options. All told I still feel like I got out ahead - I paid a little over 7 grand for 2 years' of knowledge, experience, community, passion, and an interesting hobby and hopefully career someday. That's still a better deal than the local university.

I have a dispersion trade on right now (long some street vol a d short the index vol). When i delta hedge, do I hedge at realized vol pr implied vol? Do I beleive in sticky strike or sticky delta when hedging? Where on tasty trade does it tell you how to do this? If tasty trade actually told you how to trade options they would have 5 viewers because no one wants to learn the math. If they told you to buy options they would have  no viewers because people will lose more frequently trading long vol and not delta hedging.

Once you factor things like that in, your 10 profitable strategies on paper in backtesting might become 1-2 in real life.\n\n- intrinsic volatility.
