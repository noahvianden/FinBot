R&D spend goes through cycles based on the project phase. When the shift is on fundamental research, the funds spent by R&D are low. When it's only development, the funds spent on R&D are high.

", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "**Straw man**\n\nA straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be \"attacking a straw man.\"\n\nThe typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., \"stand up a straw man\") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (\"knock down a straw man\") instead of the opponent's proposition.This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery \"battle\" and the defeat of an \"enemy\" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.\n\nStraw man tactics in the United Kingdom can be known as an Aunt Sally, after a pub game of the same name, where patrons threw sticks or battens at a post to knock off a skittle balanced on top.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": ">That does not say all project efficiencies.
