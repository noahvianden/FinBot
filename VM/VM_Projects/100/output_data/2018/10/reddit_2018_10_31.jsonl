Please correct me if I misunderstood anything.\n\n1615$ is the strike price of the option which means if the price of the amazon stock exceeds 1615$, the option-holder can exercise the option.\n\nAVG COST is the cost of the contract itself (the premium?).\n\nAMZN BREAKEVEN PRICE is the price the amazon stock needs to reach for the option-holder to have a profit of +-0$ and is calculated by (Strike-Price + AVG COST).\n\nEquity is = (Current Price * 100 * Contracts)\n\nThe guy paid (AVG COST * 100 * Contracts) for the options (= 60.300$)\n\nEXP DATE means that the option has to either be exercised or expires worthless (?)\n\nWhat I don't understand is how the Option's initial price and current price are determined.
