", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Considering I am a software engineer who not only deals with AWS on a daily basis at a professional level, but who also uses them for freelance and hobby activities, they are in no way similar to sub prime mortgages.\n\nI disagree here.  Most of AWS's big customers are tech startups which are only minimally or not even profitable at all.  They have very high costs of capital.  Using AWS is a way of accessing capital assets (ie: servers) to run their businesses at a lower implied cost of capital than they could finance their own acquisition of server hardware in the marketplace.  There are a lot of characteristics that are in common between AWS customers and subprime borrowers.  Poor income relative to the value of the assets they wish to control.  A high cost of capital.  And generally less stability in their overall business models or lives.  The very definition of subprime from a credit perspective.\n\nSo if the tech startups run into trouble, eventually AWS will feel it in a big way.  AWS is effectively their financier, and currently does a very good business at such due to the strength in the startup sector.\n\n>My personal use server costs $5 a month. \n\nYour particular \\*personal\\* case is rare, and isn't too meaningful in the overall discussion of AWS's customer base.  \n\n>It's not like they just lend you a server rack and you pay a mortgage on it. \n\nThat's basically what they do in the financial sense of things.  And remember, a loan is only as good as the ability of the borrower to pay on it.  Yes, the actual server rack sits on AWS property, so if you stop paying the loan, they can seize and sell the capacity to someone else.  But if a significant number of tech startups simultaneously fail, AWS could conceivably have a large amount of capacity sitting idle and certainly not earning those great returns that they're accustomed to.  \n\n>It's more like you pay a guy at the beach to rent the jetski.\n\nI don't see a lot of difference.  The jetski rental guy is vulnerable to the economic cycle as well.  And if his rents get out of control, then others set up jetski rentals right a few steps away.  Hence reducing the upside, and potentially amplifying the downside.  I guess my point is, AWS is very intertwined with the economic fortunes of its customers, and from what I can see, its customer base is dominated by a lot of unprofitable or only minimally profitable tech startups who use AWS as a way of accessing infrastructure for a lower implied cost of capital than they could achieve with their own access to capital markets.
