Streaming currently makes up 40% of music sales, but will likely reach 70% within the next   \ndecade. In the US, streaming is already 65%. Spotify has no original content or unique barriers to entry, so their margins will continue to be pressured by larger companies who use streaming as a loss leader, like Apple, Google, and Amazon.

A PE this high would also be hard to justify in such a slow growing and volatile industry.
