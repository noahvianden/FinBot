I don't trade it frequently, because it does irrational crazy shit.\n\nA few points though:\n\n* You don't need to believe a company is going to go bankrupt to short it. You can just believe it's way overvalued\n* The stock going up doesn't prove that shorts are irrational, any more than a stock going down doesn't prove that investors are irrational. There's a spectrum of possible futures, but only one can actually happen. If I say \"I think there's a decent chance this roll of the die doesn't result in a six\" and place a bet on it, but a six gets rolled, that doesn't make me irrational. Sometimes unlikely shit happens. That's why it's called unlikely, not impossible.\n\nI'm going to assume you asked in good faith though, and make a bit of the bear case. My understanding of the short thesis is that there are a few catalysts that might drive the stock significantly lower:\n\n* Tesla has [a $920 million 0.25% convertible issue](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stocks-surge-puts-convertible-bonds-in-the-money-1533667505) due Feb. 27, 2019, which would be convertible into common at a price of $359.8676 per share. If $TSLA is trading below that, they'll have to pay back that nearly-billion-dollars in cash. That'll be a huge hit to their sheet.\n* Similarly, $1.4B in convertible bonds are due in early 2021 with similar terms.\n* Musk has promised both [profitability and positive cash-flow](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/13/elon-musk-tweets-late-at-night-tesla-will-be-profitable-and-cash-flow-positive.html) in both quarters of 2H 2018. A failure to hit those metrics will put further pressure on Musk via the board to be more restrained in his forward-looking statements. A TSLA without bombastic growth promises is not a $50B TSLA, as no DCF or industry comp analysis prices it there without some *aggressive* growth assumptions\n* A debt raise will be difficult and expensive for TSLA, as bonds are rated as B-.\n* An equity raise will almost certainly force those convertible notes to be paid as cash, rather than equity, due to dilution.\n* In 2019, competition will be entering the market with Jaguar and Mercedes entering at the high end. These challenge Tesla's more profitable models, putting downward pressure on both volume and margin.\n* All of this tight cash in 2019 means they will not have the funding to open up new plants. That means the Semi is vaporware, and there isn't significant upside on the production side of things for existing models. By 2020, the Model S & X will start to show that they're a bit long in the tooth, and so the plant will need to be re-tooled to update the body styles. This further diverts from actual growth opportunities.\n\nThese are all real concerns.
