I haven't really posted in this sub, but I've been active on RealTesla and I've been avidly watching and investing in Tesla since late 2012.\n\nThis quarter, Tesla is likely to show a GAAP profit one way or another. It is very, very hard for them post a GAAP profit without selling ZEV credits. Possible, but hard. That's mostly due to still low-ish gross margin on the Model 3 and still high depreciation relative to revenue. In other words, they are still ramping up to utilize the overall capacity they have built.\n\nBut the most interesting thing about Q3 from an investor's point of view is the cash generation. It is possible to show a GAAP negative earning and still generate a lot free cash flow. That's mainly due to the cash conversion cycle. I've posted about this on RealTesla, but I'll repost it here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/9ivnaw/updated\\_analysis\\_of\\_q3\\_profit\\_estimate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/9ivnaw/updated_analysis_of_q3_profit_estimate/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I want to note that liquidity is the central focus of investors, especially the bears. So investors will be looking at their cash and credit situation as the #1 metric. Also, since depreciation and stock based compensation are such large portions of their GAAP losses, both of which are non-cash items, it is quite possible to generate lots of cash while reporting a GAAP loss.  \n>  \n>Last quarter, they had a $-130 million loss from operations while reporting a GAAP loss around $700 million. They will be very much cash flow from ops positive this quarter.  \n>  \n>They will ship roughly double the number of Model 3\u2019s this quarter and the cash conversion cycle will mean massive cash generation. I know already that there are quite a few of you that will scream that they didn\u2019t pay their suppliers as the accounts payable will increase dramatically. But the days payable outstanding (DPO) staying exactly the same as it has for the last two quarters will mean massive cash generation. One can go back and calculate DPO from previous quarters. With \\~80 days of DPO which is much lower than it has been at times, Tesla is paying suppliers for production from 80 days ago on a rolling basis through the year while collecting payments, mostly COD for vehicle deliveries. The average difference is double the deliveries in Q3 versus Q2. An analyst asked about this during the last ER and Deepak confirmed that the effect is in the magnitude of $23,000 per vehicle.  \n>  \n>This means there isn\u2019t a liquidity crisis now that we know they are delivering lots of cars. As Tesla said before, the Model 3 program will generate cash.  \n>  \n>I think some people make the mistake in thinking that GAAP losses means cash losses. Or that a meager GAAP profit means meager cash increase. That is not the case. I am modeling about $1 billion positive cash flow from operations and $500+ million net gain in cash in Q3. The final result depends on the amount of collateralized lease borrowing. That is with a GAAP profit of $15 million with $100 million in ZEV credits which still gives them plenty for Q4 if they choose to sell it then. I don\u2019t think they need it for Q4.  \n>  \n>This effect extends into Q4 at least. It gets more complicated in Q1 though, as international deliveries start and we don\u2019t have a good idea on their volume expansion.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I think it's cool but ultimately not relevant in the long run though. Sure it gives them cash but it also means they need to keep more cash on hand because of the higher volume.\n\nThe bear nonsense about the debt being a huge problem is FUD. Nothing is stopping them from just rolling the debt forward. In fact they'll be taking on more debt for the China Gigafactory.

They lowered capex and did layoffs in an attempt to show the world that they are \"a real company.\" As a result, cash is the number one issue in terms of the bear investment thesis and central to the slew of attacks in the media and elsewhere.\n\nAs Tesla's utilization of their PP&E increases and they get better gross margin on the Model 3, they will be generating free cash flow while the effects of the cash conversion cycle wane somewhat. So I think Q3 is about cash... and Q4 is about operational efficiency and gross margins to show a 2nd quarter of profits so that they are seen as a sustainable business.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Wow. \n\nSo you really believe the cash issues are just a bogus narrative that stemmed from efforts to *show discipline*?\n\nThis is genuinely interesting.

If that is not related to free cash flow, please explain. \n\nWhat would exactly determine the difference between the two stories would be the areas of cutting.

", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It is two things... they had to fix Model 3 production in the past year. The plan the whole time was basically this, but with a higher cash cushion. The continual delays on production and difficulties caused them to run the cash balance down much more than they had hoped. So the other thing is to show operational efficiency and raise gross margins. Last time, the Model X program ended up running right into the teeth of the Model 3 program spend. Therefore it became difficult to separate the health of the Model S and X business apart from the Model 3 ramp, which included R&D, PP&E capex, and scaling sales, service, and charging.\n\nThe upcoming projects as a percentage of revenue is much smaller. The Model 3 is likely the last bet the company program.\n\nIf the market and the capital markets were willing to continue to give Tesla plenty of freedom to not show profit, I am sure that Tesla would have taken that route if they could. Their lack of execution on the Model 3 production put them in a situation that cash was running much tighter with a 2 quarter delay and therefore the media campaign against them could actually hurt customer perception. They had to then show operational efficiency as a business to suppliers, customers, and investors.\n\nThey made adjustments to the business and now that they turned the corner on production and gross margin in Q2, they didn\u2019t need more cash.

Excellent read for anyone \n\n*edit: \n>Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man's Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.\n\n>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "I'm already flush with that...", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12191996723413467}, {"body": "Stay because you can't afford to leave", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03323231637477875}, {"body": "underrated comment", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23223435878753662}, {"body": "Jokes on me that's why I lose money in the first place", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.045901283621788025}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.010451623238623142}, {"body": "Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man's_Search_for_Meaning\n***\n^HelperBot ^v1.1 ^/r/HelperBot_ ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Please ^message ^/u/swim1929 ^with ^any ^feedback ^and/or ^hate. ^Counter: ^216432", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30800285935401917}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.010451623238623142}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0}, {"body": "He said in his blog that he got shit load of books and he can't keep many at all and asked people not to send anymore.", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "Link to blog pls?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "www.martinshkreli.com", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": ">After midnight, the floor on which I stay is populated by some unruly inhabitants who insist on reciting rap song lyrics, quite audibly, in the hallway to which my room is adjoined.

Tesla isn't overvalued;  this year, Netflix will have less revenue than Tesla, yet it's market value is 3 times as much.  If anything, other car companies are highly undervalued based on their revenue, and still no one wants to invest in them because they're not growing anymore.  Tesla is bigger now than it has ever been, and it continues to grow about 50% year after year after year, with the exception of this year where it'll grow x2-3 times over due to the Model 3.    The entire thesis behind Tesla going bankrupt depends entirely on the idea that the only man in history to run more than one multi-billion dollar company has poor business sense.\n\nThis is why I only mess with LEAPs.
