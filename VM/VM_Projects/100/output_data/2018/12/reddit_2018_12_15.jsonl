Investing in companies that provide good dividend growth over time have consistently outperformed the SP500 over long time frames. In this way you turbo charge your compound interest through higher dividend yields on your initial price, and through the appreciation of the stock price itself. Think about it this way, you are buying more shares with the dividends from your previous shares. The new shares also pay dividends which can purchase even more shares. This cycle continues, resulting in a rising passive income that only grows faster the longer you participate in this strategy.
