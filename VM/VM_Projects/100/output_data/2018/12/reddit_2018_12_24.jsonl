Even if SUV and crossover sales are increasing, the luxury car market will be around for years to come. Tesla is leading that market.\n\nThe sedan market has been declining, and the only sedans doing well compared to previous sales are those with a cult like following. We also need to consider that Tesla model 3 sales are possibly inflated over their actual monthly demand, since Tesla is quickly chewing through years of backlog within months. We don't know what the actual demand will be going forward, but if you save up orders for 2 years and run though most of them in a couple months, you can't expect that level of demand to continue after the backorders are filled.\n\nI expect that Tesla is only leading right now because they are selling more cars in a month than there is actual demand in a month due to the years of backlog orders. We will see if I am right when they have to rely on nothing but new orders. For the USA, that might be happening now until they can make the $35k model, which will be much less profitable than the current models.\n\n> I do expect Tesla to face problems, but I don't think this recession is the big one (unless the fool takes us to war).

(If the arctic holds)\n\nWe will have to see, but don't be surprised Tesla is the first car company to fall if we go into a recession. In a recession, being able to sell cheap cars and have a healthy savings to account for reduced sales is important. Ford was able to survive without needing government assistance because they had a rainy day fund.

Let's assume Tesla is really making cars at 6k/week and they sustain that through all of next year. That's a little over 300k sales. Last we heard about a year or so ago was that there was 450k reservations. Reports are saying that almost a quarter of reservations were cancelled, so now we are down to 337k reservations. As of last quarter they have sold about 146k cars, so as of Q3 we are down to about 191k reservations. Let's assume a 5k/week average this quarter, that's another 65k orders, so we are down to 126k orders.\n\nEven if I am off, it's clear they really don't have many reservations left, and clearly not enough to last them a year especially when you consider  people cancelling due to a recession. \n\nI think there is a good reason Tesla won't release reservation numbers, because they are almost gone.\n\n> I'm much more worried about Climate change or Trump taking us to war or some other sabotage to save his own skin than I am about the market downturn for Tesla.

In a few days we'll know December numbers and have a more accurate picture of the demand for the EXPENSIVE versions without the aid of the waiting list. \n\nNot only there is a waiting list for international high end and a waiting list for all markets for the Black Model 3, there are sales outside the list that are already occurring.
