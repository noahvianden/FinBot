Unless you see massive potential about the ability of Dell or Lenovo to grow their PC business, there's not much reason to be excited about smartphone growth either. Apple's growth as a luxury product maker is limited entirely by the growth in the number of upper middle class people abroad who can afford their products. Americans upgrading every few years will slow as devices last longer and offer fewer enhancements.\n\nAnd Apple doesn't engage in the low-margin race-to-the-bottom products that are actually growing in developing markets.\n\nIn the American market, Apple products have a selling point due to ecosystem. But their approach to their ecosystem is openly hostile to people who want to own 1-2 Apple products but aren't interested in iMessage or iCloud or Apple Health or Apple Watch, etc. This will bite them in the long run as everyone tries to build compelling high end devices (Microsoft with Surface, Google with Pixel). Whereas Microsoft is fully embracing Android and trying to build the same integration with Windows that Macs and iPhones have. They would do it for iOS too, but Apple refuses to build the APIs.\n\nOutside the American market, no one gives a shit about the \"Apple ecosystem\". iMessage will never displace WhatsApp or WeChat. Apple Pay will never displace PayTM or WeChat Pay or even Venmo/PayPal. iCloud barely displaces anything at all and consumer facing cloud isn't that profitable to begin with. People abroad buy iPhone because it's a luxury product and a status symbol, again, limiting Apple to the rate of the growth of the upper middle class in India and China.\n\nSo what is there to get excited about? Not much. Nothing they make is a growth market.\n\nMicrosoft and Google are compelling because enterprise is always a growing space.

Stick with me please. \n\nSo let me ask you this, how much gross profit do you think Tesla needs to obtain internationally to be successful? Or if you want to break it out a bit, how many cars at what ASP? We know they make a profit on every single car. No one is bothering to mention that anymore, even the shorts. The model 3 GM was 20% with performance mix only slightly higher than the performance mix of S&X. That to me does not imply a gross margin strongly dependant on ASP. Especially when you consider the difference in price between the LR RWD and the Performance model. As an engineer, I'm thinking about how they have been streamlining and optimizing their process. Cutting costs. Sure ASP will have some impact due to the mental game of people paying more for less when the item is a higher tier in price, but that's absolutely not a hard in fast rule. Gross margin is not just a function of ASP. It's about the process. That's why Gross margin on the S&X improved sequentially in Q3 even though ASP went down. \n\nObviously they started with only the top of the line model 3s first. Who wouldn't. Obviously Q4 is going to have a bit of a reduction in ASP. They're actually giving people their other models now. I still don't think it's going to have a big impact on gross margin. I'd go as far as worst case being plus or minus 2% from Q3 gross margin. I say that because they are still working at optimizing manufacturing (large fluctuations in production rate) and because I think the manufacturing cost of producing the lower selling price models is significantly lower than the higher end model 3 manufacturing cost, with the MR being by far the cheapest to produce from an operational & raw material standpoint.

And it also depends a ton on what you mean by successful.  If Tesla were to replicate its Q3 numbers in every quarter, they would have a profit for the year of about $1.25 billion, in my mind justifying a P/E ratio of say 30 and a share price of around $215.  In order to actually achieve that I think they need to sell about 2.5k cars per week in Europe at an ASP of around $45k.
