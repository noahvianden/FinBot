It could close slightly higher or slightly lower, who knows? But the technicals are that the stock is effectively immune to the volatility and downward trajectory of the broader markets. Instead, TSLA has been rising slowly but steadily ever since the Q3 earnings report jump tapered off in early November. I'm not saying where it is on any given day doesn't matter, it does. The next leveling off point will depend on how high the share-price is when the takeoff happens. For example, if there hadn't been so much drama over the summer and fall, the floor from which the takeoff took place would have been higher when the Q3 earnings numbers came out and so we'd be at a better place now (though I wouldn't, I was one of those who bought the dip in October).

Incidentally, my analysis from this morning has changed substantially for the change in short-term technical.\n\nTSLA closing price of $376 is a fairly substantial jump. A $10 jump is;\n\nLarger than the $7 jump we saw between Friday Dec 7th and Monday Dec 10th, \n\nLarger than the $8 jump between Friday Dec 30th and Monday Dec 3rd\n\nLarger than the $9 jump between Thursday Nov 29th and Friday Nov 30th.\n\nIt wasn't the $21 jump between Friday Nov 23rd to Monday Dec 26th, but that was a recovery from a substantial dip whereas this is basically building on a recent high. In fact all those jumps (except the Nov 30-Dec 3 jump) were recoveries from dips. This is a pretty dramatic jump in a single day. I think we've broken $370 and have a new range with a new ceiling and a new floor.\n\n$376.79 is astounding. That's not just a recent high, that's a near all-time high. The narrative has completely shifted and people are waking up to the reality that this is a revolutionary opportunity to buy in on just as the rest of the rest of the market is experiencing weakness that has been unprecedented for several years. People are saying $390 is when the short-squeeze happens, so watch out. \n\nYou see the rest of the auto-industry trying desperately to catch up, spending billions of dollars on EVs. I see that more as a vindication of Tesla than as company-crushing competition, at least in the short to medium-term. A lot of these companies are still pittling around with plug-in hybrids (Toyota is still fiddling with hydrogen and has no BEV or even serious plug-in hybrid), don't have any electric SUVs or trucks coming out and don't know what they're doing. Their production numbers are also nowhere near Tesla. Tesla is a manufacturing juggernaut, the FUD around their inability to produce Model 3s was bullshit. Even when they struggled, they produced several times more than their nearest competitors (the Bolt and Leaf). Tesla is also way ahead on self-driving, with hundreds of thousands of vehicles giving them mountains of real-world data to train their neural networks. Tesla is Apple in 2007, but with a Steve Jobs who is younger and unlikely to get cancer in the next four years (which will keep the company innovating). There are going to be some Nokias that get crushed. Besides, the market for BEVs is growing so fast they'll be room for Tesla to lose plenty of market share and still grow exponentially.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recovery", "tsla", "tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2460698038339615}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Great, seems like my pagan rituals paid off this time ", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Low volume for next day in a row - great.

{"title": "Why I moved on from Robinhood to a proper broker (and am not looking back)", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists. It has now been around two weeks where I've moved on from Robinhood and am now using a proper broker (TD Ameritrade, using their \"Think or Swim\" mobile app / desktop app). I had been using Robinhood for about 1.5 years, but didn't realize the vast amounts of benefits you get at a proper broker (described below). I wish someone had told me about all this when I first started trading, so now I'm passing on this knowledge to youuuuuu. Perhaps other brokers have most if not all of these benefits, but I don't got experience with them.\n\n\n* **Pretty cheap trades** - While the main benefit of Robinhood is that its free - you can actually get pretty cheap trades with TDA. What you have to do is open a support request with them, and ask them to price match \"Tastyworks\" (https://tastyworks.com/pricing.html). You TELL them that you want them to price match their fees, or you'll leave etc... Can even ask for cheaper fees if you want. You can also get 300 free trades when you first sign up , and even free money (up to $600) if you deposit a LOT. \n\n* **Practically unlimited day trades (for stocks and options)** - this one was a big one for me, as I\u2019m poor and have less than $25,000 in my trading account. You can ask for a \u201ctier 2 cash account\u201d, and you can do as MANY day trades as you want \u2026 but only if the money is \u201ccleared\u201d. Every time you make a trade, the money will clear the next day. What this means is that you can place a trade with 50% of your money in the morning, and then later in the day make another trade with the other 50%, then you can sell out of both positions. The next day the money will be cleared and you can continue trading. I went from doing that dumb 3 day trades every 5 days\u2026 to about 5-20 day trades every single day.\n\n* **Charts have superb indicators in them** - Here\u2019s what my \u201ccharts\u201d setup looks like - https://i.imgur.com/EiiWEHe.png - You can see I can monitor multiple charts at once (HUGELY beneficial), and I can see the 200d ma, VWAP, EMA clouds, and low and high of day. Hundreds of others to add if you want, and they all work on mobile too.\n\nCombine having \u201cunlimited\u201d day trades with seeing proper indicators on a chart . . . and you can do my new day trading strategy of buying a few options when you see a setup occur (such as a stock going below the low of the day, or buying after it breaks the 200d ma). Then when the price hits a resistance point (such as the pre market highs), you can sell 50-75% of the contracts and lock in profits. Then you can add to your positions on pullbacks or just let the rest ride.\n\n* **Good referral system** - Refer someone and you can get either $50 or 10 free trades (with Robinhood I only ever for like $5 - $10 stocks)\n\n* **Paper trading** - Think or swim has paper trading, so you can practice losing money before you actually lose your real money\n\n* **Stop loss on options** - In a position but have to step out to a meeting? You can have little fear of the market going against you as you can put in stop losses for your options. As you set the stop loss for the price of the contract, it will even tell you what approximate price the stock will be\n\n* **Market buy in and out of options** - With Robinhood, if I wanted to get out of an option I\u2019d put in a sell and it would put the price in between the bid and ask. Half the time it wouldn\u2019t sell right away, so I\u2019d have to cancel it then put in another (all the while the price keeps tanking). Now I can easily market sell something and boom it\u2019s sold. You usually only want to do this if the option has high open interest / volume / tight bid & ask, which you can easily see. Also there\u2019s no \u201cthis option can only be bought in 5 cent increment\u201d bullshits\n\n* **Buy today\u2019s SPY option** - lose your money even faster by getting same day expiry for SPY etc\u2026\n\n* **Easily see the prices for multiple options** - Here\u2019s what I see to buy into options (https://i.imgur.com/Ug8pskt.png). I can easily browse multiple strikes for today, and click into other dates to see those. No more clicking into an option\u2026 then clicking into it again to see the open volume etc\u2026 You can also see the IV on the very right of the tab name (with the date on it)\n\n* **Excellent customer support, can live chat** - Compared to RH where its practically 0 support and GG if you run into an issue\n\n* **Transfer your IRA and day trade or do options on it** - Lose your retirement funds too if you want. If it's a Roth IRA, gains are tax free (but losses aren\u2019t a tax right off)\n\nYou can also link all of your accounts... And then trade with them all at once. So in a few clicks I can take a single trade that gets executed on my day trading account, my Roth IRA, and my traditional IRA \n\n* **Excellent mobile app and desktop app that syncs** - Tons of other features I\u2019m leaving out too\n\n* **Forex and futures** - If you want, you can do forex and futures\n\n\nJust download \u201cThink or swim\u201d and try out the \u201cpaper trading\u201d at least, it's all free. You can also open a regular account and just do all of your chart viewing and option browsing, then go into RH if you want to buy in there.
