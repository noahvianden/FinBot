Why did the stock market not sell off until Sep/Oct? Explain that....", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "The market hasn\u2019t been selling off since october  FYI. It\u2019s been selling off since post January. Builders and autos were bear market by second quarter of year. Banks were grinding lower everyday. Industrials were falling.

They just saw amazon, Apple, and Microsoft compensating for the rest of the market. When two out of those three missed earning that\u2019s was the end of that masking. Defensive sectors were rotated into utilities and healthcare. Now those are being sold off too there\u2019s no place to hide and people run for the door.  There are multiple smart money flow index that\u2019s shows you big money has been dumping post January and accelerated greatly into September. Reddit investors also had their heads in the sand not paying attention to other markets emerging/ Australia/shanghai/German all showing broken down patterns or head and shoulders. Mark Cuban came on air in August and said he went to all cash besides two positions and shorted a number of stocks. Warren buffet said he was huge on cash since nothing on the market is cheap. All these billionaires told you the market was frothy and when it deflates Reddit doesn\u2019t understand why. Us is quantative tightening. Europe is stopping this next year. Japan is also stopping.

So much of the world's economy is about data sharing and a majority are sick and tired of being a product and are moving toward services that either do not collect their data, are incapable of collecting data, or do not sell it.\n\n2. China is moving toward a consumption based economy from an export one. Their plan is to import 30 trillion in products over the next 15 years.....much of that will be from the USA.\n\n3. The Republican tax cuts have not delivered the cash into the general economy that was claimed. It has however done what was expected, put more money in private corporate hands and the hands of the wealthy. They are NOT responsible for any increases in wages whatsoever like is claimed. Those increases have come from a tightening labor market whos reasons vary but include an increase in deportations of illegal immigrants, a tightening down of employ-ability of illegal immigrants, and economic policies that make it more profitable to produce nationally rather than internationally which is soaking up more workers thus again tightening up the labor market. Wages are NOWHERE near what they should be and as we move closer to increasing the minimum wage to the absolutely bottom it should be profits for corporations will continue to fall as so will this overinflated, subsidized stock market that is only where it is because of wage depression spurred on by globalism, which is moving backward rather than forward and from a labor perspective that is a GOOD thing. Many nations are adopting \"sell it here, make it here\" or similar policies to ensure that their citizens have gainful employment and who can blame them?\n\n4. The youth of the world have felt FUCKED for the last 10-20 years and rightly so. An increasingly smaller number of people have been inheriting or consolidating an increasingly larger amount of the pie we all have to eat. They are starting to get into politics now and for better or worse, things are going to change. I'm here to tell you that its not going to be good for the market until these big corporations and businesses change their way of doing things. Plus many younger investors are looking at putting their money in companies that do considerably more than just make profit and that is going to change things as well. More money put into social programs and such is going to mean less money in return for investors. \n\nJust some thoughts. As for me, my trade of the year is going to be CASH and that is for the foreseeable future. This is not to say I won't dip into day trading when I see a good change to make a buck here or there but any mid to long term investments will be held off on until this ride downhill has reached the bottom.
