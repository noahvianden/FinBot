Tesla's 310 range gets a 70% reduced range when temperature drop below 10 degree. Imagine i-Pace range dropping 70% on an already reduced range.

That also allows Tesla cars to be connected anywhere in the world to utilize superior cloud services for huge number of applications like real time traffic monitoring to allow self driving AI to automatically reroute, major complimentary computation from cloud to boost Tesla's AI chip. Not to mention, NASA is sharing innovation with spaceX which can be applied to Tesla and that includes AI. \n\nThe list goes on and on. Let's say by some miracle that one company can solve all these monumental issues from battery to AI and outpaced Tesla's innovations. Tesla having just 10% of the overall global car market is already gigantic. Not to mention, Tesla is also planning to compete against Uber. They are also building massive Gigabyte worth of batteries.
