The trading price of any series of the ETNs at any time may vary significantly from the Indicative Value of such series of ETNs at such time.\n\nThe closing price is **not** the exchange price. It's defined as the \"Closing Indicative Price\" which today was $4.22. The Closing Indicative Price is calculated at 4:15pm based on SPVXSP (Short-Term VIX Futures). But the 80% termination event condition is \"Intraday Indicative Price <= 20 % of prior day's Closing Indicative Price\", not the other way around. So if $4.22 is the Closing Indicative Price, then the Intraday Indicative Price tomorrow has to go below $0.844.\n\n> As discussed in more detail under \u201cSpecific Terms of the ETNs\u2014Acceleration at Our Option or Upon an Acceleration Event\u201d in this pricing supplement, an Acceleration Event includes any event that adversely affects our ability to hedge or our rights in connection with the ETNs, including, but not limited to, if the Intraday Indicative Value is equal to or less than 20% of the prior day\u2019s Closing Indicative Value.\n\nIf that reading is correct, they will be required to shut down only if the other conditions for an \"Acceleration Event\" are met, the most likely one being their own liquidity/hedging requirements. But that puts things largely at their discretion.\n\nThere's also language in the prospectus that would make it easy to classify the Closing Indicative Price as a \"Market Disruption Event\" (basically, they say there wasn't enough liquidity/volume to justify the price, etc.).\n\nThere's **lots** of room for them to keep XIV from \"Acceleration\"--and certainly Credit Suisse will be motivated not to liquidate.
