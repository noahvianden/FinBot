Where it saves companies money is that they can scale up or down the number of servers they have in real time based on demand. Reddit may have 10,000 servers running at noon and only 300 running at midnight. They're billed by the minute in the cloud. If you own your own servers you have to buy enough to meet peak load and leave those running 24/7.\n\nCompanies can also save on labor and facility costs. A datacenter done right needs multiple power feeds, massive cooling, battery and generator power backups, etc. For most companies that's a huge expense.

It's more efficient for a system administrator at AWS to oversee 100,000 servers than that same guy oversee 10 servers at a smaller company.
