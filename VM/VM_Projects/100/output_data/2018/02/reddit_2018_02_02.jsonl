It is absolutely vital to their position. However, as someone who works on film, and is even more keen on the business side of the industry, the productions are going to get cheaper. The unions are already outdated and expensive as is, there is a whole force of young filmmakers who have grown up run n\u2019 gun. This means smaller crews, less shoot days, and cheaper CGI. I can\u2019t say it will make for better tv, however, consumer viewing habits are changing to match this. The traditional quality indicators in film (the writing and directing) have become far less valuable in place of themes and the right talent. A lot of this will be furthered by neural networks and data mining which I know NFLX excels at. After that they just have to market the shit out of their content and they stand a good chance at making hits. Altered Carbon is a great example of this - cheaply made, poorly written, lots of characters that hit specific demos, and interesting marketing (CES Booth anyone?)\n\nWhy is cutting costs on content important? Because if you can run n\u2019 gun, you can make more for cheaper. When you can make more, you can hit niche markets. I believe the internet is decentralizing markets in favour of niches. This will continue.\n\nI think we\u2019ll see an increasing abandonment of the feature film in favor of tv series. Features make very little sense unless you\u2019re planning on building a franchise, a la episodiques.

People talking is the biggest boost for NFLX, that\u2019s how you get subscribers. Expect a continuation of weird concepts (American Vandal), reboots (series of unfortunate events, queer eye, etc), diverse programming (dear white people), niche markets (Mindhunter, Making a Murderer), young adults (Stranger Things, etc)., documentary, etc. The list goes on.

Devil man crybaby (an actual Netflix original compared to a lot of the improperly labeled ones) was a huge success, and recently Netflix has started experimenting with simulcasting dubs. I can definitely see a large portion of the anime community jumping in on netflix since 1) Amazon strike is doing very poorly because of their double pay wall 2) crunchy roll lacks a lot of the funding to buy rights to popular shows 3) Netflix just announced a partnership with studio Bones which is a huge animation company (especially well known for Boku no Hero which has been popular as of late and Full Metal Alchemist).

PE has a lot of limitations and when looking at a hyper growth company like AMZN or NFLX that reinvests every dollar it can get it's hands on, it's not a great metric to use.  That said, I've never owned NFLX, as it and AMZN always looked too expensive (even knowing PE wasn't a good metric to use) to me to even bother with, but I will point out a few of the peculiarities I think NFLX has:  \n1) It's shareholders, like AMZNs, give it a wide wide birth most companies don't enjoy.  The shareholders don't care there are no reported \"GAAP\" earnings or dividends paid.  They are perfectly content to let the founder CEO re-invest everything.  That is not a normal situation.  \n2) I have not looked at their customer sat ratings, but my guess is they are through the roof and they have very little \"churn\".  ie once they get a customer they don't loose them.  I have never remotely thought about cancelling netflix. And if the price went from $10 to say $12 or $13, I still wouldn't think about it.  \n3)  That business model looks to scale really well.  I don't know what their visions are but say they want to get to 250M+ subscribers.  If those are satisfied customers where they have the ability to raise prices, they are going to start to pull in a lot of cash.  And the original content is probably a lot cheaper to produce than leasing rights or whatever they do for non-owned content.  So production content would go up, but their admin costs probably don't go up a whole lot as it scales really well.  So profitability grows a lot as more and more subscribe. \n4)  There has to be a first mover advantage here.  It's probably not very likely we are all going to pay for a NFLX/HULU/HBO/ETC apps every month.  So I think they are getting themselves lodged into a position that will be hard to move them from.\n\nAnyhow just a few thoughts.  Congrats on the profit you did make!
