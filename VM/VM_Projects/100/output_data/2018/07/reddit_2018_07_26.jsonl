{"title": "Facebook rant", "selftext": "Facebook falling 20% yesterday is a historically unprecedented drop for a company of its market cap (500+ billion). \n\nI read people on this sub calling this a \u201cGE-like earnings\u201d. That was probably the most retarded thing I\u2019ve ever read in my life. They announce that annual revenue growth is declining from 40% to 30% next year, and people interpreted that as them going into bankruptcy. \n\nThat level of growth is still fantastic, even when compared to its FAANG peers.\n\nNetflix dropped by 13% at the peak of its collapse because of a massive subscriber miss. It went on to recover most of that loss the next day. And that\u2019s a company that had a 200+ P/E ratio,  propped up solely on growth. They missed harder, cut guidance, and only saw half of Facebook\u2019s losses. \n\nI remember saying on this forum that Facebook is the best value in FAANG.

You have a company that basically was telling everyone that they had plenty of levers to pull to continue growth. Now you tell everyone that because of changes you are making, regulation (GDPR) and users growth flattening that may not be the case. \n\n2.  You tell everyone operating margins are going to decline. This is not usually what happens to a growing business. Facebook may have diseconomies of scale. Network grows to be a global behemoth = massive global influence. Influence = regulatory scrutiny = ever increasing overhead for moderation, security and controls, while at the same time to user base has reached maximum capacity (everyone that has fucking internet has facebook.. we are getting there).\n\n3.  The combination of declining revs and squeezed margins = lower EPS across the entire future cash flow timeline (this is a major part of the reason it crashed, people updated their models - much lower EPS growth, FCF would have gone down and I would have applied a higher WACC now that regulation has shown to have a real impact).\n\nSo then the question becomes - how many levers exist to pull revenue out of the existing user base so that it grows quicker than the increased overhead (remember, headcount was up 47% YoY). And this is where I disagree with the market reaction. 1) I think in terms of AI capabilities, Facebook is rudimentary and can get even better at ad placements over time, 2) They own 4 of the 6 biggest social media platforms (WhatsApp, FB, Insta, & Messenger) - so I believe you'd need a general slow down or distaste for social media to kill growth 3) They haven't monetized Messenger or WhatsApp yet - huge possibilities for payments, ads, customer service, personalized deals, etc. (see WeChat in China) and Instagram is still early innings of monetization, user base is still growing and engagement is far superior than any other platform. 4) It is still the greatest ad platform to ever exist - the granularity and insights advertisers can glean from being on the platform are incredible. \n\nI also think that FB should be commended on cleaning up the platform, I think it is good for their long-term health. I can't be the only one that thought the core FB product was a diluge of garbage ads and content - any incremental improvement should be positive. Valuation is reasonable as well. I'd follow the three day rule and see where this bases out, I don't think it'll jump anytime soon, but I'm pretty sure they sandbagged the guidance to give themselves a more flexible window to make changes in.
