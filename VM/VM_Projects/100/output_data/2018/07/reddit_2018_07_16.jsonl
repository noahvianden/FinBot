Not to mention there is just so much more competition now than even a year ago. Almost every big cable provider has their shit together now as far as streaming content goes. Then there is Youtube, Twitch, and  Facebook/IG which are all moving towards more extended programming. All of which means good content is going to be harder and more expensive to acquire (lower margins). Disney is moving all their content off of the platform (or at the very very least re-negotiating terms) which is some of the best most watched material Netflix has.\n\nTo compound issues, NFLX has chosen quantity over quality. Most of their newer exclusive content is awful! Plus, they don't have a good way for viewers to determine whether a program is good or not before watching which is super frustrating. They also don't allow a la cart so you can't add on premium channels (HBO, Showtime, etc.) which means you can't browse all your content in one place and you'll be directed to other platforms.  I have almost every streaming platform and Netflix is the last I check when browsing and would be one of the first I'd get rid of. As a stock, they are wildly overvalued and due for a pullback.

Congrats that takes a special mix of confidence and ignorance.\n\n>Netflix has content that NO one today can compete\n\nThis is obviously subjective but if we want to crowd-source an answer we can look to research groups that estimate the most viewed shows. Netflix shows don't even make most of these 'top watched shows' lists. Yeah, it is hard to quantify Netflix's streaming as they don't release numbers and have different watching patterns but even if we look at Parrot Analytics, whose research is highly skewed in Netflix favor, their top 20 list only has 3 Netflix shows. Which isn't bad but it's far from \"NO one today can compete\". Other platforms are definitely competing and even arguably beating Netflix.\n\n>Maybe HBO. But its fucked up its game by not entering the streaming market.\n\nNot sure what you're talking about. You've been able to stand alone stream HBO for over 3 years now and were able to stream several years before that if you had HBO as part of a cable package.\n\n>Disney can NEVER make shows like Narcos/sense 8 etc. because its too adult in nature\n\nYou're confused and obviously uneducated on the matter. That's like saying Nike can't make clothes because they don't go on your feet. Disney is a massive company that serves all demographics. It's not only cartoons. They own ABC, ESPN, Touchstone Pictures, Marvel, Lucas Films, etc.  If you've seen the recent rated R Marvel films Logan or Deadpool (which are sweet!) you'd know damn well Disney can make adult content and do it well.\n\n>Disney fucked up. Just like Blockbuster.\n\nNo, no they didn't. Bob Iger's vision was just above your business comprehension. When most media companies were spending ungodly amounts of money trying to create streaming apps and buy licencing. Disney put that money towards buying the best IP out there (Lucas Films (star wars), Marvel, etc). While other companies were fighting over how to distribute content he bought up the best content and then made them fight over the rights to distribute it. Disney has been amasing IP behind the scenes for years, so they could have the scale to create their own platform while hedging their bet with owning some of Hulu. They let the streaming wars play out, learned from it while avoiding the costs, and now have the leverage of the best IP to either start their own streaming service, sell it to the highest bidder, or do both.\n\nSeriously, please only speak if you actually know what you're talking about. It's obvious you're not well versed in any of this. This is r/stocks .You could make somebody lose a lot of money if they accidentally mistake you as knowing what you're talking about.
