Thus, you need the stock to be above $352.13 for you to make money on your $350 call. A stock price higher than $352.13 is profit, but because you sold a call, you max out profit at $352.50. Thus, the most you can really make is $0.37 per share ($37 per contract). For you to buy and sell the call, it costs $2.13 per share AND I believe that robinhood wont let you sell a call without actually having the stock so you'll need to invest in 100 shares. \n\nThe profit margin seems too minimal for me to invest money into in my opinion. Also note that if the stock price falls below $352.13, you'll no longer break even and can lose up to your initial investment of $2.13 per share ($213 per set of buy/sell contract).

There is a cost to this though, 100% of the extrinsic value for your options hasn't expires so you won't get out all your profits, but you can also sell early without taking your max loss.\n\n> Isnt that super risky though?

This is why undefined risk strategies are attractive.\n\n> I feel like a weeklies are less risky.\n\nNo they are not, the reason the risk/reward for weeklies is high is  due to gamma.

Extrinsic value increases as you get closer to being ATM - typically with a correlation to the probability of being ITM at expiration.\n\nThe delta is often used as a probability for being ITM at expiration.  A .99 delta has a 99% guarantee of being ITM at expiration.  The (NFLX) $230 strike is the first .99 delta.
