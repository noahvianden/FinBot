Also, cells have to be individually contained as much as possible as automobiles move and get into crashes and Li-ion battery fires aren't fun.  Batteries expand and swell very easily at high heats, which EV batteries are much more prone to vs. a laptop.  Thousands of individual cylindrical cells are once again more practical in this situation.\n\n\nOn top of that, Tesla's battery pack technology is by far the best in the market.  The only technology that even holds a candle to them in range are LG Chem's battery pouches.  There are several problems with these pouches though:\n\n\n1. On top of the fact that heat dissipation is worse than a battery pack, swelling will completely fuck you up with a pouch.\n\n2. It isn't modular at all.  You R&D for one size.\n\n3. The auto-manufacturer has no input, no matter how much they want to invest into the battery, LG Chem can only make it like how it is.\n\n4. Working on these pouches barely does anything to help LG build their next generation batteries, which will likely be individually sold cylindrical or prismatic cells.\n\n5. LG Chem is likely still using NMC 622.  The only number that really matters is the one at the end, noting cobalt content.  This indicates 20% cobalt.  Cobalt is fucking expensive, and is only getting more expensive as EVs grow more popular.  Elon once claimed that their batteries use 3% cobalt (and plans to use 0% soon).  If he means the cells themselves use 3% cobalt, I have no fucking clue how they achieved that and it sounds like black magic to me.  Note, they use NCA chemistry rather than NMC.  LG Chem is trying to bring a NMC 811 pouch to market, but honestly, they'll probably just give up and just make 21700 cylindrical cells.  \n\n6. As long as they are pouches, they aren't true commodities and therefore will be price controlled by LG Chem.  As demand rises, the price of these pouches will skyrocket; and demand will rise because LG Chem has the only usable non-Tesla EV battery on the market.  We can see that auto-manufacturers are scared of this, and Jaguar is already inching towards the exit as they ink a deal with Samsung SDI for cylindrical 21700 batteries to eventually replace their LG Chem pouches.  We are also seeing production flag for LG Chem battery cars such as the Bolt and Ioniq because of limited supply.  As more \"Tesla-killers\" enter the market, the stronger LG Chem's pricing power gets, which increases price significantly in the short run.
