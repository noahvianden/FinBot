Get with the program.\u00a0\n\n\"We don't know he was hired for the take private\"\n\nOf course we don't know. I never said we \\*knew\\*. Honestly your ignorance is showing. We've discussed this multiple times. Remember\u00a0 the difference between proof and evidence?\u00a0\n\nQuick refresher since you're so clearly confused:\u00a0\n\nI said, there is a huge body of evidence pointing out that he was hired for the take-private. You said one of the things I said\u00a0 was evidence that he was hired for it was actually evidence that he wasn't hired for it. You started saying a bunch of emotional things and repeating yourself again and again without giving an actual argument and crying about Musk. I explained in detail why it could only be evidence that he was only hired for it, but of course could also be evidence of nothing and just a coincidence. At this point I believe that you scrambled some\u00a0ridiculous\u00a0argument that he was ignored because it wasn't his job. Important to note, you may have\u00a0conceived\u00a0this argument long before we started discussing Morton's issues with Musk in relation to why he was hired, but you didn't mention it. That's why I said, I \\*believe\\*. The argument is\u00a0ridiculous\u00a0enough that, IMO you just slapped it together. Let's be honest though, that should be expected of the emotionally compromised. Someone with so much hate in their system that even their username is a testimony to their sensitivity should be dealt with carefully. I digress, that's pretty much where we are now.\u00a0\n\nWhat's next? Oh this argument again.\u00a0\n\n\"Why would you hire someone for their expertise in a take-private ..... and then make them feel like you're uninterested in their expertise...\"\n\nI guess I can take time to explain how jobs work. Weird, I would have expected you to have had one at some point in your life.\u00a0\n\nPeople are hired for their \\*expertise\\* and are judged based on their \\*performance\\*. I rephrase your question slightly to keep it focused on our topic, \"Why would Musk hire someone for his expertise in these transactions and then ignore his input on the transaction?\". The most obvious answer is that he was underperforming. I did mention this earlier, but I'll repeat myself for your\u00a0convenience. That doesn't mean what Morton was saying was wrong. His performance goal is set by his boss, in this case Musk. We can say with a great deal of confidence that Musk did not agree with the advice Morton was giving him. I say this because if Musk did agree with his advice then he would have executed on it and Morton wouldn't have felt ignored. There are other possibilities of course, but they are very unlikely. For instance, I think we can rule out Musk disliking Morton as a person, because he wouldn't hire someone he didn't like, so it is unlikely it was done out of spite. After all, it took him weeks to come to that conclusion. If Musk was being spiteful, I think he would have realized pretty much immediately. Musk has never been known to hold back his opinions of people. As a mater of fact, his boldness is infamous and may be his biggest character\u00a0flaw. With that said, its safe to say that it is illogical to think that he was ignoring Morton out of spite. So back to your question, if not out of spite then why would he ignore him? Because he disagreed with his suggestions. I can make a few guesses as to why he disagreed with them, but it would be nothing more than a guess. The biggest factor in my opinion was the banks. Silver Lake has been very close to Musk and Tesla for a long time, so it seems likely that they would have a much stronger influence on Musk's decisions. Again, thats just a guess. The important thing to remember is that its apparent that, for whatever reason, Elon disagreed with the advice Morton was giving. Its never a good thing when your boss doesn't agree with your input. Not a good sign for your career, even if you're right. Its not a shot at Morton.\u00a0\n\n\"Yes, we have. Like when you said....\u00a0You are saying that it is logically impossible....unless Morton was hired for\u00a0the take-private\"\u00a0\n\nThese semantics arguments are getting really old. I made it perfectly clear that this is only evidence that he was hired for the transaction. I made that perfect clear. If it was \\*impossible\\* for someone to quit after being ignored about something that wasn't their job then it wouldn't be \\*evidence\\* it would be \\*proof\\*. I made it very very clear in no uncertain terms that the fact that someone wouldn't quit over being ignored about something unrelated to their role in a company is evidence. It is certainly not impossible. The word wouldn't doesn't magically make all of my other clarifications\u00a0that it's only evidence disappear.
