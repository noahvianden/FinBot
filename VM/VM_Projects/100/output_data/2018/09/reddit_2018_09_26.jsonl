If you look at Hulu, they have a far better lineup of content, in house produced and otherwise for a more affordable price. The only thing Netflix has over Hulu is the amount of movies available as compared to TV shows. However People often struggle to find films on Netflix because they don\u2019t have most classics or most good films in general. All they have is a few good movies they managed to license along with a huge gorge of their laughably shitty low budget content. Netflix is a huge household name in the entertainment sector no doubt, and they have a big advantage by being established in a market that is poised for growth when cable tv really starts to die. It\u2019s just my opinion however that for a new content streaming service to come along and hugely disrupt their market would not be very hard, and that public opinion of Netflix is going to continue to decline in the next few years.

As far as ITM you're right, I try to make it so breakeven is less than half a percent away.

If that's the case I make sure I have cash on hand and I will buy more contracts to keep my cost average down, basically just chasing the eventual turn of direction. I generally buy in lots of 5 at that point to keep the average as close to the turn number as possible, then when it goes my way I can let it ride for a bit longer. I usually start looking to get out about 20ish percent. Like I said, these aren't home runs, just base hits you can only get when you day trade.
