Here are some outstanding items:\n\nFirst, the SEC settlement will fuel the various shareholder lawsuits. Having to settle the SEC lawsuits, Elon and Tesla will not likely be able to get those other lawsuits dismissed. At a minimum, they will have to settle them, too. It's just a question of how much they will cost.\n\nFor example, short-sellers who covered their positions in the hours after Elon's famous $420 go-private tweet have a case, and longs who bought the stock after that time and for the next 17 days, all have a case against Tesla's false statements. That liability could stretch into the billions for Tesla and Musk. Anyone looking to invest in Tesla, or extend credit to it, will have to take into consideration such a potential multibillion dollar liability. Maybe Tesla's suppliers move to Cash-On-Delivery terms, and that would drain Tesla's cash balance almost instantly.\"\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/opinion/why-the-sec-s-settlement-with-elon-musk-and-tesla-is-a-slap-on-the-wrist-14727906?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Oh please.
