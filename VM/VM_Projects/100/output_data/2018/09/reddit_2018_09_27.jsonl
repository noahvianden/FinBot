That means the product is good. Only question is if it can turn a profit. I don't see any problem there, especially since 2 independent parties have said it's possible. That means from a fundamental, bill of materials, standpoint it's possible to turn a profit on this thing.

If it goes to 500, it's likely to keep going up and up because the timeline where 500 is possible means they are just snowballing with demand and marketshare, with most legacy car makers scrambling to make something happen as their market shares are destoryed and cash reserves are depleted. \n\nOn the other hand, there is a chance they can't meet obligations of notes that are coming due, suppliers demand cash up front, they are cash strapped and have to restructure and the stock goes to near 0.\n\nI guess there is a middle ground where they barely make profit, economic downturn happens, capital markets are tapped and in retreat and the company gets put in a hold, with the stock bouncing around the 200 to 380 range like we have seen, but in reality, once/if there is a proven Model 3 market and margins, the company is going to find the money they need to expand as people search for good places to put money with a decent return. \n\nI'm currently in a 6 share position with average price of 280, with enough cash to invest for two more shares if the prices stays below 260 (looking to see where the next floor is). So I'll be likely 8 shares and a little over 2 grand I'm gambling with. I can take that hit if needed (not that I want to), but it's going to hurt. For me, the risk of the bet is worth the upside. \n\nI understand the shorts positions, hell, I read /r/realtesla and comment there as it's good to understand the downside of your bets.

Firstly, he started the tweet with \"I Am considering\" and not \"I am going to.\" Thus, it was not an absolute statement, and any shares bought with a specific outcome in mind would be a highly speculative endeavor. You cannot reasonably conclude from that tweet what the outcome will be from that statement. Second, the \"funding secured\" portion of the tweet is highly ambiguous and subjective. Clearly, since the decision had not been finalized, funding could not have been \"in-hand,\" opening up a much more subjective definition of the term \"secured.\" How liberal the reading of this term is will be up to a Jury. He clearly did not specify a specific funding source, nor any funding terms. You may disagree with his definition of \"secured\", but does that mean it was illegal given his personal understanding of the definition? Also relevant is the medium itself; tweets are a shorthand communication and often abbreviated. This could easily be chalked up to an error of omission (see trump's Helsinki \"would\" vs \"wouldn't\" shenanigans). \n\nSo it all seems to come down to interpretation; there does not appear to be objectively false information in the tweet unless a very narrow interpretation of the language is followed. I'm not aware of any legal requirement for corporate officers to abide by specific definitions or interpretations, so IMO this will be tough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, unless they can prove there was a premeditated intent to deceive investors via contemporaneous witnesses with intimate knowledge of the matter.\n\nIt seems more likely that the more objective wrongdoing is the timing and manner of the disclosure rather than the substance. The tweet was sent during trading hours, which is avoided because it causes extreme volatility before investors have been able to digest the information. Additionally, twitter is not a preferred dissemination medium, and best practices would be to pre-announce a press release at a specific time, to give investors an expectation of incoming material news and ensure they can all receive the information simultaneously. \n\nMy guess is they will settle with a slap-on-the-wrist fine and he will remain in control of tesla.

Say I buy a Microsoft 110 call at 9:30am, and then magically it\u2019s value shoots up 3.00 in value by Noon. Fuck! I want my gains but don\u2019t want a PDT ban. Well, if you sell a call at 115 (one strike price higher), you will notice that that price difference between the call you bought and the call you sold is your profit. So by doing this you lock in almost all of your gains due to the way options are priced. This works especially well on high volume options where the bid/ask mark is closer. You can then close them both the next day. \n\nI am so sick of reading you people complain about 90 day bans so stop being stupid and actually learn options before you trade them.
