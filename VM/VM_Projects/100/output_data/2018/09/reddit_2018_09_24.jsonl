{"title": "Risk-reward analysis.", "selftext": "OK wsb, time to help you guys out a bit. I\u2019m a tenured finance professor at a university in the US and I manage a personal account of \\~500k.\n\nFirst, too many people here don\u2019t understand efficient market hypothesis or its implications. Second, I noticed that most people here have no clue of how to create a diversified portfolio or the actual benefits of it (mathematically). You guys like to YOLO, so rather than give you \u201cboring\u201d systematic advice, I will offer you idiosyncratic advice.\n\nI present to you a risky trade, but with high payoffs in buying 11/16/18 puts in FB for $130, and here\u2019s why:\n\n\\#1) The general market setting is set up for uncertainty due to the trade war with China and NAFTA with Canada. These risks compound over time so the longer we go without deals, the more the general market will decline.\n\n\\#2) FB is in deep shit with the government. Think about the worse-case scenario implications.\n\n\\#3) I personally find myself spending less and less time on FB. Coupled with the fact that FB is unable to appeal to the millennial population, this could place significant strain on their ability generate ad revenue.\n\n\\#4) If you compare the one-year trend of FB with QQQ, you will see that only began to diverge after FB\u2019s last earnings release in July. Because the problems suggested in #1, #2, and #3 are longer-term issues, divergence can easily extend for 3 quarters to 1 year, to the same extent as Netflix\u2019s pricing issue in 2011 or Chipotle\u2019s E.coli outbreak in 2015.\n\nDue to the above reasons, I predict that after this information will be better recognized by the market after FB\u2019s earnings release in early November. November 16 was chosen to capture a post-earnings announcement drift due to the negative shock of the results.\n\nWith a 10% chance of happening, I believe that FB\u2019s stock will decrease by 20-25% from current prices. At the current stock price of about $165, a 20-25% decrease will cause FB to drop to about $120 by 11/16, accounting for both the earnings release and drift. Cost analysis would suggest that buying $1,000 of $130 put at 0.42 each would allow you to buy 23 puts. A $120 stock price will result in a payoff of $22,000, at which point, I would suggest to exit out of your positions.\n\nAgain, I think the chances of this happening are 10%. This means you will lose $1,000 nine out of ten times, but it comes with a 22-fold payoff.\n\n(Disclosure: I currently own a small short position in FB in a diversified portfolio.)\n\nTL;DR Buy 130 FB puts, expiring on 11/16. Risk $1,000 for a 10% chance to get $22,000. Don\u2019t get greedy/over-confident.\n\n[Ask prices after market close on 9\\/24\\/18.](https://preview.redd.it/gz9ooax309o11.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a7d4bc8b3f42c8339d7a21518530f575e06b37)\n\nRecent news:\n\n9/24:  [FB privacy issues, co-founders of IG leave](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/instagram-co-founders-leave-the-appare-facebooks-privacy-struggles-to-blame-2018-09-25)\n\n9/25:  [FB regulation (Harvard report)](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/09/25/2018/harvard-report-calls-regulation-facebook-big-tech?cm_ven_int=homepage-latest-headlines)\n\n9/28:  [Security breach of 50 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-hack-50-million-people-175400821.html)\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "9ilhm0", "created_utc": 1537820592.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Proof of 500k, proof of career and proof of university", "score": 158, "replies": [{"body": "Or ban", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "No he's definitely a professor but uses the phrase \"worse-case scenario\" instead of \"worst-case scenario\".
