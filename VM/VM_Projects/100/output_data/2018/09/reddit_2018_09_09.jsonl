Tesla is spending a lot on R&D specific to these types of vehicles, and securing battery production second to none.

What made him leave Tesla after just a month ? What did he see in Tesla books that made him nope the fuck out of there ? CAO didn't receive $10M on his departure. $10M is stock options vested over 4 years. No signing bonus either. So he walked away w 1 month salary. Ask yourself, how bad the situation has to be?\n\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dmf_AyQV4AAqTJ8.jpg:large\n\n\n* Also the CAO said he left because of \"public scrutiny \" ? CAO is not a outside visibility job like CMO or CEO. So his reason for leaving makes no fucking sense.\n\n\n* Also Tesla has existing obligations due soon -- $230 million due in November 2018 with conversion at $560 and $920 million due in March 2019 with conversion at $360. **I think their unrestricted cash right now is negative**.\n\n\n* Also Look at the fucking bond rates - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dmf2r2iXcAAv90e.jpg:large. Touching 82C.\n\n* Another reason, Tesla's credit rating is based on them having 420K model 3 reservations. But yesterday without notice, they sent an email to everyone holding firesale of their Model 3s. Everyone can go to the store and pick up any Model 3 they want and **pay in cash**. WTF ? Its as if they are almost out of cash and 420K figure was a fraud.\n\nhttps://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/anybody-get-short-term-notice\n\nEdit 1 :: I see some Musk dick suckers infesting this thread. If you \"invest\" in a company because you have a hard on for the CEO, its called \"gambling\" not \"investing\".  Also they talk about vague products in future like Model Y, Truck etc..\n\nEnron Musk has allocated $0 CAPEX for these products. If you need to build these products then you need to start building assembly lines for it now . Where is the CAPEX ? He cant build stuff out of his ass.\n\n\n* Also According to WSJ, their cash in first week of Q3 was 1.69B (https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-tesla-suppliers-fret-about-getting-paid-1534793592)\n\n\n* 230MM is due in November, that leaves us with 1.46B with convert price of $560 (https://www.wsj.com/articles/sizing-up-teslas-10-billion-debt-stack-1529240400)\n\n* 920MM due in March, that leaves us with **534MM** with convert price of $360\n\n* But Tesla burns $1B every quarter and Enron Musk's recent blog posted on Friday has no reiteration of Q3 profits\n\n\nIf they dont raise within next 3 months, BK is imminent. **They will have no cash left in Q4 if you account for upcoming bond payments**\n\nAlso Tesla cannot do equity raise to pay back the bonds, the bonds need to be paid in cash. Because equity raise would dilute shares and share price will drop even more.\n\n\nEdit 2 : Tesla is sending reservation invites to people to pick up car today on first come first serve basis, **even to those who dont have reservations aka spamming** !

Declining YoY % growth in operating cash flow. \n\n2. Negative YoY% FCF growth. \n\n3. Increasing debt to equity.\n\n4. Increased days sales outstanding and declining inventory turnover. \n\n5. Declining fixed asset turnover -a signal for over investing.\n\nThen there are two more observations that raise a red flag:\n\nSerial acquirer which destroys value (GE and CSCO being great examples of this. CSCO luckily broke the habit). Whole Foods is a great example, increased revenue but losing the highest margin customers to smaller competition (WSJ). \n\nIs the business dying? Not exactly, but Amazon is aware their retail businesses is close to peaking in its growth, which is why they\u2019re expanding to combat this.

Declining receivables turnover.\n\n2. Declining quick ratio and current ratio -e.g. less liquidity.\n\n3. Declining interest coverage, although it has recovered from 2014 lows somewhat. \n\n4. Chinese knock-offs taking away business from supplier brands. \n\nCouple all these with rising interest rates and we might have a recipe for disaster. Those customers who purchase heavily on credit may not be able to pay Amazon back, this includes AWS. Retailers on Amazon\u2019s website may no longer be able to participate if sales decline further from knockoffs and credit continues to tighten. Throw in a recession where sales can decline, then Amazon might hurt a lot. \n\n> 3.\t\u2060It has incompetant management that doesn\u2019t know how to fix problems before they get bigger.\n\n\nHere are a number of things Amazon\u2019s management continue to fail to address.\n\n1. Poor delivery services (does not fulfill orders in specified time periods, drivers failing to follow regular postal procedures, and items packaged poorly). \n\n2. Proliferation of knock-offs and scams. Customer service does not address people getting ripped off from these (including myself).\n\n3. Poor work conditions for employees i.e. abusive management policies (that\u2019s according to management themselves), poor work/life balance, poor benefits, and low pay.\n\n4. Failure to attract exclusive brands or extremely popular brands (excluding third party sellers that sell at big markups). \n\nIs Bezos an excellent manager? Yes, absolutely. Is everyone under him extremely competent? That is yet to be observed. In contrast, despite its failings now, GE has produced top tier managers that excelled  greatly at other companies. Amazon has yet to follow. Also the best employees will eventually turn on Amazon if the company proceeds to treat them poorly. \n\nAnother example is that I didn\u2019t take a job at Vanguard because of low pay, dumb rankings, and overall cheapness taken to the extreme, but I can say they offered great benefits and offered a great work-life balance. This is observed company wide for Vanguard at most levels, it isn\u2019t only anecdotal. Amazon has a similar low-cost mindset, but addresses all those aspects mentioned very poorly. \n\nIs it a good short? We\u2019ll see... One has to be willing to potentially lose a lot of money before eventually profiting. The market can be irrational longer than you can remain solvent. \n\nEdit: I made a typo earlier stating declining debt to equity instead of increasing debt to equity.

The future of retail no longer lies in purely e-commerce, but a combo of e-commerce and physical stores that are meaningfully intertwined.\n\nAssuming you meant e-commerce, I don't believe e-commerce has come close to their peak yet. E-commerce only accounts for 10% of retail sales at the moment, so there's certainly room to grow. You see the death count for retail growing at an astounding rate (for a variety of reasons, Amazon just being one of them). \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_retailers_affected_by_the_retail_apocalypse\n\nNext year, we are probably gonna see Sears go under, and Burlington Coat Factory, Stein Mart, Guitar Center, Bebe, and Bon-Ton could all join them. Every death in retail gives Amazon a little more market share to absorb.

Retailers on Amazon\u2019s website may no longer be able to participate if sales decline further from knockoffs and credit continues to tighten. Throw in a recession where sales can decline, then Amazon might hurt a lot.\n\nAmazon benefited from the last recession. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/24/amazon-recession-profits\n\nAs a company with healthy fundamentals, they can weather the storm of another recession. A lot of the retailers I just listed are already on thin ice, and a recession would simply cull the weak and allow Amazon to fill the void. \n\nI don't know much about how businesses would use AWS on loan money or how they might not be able to repay it. So many companies rely on AWS for their basic infrastructure that they would cease to exist without it. Netflix would vanish overnight. Even the company I work for would be heavily undermined by cutting off its use of AWS. In other words, only companies who were truly going bankrupt would cut off AWS. \n\n>Is Bezos an excellent manager? Yes, absolutely. Is everyone under him extremely competent? That is yet to be observed. In contrast, despite its failings now, GE has produced top tier managers that excelled greatly at other companies. Amazon has yet to follow. Also the best employees will eventually turn on Amazon if the company proceeds to treat them poorly.\n\nAmazon is notorious for being rough with its employees. I've personally spoken with several Amazon employees (at least in the operations side) and I certainly haven't heard anything to contradict the overall-negative consensus on Glassdoor. \n\nWith that said, Amazon will be automating its operations more and more over time. They can afford to treat their operations employees like shit because they are easily replaceable and their role might not even exist in a couple of decades. \n\nIn terms of upper management, Amazon is poaching top executives at 6x the rate of Google. That's despite Google having a reputation for being relatively good for work-life balance. \n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-poached-30-former-microsoft-executives-2015-to-2017-vs-google-report-2018-6\n\nThe reason this poaching is so easy is because Amazon will compensate them more than their competitors will. Even you did not take the Vanguard position because of the low pay and \"overall cheapness\". People will stomach difficult working conditions in exchange for a higher salary, and Amazon is willing to pay them for it. \n\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx", "recession", "amzn", "msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["bubble", "recession", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Buying ATH if you were already in but not if you weren\u2019t is illogical.
