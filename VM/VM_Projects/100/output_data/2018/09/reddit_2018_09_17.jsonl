If these tariffs mean I don't go out and buy the latest and greatest electronic device every year because prices have gone up, then so be it. It's not hurting any necessity I need to live. People complained companies were getting TAX breaks that only make the rich richer and now complain those same companies are being hurt by Tariffs. So which is it? And whats the solution?

If you're living in this country you come into contact with these items daily, whether you even own them or not.  Do you own an office chair?  Silverware?  Plates and mugs?  Do you ever go out in public?  Eat at restaurant, or own a house?  What percent of your house was manufactured in China?  Do you invest in the stock market?  Do you plan on buying anything that is made with aluminum or steel?

This is bad deal for everyone, not just for corporations. \n\nI'm completely on board with free trade* (it's never actually been free, generally tariffs between 3%-6%).  The idea is that the market delivers goods to consumers in the most efficient possible way. That means lower prices for everyone.  It's true that some industries in the US will not be as efficient as foreign competition, but this cycle has been going on for hundreds of years whether we like it or not.  I don't see any textile mills operating in my neighborhood, and the last horse and buggy shop shut down a hundred years ago.  I'm much happier this way than the alternative - which is where the government picks it's own winners and losers, and makes us all pay for the balance.    \n\nPersonally I'm against the tax breaks, I think they're stupid and overwhelmingly geared towards the top income earners while leaving everyone else behind.  So now the US government has decided to take away even more of my money and your money in the form of tariffs.
