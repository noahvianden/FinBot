But let's look at both.\n\n**Median income**\n\nNorway does have slightly higher median *income* than Australia (though not by much - both are in the top handful of countries). There's a few tables at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\_income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income) which measure it in different ways (international dollars/PPP, USD, per household vs per person etc.) but Australia is 2-3 places behind Norway in each case. I'm not sure using PPP or not changes that comparison much since both Norway and Australia are high-cost-of-living countries with consequently similar purchasing power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Median wealth**\n\nIf we are talking median *wealth* (accumulated savings, investments etc. per person or per household )*,* Australia is at or near the top no matter how you measure it. I remember this factoid from the hundreds of articles out there that contain one of these charts:\n\n[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/medianwealth.jpg](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/medianwealth.jpg)\n\n[https://medianism.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/median-adult-wealth1.png](https://medianism.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/median-adult-wealth1.png)\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/r/europe/1TzF6eN - here\u2019s one that actually mentions the source...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThose charts were based on Credit Suisse OECD rankings but were used in hundreds of articles from dozens of countries all over the place some years ago. One example is [https://www.businessinsider.com/us-trails-at-least-15-oecd-countries-in-median-wealth-2012-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-trails-at-least-15-oecd-countries-in-median-wealth-2012-7) , but there are many many more. Do a reverse image search on those charts and you'll find them used all over the place (usually in comparisons involving the middle classes of two different countries, or talking about how the US ranks very highly when measured by *average* wealth, but aren't doing so great on *median* wealth). The figures used in those charts are a bit old and include only OECD countries, but show Australia to comfortably rank 1st among those countries (which include Norway).\n\nIn more recent years Australia seems to have fallen to second place in the OECD behind Switzerland, or third place among all countries, due mostly to the fact that the AUD has weakened significantly against the USD since 2014, and most of these rankings measure in USD:\n\n[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_wealth\\_per\\_adult.html](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult.html) \\- 2nd in OECD behind Switzerland, using more recent Credit Suisse data (2016).\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_wealth\\_per\\_adult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult) : 3rd among *all* countries, behind Iceland and Switzerland, and that's measured in pure USD without PPP adjustments. Norway's at 7th place and US at 25th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStatistics can often be twisted to prove anything you want of course, but I think it's safe to say that Australian median wealth is higher than Norway's regardless of how you measure it.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7572287917137146}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29838430881500244}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02518756128847599}, {"body": "Someone's jealous of the amount of dollarydoos that Aussies make", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10688294470310211}, {"body": "This is a common mantra among bogans who've never been to Switzerland.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06498884409666061}, {"body": "\ud83c\udf4c are expensive because they ban bananas from the Philippines", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Bananas get expensive in Australia when a cyclone hits the Banana region like in 2006 where they reached $10-15 per kg but they're normally $2-3 a kg presently.\n\nAs for banning bananas, they are extremely susceptible to disease and would probably be the reason for the ban from the Philippines.
