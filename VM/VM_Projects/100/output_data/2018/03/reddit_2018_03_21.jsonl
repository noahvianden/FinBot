So my angle is primarily coming from their cloud growth. Whether its building a cloud infrastructure that allows companies to build their own platforms or cloud services like office 365. Their CEO is a cloud specialist appointed to bring Microsoft to this new era and he is doing a fantastic job in putting the companies focus in this direction. He did some dirty things too in the process. Sold windows 10 as a free product but bloated it with ads (as seen in start menus) and forcing updates even if IT departments try to stop it with scripts.
