What started as a small experiment with 3 AAPL stocks is now standing at over a 1100$ gain. This sub has always been the starting point for all my research. I come here to check what\u2019s new, read the comments, then work backwards and start researching before I buy, sell or hold anything. \n\nI never wanted to hold long and the plan was to always swing trade on a company during its earnings. Gradually, I started making educated choices, became confident and started holding, did not panic sell but doubled down whenever the market dropped and here I am. From shares pricing in the future effects to investors moving towards Gold at times of nuclear threat and towards bonds when their yield increases; this sub has taught me a lot. \n\nThe gains might not last long but I am glad I made it till here. I just wanted to thank you all. You guys are awesome. \n\nPortfolio:\nAAPL - got in at 152, 164\nNVDA - got in at 154, sold at 200, got in at 200 \nSHOP - got in at 80, doubled down during the Citron dip\nNFLX - got in around 160 and sold at 240 (regret big time)\nTWTR - got in at 19 and sold at 21\nSQ- got in at 37\nAMD - got in at 11 and out at 13.5\n \nI have decided to stay in the game long and I am now waiting for the next dip to invest in,\nV\nNFLX\nBABA\nAMZN\n\nLet me know what you guys think. I know that my portfolio is completely tech and diversification is something I should do. I could not help it since I love those products I have invested in and think they can do well in the long run. Also, I regularly keep track of the tech industry news than others. \n\n\nEdit: YES. It is a bull market. Anyone could have made money. My whole point was that, I started making decisions based on the sub. I could have still made money but not 30 percent.

The type of retirement account doesn't matter.\n\n With all retirement accounts, you pay income tax either when you deposit (roth) or when you take it out (traditional). There is no capital gain tax involved. There are no taxable events on any  trading you do while the money is in the retirement account.\n\nWith a taxable brokerage account, every time you sell a stock for a gain, you must pay taxes.  If you did not hold the stocks for a year, you pay short term capital gains tax, which is typically higher than long-term gains tax. So, it's beneficial to hold stocks longer (or never sell them). You have to consider the tax implications every time you want to sell a stock.  \n\nSo, if you consider both accounts part of an overall portfolio, and your strategy comprises both \"buy and hold\" and short-term swing trading, all other things being equal (Note-they are not) it makes sense to swing trade where you don't have tax implications on all the transactions and take advantage of long-term capital gains (or never selling) in your taxable brokerage account\n\nObviously, there are other tax efficiencies to consider. Dividends, International taxes, High growth vs low Growth, etc.  But in my situation, doing my swing trades in a retirement account makes sense to me.\n\nOne last thing to consider - swing trading is riskier, dealing with more volatile stocks. My retirement account is money I won't touch for a long time. I can just keep working until there's enough of it. My taxable brokerage account is the money I can access right away. If there's an emergency or opportunity, that's the money I have access to.

You're limited to your yearly contribution, so your \"war chest\" will not be as high as in your regular broker account.  In active trading the more you can trade with, the greater your possible return.  If you've contributed all your available funds to your ira/401k for trading this obviously won't apply.  \n\nB. You can only recognize capital losses in a Roth IRA account when all the amounts in all of your Roth IRA accounts have been distributed to you and the total distributions are less than your unrecovered costs from the accounts -- there is one other weird way but it's complicated I think and I haven't looked into it.  \n\nAnd for traditional ira and 401k, you may deduct your traditional IRA losses only if the total balance that you withdraw is less than the after-tax amounts. \nNow if you never experience losses in your active trading by all means go for it but if you do, this is a pretty big deal.\n\nC.

That alone makes buy and hold the best option for retirement accounts.\n\nDon't understand your reasoning here.  As I mentioned in another comment, swing trading is more volatile, so I'd rather do it in an account I know I won't access for 10+ years instead of a taxable account I could possibly need to dip into at some point.

I\u2019m similar to you - 24 years old, love tech and so bought a whole heap of tech stocks originally, believing that tech is the way. But it would pay to understand broader macroeconomic principles like debt cycles. A bull run inevitably peters out. And you currently have 100% risk not only in equities, but a very narrow category of equities, heightening your risk even further. \n\nModern portfolio theory is quite useful but still can be deceptively volatile (given that in a traditional portfolio 90% of its risk lies in equities/stocks still). \n\nMost valuable thing I can recommend is reading about risk parity and the research papers at Bridgewater in general. The summary is: people think that bonds are slow and low growth. So you leverage them, so that they share the same growth/risk as shares, while simultaneously lowering your risk substantially given that you now have 50% risk in two different asset classes. \n\nOne other way to diversify your portfolio is KWEB, which is an ETF dedicated to Chinese Internet shares.
