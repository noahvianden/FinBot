The darkness of the video is probably due to the dynamic tuning software for the camera. Dynamic White balancing and exposure are critical for computer vision since they these systems typically only detect what they train on. You can train a CVS on pictures of white cars all day. When you show it a picture of a white one, it will say '99% chance it's a white car' but when you show it a red one it will say '58% chance it's a white car'.

For example, this car system would be classified as  [ASIL-D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Safety_Integrity_Level)  in ISO26262 which dictates the documentation, processes and requirements that must be met to achieve that rating. These standards dictate that every line of code including branches and decisions needs to be fully tested. No safety/life critical system relies on computer vision (2D and 3D) because it technically can't be tested as modern approaches are neural-net based. To save another wall of text: Neural nets can modify their decisions at run time and the same set of 'inputs' doesn't always yield the same corresponding output.
