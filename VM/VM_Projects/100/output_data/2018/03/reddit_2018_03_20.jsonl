OP *bought* short term options (combination of calls and puts) on different underlying assets. When you *buy* an option contract (either call or put), the underlying asset(s), in this case three (INTC, NVDA, and FB), **have** to go in the direction of your option contract. If they go sideways or the opposite direction you can lose your entire investment.\n\nOption contracts have a time factor to them (theta). Judging by the drastic increase in OP's portfolio in a single day, these contracts expire by the end of the week. The closer to expiration, the more closely OP's option contract values follow the move in the underlying asset, but also the quicker they lose value if the underlying asset(s) go against OP's position (hence the gamble). If the underlying assets went against OP's position, its likely he could have wiped out a large portion of his account in a very short time period.\n\nThe reason why the gains are so large is because a single contract represents 100 shares of the underlying, in this case a stock. So, the power (or danger) of options is leverage. You can buy one contract and get exposure to a move equivalent to 100 shares with far less margin or cash. At the same time, if that small amount of cash is your whole account, you can lose it all very quickly.\n\nIf he only bought one contract each for INTC, FB, and NVDA he gave himself exposure to 100 shares of each underlying. INTC, FB, and NVDA opened at $51, $170, and $241, respectively. That means he ***roughly*** got exposure to $5,100 + $17,000 + $24,100 = **46,200** dollars worth of stock with very little amount of money. This sounds attractive, but like I said it can be dangerous and is pretty much a gamble. Keep in mind OP roughly started off the day with $2,000 in his account.\n\nEverything I said above is in regards to *buying* options and is meant to be educational, not advice.
