You can show me balance sheets all day, but you can't account for human idealism. \n\nLike it or not, many people want this company to succeed, and I'm not betting against human irrationality. The best reason to play this stock is because of how polarizing it is. 30% of shares are tied up by people who hate Elon, and the other people propping up the inflated price believe that deep down someday this will profit. I don't know -  nor do I care what happens - but that's a wave you can ride. For every high there will be a dip, and every dip a high. Play the psychology.
