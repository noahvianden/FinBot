It\u2019s hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen a few weeks from now, let alone a year. You could be buying in at all time highs only to have things crash a few weeks later. The opposite could happen as well with buying low right before a nice market run. By investing a large chunk, you\u2019re indicating that you\u2019re confident in the holding or that you\u2019re willing to hold for the long term regardless of how it performs in the short to medium future.\n\nDollar cost averaging or investing in chunks allows you spread out your risk to volatility a bit. You\u2019ll get in during good times, bad times, stagnant times, etc. but you at least don\u2019t risk putting your money into things all at once and risk having something bad occur just days, weeks, or even months later. Investing in chunks also prevents you from fully committing a huge sum of money if something were to change. For example, you could put 10k down on something like a Marijuana company and be really optimistic about it only to have news come out that new regulations are being passed or that legalization ended up being voted down or delayed. If you already put that 10k in then you have to decide if you\u2019re going to sell or try to wait it out, facing uncertainty and missing out in potential gains in other companies, funds, or sectors if you were to have put your money elsewhere. If you did it in chunks and were say 2k into investing some of your money, you could decide to cut your losses and sell there or wait it out while putting the other 8k into something else. I\u2019m just throwing that example off the top of my head but hopefully that makes sense.\n\nThere are pros and cons to both ways. Investing in chunks can reduce commission fees. It can also be good for someone who has trouble committing to a schedule and prefers to just get it over with, set it and forget it.\n\nI personally do a bit of both. With index funds, I more or less just invest all at once each quarter. The exception being a healthcare and US Growth mutual funds I have that I have automatically come out of my check each week. I avoid individual companies for the most part but when I buy well established big companies like say Visa or Amazon, I\u2019ll typically split it into 2-3 transactions over a year as long as nothing usual happens. With my more risky, long shot companies I\u2019ll typically invest in one big chunk if the price is good and I\u2019m confident in the company after much research but they probably make up less than 10% of my portfolio. The only time I may invest a sizable chunk into individual large cap companies all at once and not again is when I think it\u2019s a great buying opportunity like I did with Facebook a few months back.\n\nIn other words, there is no right or wrong answer.
