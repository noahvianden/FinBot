The other thing with Intel that's important is that they were hit much harder with Meltdown and Spectre and rumors from I think OpenBSD were implying that there's issues with their hyperthreading design as well. It seems like there's a lot that they'll need to go back to the drawing board for because they can't just release a slower line of CPUs no matter how much more secure, so they'll probably hold on the full redesign and go for more refreshes before they're ready to release a new series.
