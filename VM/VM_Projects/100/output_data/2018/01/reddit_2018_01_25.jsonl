{"title": "BofA Merrill Lynch 149 page report on US equities", "selftext": "Someone mentioned trying to actually promote good, non-meme material here to help make informed decisions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Merrill Lynch released a huge 149 page report detailing the US market, their outlook, fears, metrics, and opinions.\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/369989100/US-Equity-Strategy-in-Pictures\n\n(EDIT: here is the raw file because the Scribd conversion is ass)\n\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/a3fu6slrdddb88u/US_Equity_Strategy_in_Pictures.pdf\n\nIt's a long read, and I'm not done with it yet, but here are some highlights:\n\nS&P 500 price target raised to 3,000 for 2018\n\nMarket doesn't to be at euphoric levels to cause concern, yet\n\nEquities still widely cheaper than bonds\n\nQuality stocks may be underpriced, a huge potential win\n\nWhat the cash repatriation may lead to\n\nNo 5% correction yet is odd, but if it happens it might not represent the end of the bull market but signal the late stage of it. Some of the best bull run returns come in the final year.\n\nBond flows well outpacing equity flows\n\nWhile analyst are bullish, forward P/E may be high as prices have outpaced increased earnings and some firms are still adjusting their models for increased earnings due to tax bill\n\nS&P 500 statistically expensive relative to past years\n\nExpect this year an opportunity to buy S&P 500 5-10% off it's highs due to a pullback\n\n11 of 19 bear market indicators have been triggered\n\nTax reform was largely priced in at the start of the year on a price standpoint, but price/earnings estimates may be revised upwards as firms include tax related aspects into their estimates\n\nTax reform may add 10-11% to EPS for 2018. Discretionary and telecom the biggest benefiters\n\nWeary that tax reform benefit for financials (thought of having the biggest impact) will remain due to competition\n\nTax reform good for small caps, but large caps have pricing power while small caps competition is tough\n\nNet margins for companies look **extremely** good and are at all time highs\n\nSector opinions:\n\n* **Overweight**: Information Technology, Materials, Financials\n\n* **Marketweight**: Health Care, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Energy, Telecom\n\n* **Underweight**: Real Estate, Consumer Discretionary, Utilities \n\nSector specific highlights:\n\nOverweight\n\nTech: semiconductors and tech hardware\n\nMaterials: Metals & Mining, Chemicals\n\nFinancials: banks and cap markets\n\nMarketweight\n\nConsumer staples: Food & Staples Retailing\n\nIndustrials: Machinery\n\nUnderweight\n\nRE: Specialty REITs\n\nTech only sector with positive net cash (cash - debt)\n\nCompanies likely to use repatriated and excess cash to pay down debt instead of buyback shares or companies\n\nWatch out for surprise inflation; would lead to quicker fed tightening than expected, and be a strong bear market signal.\n\nWage inflation has put some pressure on margins\n\nTax break/cash windfall has companies looking more towards one-time employee bonuses and wage increases than capex\n\nLarge caps over small caps\n\nDividend growth over high dividend yield\n\n", "id": "7sxdow", "created_utc": 1516898886.0, "score": 315, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": ">S&P 2018 target of 3000. \n\nPack it up boys this analysis is legit ", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Lol, 3000 will be hit by March if not next week.
