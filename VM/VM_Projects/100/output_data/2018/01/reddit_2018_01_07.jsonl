They let me back in during rebuilding with around a 650 score. You may not start out to high but they are a great lender to grow with. They offer 5% revolving categories and 1% on everything else. Also, they match all of your cash back for the first year. So the first year is effectively 10% for categories and 2% for everything else. Last quarterly category was Amazon and target. So you'd have gotten 10% back at either of those. Restaurants the quarter before. The quarterly revolving categories is awesome. I would also recommend checking out the American Express Blue Cash Everyday (BCE). They have great rewards and they also let me in around 650. If you have a fidelity account with a decent balance you can get the fidelity 2% visa fairly easy. They gave me a 5k limit when I had about a 675 score and my next highest limit was 2k. My scores didn't warrant getting the card but I had 75k in a fidelity brokerage account so I got it. \n\nThat denial is saying your average age of accounts is low and you haven't paid down much of your loans yet. It doesn't necessarily matter if your debt is 100k or 2k, but how much of it has been paid off from the beginning balance. A loan of 2k with a current balance of 1900 is going to look worse then a loan of 100k with a 50k balance because it shows you pay off your debt.
