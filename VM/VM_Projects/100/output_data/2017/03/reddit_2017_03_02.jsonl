Got a bit of reading done and looked more into this and kinda find this is BS. This is really  unfair to Ryzen, lets get one thing straight these are benchmarks. Comparing a heavily tuned gaming /single threaded cpu to a multi threaded based architecture is not fair comparison. \n\n The 1800x scores a tad higher in single threaded performances than the  i7-5960X  and is on par with multi-threaded performance for half the price. So I think they did there job in making intels' 1k cpu a run for its money. The key  thing not forget here is the 7700k is also intel's fastest single threaded processor as well. the 7700k is significantly faster in single threaded benchmarks than all of its other processors (even the high end xeon servers and 5960x).  The 7700k is tuned for specific  type of performance. Just like how certain engines are tuned for sports car and some are tuned for SUV's. There is no one type of engine, so there can't be one type of cpu. You can't fault them for hitting high multi threaded benchmark goals and not being tuned for gaming at the same time. Don't forget 1800X has a huge advantage over the 7700k in multi threaded performance. Looks like reviews are comparing them into different categories and that is just not fair. They wanted a cpu that could stand out next to intel, and they did. I'm sure second gen, or updates should fine tune single threaded performance . \n\nWhile this doesn't change the stock price, it will give me piece of mind that amd wont be out of the game and intel will actually have to do something.  I might double down on some of amd's stock tomorrow if the price drops a little more. Lets see what happens when the stock market opens.
