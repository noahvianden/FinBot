Ever since the Glass Stegal was passed IBs cannot prop trade for their own books. Goldman is just a market maker in this instance. Also the lock up period is for the seller (Abu Dhabi fund) they cannot sell any shares for 60 days. This is to ensure that when Goldman is selling the shares they are not selling into a market where Abu Dhabi fund is already dumping shares into.

Over here you'll see Goldman Sachs owns 2.7 million shares as well. \nhttp://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amd/institutional-holdings?page=3\n\nTo others:\nConsidering this was a block trade, Goldman Sachs most likely brokered the deal so that there wasn't a large drop in price. As for the Lock Up Agreement, it's directed towards the Abu Dhabi fund. The reason for this is so that they don't engage in \"prohibited hedging\" by disposing common stock for 60 days while Goldman is going to sell the shares in the open market strategically so they don't cause sharp price drops. Though the price they bought at seems interesting because y'know AMD being a pretty badass and confusing stock. They probably made a lot of money brokering the transaction to offset the loss in selling back to the the open market.
