The market could only go up, we were at the cusp of a new era and a new paradigm, all that. I distinctly remember wondering if I was missing the boat by working in government instead of some start-up firm.\n\nThen one day in 2001, I watched what seemed like an endless stream of people streaming out of those buildings after Amazon let hundreds of people go.\n\nThe dot-com bust was savage. We forget about it because the 2009 recession was so much more severe, but it was a sharp tack down just the same. Very few of those companies exist today. Amazon today is almost unrecognizable from what it was 15 years ago.\n\nWhen people mention the frothiness of the current market, the nay-sayers spell out that the last recession was caused by a systemic failure, and we don't have those same conditions today. But unlike the 2009 crash, 2001 was a legit market correction. The investment capital dried up. People started to look at fundamentals. Shit got real. People like to blame 9/11, but that just put the nail in the coffin.\n\nCan TSLA continue on this path forever? No. The questions are how and when does the ride stop. \n\nThis ends one of three ways: \n\n* TSLA explodes violently and spectacularly in the market one day (\"nobody could have predicted!\") and a significant portion of $50 billion dollars evaporates like it did for investors of YHOO in early 2000.\n* Investors demand blood like they did with Amazon, forcing TSLA to limp into profitability - likely losing a decade like Amazon did - and ushering in a slower, more painful grinding of that $50 billion dollars like AMZN through the year 2000.\n* TSLA lands fat contracts or licensing deals and pulls into positive P/E. The same scenario as #2 plays out, though with less savagery, as speculative investors begin to be replaced by those looking for value.\n\nSo I guess, yeah, I am short TSLA.
