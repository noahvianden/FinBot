{"title": "Have 10,000$, I am starting college in January. ETF or Individual stock(s)", "selftext": "Hello everyone! This is my first post on this sub. I have been doing as much research as possible the last 2-3 weeks on stocks, ETF\u2019s, Mutual Funds, and about anything I can read. Like I said I am starting college in January and would like to turn this 10,000$ into a decent bit more after 5-7 years. I would like to pay a decent bit of my student loans off from this investment. I am lucky enough to be great with money and have saved all of this up after starting to save last January. Would appreciate the advice on if I should do stocks. I am leaning a mix of \nNvidia, Amazon, AliBaba, MU, and Microsoft for stocks. I am very technologically inclined so that is why I chose these. For ETF\u2019s there were a few Semi-Conductor stocks such as SOXL, TQQQ, and SPXL that have caught my interest. Any advice for a noob trader?\n\nEDIT 1: This is receiving much more attention than I thought. Can people please do more than shout stock names. The few who have asked me questions and sent more in depth responses have helped a ton. Obviously this advice can help anyone not just I. Not looking for any sort of get rich stock. Just a smart idea to invest the money to help later with student loans.
