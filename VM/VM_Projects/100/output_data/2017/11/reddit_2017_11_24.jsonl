Marvel and Disney are very different from the rest of the networks on netflix. If AMC for example opens their own streaming service. Who is going to pay for it?  1/100 of Netflix users? The same is true for all the other networks. If they all  take 1/100 piece of the pie of the user base.. what will be left is an old school expensive viewing experience where users will have to subscribe to all these networks get the full \"netflix\" level experience again. This will kill the network more than Netflix as their demography potential has dramatically shrinked. Aside from no commercials, people love Netflix for how little it costs and the large variety of shows they can view. And creating small pockets of independent networks will destroy the large audience these networks have with Netflix and force customers to pick and choose service providers due to cost. So I dont see this simply as a problem Netflix will have to face but all networks that will opt out\n\nAs for the networks leaving... there is a big difference between Disney and marvel in comparison to every other major network that could potential leave. People are huge fans of star wars, disney animated cartoons and Marvel Comics. The other networks aren't even close to their caliber of loyal fans so they wont survive for long if they go solo. Disney and Marvel can do it with no issues and they know it.The rest? Netflix is the best place for their graveyard shows that dont run anymore, its the best way for them to still make money on shows 20-30 years old. I know I wont be getting AMC's streaming service just to watch a show or two I like from them (i.e. breaking bad) but I sure as shit watch it again on Netflix if its available. \n\nAnd Netflix has been absolutely killing it with original content, far better than every other network in terms of hit or miss ratio of shows. Whether its tv series, indie documentaries, movies or better yet stand up specials(every comedian wants to get on Netflix). If they continue like this (even if every network opts out) I can see them ending up as the top network providing nothing but original content. And people dont consider the ads that are already included in Netflix. They dont come in the traditional sense of stopping the viewing experience for a few minutes to showcase advertising but are rather integrated in to the show as a product utilized in the set. Its the most sustainable form of advertising today.\n\nOf course this is all speculative, I plan to ride netflix with leaps until 2019 (before the break up), they will for sure continue to kill it until then.
