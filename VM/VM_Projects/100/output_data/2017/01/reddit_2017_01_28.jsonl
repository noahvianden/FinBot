When you use them, you probably don\u2019t do so maliciously \u2014 and certainly not in a way to purposely offend or insult homosexuals. You, like many, may use the words without even thinking twice about it. Sometimes it just slips \u2014 it\u2019s an easy, long since accessible insult. It\u2019s almost a habit, right? Well, even if this is the case, it doesn\u2019t make it okay.\n\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s start with the obvious fact that \u201cgay\u201d often doesn\u2019t even make sense in most contexts in which it is used to describe something or someone. Take for example when you are hanging around with your friends and you say something along the lines of, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you come out tonight? Stop being gay.\u201d There is nothing gay about staying in. You mean stop being lazy? Anti-social? Lame? Is there really no better adjective you can find in your brain to use \u2014 one that is not only more politically correct but also more accurate for the point you\u2019re trying to make?\n\n\nJustifying your use of these words by saying \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it offensively,\u201d doesn\u2019t make it okay. Not only does it show ignorance, but it also shows a concerning lack of intellect. Yes, context is important.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s the implication behind it that is the problem.\n\n\nIf you are calling someone a faggot or gay, you are still using the term in a condescending, demeaning and often insulting manner. You never say, \u201cThis new guy I am dating is so fun and sweet! He always acts like such a faggot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just a word!\u201d Some people argue that by rejecting the word you could potentially give it more power, making it taboo or more controversial, and that they choose to use it as a means of \u201creclaiming\u201d it. I am not suggesting you ban these words from your vocabulary; I am suggesting you don\u2019t use them if you are doing so with the intent to insult.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t get to impose your own meaning on words and use them on, or against, other people... at least not while holding the ignorant belief it will go without ridicule \u2014 that the context you\u2019re using it in is excusable. You can\u2019t reclaim something without a thorough understanding of where it came from and the problem surrounding it. And the fact that you use it so carelessly leads me to assume you don\u2019t have that thorough understanding.\n\n\nTo you, it may be \u201cjust a word.\u201d If so, you are fortunate. A lot more fortunate than others who have a lot of pain and suffering tied to it. Sure, it\u2019s not a big deal to everyone, but just because it doesn\u2019t affect some people doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t your obligation to care about who it may \u2014 and why.\n\n\nThe best depiction of the problem with this word, and one that forever changed the way I view it, was a scene from comedian Louis C.K.\u2019s show, Louie. The particular scene is of him and his friends playing poker, poking fun at their gay friend, and asking a number of questions about \u201cgay things.\u201d\n\n\nLouie asked him if he thought he shouldn\u2019t be using the word \u201cfag\u201d on stage during his routines. His friend responded by saying:\n\n\nI think you should use whatever words you want. When you use it on stage, I can see it\u2019s funny, and I don\u2019t care. But are you interested in what it might mean to gay men? Well, the word \u2018faggot\u2019 really means a bundle of sticks used for kindling in a fire. Now, in the middle ages, when they used to burn people they thought were witches? They used to burn homosexuals, too. And, they used to burn the witches at a stake, but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting to be given a stake to be burnt on, so they used to just throw them in with the kindling, with the other faggots. So that\u2019s how you get \u2018flaming faggot.\u2019\n\n\n... You might wanna know that every gay man in America has probably had that word shouted at them while they\u2019re being beaten up, sometimes many times, sometimes by a lot of people all at once. So, when you say it, it kind of brings that all back up. But, you know, by all means, use it. Get your laughs. But, you know, now you know what it means.\n\n\nBe responsible. Hold yourself accountable. Pay attention to the words you use, the way you articulate yourself, and be aware of how the things you say may affect people around you. At the very least, take the time to understand the origin of a controversial term you use and the meaning it has for other people in our society before deciding not only whether or not you have the right to say it, but what feeling entitled to do so says about you.\n\n\nYou may not be homophobic. But saying you are \u201cjust joking\u201d or only saying it to people who aren\u2019t gay doesn\u2019t absolve you of blame. You may not be able to solve the issue of homophobia in our society. But what you can do it make sure you aren\u2019t \u2014 consciously or not \u2014 contributing to it.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When you use them, you probably don\u2019t do so maliciously \u2014 and certainly not in a way to purposely offend or insult homosexuals. You, like many, may use the words without even thinking twice about it. Sometimes it just slips \u2014 it\u2019s an easy, long since accessible insult. It\u2019s almost a habit, right? Well, even if this is the case, it doesn\u2019t make it okay.\n\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s start with the obvious fact that \u201cgay\u201d often doesn\u2019t even make sense in most contexts in which it is used to describe something or someone. Take for example when you are hanging around with your friends and you say something along the lines of, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you come out tonight? Stop being gay.\u201d There is nothing gay about staying in. You mean stop being lazy? Anti-social? Lame? Is there really no better adjective you can find in your brain to use \u2014 one that is not only more politically correct but also more accurate for the point you\u2019re trying to make?\n\n\nJustifying your use of these words by saying \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it offensively,\u201d doesn\u2019t make it okay. Not only does it show ignorance, but it also shows a concerning lack of intellect. Yes, context is important.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s the implication behind it that is the problem.\n\n\nIf you are calling someone a faggot or gay, you are still using the term in a condescending, demeaning and often insulting manner. You never say, \u201cThis new guy I am dating is so fun and sweet! He always acts like such a faggot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just a word!\u201d Some people argue that by rejecting the word you could potentially give it more power, making it taboo or more controversial, and that they choose to use it as a means of \u201creclaiming\u201d it. I am not suggesting you ban these words from your vocabulary; I am suggesting you don\u2019t use them if you are doing so with the intent to insult.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t get to impose your own meaning on words and use them on, or against, other people... at least not while holding the ignorant belief it will go without ridicule \u2014 that the context you\u2019re using it in is excusable. You can\u2019t reclaim something without a thorough understanding of where it came from and the problem surrounding it. And the fact that you use it so carelessly leads me to assume you don\u2019t have that thorough understanding.\n\n\nTo you, it may be \u201cjust a word.\u201d If so, you are fortunate. A lot more fortunate than others who have a lot of pain and suffering tied to it. Sure, it\u2019s not a big deal to everyone, but just because it doesn\u2019t affect some people doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t your obligation to care about who it may \u2014 and why.\n\n\nThe best depiction of the problem with this word, and one that forever changed the way I view it, was a scene from comedian Louis C.K.\u2019s show, Louie. The particular scene is of him and his friends playing poker, poking fun at their gay friend, and asking a number of questions about \u201cgay things.\u201d\n\n\nLouie asked him if he thought he shouldn\u2019t be using the word \u201cfag\u201d on stage during his routines. His friend responded by saying:\n\n\nI think you should use whatever words you want. When you use it on stage, I can see it\u2019s funny, and I don\u2019t care. But are you interested in what it might mean to gay men? Well, the word \u2018faggot\u2019 really means a bundle of sticks used for kindling in a fire. Now, in the middle ages, when they used to burn people they thought were witches? They used to burn homosexuals, too. And, they used to burn the witches at a stake, but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting to be given a stake to be burnt on, so they used to just throw them in with the kindling, with the other faggots. So that\u2019s how you get \u2018flaming faggot.\u2019\n\n\n... You might wanna know that every gay man in America has probably had that word shouted at them while they\u2019re being beaten up, sometimes many times, sometimes by a lot of people all at once. So, when you say it, it kind of brings that all back up. But, you know, by all means, use it. Get your laughs. But, you know, now you know what it means.\n\n\nBe responsible. Hold yourself accountable. Pay attention to the words you use, the way you articulate yourself, and be aware of how the things you say may affect people around you. At the very least, take the time to understand the origin of a controversial term you use and the meaning it has for other people in our society before deciding not only whether or not you have the right to say it, but what feeling entitled to do so says about you.\n\n\nYou may not be homophobic. But saying you are \u201cjust joking\u201d or only saying it to people who aren\u2019t gay doesn\u2019t absolve you of blame. You may not be able to solve the issue of homophobia in our society. But what you can do it make sure you aren\u2019t \u2014 consciously or not \u2014 contributing to it.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
