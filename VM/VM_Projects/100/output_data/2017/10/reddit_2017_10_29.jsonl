{"title": "Trying to Long the Opioid Crisis", "selftext": "I've been interested in going long on the opioid crisis for about a year now. I think now is the time for me to buy in. I'm looking for any new plays and to share one of mine. I know a lot of people around me who have been effected in some way or another. \n\nFrom a political standpoint **most politicians have incentive to try and stop this crisis**. The ones who don't will soon enough at the rate use of opioids is rising. \n\nI was looking into **ACHC**. My thinking is most people either they get clean or keep using until they die. I remember watching a Vice doc awhile back about how at least in Maine **some people can't afford to get clean**. They can't get into treatment centers to get off of the drugs.\n\nIf I recall **ACHC** is the **largest single rehab corporation in the country**. In Canada (someone please tell me if this is true) I believe the government will pay for people to get clean who cannot afford it. **In some other countries (notably Portugal) the government spends more trying to treat users than cracking down on them.**\n\nI know a lot of this is speculation, but if you don't get in now before its being combated you'll probably be too late. I'm certain whatever the response is that it will include trying to help addicts get clean. **You only get two options: Keep using until you die, or get clean.**\n\n**TL:DR I'm looking for any potential opioid epidemic plays.

I got really good at predicting what the FDA looks for in trials and also what makes a successful ADF. Problem is, every company that gets an FDA approval never does well in selling these drugs.

Until laws are passed that specifically forces doctors to prescribe ADFs, this technology will go nowhere. \n\nA turning point seems to be around the corner, though. I personally think the first few laws passed will (or at least should) target doctors who turn to pure opioid formulations before trying ADFs.
