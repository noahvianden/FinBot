The issue was that they were over hyped and over priced.

There is still a short covering that has to take place and plenty of the long term investors and institutions will start increasing their stakes and averaging down. Also, those who were on the fence or waiting to buy depending on the Earnings report will likely see this as a good entry once the price stabilizes.
