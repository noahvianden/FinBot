In the first case, $37; in the second case, $63; in the third case, $71. In today's case, the stock has attempted and fallen from $120 twice. \n* Also on the daily chart, the relative strength indicator has been a reliable way to identify a buy-in point. NVDA has rebounded off of 45 on the RSI consistently. It's currently hovering around 45.\n* However, the weekly chart looks pretty overbought. Please take this into consideration.
