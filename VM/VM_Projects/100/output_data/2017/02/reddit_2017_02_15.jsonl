{"title": "TSLA is a short-squeeze", "selftext": "I'm as short on Tesla as anybody. I think it's a bubble stock, and it's going to burst. Just look at how much the price has risen in the last few months without any substantive change in the stock fundamentals(Model 3 being on schedule is good news, but doesn't make the company 50% more valuable). Here's some numbers for you: The market assigns Tesla an EV(value of business after subtracting net cash) of $46 B. As a point of comparison, the market assigns General Motors an EV of $70 B. Now, Tesla is a wonderful company with a fantastic product. But GM literally has a NET INCOME GREATER THAN TESLA'S ENTIRE REVENUE. GM could take half a year's earnings, and build more Electric Vehicle production capacity than Tesla has built over the last decade. They are already doing this. The Chevy Bolt will cost $30,000, $5000 cheaper than the Model 3's stated price, which may in fact be higher. And this is GM's first all-electric vehicle in nearly 20 years. Just wait for that price to drop like a rock when they come out with the second model. Point is, if GM needs to, they will pull out all the stops and destroy Tesla's market with cheap mass-market electric cars. They are doing a lot less of this than you would expect, if you thought that Tesla will eventually take over the market for affordable sedans. This is because GM does not view Tesla as a serious threat to their business. The auto industry is an industry of scale, and GM(as well as the other automakers) have scale, whereas Tesla does not(20 million vehicles annually vs. 80,000). Self-driving is cool, but hard to value. Warren Buffett has said his personal over-under for self driving cars on the road in 2030 is 10%. In my opinion, in the absence of legislation, most people would rather save $10,000 than have a self-driving car.\n\nBack to the stock: I am bullish on Tesla and Elon Musk, long term. They have the best engineers and a truly tremendous product. But a price of $280 makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It will crash. That being said, only morons short Tesla. Shorting TSLA will only push the price up, when you are forced to buy back the stock at even more absurd levels. If you short TSLA, you are betting against the combined insanity of millions of enthusiastic, fat-walleted idiots who see just how damn good Tesla's management, engineers, and products are, and think that means the stock is infinitely valuable. I have two recommendations if this has all made sense so far. Number 1: LONG TERM PUTS, LONG TERM PUTS, LONG TERM PUTS. Don't push the price up further by shorting it, and then getting short squeezed. My second recommendation is to go long the other automakers. GM is my personal favorite, as they have had incredible earnings for the last couple of years, have made some serious investments, and are poised to completely dominate the Electric Vehicle Market if things go well. I'll be looking to go seriously long GM once Reverend Shkreli gives me that Gilead boost.

The guys I knew that were fans of Chevy in high school mostly still are.  GM going in to electric cars is going to secure that base, and being the most affordable electric is going to nab a section of consumers that couldn't afford previous electric vehicles, but they aren't going to be massively changing their earnings.  They already had affordable fuel efficient or hybrid vehicles prior to the bolt.  GM wasn't worried about people going for the initial Teslas because the guys buying those were already not buying GM brands - they were buying european or asian cars.\n\nThe market for GM is mostly in their truck sales.  The silverado alone is a half million sales per year, and GMC trucks are popular as well.

Apparently Elon expects most Model 3s to be sold at 42k though, so it's maybe more realistically $35k after $7500 in tax credits. As for the batteries, I think you might be underestimating the strength of the established Chinese and Korean battery manufacturers. Gigafactory is great, but these guys have years of experience and cheaper labor/friendlier regulatory environment. I won't call that one either way. Looks like the model 3 will charge about twice as fast as the Bolt, so that's an asset in Tesla's favor, although I don't think it's earth-shattering. As for the credits, they can sell them to the other automakers just like Tesla does. And if there are too many, then that's bad for both GM and Tesla, at least unless California raises the requirement. And yes, the established automakers are not nearly product-focused enough. GM will certainly have to improve its product or it will lose to the 100% product-focused Tesla. As for Tesla being a tech company, that's true but also sort of irrelevant, unless that's what the customers really care about. For instance, Apple is a tech company, but they're successful because of their brand. Their tech is no better and often worse than the competition. Which is more valuable to Tesla, its technology or its brand? Could Tesla lose some of its reputation as a maker of sexy cars if the Model 3 is average in a lot of ways? I don't really know, but maybe. And yes, Tesla is branching out, but I think you should be very skeptical of its non-car operations which don't have any proven success. The solar roof thing could have been just a bunch of hokey crap to justify Musk's purchase of his cousin Kimbal's company. The energy storage units will have to compete with other technologies like Sodium-ion batteries, and cheap Chinese shit. I don't see how lithium-ion would be more cost effective than sodium-ion when space/weight are not the primary concern, and I also never bet against cheap Chinese shit, they're just too damn good at what they do.\n\nUltimately, my thesis is that if GM or Ford acts now, focusing heavily in R&D and mass production of affordable EVs, that Tesla would be a goner. These companies just have so much more in terms of assets and earning power than Tiny Tesla. That's why I think Tesla has to be overvalued; it's too vulnerable in a market where it is not fully mature yet. It could still fail.
