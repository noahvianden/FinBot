Absolutely spot on. \n\n\n\nEdit: A few people from outside WSB seem to be a bit out of the loop. Rather than explain it over and over again I thought I'd just add a brief explanation of what's been going on:\n\n\n> Quite a long time ago the members of WSB got together and developed a trading algorithm. It was a bit of a joke at the time, but progressed much faster than anyone thought it would. Obviously it's not 100%, but it's pretty damn impressive. In particular, it did an amazing job calling the various oil moves a few years ago.\n\n> However, thanks to repeated waves of immigration from /r/all the percentage of members of WSB who had actually contributed to the original algorithm is pretty small. The original cabal didn't want to share the knowledge with all the plebs so had to decide a new way distribute the algo trading knowledge.\n\n> This is where Mr Frank \"wolfman\" C0meau comes in. He was an alter-ego thought up years ago by /u/jartek . Originally he just came out for long weekends and special occasions; he was meant to be a vicarious parody of /u/americanpegasus . However, jartek realised that this offered an outlet to distribute the algo's knowledge.\n> Whenever the algo light starts broadcasting, jartek runs down into the basement lair, dons the wolfmask and suit, and gets ready for action. He releases the algorithm's prediction in inverse form for the faithful to interpret. To save WSB from itself.\n\n>  tl;dr:\n\n> He's the hero WSB deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector.

Almost all of the following excerpt is wrong. Why does he even have a platform?\n\n\"Apple does not have shares\n\nIn theory, a share is a portion of a company\u2019s future earnings. If you owe 1 shares and the firm has 10, then 10% of the earnings are \u201cyours.\u201d If earnings go up, it should become clear that the stock price should go up as well.\n\nIn practice, though, you\u2019ll almost never receive the  company\u2019s earnings, and when you do, it will be heavily taxed and cut, under the form of crap-dividends, which you don\u2019t want anyway. It\u2019s not like you can go atMicrosoft\u2019s HQ and ask for your share of the quaterly profits, you know. Well, technically, you can, but they won\u2019t give it to you. Thus, on the stock market, there is only one real way to make money: resell a share for more than you bought it. This implies finding someone ready to pay a higher price than what you paid for a stock. Now, except in very rare circumstances, there is no guarantee anyone will ever buy a share for more than what you paid for.\n\nIn other words, in practice, earnings, revenues et al. don\u2019t matter nearly as much as they should. A company could report a gazillion dollars in profit, if there is nobody there to buy your shares, then you can\u2019t turn a profit. Company A could announced increased profits for 20 years in a row, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the stock will go up.\n\nThat being said, most companies do follow the theory, meaning that the stock will go up as earnings go up \u2013 most of the time. Sometimes, though, a stock will go up even as profits and revenue fall, and vice versa.\"", "score": -8, "replies": [{"body": "I don't necessarily agree with all the points but can explain why you think he's way off base? Stock prices for individual companies follow some general rules but they are not hard and fast, and they differ a lot by sector. For instance, you can have a company like AMZN, which has never issued a dividend and has insane P/E and P/B ratios, yet which has continuously gone up for the past 20 years because it's considered a growth stock. Then you can have a company like WMT, which has very typical P/E and P/B ratios yet which plummeted even when it hit Q4 earnings projections because foot traffic in brick and mortar stores declined.\n\nThe point is that fundamentals can only get you so far. AAPL, being the most valuable company in the world, is in a bit of a weird situation right now. They've been one of the most impressive stocks in the post-recession era yet in 2015 they hit a wall in part due to perception that they were no longer a \"growth\" stock due to saturation of the smartphone market and lack of market share in emerging markets.\n\nThe point being, no one in the history of the stock market has been able to reliably predict whether a company's stock price will go up or down based on fundamentals.

It was a bit of a joke at the time, but progressed much faster than anyone thought it would. Obviously it's not 100%, but it's pretty damn impressive. In particular, it did an amazing job calling the various oil moves a few years ago.\n\nHowever, thanks to repeated waves of immigration from /r/all the percentage of members of WSB who had actually contributed to the original algorithm is actually pretty small. The original cabal didn't want to share the knowledge with all the plebs so had to decide a new way distribute the algo trading knowledge.\n\nThis is where Mr Frank \"wolfman\" C0meau comes in. He was an alter-ego thought up years ago by /u/jartek. Originally he just came out for long weekends and special occasions; he was meant to be a vicarious parody of /u/americanpegasus. However, as head mod he realised that this offered an outlet to distribute the algos knowledge.\n\nWhenever the algo light starts broadcasting, jartek runs down into the basement lair, dons the wolfmask and suit, and gets ready for action. He releases the algorithm's prediction in inverse form for the faithful to interpret. To save WSB from itself.\n\ntl;dr\n\nHe's the hero WSB deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector.
