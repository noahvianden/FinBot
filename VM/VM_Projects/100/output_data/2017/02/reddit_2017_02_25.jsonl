AMD Has a long history of overheating and causing problems, companies don't like that, they would rather go with an Intel processor that has never overheated. Maybe as time passes, AMD becomes more of an option for big companies.\n\nThese companies follow the simple rule of \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" with the exception being Saving Money. AMD is giving them the opportunity to save money, now they just need to prove it's reliable. \n\nBut when it comes to the gaming market, AMD might be ahead in a few years if they keep this up, but they aren't going for the top performance at this point of the game. The old management team was, the new one isn't. They are going for budget Processors/GPUs, which is what will attract bulk-buyers.\n\nAlso, the Title of this post is misleading in a way. Intel has their prices that high because no processor is close to theirs, it's essentially a monopoly. With AMD catching up, it might make Intel drop the price in their $1500 processors (That cost $100 to make) to whatever AMD is doing. That is, if they don't collude and agree to keep prices at a midpoint so that both of them keep profits up.\n\nThat's my 2 cents. I don't expect AMD to steal Intel nor NVidia's place anytime soon, but if they prove to be reliable, they might just do that. I'd say that NVidia's safe for a while though, currently, AMD is focusing MUCH more on CPUs. They might announce new GPUs soon with NVidia announcing the 1080ti in 2 days, but that won't be top tier.
