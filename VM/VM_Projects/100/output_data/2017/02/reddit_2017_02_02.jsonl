This is important for tax purposes if you buy the same stock over some period of time. If you go with FIFO (first in first out), then the earliest shares you bought are the ones that get sold first. If you've been holding the stock for over a year, these will be considered long term capital gains, which means you get a discounted tax rate compared to short term gains. HOWEVER, if the stock has been going up steadily since you bought it, and you sell those early shares, your capital gain will be substantial. This means you'll pay a large amount of the capital gain as tax, compared to if you had sold a later share that's still over a year old.\n\nThe default for the IRS is FIFO so most brokers assume you're doing that unless you tell them otherwise.

If you sold the oldest ones first (FIFO), you would have a capital gain of ($9-$8)\\*1000 = $1000 that you would need to pay taxes on. On the other hand, if you sold the more recent ones, you could claim a loss of ($9-$10)\\*1000 = $-1000. So if the stock goes up later on (say above $10/share) and you sell the rest of it, then by selling the more recent shares now, you'll have avoided paying capital gains tax on 1000 shares. \n\nSomeone should correct me if I'm wrong since I've never actually done this, just basing it on what I've read.\n\n", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Ding ding!

A call that is lower than the current stock price is called an ITM (in the money) option.  Look at fb option tables for an example of all options available.

The more ITM an option is, the higher delta it has.\n\n\nPeople have a lot of reason to buy ITM.  When the stock drop, if the option is OTM (out of the money), it becomes worthless.  But if it's an ITM option, it may still retain some value.\n\n\nFor the people who buy deep deep ITM options (delta>.9), they treat it as discounted stocks.\n\n\nTake, an example, if you buy a call fb option at 80 strike that expires in Dec 2017, it'll cost you $53.  That means for $53, you have the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $133 (80+53).
