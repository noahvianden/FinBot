It is a metric in determining how much the stock is expected to move before the expiration date of a stock. An option is more expensive when IV is high. The logic is kind of sound because if a stock is expected to move a certain percentage then it's more likely that the price will move above the strike price of an option call or below an option put. Then IV goes down, so does the price. IV is especially high when earnings are considered. Time decay is the decay of the price the closer an option gets to expiration date. The closer it gets, the lower the price. This is exponential on a chart showing price over time. Again it's intuitive because the closer you are to expiration, the less time a stock has time to move.\n\nTakeaway: don't buy too close to expiration date or the decay will go very fast. Don't buy too close to earnings if IV is mega high because the price will drop as soon as earnings are over, unless of course it moves in the direction you expected it to. Let's say after earnings the stock doesn't move much.
