As a real estate owner, I can use valuation methods and purchase into real estate. \n\nMy profession by trade, being an asset manager is different. In the world of equities you cannot pick and choose stocks based upon valuation. The valuation to share price is too randomized do to speculative trading becoming mainstream. \n\nWhich is why even the best of the best managers are not that great at managing. Which is why for actively managed portfolios we've moved to the world of options/futures. With those you can calculate probability. You can calculate returns. You can find a statistical edge every single time you make a trade. \n\nIt should also be noted, as a business owner/investor - I'll say Robert has one of the most spot on books about investing since inception.
