I'm borrowing 3k right now so I get charged $15 a month (0.5%). There are no interest fees on profits or their money, only the monthly fee you must pay.\n\nThere is a margin maintenance to maintain or you will need to add $$ to your portfolio/not be able to trade until the amount is settled. I believe the margin maintenance is if your portfolio drops below the $ amount you borrowed. Mine is $2,100. So if I magically lose all of my portfolio down to $2,100 they will freeze my account.
