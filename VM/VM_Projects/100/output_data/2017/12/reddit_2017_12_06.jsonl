If you aren't trading actively (short-term), the only real difference is during a crash - because you can unload ETFs in a matter of milliseconds, but mutual funds are only sold end-of-day.

Those two pluses come at a price though, as most casual investors may not have the minimum investment necessary to achieve I-share sized investments and well rounded diversification.  \n\nTo further clarify, I-shares were designed for Pensions, municipal funds, endowments, and outside corporate investments.
