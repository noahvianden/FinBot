{"title": "The Art of the DD: For Beginners", "selftext": "WSB was full of the best people - simply the greatest people, anyone will tell you that, we used to be the best.  But after an influx of unvetted new users, we've fallen into disrepair.  Due to a recent margin call after a sequence of poor trades, our sub can no longer afford to ban all Canadians or build a wall.  However, fear not - I believe that we can solve this crisis with a little bit of education.  It's time to make this sub great again.  \n\n**Chapter 1:** \n\n*\u201cWhat the fuck does \u2018justify your trades\u2019 mean?\u201d*\n\nIt\u2019s a question that anyone here who posts on /r/investing will sprint back asking in a matter of nanoseconds.  \u201cWhy do I have to give reasons?  Why can\u2019t we all just fly by the giant throbbing dick in my pants?\u201d  \n\nWhen normal people gamble their money, they like to limit the risk involved, and draw a basis for their expectations of potential gain or loss.  Due to this, investors have invented the DD \u2013 a versatile tool that both acts as a high-quality plastic upgrade for their wives, and an excellent way to convince others to follow or allow (if they\u2019re an institutional investor) their trades.  \n\n**A Due Diligence is about like a high school book report, but on a stock.** It involves some basic preliminary research \u2013 most of which can be done with websites not dissimilar to CliffNotes.  After choosing a stock, you can pretty much go get condensed data from some website that actually bothered to read the SEC filings and calculate the basic TA algorithms.   These are what you will stich and glue together to make your very first DD collage.    \n\n**Chapter 2:**\n\n*\u201cHow do I not be retarded?\u201d*\n\nThis chapter will be my extremely over-simplified, probably-inadequate answer to that question. \nFirst and foremost, I believe that there are four key elements to any good trade, listed here in order of importance (top to bottom) and implied penis length when used to justify your trade (bottom to top): \n\n* 1.  Climate\n* 2.  Fundamentals\n* 3.  Technicals\n* 4.  Story\n\n**1: Climate (The Obvious Shit)**\n\nLet\u2019s start from the top. \nFirst and foremost, you\u2019re going to want to look at the climate that surrounds the stock.  This is crucial for short term trades \u2013 if the market is in the middle of a slide, correction, or crash, it\u2019s probably best to wait and get in at a later date.  If the market sector is facing significant challenges (i.e. oil with rapidly expanding production and growing inventory) that are likely to weigh on the sector\u2019s stocks, it\u2019s probably a good time to wait or move sideways.  If all is well and good \u2013 or if the market is experiencing a surge \u2013 perhaps a more aggressive than usual stance can be taken, due to a theoretically lower risk.\n\n**2: Fundamentals (Aka /r/investing)**\n\nNext, you want to look at the fundamentals of your stock.  Even for the autistic orangutans here in WSB, this is pretty damn easy \u2013 but it\u2019s usually missing from DD posts anyways, so let\u2019s break out the crayons.  Yahoo Finance has pretty much all the information you could want under its Statistics and Financials tabs.  Advanced autists can also search for 10-k\u2019s, 10-q\u2019s, 8-k\u2019s, and, well, literally every type of SEC filing, with SEC.gov\u2019s edgar search tool.  Using this data to predict future cash flows, you can come up with a valuation for a company\u2019s stock price.  Or you can just look up analyst estimates and hope for the best.\n\n**How To Use Fundamentals in WSB:**\n\nFundamentals are not the essence of a good trade \u2013 the market is inefficient, irrational, and rarely ever trades shares at a fair market value.  You will rarely, if ever, buy a yacht with gains from fundamental analysis.  **However,** (this is the important part) **a stock\u2019s price will trend towards its ever-changing fair market valuation over time.**  This makes fundamentals very useful as a safety net or a measure of risk for short term trades.  For example, someone who\u2019s betting on a binary event to cause share value to go up is taking on less risk if the fundamentals suggest the price should continue moving upwards over time (whereas if fundamentals suggest the stock is overvalued, the trader will be completely reliant on the outcome of the binary to make a profit).  They\u2019re there, they\u2019re useful, so use them.  \n\n**3: Technicals**\n\nIf the climate is appropriate and the fundamentals are comfortable, you\u2019re in the clear to make an investment.  However, we\u2019re not investors here.  Traders operate on a much shorter timeframe, which I could yap on about but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all already stopped reading at this point.  \nAfter using the market climate and fundamental analysis to predict long-term price trends, a trader should investigate the technicals.  Technicals are the key to predicting short term movement.  Where should we start?  If you\u2019re actually still here reading and taking this seriously, and don\u2019t know the basics already, do yourself a favor and go binge-read Investopedia like it\u2019s your favorite type of porn.  Go educate yourself on SMA\u2019s, EMA\u2019s, RSI, Stochastic Oscillators, MACD, Bollinger Bands (use responsibly), candlestick charting and patterns, Fibonacci Retracements, and anything else you can find.  Learn how to calculate them, and what they mean.  Then, find a website or write a program to do the math for you (but again, make sure you know what factors they consider and what they mean, otherwise you\u2019re probably just going to fuck yourself over by using them improperly).  \n\n**How to use Technicals in WSB:**\n\nIs the stock trending up or down?  Is that trend likely to continue?  How strong is the current price?  Is the stock overbought or oversold?  Etc etc.  Technicals are the key to timing your entries and exits.  Using them properly will make you a more successful trader, and referencing them in a DD will make your e-peen bigger when you post to WSB.  \n\n**4: Story (In Brief)**\n\nFinally, we arrive at what\u2019s probably the most inexplicable item \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 the story.  This gets real self-explanatory real quick: What the hell is making TSLA shoot up every time I sell it?  It\u2019s not the climate \u2013 auto makers are getting slaughtered.  It\u2019s sure as hell not the fundamentals \u2013 these guys aren\u2019t making a profit, and their future cash flow is difficult to estimate.  Technicals have no bearing here.  But what does?  Elon does, mother(musker?)fucker.  The market is retarded and irrational enough that we can\u2019t put a price on a Horatio-Algers story and some batteries.\n\n**Chapter 3:**  \n\n*\u201dThat was long as fuck and I hate you for it\u201d*\n\nIndeed.  \n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nIf you\u2019re going to make a DD post, actually do your due diligence. Tell us: \n\n* About the market sector\n* About the company\u2019s performance\n* About the stock\u2019s performance\n* About the retarded delusions you have of where this company will go in the future\n\nUse resources like: \n\n* [Yahoo Finance]( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WCN/key-statistics?p=WCN) and its many tabs\n* [sec.gov\u2019s Edgar Search]( https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)\n* [StockTA.com]( http://www.stockta.com/)\n* [MarketWatch]( http://www.marketwatch.com/)\n* [SimplyWall.St](https://simplywall.st/) (for those of you who don\u2019t like research)\n* [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/) if you actually want to be a decent investor and know your shit\n* [Pornhub\u2019s vast collection of investor materials](https://www.google.com/search?q=pornhub+cuckold&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) (NSFW)\n* Literally anything besides your gut feeling or a shitty meme\n\nEdit: and as per /u/spawrks comment, give us proof of your fucking trade.  \n\nI hope that, with effort, we at WSB can come together once more.  We can revive our legacy - relive the glory days of rainbow dicks and real-life meetups that inevitably ended in massive homosexual orgies.  But we will have to work together to reach that goal.  It's time to make WSB great again.\n", "id": "6j6gri", "created_utc": 1498281326.0, "score": 2320, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 217, "comments": [{"body": "I sticky this thread from time to time to highlight two things:\n\n1.
