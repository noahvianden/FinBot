(I've invested into $DIS, $ATVI, $BABA, $MSFT and more with the two.) \n\n\n\nThough I strongly believe $NVDA and $AMD have more rooms to go north, I'm going to cash everything out and take the profit for now (I'm going to pay out my loan with it.) Half of the profit came from the stocks that I've bought along the way which I'm probably gonna get hit by that 25% tax rate but profit is still a profit I guess :)\n\n\n\nSetting everything aside, it feels great to reach my goal!!!
