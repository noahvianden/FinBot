They've got orders that will take years to fill but it's for a car no one has seen or driven. I'm sure it'll be nice but it WILL have recall problems. So some will cancel and others will be told it could be several years, at which point they'll cancel.

So they've created a car that has demand so high they'll spend several years trying to meet it all the while continuing to not make money.
