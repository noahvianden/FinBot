How to implement algorithms, which are best, good coding practices, bad coding practises, why unit testing is good. General CS stuff. Know at least how to program in Python and Java(or Scala). Know why using scripting language is better or worse over a compiled one. Likely the stuff you work on will be difficult, not algorithmically but logically very difficult to implement.
