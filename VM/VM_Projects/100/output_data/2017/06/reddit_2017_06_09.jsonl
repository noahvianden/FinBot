Welcome to /r/wallstreetbets and now you can start losing money with the rest of us! \n\nJokes aside, you can make money when a stock falls by either shorting, buying puts, or selling calls. Shorting is like the opposite of buying a stock, you borrow shares from a broker and pay them back later (hopefully when it's at a lower/cheaper price). \n\nCalls are contracts that let you buy a stock at a certain price (called the strike price) by a certain expiration date. Long story short, stock goes up enough, you're earning way more of a percentage gain depending on the strike price, volatility, and a bunch of other factors. However, that's not always the case, as you have to watch for how much implied volatility is priced in, and theta decay, etc. Puts are the opposite of that (sell a stock at a certain price). Stock goes down a lot, you earn even more. For each contract (100 calls or puts), depending on the delta, it'll be similar to holding (or shorting) like 50-100 shares of the stock most of the time, but at a much much lower cost. The most you can lose though, is the premium you paid for the contracts. \n\nThere are dozens of other options methods (butterfly, straddle, strangle, faggot's delight), but I wouldn't recommend you try them with real money until you research it thoroughly.

I didn't stop doing it in my sleep until I got mouth cancer and had to have part of my cheeks removed, couldn't pack a lip anymore. I then started going to bed with some nicorette under my tongue. That of course, came before the tongue cancer, which finished off both my tongue and lower jaw. I had to have a feeding tube put in since I couldn't swallow anything without a jaw or a tongue. This also meant no more gum for me, not that I could afford buying it much longer anymore. Medical expenses piled up and my golden goose, 10000 shares of AMD, started looking shaky enough to short after it sunk under the 2.90 mark. At this point, I was in a real dilemma: I couldn't dip without cheeks, couldn't chew gum without a jaw, and couldn't smoke without lips (which by the way, were removed with the cheeks). I figured it was time to go back to dip, but this time, I mixed it in with the ensure that I ate with my feeding tube. The skoal smoothies worked a couple of times, but after that, my feeding tube got clogged and I had get a new one put in. Right after I left my doctors office with a new feeding tube I, it finally hit me how much money I lost.

You most certainly can lose money as a result of IV when an underlying rises less than was originally priced into the option... if you don't know that you probably shouldn't be buying options.

You seem very adversarial, grounded in your ways, and unable to understand what consensus does to required returns for profit... don't buy options man.
