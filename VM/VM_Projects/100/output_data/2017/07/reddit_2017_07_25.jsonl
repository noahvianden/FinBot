We'll likely see a lot of volume in the morning too.  Profit takers handing over to shorts covering in extended hours, that type of deal.\n\nSometimes this extended hours volume leads to the classic gap and crap, where the price gets driven up by shorts closing, then right after the bell, all that volume on the bid dries up and the price is just high and without much support, and it gets crashed right down again.  Gaps up and craps out\n\nA more traditional short squeeze is usually dependent on price movement and not actual time of day - when a price moves up past a couple levels of resistance, it's met with more buying pressure, and starts tripping stops on shorts, which adds to the buying pressure, and causes that little breakaway.\n\nBut AMD, it's already up 10%, anything we're gonna see is gonna be thrown into the first hour most likely, it's already that far up.\n\n\n\n", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Damn I don't know what to do, maybe set a stop loss and just watch what it does in the morning and cash out sometime in the first five minutes or something lol >.<", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I wouldn't go so far as to dump the entire load at the open without any sort of confirmation that it's coming back down, but it's good to keep in mind that many people have watched their 10% or 20% float right back down.  Pretty much everyone, at some point in time.  Buy low, sell high.  Sell high, don't hold high and watch your tendies get away from you and then sell back where you started.\n\nLots of people reduce their position as opposed to treating their position as an all-or-none binary proposition - you could be very protective of a portion of your position and sell with a tighter mental stop, and let the rest ride more loosely.  This is good practice, take some off the table.\n\nThis will likely be incredibly high volume and high trading range due to price, so I'd greatly recommend keeping an eye on 3 minute charts as opposed to a ticker, so you can visualize that range, and visualize levels of support (where it's bouncing vs where it's crashing), and not set any stop limit until you can identify the range (many people have set a tight stop on shit like this only to have it trigger on a normal bounce in the range).\n\nBiggest thing to keep in mind is that if you aren't firm in your stops and you let this thing fall down, every percent you lose letting it come closer to you in hopes that it takes off again, you're taking all that money and gambling with it.  If you have 10k at stake, you're paying 100 bucks on every percent to see if it'll pay off, and the more money you give away, the less likely you'll see any upside (since it's just dropping and dropping).  But you might feel like you sunk all this paper gains into it, that just a little more will do the trick (it's really just dropping).  That's how intraday fucks you raw - 'I'll give it another percent, and another percent, it just went up 10% it'll probably go another 10% any minute now, just one more percent and it'll bounce' - yeah, it'll fuck you raw if you let it.  If you ever feel like giving it another percent, consider all other options - exiting the trade, reducing the position, going to another position where you might have much better odds.
