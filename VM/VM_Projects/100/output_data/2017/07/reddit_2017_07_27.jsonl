They beat on revenue which means people are still buying toilet paper with their prime accounts. Amazon could hunker down, streamline operations, cut spending, and focus on making money.

The weakest of these ideas is the original streaming content because I just don't see it ever being too profitable an enterprise for Amazon.   \n\nEdit: the streaming content makes a lot of sense.
