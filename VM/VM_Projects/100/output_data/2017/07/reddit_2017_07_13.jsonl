To eat endless freshly made ceviche on the yachts (anyone who has ever been on a yacht knows it's nothing without fresh ceviche).\n\nFor those of you in the green, I salute you as you slowly - but SURELY - build the yacht of your dreams. This post isn't really for you.\n\nHowever, for those of you less fortunate souls who are deep in the red, giggling at images of yachts run aground which you still can't afford, this post is for you. Specifically, this post is for those of you which have managed to lose an absurd amount of money on options in a short amount of time, since that seems to be something that happens here basically every day to someone.\n\n**Tip #1: Don't stop trading options. Instead, trade them smarter**\n\nDon't be a pussy. Yes, options most likely got you into this mess. But guess what? They can get you out easier than most things as well! \n\n**You most likely went wrong Buying Faggie D's**: Yes, everyone on this forum is grateful for our beloved FD's, but any of us who have been trading options long enough know that beneath the skirt of most fine looking weeklies is a huge dick waiting to fuck you right in the ass.\n\n\"What do I buy then, daddy?\"\n\nI'm not going to get into understanding theta and IV, if you don't get that stuff then go to Google. That's the bare minimum you should understand before trading options.\n\nIf you're deep in a hole, I recommend purchasing ITM options that are MINIMALLY 3-4 months expiry away. For the patient pandas in the group, going further out, 6+ months, and continuing to roll successful plays is a great way to make a lot of money over a longer period of time. For those of you who can barely stop looking at the numbers go up and down for more than 5 minutes at a time, you might want to stick to the 3-4 month window because you're not going to be able to keep your finger off your mouse long enough to profit fully off of longer term plays.\n\nBy ITM, I mean as far as you can comfortably go given your finances. If you're not retarded (which you probably are), you've figured out by now that options scale better the deeper ITM they are. A $50 stock might have a $50 strike with a $5 premium, meaning the stock needs to hit $55 by expiry to break even. But the $20 strike might have a $31 premium, meaning your break even becomes $51. Of course, your up front costs are way bigger, so pick a strike that is a good balance between what you can actually afford & deepness.\n\nTo give you an analogy you will be able to associate with: Just like sucking dick, the farther you can go down the better. But you don't want to choke to death on it.\n\nIf you want to buy OTM options, you stand to make a much greater amount in a much shorter time, but you've increased your risk dramatically... and it's likely that's why you're fucked to begin with. Still, you can much more safely buy OTM options if the expiration is further out, and they require a lot less capital to invest. Of course, you'll also notice the stock will need to climb much higher to pay off. For OTM options I really recommend SLIGHTLY OTM on a stock that had a recent dip.\n\nNext part of this tip: **know when to sell**\n\nI know you think this is easier said than done, but it's actually quite simple:\n\n* Sell before you've lost more than you're comfortable with - let's say 20% of your initial investment as a reasonable starting point. While I don't necessarily recommend setting stop losses on options, if you're the kind of person who will consistently say \"but it HAS to go back up SOON\", maybe you should consider that.\n\nLearning to get out with minimal losses is one of the best things you can do when trying to claw back your money. It gives you a renewed opportunity to make money, vs being dramatically deeper in the hole and too poor to ever get out.\n\n* Sell when you've made an amount of money you're happy with. Try to keep your goals realistic. 10% is a LOT to make in a day. If you're not sure the rocketship will continue, consider getting out at 5 or 10%. If the rocket is blasting off to the moon and you want to ride it out, great, but having an exit point in mind ensures you a much greater chance of not watching the rocket sputter out and crash into some shitty meteor which plummets into Earth's atmosphere and burns up in seconds.\n\nThink about this - you're $500 down or whatever half of your life savings you took out of Robinhood to trade options was. You make a $100 options play, and you're 50% up on it in a week. That's 50 fucking percent. It might only be $50, but how many opportunities do you have to make 50% in a week? Unless you're absolutely sure the stock will continue to move in the right direction - which you aren't - get the fuck out and be happy with now only being down $450. Make enough smart moves like that and you'll be just fine.\n\nNext up: **Don't \"play\" earnings**\n\nIn fact, stay the fuck away from earnings dates. \n\n\"Well when do I buy the options if it's not right before earnings then, daddy?\"\n\nHow about this - after your favorite meme stock just took a major hit of 5+% and has stabilized and is trading flat or slightly up for a day or two. Now buy your long dated calls, watch that shit soar. Or conversely, wait for the stock to have that big run up, then the first day it takes a 5+% shit buy your puts.\n\nIn fact, if you're buying calls, buy them for after the next earnings, so you can capitalize on high IV. Wait for the run up into earnings and then 1-2 weeks before earnings GET RID OF THEM.\n\nThere's nothing worse than having made a smart options play and then shoving both ends of a double sided dildo inside yourself by riding through earnings just to watch your tendies turn into chickens. What the fuck do you do with chickens on a yacht? There is no chicken ceviche, fuck off.\n\n**Tip #2: Diversify yo bonds**\n\nStop putting all your money in one play. Yes, this can get you out of the shit as fast as you got in. It can also double fuck you to infinity and beyond, never to recover your losses and teaching you zero lessons in the process.\n\nHow much should you put in? For options plays, probably not more than 10% of your entire portfolio per play.\n\nDiversification may be frowned upon here, but you can quietly diversify and make your money back before coming back into the public light with your new YOLO's. Nobody will even know.\n\nAnd I don't just mean spread your money around into different options. Buy stocks. In fact, have at least 75% of your portfolio be stocks. One great thing about owning stocks is you learn what the price action on that stock is like, which gives you an *amazingly* higher chance of playing options correctly on that stock. In fact, I'd recommend buying and following at least 1 share of a stock for at least one full quarter before playing options on it, even though I know you won't listen to that.\n\nThe other nice thing about stocks is that if you fuck up, you can just bag hold long enough and you'll eventually make money. Options? Not so much. This brings me to my next point:\n\n*don't buy penny stocks, stay away from pharma*\n\nThese are the two kinds of stocks that regularly go from hero to zero or vice versa, but once they make the flop... that's usually it for a long fucking time. Maybe forever. Buy stock in companies that have been around a while and have more normalized product and sales cycles. You can be riskier by trading high growth stocks like NVDA, AMZN, and many other of this forums favorites, most of which will bounce back and make you money even if you bought it at its all time high. Which brings me to my next point:\n\n**have a safe haven stock or three**\n\nThere are going to be times when it's better to NOT be putting your money into trades. But you and I both know you can't fucking help yourself. You think something retarded like \"oh, but if it's cash it can't make me money so I HAVE to make a trade\". Fine. Have a few stocks that are the kinds of stocks which likely won't move very much that you like. MSFT is one of my fav's, any time I'm like \"what the fuck do I do with this money?\" and I can't control myself, it often goes to MSFT where it makes me a few pennies and if I'm lucky some dividend payouts and then I move along when I'm ready. McDonald's is surprisingly reliable. There are many other solid blue chip stocks which can play this role well. Of course, by not staying in cash during these periods you are always risking the inevitability of suffering a true market correction.\n\nWhich brings me to my final tip... \n\n**Tip #3: Don't trade just to trade**\n\nSeriously. If you just rode an enormous rally to Valhalla and made back 50% of your losses and are like \"IT'S GOTTA CRASH ANY SECOND NOW SO I'M CASHING OUT\", that's smart. Cash the fuck out. Maybe it won't crash the next day, or the next, or even the next. And you might feel like a real dickfor. But EVENTUALLY there will be a nice red day for you to jump back in. Learn to be comfortable sitting in cash until you see a good opportunity.\n\nIf you can't do this, you're going to at some point or another experience a world of pain as all your gains get flushed down the toilet in some temporary reversal and you have to start back at square one like an asshole.\n\nIf you can continuously spot good opportunities, get in, get out without getting greedy, and being patient until the next good opportunity, you *will* make back your money.\n\nThen once you've made your money back, it's YOLO time.\n\n*Note: This is not professional advice and frankly idk what the fuck I'm doing or I wouldn't be here.

So my original idea was to hedge these with PUTS, more or less. But since my calls were so far out, I got the idea to buy a new one closer to the money, which would get a bigger effect from a swing. \n\nBut since I had an underlying hope of the stock going upwards to save my calls, while convincing myself it was most likely, I decided to sell one of my PUTS. So I sold the one which had the same price as I sold it for, and kept the one that had decayed 35%. The fact that at this point I had a lot of money in the game, and the fact that I could get my weeklies back at no loss made me do it I think. \n\nIt was a fucked up situation cause around lunch I was thinking it would go down with earnings, quite convinced, then the hour before close estimates call and the market looked positive, which made me doubt myself..

If it keeps bleeding it might got way up, but I'm holding it for now. \n\nAll of this mess came from emotional trading, so I'm trying to learn from it. My original idea from 1month ago was to set a strangle ahead of earnings by buying OTM calls and puts oppossing eachother. If I had done that properly I'd have like +3000$ or something.. While this stock is bleeding I'm looking or dirt-cheap calls for december after 3rd quarter earnings.
