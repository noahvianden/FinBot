You'd think after like 9 earnings straight of always beating that analysts would expect higher from NVDA but it seems like every Quarter they are always so surprised that they somehow, yet again, beat by +70% and always set the next quarter to even lower than last.\n\nFor real though, NVDA is always priced in to some extent, which is why it needs to have a spectacular beat in order to go up. Look at last earnings when it was in the ~90s and everyone was talking a lot of shit about NVDA having a resistance at ~100 (-/+ $5) then it beat by like 70% (again) then got like 7 different companies giving it a PT increase to like 140s or some shit.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Um bro it was still spectacular beat.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Breh 50% aint shit for NVDA.
