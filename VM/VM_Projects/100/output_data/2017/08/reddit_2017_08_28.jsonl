You had to go to farmer's markets or inconvenient specialty shops to get things like almond milk, line-caught fish, any kind of flour other than wheat or corn meal, etc. \n\nSupermarkets had a kind of gentlemen's agreement not to compete on \"that kind\" of quality. Or rather, they had all internalized indifference to that stuff, as a kind of absolute law of customer preference. Customers cared about big, red, perfectly round tomatoes and apples, not about where they came from or how they were grown or that kind of stuff. Or so the thinking went. \n\nSo most people picked their supermarket based on price and convenience, since that was really the only differentiator. A handful of dedicated hippies and vegetarians might trek to specialty shops or ethnic markets, but for most of America, groceries were a commodity. \n\nApples were apples, cooking oil meant Wesson, Crisco, or Philio Bertoli pseudo-olive oil (or store brand equivalents). You either went to the supermarket that had the best price on Cheerios or chicken breasts, or you went to the one on your way home from work. \n\nWhole Foods bet against all that conventional wisdom, and bet correctly that:\n\n1. *at least some* consumers would pay more and/or drive further, to get \"boutique\" groceries, for lack of a better term, andd that;\n\n2. *enough* of those customers would be of a demographic that could and would support higher-margin prices across the board, to support a full-service supermarket with all the modern conveniences, versus just a little specialty shop with sprouts and soy milk. \n\nWhole Foods bet correctly, and all over America, \"regular\" supermarkets began losing their most-desirable, least price-conscious, biggest-spending customers to Whole Foods, even while stores like Target and Wal-Mart were competing for their penny-pinching base. \n\nNow, 10~15 years later, nearly every supermarket has a pretty well-stocked \"organic\" section, vegetarian options in the frozen food section, gluten-free choices, coconut oil, grass-fed beef options, etc. \n\nWhole Foods forced them all to compete on that front. Whole Foods still does it better, but at significantly higher prices, and it's no longer the kind of qualitative difference of kind that it was maybe 12 years ago. \n\nI hope they do well under Amazon ownership.
