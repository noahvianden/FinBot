I have a nice apartment with immaculate landscaping and a gym which is literally gold plated. I pay $5 a month for renters insurance and that's my only other expense other than my power bill (which is like $30/month). I don't need the expense of a nice car because I only drive it once a week if even that. I basically live at a resort where my every need is taken care of by the staff.

On Saturday they're having a massive bagel party where they're bringing in like every type of bagel known to man and it'll be free for the people that live here.\n\nI'm not sure what I would do with all of the space that comes with a 3-5br house. I have a 750 square foot apartment and that's already too big. All I need is a bed, desk, and microwave. Ideally I'm just out all day walking around or at the park and I'm not home that much anyway. And if I got a house my lifestyle would take a huge hit. There are no houses within walking distance of anything. Instead of going out for a walk every day I would just have to sit at home. I work from home and work sporadically during the day. I would literally be chained to home.\n\nSpeaking from a financial standpoint a house rarely makes sense as an investment.

It's cruel to put your kids out in some kind of suburbia with no sidewalks where the nearest store is a 20min drive away.\n\nI think that buying a house right now thinking that it's going to go up or even maintain its value is very wishful thinking. A lot of the suburbia we have is very very bad in terms of the lifestyle it affords people. At this point everything is a commodity.

So if I had $30k in student loans principal that has accumulated $20k in interest over the years, I might take out a $50k loan to pay off the entirety of my student loan balance. That $50k loan i just took out *is* dischargeable, and this is what could cause a bubble.\n\nAlso, it just makes it harder for other loans to be paid in general. The baby boomers could take out a loan on their house and have that be the only loan they make payments on until they retire. Most millennial don't have that option because they have to deal with their student loan payments (and many also have CC debt). The loans just pile up and b/c people know that student loans are dischargeable, they are more likely to defer payment on their other loans.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": ">  So if I had $30k in student loans principal that has accumulated $20k in interest over the years, I might take out a $50k loan to pay off the entirety of my student loan balance.
