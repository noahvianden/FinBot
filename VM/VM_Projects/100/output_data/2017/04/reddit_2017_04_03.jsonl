Vertical integration doesn't work in the long run. The competition will always beat you because you're never going to be the best at everything. It's why Windows won over OS/2 and Mac OS. It's why Android will (has already) won in mobile. Failure to give up vertical integration is also what killed a lot of companies like Nokia and Blackberry.\n\n> Tesla is building the infra to make cars cheaply and at scale, which will drive unheard of margins. \n\nThis is pure speculation and has no basis in fact. Their margins might be terrible. Why are you so sure Tesla can manufacture a car better than the competition that has been doing it for 50-100 years?\n\n> Massive automation, batteries at scale and unrivaled software.\n\nEvery car manufacturer uses massive automation in their factories and probably more efficiently than Tesla. Tesla's self driving technology is inferior to Waymo. Honda, FCA, and anyone else who uses their solution will be superior to Tesla in that regard.\n\n> Everyone else is building ugly golf carts or one-off machines they'll unable to build at scale.\n\nI find it more likely that car manufacturers just don't care *yet* about their EV designs. They know 1) the market isn't worth the expense yet and 2) the people that have been buying EVs care more about the cost/performance than the design. These companies are clearly capable of making some beautiful cars. If they haven't done it yet for EVs it's not because of lack of competence or capability. The cars just weren't designed to look good.\n\n> Good luck buying a car if there's no network you can go to while you're on a trip.\n\nWhat about if third party companies make their own network?
