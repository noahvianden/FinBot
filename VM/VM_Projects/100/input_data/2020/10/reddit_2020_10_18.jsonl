Tesla is prioritising other regions.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I posted the below comment elsewhere and thought I would copy into this thread as well:\n\nAs I see it Tesla announced an insane plan at battery day to get to 3TWh by 2030, that represents a HUGE increase that will take an exceptional effort to achieve. To be able to achieve their goal Tesla will need raw material supply, a high speed production process (announced at battery day with DBE process needing some kinks to be ironed out), a high number of competent workers and funding.\n\nOf these, most investors seem to focus on cost of scaling and Elon quite rightly highlights that funding isn‚Äôt the bottle neck. Securing work force takes time but is also actually fairly straight forward. However, with the average time to get a mine online being 5-7 years, securing enough material supply to make 3TWh in 2030 is order of magnitudes more difficult in my opinion. That represents an 8x increase in current world lithium supply.\n\nThe reason why the material processing announcements at battery day are so important is because Tesla needs the material supply chain industry to be able to achieve their goal. Tesla will not achieve this goal if the material supply chain does not ramp hard and fast with them - Tesla needs to drag them along with them. This means the lithium supply industry (as well as Nickel and Manganese) needs massive funding, and they need it right now. Remember it takes 5-7 years to get a mine online. \n\nTesla‚Äôs announcement at battery day regarding lithium and table salt sounded very simple on the surface but would represent a process that has been tried and tested in the past but has not been commercially adopted. I‚Äôve read about much scepticism within the lithium material supply world about this announcement because what Tesla announced sounded like a ‚Äòmagic solution‚Äô but ‚Äòindustry experts‚Äô are highly sceptical this will play out in reality. They view the announcement as not helping the lithium supply industry as it does not highlight the vital need for investment in the sector straight away, if Tesla are going to have enough materials to deliver on their stated 3TWh goal.\n\nI consider myself a massive Tesla bull, but Tesla‚Äôs share price will be contingent on their ability to grow and ramp up production over the next 10 years. As such I now view securing the battery material supply chain as the single biggest risk to my future share price predictions.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Its all the matrial.

They are still on the very foot of the S curve. Only question is: Do they survive or get eaten for breakfast? No one knows.\n\nIn terms of Nickel, I think its going to be a bigger problem than Lithium. Lithium is easier to get because it is wider spread in the world. There are a lot of staggered lithium deposits and if the incentives are high enough, mines will come online faster. Also, the lithium shortage is known since years, there are is a lot of investment already. Maybe not enough, I dont know.\n\nIn terms of Nickel.. that is eliviated by Lithium, Iron, Phosphate, LFP. I think that chemistry will dominate the personal car and power pack storage battery market. In trucks and sports cars, where weight is a big concern, Nickel chemistry will dominate.. we will see.\n\nAnode material: LFP chemistry will be dominated by graphite anode, Nickel will be pushed to use higher content of Silicon. Not sure how far that will get, but this will be the development if its at all commercially viable.\n\nWill Tesla own part of the base material supply? At this point, I think so, yes.

{"title": "Everything Is Priced In: Let's calculate how much growth Zoom and Tesla have priced in", "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Puts on ZM, TSLA\n\nYou probably have heard the phrase or even shit posted it yourself: \"It's priced in\". Usually, it's used to easily dismiss someone else's well-crafted DD, however today let's use it to actually do something useful with it. Let's find out, how much growth is priced in in the current price of Zoom and Tesla. As a comparison I also included Microsoft and P&G.\n\nNow follows the detailed description of how I calculated that. If you are only interested in the results, scroll to the bottom.\n\nHow would you even calculate something like that? I will do it with the so-called [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow). The intuition behind it is that by buying stock you essentially lose out on the returns the cash you used to buy the stock could yield somewhere else, like if you invested it in bonds or an S&P 500 ETF (or of course in FDs, whatever floats your boat). So, this model takes this into account by treating the cash you pay today (or more accurately, its current market cap) as a discounted cash flow of the future returns.\n\nTo be able to use this model, we need to make several assumptions. First, we need to decide on a time-frame in which we expected the company to completely earn its current valuation. I will use 10 years here as a very generous value.\n\nSecond, we need to decide what the cash flow actually will be. For this very simplified application of the DCF model I used the Net Income of the last quarter. I will call this N. In the end we want to have a growth rate as a result which tells us how much the quarterly earnings will need to increase every quarter to earn its entire valuation in the given time-frame. I will call this q.\n\nTo account for the equity a company already has, its current equity E must also be included in its future returns. Again, as a very generous estimation, I will assume that the equity will appreciate like the average returns of the S&P 500 in the last 10 years which is 16.3%.\n\nFinally we need the discounted cash value. This is the current market cap M of the company. We also need to decide on an interest rate to discount M. Again, very generously, instead of assuming that M should also be assumed to have the average S&P 500 returns, we will instead only use the much lower, essentially risk-free returns of the 10Y US bonds, which currently is 0.75%.\n\nTo summarize, we made the following assumptions:\n\n* Time frame of 10 years\n* Equity E appreciates by average S&P 500 returns of 16.3% every year\n* Cash flow is given by the net quarterly income N\n* Current market cap M is discounted by 10Y US bond yield, which is 0.75%\n\nNow, we can formulate the following equation that puts the expected growth of N into relation with the other variables:\n\n    E * 1.163^10 + N * (q^(4 * 10) - 1) / (q - 1) = M * 1.0075^10\n\n(Equity in 10 years plus quarterly earnings of the next 10 years that grow by q every quarter must equal discounted market cap )\n\nNow we only need to select a company and solve the equation for q. This can be done by using approximation methods like Newton's method, or just plug it into Wolfram Alpha.\n\nAs mentioned in the title, let's first start with Zoom and Tesla. All values are in Million USD:\n\n##Zoom:\n\n    E = 1198.81\n    N = 185.99\n    M = 160400\n\nThis gives us q = 1.12575 as a result. So, for Zoom, its current market cap has a yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 60.61% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*. Note that this already includes the Q2 earnings which were almost 7 times higher than Q1 earnings.\n\n##Tesla:\n\n    E = 9855\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n\nThis results in q = 1.17685. So, for Tesla, its current market cap has a even larger yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 91.82% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*.\n\n##Microsoft and P&G:\n\nFor comparison, let's also calculate this for less meme-y stocks. I chose Microsoft and P&G, let me know if you want to know the results for other stocks.\n\nMicrosoft:\n\n    E = 118304\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n    => q = 1.04679\n    => q^4 - 1 = 20.07%\n\nP&G:\n\n    E = 46521\n    N = 2800\n    M = 358600\n    => q = 1.02179\n    => q^4 - 1 = 9.01%\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a very simplified calculation which makes many assumptions: We only look at a companies net income of the last quarter, its current equity and its market cap, nothing else. Also, this looks at a rather large time-frame of 10 years, so is not that useful for short-term stock price predictions.\n\nTo summarize: By using the DCF model we can calculate that Zoom and Tesla have priced in into their current market cap outrageously high growth rates already for the next 10 years. Around 60% and 90%, respectively.\n\nPositions: [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/Rae9FzS.png), [TSLA](https://i.imgur.com/ybVcZ1M.png)", "id": "jdnvi6", "created_utc": 1603053691.0, "score": 603, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 317, "comments": [{"body": "There is no fuckin chance im reading this.\n\nTSLA 430C 10/30", "score": 1006, "replies": [{"body": "Autism wins again", "score": 264, "replies": [{"body": "My room is painted blue", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Don‚Äôt eat the paint chips", "score": 18, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Omg I can only cum so much", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I set up for it land around 420 on 10/30 because it‚Äôs basically a weed joke and Halloween and the world is a meme.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Is anyone going to tell him?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Not a chance.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "420 indeed", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "This is conservative.

A third example is a company with assets that aren't paying dividends yet - for example, a large but still unmonetized user-base, or a technology that hasn't been released yet.\n\nI don't know if any of this applies to Tesla, but *in general* it is not out of the question for a company to have a valuation completely out of line with earnings based solely on fundamentals.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't disagree, but efficiency improvements and cap restructures would need to achieve a 92% yoy compound growth rate over a decade.
