My husband and I fully believe in Tesla’s mission, and we see the existential threat of climate change. Outside of climate change, ICE vehicles exacerbate and contribute to new, onset cases of respiratory disease (I recently did a literature review on the topic for an MPH course), so our hype over EVs extend beyond just the climate change argument. \n\nWith that said, my husband and I have only recently begun to take active interest in our stocks and the stock market in general (we’ve had an asset manager do it all for us until recently). We are the first in the family to own an EV, with no indication that anyone else in the fam will move to an EV in the near future. My in-laws have shown lack luster support for Tesla, with past comments like “don’t own a Tesla if you live on a hill” and “Tesla stock is so overvalued”. \n\nWe’d like to be able to respond to comments like this with factual information about why the comments are misleading, or flat out wrong. I can hit them with scientific facts all day long about why EVs are better for health and the environment than ICEs.
