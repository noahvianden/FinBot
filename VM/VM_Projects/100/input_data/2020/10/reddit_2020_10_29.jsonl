{"title": "AAPL price drops 5% as it beats earnings", "selftext": "Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/29/apple-aapl-earnings-q4-2020.html#:~:text=Revenue%3A%20%2463.7%20billion,Other%20products%20revenue%3A%20%247.40%20billion\n\n\n\nApple reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations, but the company did not offer investors any guidance for the quarter ending in December. iPhone sales were down more than 16% year-over-year.\n\n* EPS: 73 cents vs 70 cents expected, according to Refinitiv estimates\n* Revenue: $64.7 billion vs $63.70 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates\n* iPhone revenue: $26.44 billion vs. $27.93 billion est.\n* Services revenue: $14.55 billion vs. $14.08 billion est.\n* Other Products revenue: $7.88 billion vs. $7.40 billion est.\n* Mac revenue: $9.0 billion vs. $7.93 billion est.\n* iPad revenue: $6.8 billion vs. $6.12 billion est.\n* Gross margin: 38.2% vs. 38.1% est.\n\n\n_____\nThe lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don’t get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. \n\n\nApple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.\n\n“If you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They’re climbing in the United States. And so there’s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there… we don’t believe that’s an environment to guide into,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Josh Lipton. \n\nApple hasn’t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nHowever, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that “initial data points are really quite good.”\n\niPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple’s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren’t counted in this quarter.\n\nRevenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. \n\nSales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.\n\n“A larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that’s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we’re confident we’ll grow in Q1,” Cook told CNBC.\n\nApple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. \n\nInvestors are always closely examining Apple’s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. \n\nOn Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported.

They sell electric busses all over the world, the got low end market covered, started to sell outside China in Norway as well.

BYD is also profitable and past that critical hurdle (although founded pretty heavily by the Chinese government if anyone takes issue with that, I just see it as too big to fail=win). \n\nReally I think only reason BYD is undervalued compared to TSLA, NIO is that they're only listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and aren't well known outside of China. \n\nI did say the same thing when I bought them in June (through tracker certificate).

At night, considering the interior camera is rgb, you'll probably still need to do the wheel torque thing, but even getting rid of it during the day would be great.

{"title": "Why the market is dumping tomorrow", "selftext": "Let me start by saying I’m usually a bull, but this dump is undeniable. Let me give you some reasons.\n\n1) Election next week, even more people are going to get out of the market on top of the usual Friday sell off to hedge against weekend uncertainty\n\n2) Big tech can beat earnings tonight and still flat line or drop. Look at all these companies this week that beat earnings and fell. There is bound to be big tech that does the same. For the unaware, big tech makes up top holdings in both the SPY and QQQ, so if big tech does bad, the market does bad.\n\n3) Corona virus uncertainty. Lockdowns are happening around the world and cases keep spiking\n\n4) Stimulus is officially dead. No more stimmy hype to keep the market alive. My guess is we’re moving into the vaccine hype phase.\n\nWhy are we up right now then?\n\nRetail boomers have bought the dip because Cramer said to if youre long. Investors are optimistic that big tech will rally because of their ERs. The investors who do not want to hold during the election have not sold off yet.\n\n\nTLDR: Election sell off, big tech tanking, corona uncertainty, and dead stimulus are all going to tank the market starting at 4:01 PM\n\nBan me if tomorrow isn’t red.\n\nEDIT: https://youtu.be/bbxjTzEbLmI\n\nUpdate 10am: SPY is die.
