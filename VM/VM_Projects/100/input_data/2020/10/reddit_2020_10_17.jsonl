{"title": "AT&T (NYSE: T) - An excellent opportunity for Dividend Investors, or those looking to start.", "selftext": " \n\nAT&T is a company that I'm sure doesn't need explaining. It is familiar to all of us as a telecom company that has branched out to providing internet, entertainment (HBO Max being one of their more recent ventures), and more.\n\n**Why this is being posted now & the potential:**\n\n* Q3 reporting is set for 22 October.\n* At its current price AT&T is in a position to provide significant growth prospects alongside a safe, high-paying dividend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at it current chart (16 October for reference) we can clearly see here that the stock is trading at its lowest levels since Q1. This provides a great opportunity to buy quality company at much higher yields to lock in superior long-term returns. It is unlikely they will drop much lower than this point due to the effect downward pressure has on dividend paying companies. If we look at the older charts, when AT&T has reached these lows the stock has a strong tendency to rally from this 27-28$ support area. Additionally AT&T has a lot going for it, let's quickly take a look.\n\n**What AT&T has going for it:**\n\n* It has increased its dividend payout for the last 36 years and has the means to continue to do so.\n* Consistent revenue growth.\n* Lots and lots of cash on hand.\n* They are a leader in the US for 5G.\n* They are working to replace old top management (This is particularly important).\n* Warner Media and HBO Max\n\nWarner Media and HBO Max may be points of controversy here. Let's look at it from this perspective. These get AT&T into new markets, HBO in particular into the saturated streaming market. Netflix has dominated this particular sector, however Disney and AT&T are cracking Netflix's business model by pulling back their streaming to their own platforms. This is the reason Netflix is creating so many of its own shows/movies and increasing it's subscription price. This pressure is allowing AT&T to slowly claw its way in. (Very slowly though, obv HBO Max is no Disney Plus). Additionally this will be the first full quarter of HBO Max on the books for AT&T, with 36 million new subscribers reported it is likely to have a positive effect on the report.\n\nThe safe dividend is a strong factor to remain bullish on AT&T. Even with the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&T's balance sheets show recurring profitability and consistent cash flow generation can easily cover the quarterly payouts.\n\n**Two big issues:**\n\n* A lot of long-term debt (At extremely low rates, so fortunately it doesn't impact their cash flow too much)\n* Terrible acquisitions over the last 10 years (Direct TV, which they are looking to sell)\n\nIt could be a good sign that AT&T is finally looking to sell the underperforming Direct TV. Sure they bought it for $67 Billion and would likely sell for $20 Billion but off loading legacy segments can allow them to focus on growth and expand into markets that are actually relevant for today and tomorrow while being less of a drag on their current debt.\n\n**Final Comments:**\n\nPlease extend this by doing your own research on top of everything else you have read here, there were many points only briefly touched on.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read!\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all that posted constructive comments! As several have pointed out, yes, AT&T has underperformed the S&P, it should be avoided if you aren't seeking out a high paying dividend stock.", "id": "jcmvep", "created_utc": 1602899961.0, "score": 604, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 230, "comments": [{"body": "KO gang, where you at???", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "Just buy SCHD.

However, DCF also takes into account a # of variables that are assumed and can lead to a value that is very different from the actual valuation. Thus, valuation by itself is worthless. That is the reason why people are willing to pay $550 to buy Zoom and $1000 to buy Shopify because they do not care about valuation. Rather, people care about a) total addressable market (TAM), and b) leadership acumen. If a company has a superb leadership team and super huge TAM, people are willing to pay any price because long term, the value of stock will only increase until a) another player comes in to compete or b) the TAM is saturated. In Shopify's case, there was no competition. Therefore, people were willing to pay any money for owning the stock of a company run by superb leadership and a huge TAM.\n\nAMD falls in that category as well. The market for AMD is huge and leadership is exemplary. The question then becomes, do investors see AMD outgrowing Intel and eating their market share? The answer is-yes! If investors saw value in Intel, it won't be sitting at $53. The other thing that matters to investors is this--do they think Bob Swan can underpromise and overdeliver? I guess time will tell but the gut feeling is that he is not a capable leader and a complete house sweep  is necessary to overhaul Intel.

When I used the term \"5G spectrum\" in my op though, what I really meant to say was mmWave spectrum, i.e. the 28GHz UWB stuff that is at the core of this handset upgrade. In this spectrum, you can use channels dozens or hundreds of MHz wide instead 5 or 10MHz like has typically beem associated with LTE. The wide channel bandwidth allows you to cram in a lot more data in the link, which is why these channels are uniquely well suited to high throughput applications such as content delivery and home broadband replacement. There is an incentive to move media users more into this frequency space as it's a slightly better UX, but more importantly leaves lower, narrower band, longer range frequencies free for LPWAN use. LPWAN technologies like Cat-M and NBIoT, which are 5GNR compatible, are ideal for sending small amounts of data with minimal power consumption, making it perfect for industrial IoT applications. Operating at lower frequencies allows you to maintain a link at lower transmit powers, as less energy is lost in the atmosphere, so they want to use this space for LPWAN as much as possible. But, this involves customers buying new hardware that supports these new bands to free up space.\n\nAlso, if you don't live in a major urban area, you aren't going to get any benefit from the new radio hardware in the phone for like two or three years minimum.

{"title": "Two Plays for the week", "selftext": "Hello Gamers here are two plays that I am looking at in the upcoming week  \n\n\n1st: WYNN. Wynn has been consolidating on and off of the .382 fib level after completing the 4th wave of a 5 wave sequence. It is now also having high pressure due to the red bubble on the Squeeze indicator, which essentially measures how tight it is consolidating. This could cause a move to, or beyond the .618 level @ 85. OCT 23 $85 calls are going for .06, and if they become in the money would be worth over 1.5. I will be buying some of these  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xq38fu5lcpt51.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=456736cd1f8802737054250cf011b3bdb01e50de\n\n2. PLAY. A similar setup to that of WYNN with strong pressure for a break to the upside. PLAY has been consolidating in a tight range, in the 4th wave of a mini 5 wave sequence, which is within a larger sequence. A break from this consolidation has a target at 20, where there will be resistance, and a FIB target of 23. Calls for PLAY could pay very well if the timing is correct. - Good luck  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvv9l886dpt51.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b0dbad3fe85a0ef643846bb85b22e5de604f9b4", "id": "jd0ywz", "created_utc": 1602961228.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "I see you drew a big green line going up on your first graph.
