GME won‚Äôt reach 9bn just because these two examples have such high multiples. The biggest question re GME and why it came to be so heavily shorted is about business continuity: whether their business model (retail of physical games, consoles and collectibles) will exist in 6/7 years. Will this console cycle generate enough cash flow to support the company? Will covid, ecommerce and virtual games significantly impact this cycle‚Äôs cf? Will the next console cycle still have physical games? I believe the shorts came to be so absorbed by this narrative that missed the significant changes that took place in the past 18 months: change in management, conversion of inventory to cash, closing of underperforming locations, the share buyback program and more recently the revenue sharing deal with MSFT. So they are in a very good position to show the market that they can pivot to an ecommerce focused strategy and decrease dependence on brick and mortar.
