I decided to do some performance analysis of these picks.\n\nIn 2012, a financial [article](https://moneymorning.com/2012/12/31/the-best-and-worst-stocks-of-2012/) wrote that these were the 5 \"Best\" stock picks of the year:\n\n**PulteGroup Inc (PHM)** \\- It's had some volatility but overall has grown by about 180% in 8 years\n\n**Sprint (S)** \\- Pulling data is hard but it appears that Sprint was pretty volatile but overall had a nice run, then a decline, until it was bought at 280% above its 2012 price\n\n**Whirlpool Corp (WHR)** \\- It had some volatile growth but is currently sitting at 99% growth from its 2012 price\n\n**Expedia (EXPE)** \\- It had a nice period of a lot of growth but COVID hit it hard. It's now sitting at 59% up from its 2012 price\n\n**Bank of America (BAC)** \\- It grew quite a bit for a while but it hasn't fully recovered from COVID yet. It's currently up 135% from its 2012 price\n\n**If you had invested $1k in the 5 \"Best\" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on about $2500, or over 150% growth.**\n\nNow let's see what the \"Worst\" stocks of 2012 were:\n\n**Radioshack (RSH)** \\- Sold in 2015 having lost effectively 100% of 2012 value\n\n**SUPERVALU Inc (SVU)** \\- Immediately experienced a 3 year 500% run-up, fell, then was sold in 2018 up 62% from 2012 value\n\n**Apollo Group (APOL)** \\- Sold in 2015 at 50% less than its 2012 value\n\n**Best Buy Inc (BBY)** \\- Almost immediately after the author hit send, this stock had an eight year run-up. It is now up 900% the value it was in 2012\n\n**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** \\- It took a few years but eventually had a run-up over 3400%. AMD, everyone. This was among the \"worst stocks of 2012.\n\n**If you had invested $1k in the 5 \"Worst\" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on over $9000, or over 800% growth.**\n\nIf you had taken all that many and just bought VOO in 2012, you'd be sitting at about **145% growth.**\n\nOf course, AMD is the real diamond here. Without it, this outcome would look different.\n\n**But even if we remove AMD, the other 4 \"worst\" stocks would have seen 140% growth.**\n\n**What does this all mean?**\n\nI think it means you shouldn't *necessarily* overlook \"bad\" stocks. Of course, do your due diligence. And definitely don't invest all your eggs there. But conversely, don't ignore picks just because someone tells you to.

Their behavior over the stimulus package, which is to basically stonewall it for months now, signals their planned strategy going forward as being fiscal obstructionists in the same way they were during Obama's presidency. They only react to criticism about that when the stock market starts to tank too badly.\n\nThe GOP senate has been writing off Donald Trump and have turned their backs on him and are bracing themselves for being an obstructive and no-saying obstacle to Joe Biden. This has been so obvious in their stonewalling of an essential relief package for months now. They have already started repositioning themselves as the Party of No, and, after all the wild tax cuts for rich people and giveaways to red state business stakeholders in the last 4 years, will be claiming they're 100% behind low spending and not running up the federal deficit.\n\nIf the GOP senate has already entered the mentality of the Party of No that will approve no stimulus and starve a Democratic president of the ability to move any legislation, approve supreme court judges and create any benefits during their presidency, in the same way that they obstructed Barak Obama for 6 years after taking the senate in 2010, we are looking at very hard times ahead as investors.\n\nIn other words, we can't expect growth, but a return to a starving economy and increasing inequality as the GOP plays the long game and intends to starve the country to shut down a democratic led White House. Read the article, because that's how they operate. While it's wildly successful politically at keeping high discontent levels vs. democrats in the WH since Bill Clinton's day, that strategy also implies we can expect little or no stimulus and all kinds of other growth-choking antics from the GOP senate. Unfortunately, with the current coronavirus economy problems, that kind of fiscal management will likely put is unto a long austerity-created pandemic recession that is oddly coupled with propping up investment assets from the fed and treasury firehosing money at investors and banks.\n\nThe stock market and economy is about to change significantly into something like Japan's lost decades dominated by zombie companies and possibly even actual decline. \n\nThe only way to expect the kind of generic growth your story relies upon, if something changes the path our government is on. The pandemic has exposed how incapable the US is of managing its business because it's become too gripped by paralyzing infighting between political parties and insiders. The GOP was only using Donald Trump as a head-fake into a pretense that they want to change how things are done, and they are moving ahead with plans to go forward without him, and they have stopped listening to him whether or not he wins the election.\n\nBecause we happen to be very dependent on fiscal leadership for economic recovery at this time, and have gotten to the point where central bank policy can't do any more, the only way this dynamic will change is if the GOP senate is trounced in the election and the Democrats win a majority. That will change the course our economy is on *whether or not Trump wins the election*, because the GOP senate is running things now and barely acknowledging him. \n\nThe real contest, for investors who want actual economic growth and not just wealth for the wealthy, and people and businesses whose survival depends on good fiscal leadership in the next 2 years, is whether or not the GOP maintains is grip on the senate after the election. \n\nLook at Warren Buffet's current portfolio.

Even when you do recycle them, it is incredibly energy intensive. Not to mention some of them are toxic.

Let's imagine we are generating 40% clean energy and the rest is fossil fuels (I don't know the actual number, but just an example) at the moment and it would be enough to charge all our EVs. That would mean an EV would be charged 40% renewably. Now let's say we adopt hydrogen instead of EVs, suddenly we need 2,5x the energy to charge these vehicles. The only way to scale up energy production immediately is by burning more fossil fuels, so 3/5th of the energy required to charge hydrogen will be done solely with fossil fuels, while 60% of the other 2/5th will be charged by fossil fuels. That means hydrogen would be fueled 84% by fossil fuels where EVs would be only at 60%.\n\nObviously the actual numbers would differ, but you can see how big a difference it would make and how much it would delay our transition to 100% renewable energy.\n\n> Also lets not pretend that EVs are 100% clean if we have 100% renewable energy. Batteries are made out of finite materials. Mining those materials devastates the environment. We are both going to exhaust natural materials while devastate the environment from mining the same way we do with coal.\n\nThis is simply not true. It is possible to mine battery materials sustainably and Tesla is pushing hard to get this done. On top of that, unlike with things like plastic, it's cheaper to recycle batteries than to mine for new ones, so in due time new batteries can largely be made from existing batteries as Tesla demonstrated at Battery Day. Long term EV batteries can have close to no impact on the environment.\n\n> Even in the 1920s electric cars were more efficient than gasoline cars. Again, a certain company had so much influence that it swayed the entire industry.\n\nThat's entirely besides the point. We didn't have an issue like climate change to solve at the time, so no matter how hard influential companies may push for hydrogen, if EVs are more effective at combating climate change, at least for the next few decades - which they are - people and governments will demand EVs.\n\n> The reason why you think you're right is predicated on biases.\n\nActually it's the reverse. Yes I'm following Tesla and have a few shares, but it's a result of me investigating EVs, HFC and renewable energy in general, not the other way around.\n\n> This means you have a vested interest in them succeeding so when Musk said he doesn't rate HFC, his supporters follow suit. Nothing wrong with that, just realize that it's a factor.\n\nAgain I would argue the reverse, as an investor I have a vested interest in finding out reasons why the company might not succeed to prevent myself from losing money. Also, I didn't know Musk disapproves of HFC, but I have been against it since I researched it back in July 2018 (which I know because it started with me watching a video about it on YouTube).\n\n> As for me, this is a long game. I realize that the world only has a finite resources. But water is everywhere and the waste produced by HFC is water. That's renewable.\n\nThis I do agree with, which is why I do think outside of some practical aspects (refuelling is annoying, given sufficient infrastructure it's much easier to just have a fully charged EV infront of your house every morning, and maintenance and performance of EVs are better/more comfortable) hydrogen is the most sustainable solution available. Perhaps we will transition to it by the time we can generate 100% of our energy sustainably and in an ideal world we would've started transitioning to it 50 years ago when we weren't at the point yet where we needed to stop CO2 emissions as fast as possible, and could've skipped over EVs entirely.\n\n> Once you toss a lithium ion battery or any other kind of batteries, that's that.\n\nIf you toss a lithium ion battery you're a fool. This doesn't happen in any real world situation.\n\n> Even when you do recycle them, it is incredibly energy intensive.\n\nThat's relative, it's still only a fraction of the energy required to charge the cars over their life cycle so it doesn't nearly come close to the added energy required for hydrogen cars. On top of that it's cheaper than mining for new batteries like I said, so it drives the cost of the cars down.\n\n> In Asia there's a push for HFC. There are plans for solar powered electrolysis plants which would make HFC carbon neutral.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is great if we can do it alongside moving towards EVs. It just shouldn't be done at the cost of moving to EVs, which is usually the case. That money probably would've been better spend promoting EVs.\n\n> P.S. I love Tesla but that doesn't mean their strategy is the only solution to our problems. The more tech the better.\n\nThis I wholeheartedly agree with and I do see a future for hydrogen alongside with or as a long-term replacement of EVs.

That being said execution risk is still on the high side especially if they try to put out a 25k car with model 3 quality so whether we go low estimates and do low risk or high estimates and high risk, well boil down to similar numbers. \n\nHaving been in the manufacturing and supplier side.

I'd be happy to write those calls myself. \n\nI'm not saying we can prove the result, but you could start by showing me how TSLA cannot capture a $5T market cap in 2030 based on autonomy, car market, energy market and other potential verticals like ships and aircraft drivetrains with the available 3.000 GWh. Again, I said that IF everything goes right Tesla CAN get a $5T market cap, I never said that is the expected value.

The market valuation is based on future cash flows, discounted for current value (or it should be). To achieve 5T in 2030 that would mean the future cash flows should equal about 5T in current value, averaged out let's say that means 10T in bottom line numbers in 2040. \n\nI'm sure we can justify 10T 20 years from now accounting for inflation, an energy market share boom, car revenue, robotaxis, etc, etc. But what we're not adding on here is that since we are looking so far out you need to add significant risk just extrinsic, not even including intrinsic risk of capabilities. \n\nRealistically taking risk into consideration the 2030 profit would have to be closer to 20-30T. \n\nNo one is saying it's not possible but this is an investors forum.

It needs to beat the market considering things such as risk, outside competition, governance, and value. \n\nI hold a bunch of 2021-2022 calls for the off chance fsd happens.

They do need to achieve their target numbers, which adds risk but all I said was that if they do execute on that they can achieve that market cap. I would never buy stock today assuming it WILL be $5T in 2030. For example I would want 10% year over year on my investment plus maybe a 50% uncertainty that they will get there.

Intel processors have a design goal of a FIT under 200 at 55°C. So that would be 570 years of running at 55°C before a processor fails. \n\nComparing that FIT rates of fatalities by [type of transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#Transport_comparisons), \n\nBus, 11.1 FIT\n\nRail, 30 FIT\n\nCar, 130 FIT\n\nFoot, 220 FIT\n\nAir 30.8 FIT\n\nCycling, 550 FIT\n\nParagliding, 8850 FIT\n\nSpace Shuttle, 70000 FIT\n\nOk, so what does this mean for actual number of deaths from FSD? There's around 700,000 Tesla vehicles with HW2/3 that should be capable of autonomy. Say they were to just switch it on and it had really good FIT rate of 10, each car would be running taxi stuff 8 hours per day. \n\nThat should be an expected [20 fatal crashes per year](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+year*700%2C000+*+%288+hours%2F24+hours%29+*+10%2F%281+billion+hours%29)\n\nIf you look at historically, there was 1 Tesla Level 2 fatality in 2019, 2 deaths in 2018, 2 in 2016. I don't think Tesla was found at flaw in any of these because the driver could be blamed for not paying attention. \n\nSince the car isn't autonomous yet if you bring it down to like 2 hours of daily use on average, and estimate a FIT rate then you get like 2 FIT to match 1 fatality per year today. Even if you stick with that rate and extrapolate it up to full +60 million cars on the road driving 8 hours per day autonomously it ends up being 350 deaths per year from FSD. \n\nReally if deaths happen every day that would probably be easier to just normalize than a random news article popping up every month about how a autonomous Tesla ran over some child crossing the street. It's probably going to be a nightmare to navigate the PR, that's why Tesla is doing it carefully. \n\nBeing 3x safer than air travel, 13x safer than cars is also a ridiculously high bar to meet.
