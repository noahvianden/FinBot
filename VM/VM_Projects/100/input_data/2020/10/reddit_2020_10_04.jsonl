Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.\n\nMake no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, \"Who killed the electric car?\" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).\n\nNow, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "j50qqy", "created_utc": 1601825314.0, "score": 655, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 175, "replies": [{"body": ">because they have to so they can look like they care,\n\nI doubt that.

My Tesla can take me clear across the country if I wanted to.  \"Range\" is not an issue.  Are you talking about on a single charge?  That's not really as important as you think.  Range on a full charge or full tank of gas is somewhat arbitrary after a certain point (usually defined by the size of the passenger's bladder).\n\nThe important metric is total trip time, or if you prefer, refueling overhead (if any), and this will vary from person to person based on their driving style and endurance.  And I will make the argument that for many people (although not all), even a 300 mile Tesla imparts no additional total travel time than a gas vehicle.  My in-laws live 800 miles away and we do the return trip in one day.  It's 12.5 hours of active driving.  With stops, it usually takes us 14 to 15 hours altogether (whether gas or electric).  What we've found is that since getting a Tesla, our total trip time has FALLEN!  (part of this may be pandemic-related) and the car itself only needed 58 minutes of charging time altogether on our last trip.  So for us, there is zero impact to the fact that our Tesla has a \"range\" of 100 miles less than a typical gas car.  I'm sure there are those that will insist that they ever ONLY stop for 5 minutes at a time every 5-6 hours while on a road trip.  Fine...for them they can ignore all the other benefits of an EV year-round and save themselves 30-45 minutes on an all day road trip once or twice a year.  But the first thing we need to do is stop focusing strictly on the \"range\" and look at \"trip time\" as the key metric.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "800 miles is 1287.48 km", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No, actually I am not, any more than you are.  What I **am** saying, is that rather than focusing just on pure range, the more important metric is should be impact to travel time (or just total travel time).  Range alone is meaningless if you have to stop more frequently than your car needs to anyway.  For those that can travel longer distances between stops and take shorter stops when they do, ultimately it's the total impact to travel time that's important, not the actual range.  If you hypothetically had an EV that could charge in 2 minutes (or maybe do a battery swap) but the range was only 250 miles, it's still going to take the same amount of time to get from NY to LA as it would in a gas car that had 500 mile of range by took 4 minutes to fill up, or an EV that had a 500 mile range and took 4 minutes to charge.\n\nYes, it's a fair criticism of EVs to say that recharge times are longer (certainly there is no such thing as a 2 minute recharge!) and that is more the reason why they may not work for everyone today.  But it's not the range itself.\n\nThe **one** case where range is important is a trip just barely outside the range of a typical EV, but within the range of a gas car.  But these tend to be highly contrived scenarios, and not only that, because of the fact that most EV trips start out with the battery at 100% and gas cars start out a trip with less than a full tank, the EV sometimes even has an advantage.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, infrastructure is just another element to the ultimate metric, which again, ends up being total travel time.

Even if all else was equal, you're adding more time for the charging station.\n\n(as for the difficulty in looking for a charging station--that's practically trivial with apps, or even EVs built-in nav systems that will route you directly there)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Again, I am not trying to argue that EVs are perfect or better or even equivalent to gas cars for all people.  It seems like you are interpreting my statements as saying that.  \n\nI am simply trying to say that the only thing that really matters at the end of the day is how long it took to get from point A to point B.  Range of the vehicle, convenience of the refueling/recharging stops, length of the refueling/recharging stops, etc...none of that really matters any more than the bottom line, which is how long did it take to complete the trip, including ALL stops that someone may make.\n\nI openly acknowledge that there are travelers out there for whom an EV is going to be an inferior mode of transport.  I don't pretend that available charging stations are plentiful, convenient, or that charging times are sufficiently short for everyone, or that the range of EVs is up to par with how far you can drive on a tank of gas.\n\nWhat I AM saying is that none of that matters one iota if your personal travel pattern means you are going to be stopping every 3 hours anyway and the length of your stop to pee, check your phone, and grab a bite to eat allows you to get sufficient charge to make it to your next stop, thus making your total trip time the same as it would be in a gas car.  If your personal travel pattern means that you end up having to stop more frequently than you would have otherwise, and/or for longer amounts of time, then the combination of range, recharge speed, and convenience of charging stations DOES matter.

And as someone who is pretty neutrally biased in the automation space, I don't agree with some of their comments, and some of the scoring systems.\n\n>Tesla’s system name Autopilot is inappropriate as it suggests full automation. The promotional material suggests automation where\nthe handbook correctly indicates the limitations of the system capabilities, which could lead to confusion\n\nAgreed, its a tainted name at this point and Tesla really, desperately needs to stop advertising it as such.\n\n>Status information is clear, but the Model 3 does not offer a head-up display showing the system status in the driver’s direct line of sight. \n\nI don't agree with this sentiment, a car's driver assistance suite should not be judged on a premium feature that most cars don't even have. Don't get me wrong, I love my HUD in my 440i, but I wouldn't expect it offered in a non-premium car. And even on premium cars it is sometimes a seperate option from the driver assistance suite.\n\n>Vehicle response to variable Speed limits No response\n\nVariable speed limits are a fairly new thing, and aren't even a thing in the US. So I get why this is a testing parameter for NCAP and why Tesla basically did nothing. Seems fair.\n\n\n\nNow breaking down the scoring:\n\n>Assistance Competence: 36%\n\n* DRIVER ENGAGEMENT 36.5 / 100 PTS \n* VEHICLE ASSISTANCE 91.7 / 100 PTS\n\n\n>Safety Backup: 95%\n\n* SYSTEM FAILURE 25.0 / 25 Pt\n* UNRESPONSIVE DRIVER INTERVENTION 20.0 / 25 Pts\n* COLLISION AVOIDANCE 50.0 / 50 Pts\n\n\nSo why did Tesla score so low in Driver Engagement? They took points off for inaccurate marketing material promoting autopilot as an automated solution vs the handbook stressing attentiveness is needed with the system. I think this is ridiculous, we're including a promotional material criteria in a Driver Engagement scoring? Cars should be score based on their systems abilities, not whether or not the car makers marketing arm is making bold claims. At the very least it shouldn't be a scoring criteria in the test, that just seems stupid and misleading to some of these cars systems. \n\nSystem Status had points taken off for not having a HUD, something most non-luxury cars don't even have an option for. Driver monitoring had points taken off for not having the camera be used in the car for tracking the drivers attentiveness, something every single car scored a 10/25 on because no car actually has this in place right now, I think maybe a few cars have eye tracking. Cadillac maybe?\n\nGiving a 0 for driving collaboration because the system turns off when you turn the wheel to avoid an obstacle seems counter-intuitive to scoring a driver assistance system. On Teslas part, the system shouldn't deactivate completely if you need to avoid an obstacle. But I'm also curious to see if the car would avoid it itself, I understand they have to follow the tests parameters, but shouldn't we have an obstacle avoidance test where the driver is hands off? Everybody using these systems are going to be less attentive to the road regardless because the system is handling some of the driving work for them, so if the driver isn't attentive and an obstacle appears on the road, I'd want to know if my car would slam the brakes or simply steer around it. They should really add that as a follow up test to the current obstacle test.\n\nIn fact, Tesla actually scored the highest out of everyone on the actual driver assistance tests.

In its standard form - as much as I dislike bureaucrats and stupid people -, and one Tesla operates though progressive mistakes to achieve by taking an idea and wanting to run with it, it cannot ‘solve any problem’ or ‘shame stupid people’ since you’re positing working from an axiomatic position is key; a position that can be as simple as ‘gravity exists so we can make flying cars.’ \n\nSince without gravity they would by fly. Which means they wouldn’t fall. Which means that they could not not fall - ergo, fly. \n\nIt is a prettt basic, organic approach most people have. I wouldn’t treat it as if it were an infallible cure-all. \n\n>\tinstead of the designing from History, ppl like Musk who actually read and think design from the Future...\n\nTo skip past the (trite) technicalities of ‘reading’ from the future, I’d agree to you with some caveats; Musk is changing the design - just not as much as you think. \n\nIt’s the disregard of the past which bothers me. \n\nLike brake designs that have been around for centuries - which are being employed in Tesla’s much like f150s. Since there is an additive, evolutionary aspect. To say nothing of the required knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, and physics that are well, well before his time. He didn’t invent it - only optimized the knowledge for his design’s intended purpose. \n\nSimilar statements can be applied to the Falcon rockets and the batteries - they utilize atypical design elements by piggy-backing on historic discoveries and optimizing it. I’m impressed with his achievements and I respect it immensely, but deifying Musk isn’t healthy. \n\n>\tread sci fi, study first principles in physics finance and software, imagine what should be done, and do it. Enjoy life, be on a mission, find out whatever you need to know, if you are truly intellectually honest the future is unlimited.\n\nFirst principles, again, are basic: they denote only things that are axiomatic truths. A first principle in finance, for example, would be Supply and Demand - which Tesla repeated failed by failing to keep up with pre-orders before inducing Supply constraints and cede the market to other players. \n\nAnother is the profit/lose mechanism of confirming the market viability of offerings to the world at large; one they’ve just barely crossed the threshold of black ink. And given its decade of debt and equity-offering financed projects, you have to take into account another first principle:\n\nThe accumulation of debt and equity obligations restricts the management’s freedom as they have to satisfy multiple disparate needs and/or wants. Where the former, where it doesn’t have a nominal, realized return on investment, will burden the company and further restrict its abilities; the latter opens a company up to market volatility which perpetuates issues with a company’s board, shareholders, and *shivers* the stakeholders that are involving themselves in NA capital markets. \n\nAlso the future is finite. \n\nWe die and eventual heat death and all that. \n\nWith finite resources. \n\nWhere you can claim a *virtually* infinite cache of resources by virtue of our present needs, but not infinite. \n\n>\tThe value of Tesla is not yet understood by investors .... \n\nThe fact that Tesla has survived for so long as they were constantly at a loss proved investors understood its value. Any NPV valuation calculation would have forced people to have to be paid - paid - to take hold of a share. \n\nAdding to that, the (long-unseen) P/E ratio is at a 1000. A thousand. So 70x ‘better’ than a ‘standard company’? So 30x better than Microsoft, pound-for-pound? \n\nNB: I don’t mind Tesla. As a EV (and other) movement and as market competition. It’s good for the consumer. But as a company, it suffers from secondary issues that aren’t covered by the first principle argument - namely, page 15 in an ECON 101 textbook where the nature of humankind promulgates the same kind of issues as seen in the South Sea Company and Tulips and a dozen other case studies - which can be argued to be more axiomatic than specific subsets of fields of study that attempt to explain our systems of organization and discovery that are invariably coloured by our natures.\n\nWhere Tesla has merit now because it survived long enough to create a solid product that it had, by all rights, no justified opportunity before with the capital it accumulated. \n\nPS: This is brought to you by one who understands the 21st century ‘first principle’ in Finance - never short Tesla. \n\nPPS: My opinions over Tesla Bulls do not necessarily reflect my outlook on the company itself since I believe it crossed a necessary threshold. (Whereby, the same threshold does not apply for the Bulls even if human nature produces self-fulfilling prophecies when enough stand together, be it in adherence or defiance to ‘first principles’ of a field of study.)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I disagree.

As awesome as their team has proven over the years, there’s no way they could meet the market’s expectations anytime this decade.\n\n[NIO](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nio%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=nio%20stock&sc=7-9&sk=&cvid=BA8D2A8B783F46319BE31B9956890EC8) is a Chinese electric car company. Note Chinese consumers are mostly poor and overwhelmingly prefer small personal transportation like scooters, motorbikes, ebikes. They have been losing money but that doesn’t stop their price from rising over 1,200% in the past year.\n\n[Nikola](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nikola+stock&qs=LS&pq=nikola+stock&sc=6-12&cvid=DC098EE074A6496FACCDC7B02BFDCE2E&FORM=QBRE&sp=1) is trading below its IPO price being more and more revealed as a scam. They claim to have designed their own working truck, but all they have is CGI mockups and a faked video where they rolled the truck down the hill. Engineers have debunked a lot of the claims their founder Trevor Milton made, but in short he claims his stuff does literally double of everything Tesla does in spite having no product or design team or history of the long process of creating that. Plus Trevor Milton resigned in the face of lawsuits and investigations pending. And in spite Nikola itself saying they were “highly dependent on their founder” Trevor Milton, they are still on Robinhood’s **100 Most Popular list!**\n\n[Arcimoto](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Arcimoto%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=arcimoto%20stock&sc=6-14&sk=&cvid=8AB657D7B3D54A39BCE0C00777388A79) is a small company with 95 employees that makes small electric utility vehicles. They’ve only been selling cars for a year, they’re losing money, but they still have a market cap of 195 million.\n\n[Aryo](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ayro%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=ayro%20stock&sc=6-10&sk=&cvid=C1CACD62DB384890B47989F02C5D2698) is an engineering sub-contractor specializing in EV. They have six employees, a revenue of zero the last two years, and a market cap of 68 million.\n\nThe trend extends to related industries, with nickel and lithium stocks rising alongside anticipation of contracts from EV companies (with disappointingly meager results). And consider that as large a market cap these companies have, they also compete with older motor companies that are making their own EV and hybrid vehicles. On the wind and solar side, they have seen similar growth over the same time period, which is even more telling.\n\n[SolarEdge](https://www.bing.com/search?q=SolarEdge%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=solaredge%20stock&sc=7-15&sk=&cvid=881BEB5EA020452D8737355C25F7693B), an Israeli innovation company, has risen over 200% in the last year and has a PE of 74.\n\n[Vivent Solar](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vivent%20Solar%20%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=vivent%20solar%20stock&sc=6-18&sk=&cvid=EF6DB7BE434F4EFB9F3542386CA62018) has risen over 550% in a year, have under three thousand employees, are going into big debt with their investment, and have a market cap of 5.29 billion.\n\n[Vestas Wind Systems](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vestas%20Wind%20Systems%20%20stock&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=vestas%20wind%20systems%20stock&sc=7-25&sk=&cvid=D635DB0D4724467F9663C497DBAFF96B) has risen by 118% over the last year, has a PE of 57, a market cap of 32 billion, and only 25,541 employees.\n\nNote these are *utilities companies*, that have years long installation and maintenance contracts with cities who go into decades of debt to install these services. To show how slow the industry moves, my hometown still has a working coal power plant that was built in the late 1920’s. Sure there’s new windfarms being built, but this stuff was built to last and it costs a fraction as much to overhaul old stuff than buy new. Ergo the old stuff goes offline slowly, and new investments are made.\n\nThis means the rise of the wind and solar industry is **solely due to** **investor sentiment**, not the growth of the industry itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen science itself comes in.\n\nIn strictly performance and economic terms, gas is fundamentally better than renewables. [The main issue](https://youtu.be/Hatav_Rdnno) comes down to energy storage: A gallon of gas contains 13 times more energy by volume than the best lithium ion batteries Tesla has to offer. That same gas has 50 times more energy by weight than lithium ion batteries. Plus, gasoline just goes into a tank and sits there, while batteries are broken into many cells with connective wires and packaging that aren’t space or weight efficient. Tackling this problem has been Tesla’s greatest hurdle, as they’ve had issue with [new batteries randomly exploding.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a28687473/tesla-model-3-explosion/)\n\nOn top of that, electric motors offer a lot less horsepower for a given weight than a gas motor, along with a much lower top speed. Electric motors do offer instant torque, less maintenance requirements, and don’t need to idle, but that means little to the average consumer. Altogether with current tech an EV user would be limited in the range, weight, and speed he can move things. Where I live I don’t even have the garage to charge an EV in nor are there charging stations anywhere within 80 miles, and many people live likewise.\n\nThis is also why you don’t see many electric airplanes. The range, speed, and payload are extremely limited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, you say “But the science is moving forward, and we’re investing it that.” Two problems:\n\nGas motor tech is also advancing as companies find ways to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Of course they are, because not only is it a very good thing to do… It is a very Profitable thing to do. And why are we complaining when they raise efficiency on the type of vehicle that +95% of people drive?\n\nNext problem is that scientific progress is measured in decades and generations, not months and years. For instance, [projections](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/weve-long-waited-for-fusion-this-reactor-may-finally-deliver-it-fast/ar-BB19A6Xq) have put us 20 years away from fusion power… ever since the 1960’s. Much progress has been made, like using giant magnets to force atoms together or complex math to compensate for instability issues, but they still only making marginal improvements when the problem is no one can make self-sustaining fusion. Fusion requires isotopes of hydrogen, the lightest gas in existence. Fusion requires ludicrously high temperatures and/or pressures to work. Fusion creates a nuclear flash. None of the above cooperate with each other at all.\n\nIn the case of solar panels, each decade has seen measurable improvement, but the base issues that were there over a century ago when it was just a laboratory novelty still exist. Namely, finite energy from sunlight even if they were 100% efficient (they aren’t), and the fact each panel is a significant investment. Current research revolves around solving [mystery wear and tear](https://phys.org/news/2019-06-solar-cell-defect-mystery-decades.html) that makes panels lose productivity and also making the panels self-cooling so they don’t lose efficiency at high temperatures. But still, the up-front costs are debilitating by any measure.\n\nSo not only has the market priced in a revolution in the car industry, it has priced in major revolutionary advances in science that can’t happen anytime soon. I can’t predict the future, maybe in 50 years new energy storage devises will hit the market using a currently unknown caveat of quantum physics.\n\nBut current scientific research reflects what will hit the market in 10-30 years. I mean it, even in military projects it takes that long for something to go from a concept to a weapon. Case in point, according to Ben Rich from Lockheed’s Skunk Works, the experimental concepts of radar absorbing paint and a radar resistant shape of aircraft were known back in the 1960’s. His book detailed some of the immense list of tricky technical issues involved in making an actual stealth plane, however.\n\nWhat generates this bubble? Look at 5 year charts of these stocks and you’ll see the pattern. The started going up last winter, dipped with the Coronavirus crash, and then immediately soared. I ask Why?\n\n1. [Essentials.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/focus-on-essential-companies-that-can-get-through-to-the-other-side-jim-cramer-says.html) Institutional investors are looking for high growth stocks safe from Covid induced bankruptcy.\n\n2. [Autists.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/08/17/robinhood-valuation-soars-to-112-billion-with-new-funding-and-record-growth/#282f7699663d) Discount brokers, from Webull to TastyTrade to ThinkorSwim to Interactive Brokers, all have grown a lot, especially in the last year with quarantined and bored people looking for a way to make some money. Even r/wallstreetbets have seen their membership rise significantly over this period. Nothing wrong with that, but what do all these inexperienced investors consider good growth positions in ethical industries? That’s right, tech stocks and renewables, and the average number of stocks held is two per account. In some circles I follow, I’ve had to explain that day to day changes in the market price does not always reflect the business itself. And I’ve literally seen this question: “Which should I invest in, Tesla or Apple?” (FACEPALM)\n\n3. [Hedge Funds.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-darlings-vs-tesla-204030211.html) These guys seek out high risk high reward schemes, and it is known that several capitalized in Tesla’s meteoric rise and were among the first to bug out. While it varies wildly how these guys make money, the high volumes surrounding the “meme stocks” would present them with many opportunities.\n\n4. [Venture capitalists.](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-is-a-billionaire-who-doesnt-care-about-money-2020-5) Rich people are no different, and several corporate heads in renewables said they were more concerned about science than making money. Nothing wrong with that, but you see where the market has gone with this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut not all hope is lost for those of you who want to invest in renewables; Nuclear energy is seriously undervalued! Again, this is due to public perception effecting investments, and not the science itself. Progress continued to be made in the science even after Chernobyl caused the total halt of reactor construction, and now as old reactors start going offline and new reactors are cheaper, safer, and come in conveniently smaller packages they look more tempting than ever.\n\nNamely, Microsoft and General Electric are partnering to make [NuScale](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200828005299/en/NuScale-Power-History-Small-Modular-Reactor-Receive), a small modular nuclear reactor that can be produced in bulk, shipped as one piece on a semi, installed into bunkers with a crane, and integrated with as many other reactors as you want. The streamlined process brings costs down, and the small size allows for small remote installations to cut their overhead power costs to near zero. So far, only the Pentagon is buying, but it is also just passed a rigorous certification process last week.\n\nAlso, [thorium nuclear reactors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/could-thorium-revive-the-nuclear-energy-industry-1029624977) are becoming a thing. These are a lot less energy efficient, but physically can’t break down in a lot of the ways uranium plants have historically (I.E. coolant leaks). Technical hurdles remain, but this has been in the works since the 1980’s and only slowly has it been getting attention.\n\nAnd yes, nuclear is definitely a great option. From the perspective of energy density, kw per dollar, initial installation costs, and manning costs nukes lead all others by a ridiculously large margin. In fact, one of the biggest costs are actually the extreme safety and security requirements. And used parts have to be disposed of in lead containers and buried deep in a remote desert.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my autist opinion, I give an emphatic sell recommendation to the whole renewable industry.\n\nDo I recommend dropping everything and going into nuclear? No, I’m saying the damage is done with this human error. Someone has already bought at the top, and when the selling starts someone will lose money. This doesn’t mean renewables are doomed, either.

An electric motor is roughly 3 times as efficient as a gas engine, from power produced to wheels.\n\nThis is why the technological challenge in surpassing gas cars becomes quite obvious, it's down to battery improvement. If you do not believe the batteries will improve or become cheaper, then yes, EV's might have a problem in technically surpassing combustion engine cars, but that is not what the trend show us so far. There are so many battery innovations and so many resources trown into this that it's just hard to imagine that the trend of falling and improving batteries will come to a halt.

But that’s a flash-in-the-pan statement, because literally any machine we’ve built to use gasoline as fuel can’t top 30% efficiency, and that’s REALLY good for an engine. Your gas car, on a hot summer day, probably sits around 25% efficiency, while in the cold probably has a measly 15% efficiency. Meanwhile, lithium batteries have a 90% energy conversion efficiency, and their charge is constant until close to 0% state of charge (SoC). The first point is trivial, because an L-ion battery only needs about a third of the energy density as gasoline to perform as well as a fuel. That second point is why L-Ion batteries have seen such a meteoric rise - their SoC capabilities and stability are unmatched compared to any other battery tech we have seen. The only problem, as you mentioned, is thermal runaway, which can easily be controlled through a battery management system. These systems measure the voltage, current, temperature, and SoC of every individual cell, regulates their output, and shuts them off if anything seems remotely off. Many companies, including TSLA, have BMS tech out there, which brings me to my next point:\n\n- TSLA is far more than an automotive manufacturing company. The reason why they’re such a threat is because they pour resources into RnD like none other. This is one of the main reasons TSLA went negative for like 8 years straight. They literally mine, forge, cold-roll, and manufacture their own steel, and insert an additive that gives it more tensile strength while reducing weight. That is something that automakers cannot figure out, mostly because they buy their sheet metal and other raw materials from other companies. TSLA also creates their own battery tech, BMS, and patented their own in-line thermal fuses. That third point doesn’t sound like a lot, but from an engineering standpoint is incredible difficult; the in-line fuses they created are copper wires thin enough that if the current exceeds that of the maximum power their LI batteries can output (I.e. short-circuit or thermal runaway), the copper wire heats up and melts, breaking the connection to the rest of the batteries. The level of manufacturing precision to make those fuses reliable to the sixth Sigma is incredible in itself. Their batteries have some of the highest energy densities of batteries out there. The software they’ve written is high above any other automotive software. They might be hyped up, but I don’t believe they’re overvalued given the advances in material science they’ve contributed. And, TSLA is part way solving the energy storage crisis that you y’all about for renewables, which brings me to my next point:\n\n- solar panels. You claim they’re too expensive to become profitable, and that they have problems with maintaining their efficiency. While it may be partly true, I’ve run many models of residential and commercial solar panel systems, and with a standard 8-10% efficiency, most systems become profitable within a decade. While that may seem like a load of shit to residential customers, commercial customers should be all over it. No, there hasn’t been a breakthrough in solar efficiency in a while, but you have missed several breakthroughs in manufacturability. The cost-per-watt model is commonly used to grade a solar panel’s practicality, and standard silicone solar panels have decreased their $/W by 90% since they first hit the market. And their shelf life is about 30 years, with solar efficiency staying relatively constant through that period. So 10 years to become profitable, 30 years until I have to get new ones, and for a commercial investor it really isn’t that expensive to convert....seems like a profit to me. Of course, there’s areas where solar won’t work, but why would we be talking about those places in the first place? The final problem is energy storage, which I’ve said is being solved as we speak, and really already isn’t a problem if designed correctly. \n\nTL;DR, not in a bubble, tech is there, OP needs to read a few ScienceDirect articles. \n\nSource: BSME with focus in renewable and sustainable energy, and built my own high-speed electric motorcycle", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh man lol.

Completely ignoring the fact that AMD's 2 direct competitors are like >2X and >3X the market cap and now have products that AMD either straight up beat or directly compete with. They look at trailing market shares in laptops, datacentre, GPU when AMD's products were inferior while ignoring the fact that AMD's products are now good enough that they can sell as many chips as TSMC give them. TSMC capacity is literally AMD's only constraint on how much product they can sell for the next year+ and fortunately AMD have an absolute tonne of N7P wafers this year and N5 wafers lined up in 2021.\n\nAll the talk has been about consoles, yet in terms of profit per wafer they are probably the worst product AMD are producing right now, I'm sure Zen3 will make them waaay more per wafer.\n\nZen 3 - 8th\n\nThe tech community have known for a long time that Zen 3 IPC and clock uplifts will take the single-thread crown from Intel, however the price only started to move with the recent leaks that add weight to these rumours. However everyone's news feeds on Oct 9th are going to be full of articles and youtube videos like \"AMD finally beat Intel in gaming\" \"AMD CPUs better at every price point\" \"AMD to dominate desktop, mobile and sever into 2021\" and there is no way the price isn't jumping when that happens.\n\nRDNA 2 - 28th\n\nAgain anyone following it knows that RDNA 2 is going to be competitive with the 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance, but I don't think this is sufficiently priced in - I think the market expects better performance/$ and performance/watt and maybe competition at the low-mid tier (which is AMD's normal spot) but I don't think they appreciate AMD will offer 4K-viable cards. I think people aren't appreciating the fact AMD will have decent supply and decent driver support this time around so this will be followed with headlines like \"6900 is about the same as a 3080 and you can actually buy one now!\" \"6900 gives similar performance but doesn't require a nuclear power station to run\" \"Don't bother waiting for a 3070, spend $100 extra and get 15% better performance with a 6900\" etc..\n\nThese events (+the leaks that come before them and the commentary that follows them) are going to dominate the price action this month and I don't see how TA helps with that.
