The company is worth a lot more if you can comprehend what they talked about on battery day, but most people are simply in denial.

Tesla has offered a pretty clear roadmap that should have them to 100 gWh by that time. GM's cells made with LG Chem will maybe cost under $100 per kWh, yet the 4680 cells, will cost Tesla $50-$75 (eventually will go down closer to $50) per kWh. The 4680 cells can also be scaled up to mass production easier and cheaper. The 4680 cells will run cooler than pouch cells. The 4680 cells will form the mid structure of the car, whereas the pouch cells GM will be using will not. The weight savings, the performance benefits, the cost savings, and the manufacturing efficiencies Tesla will benefit from as compared to GM are huge. Also, that Tesla will be casting the front and back as single pieces puts them way ahead of anyone else (you need to design the part, you need the casting machines, and you need an aluminum alloy that Tesla invented to be able to do this... unless you have been working on this in secret, there is no way you start now and have this ready for mass production in a year or two).\n\nIf people have not figured it out already that Tesla is way ahead (without discussing FSD or their grid/home energy storage projects), they will not figure it out until at least a year from now (maybe even 2 or 3) when the benefits of what Tesla is doing start becoming apparent in actual production and profits.\n\nSo rather then seeing the price shoot up to $800-$1,000 a share now and then doubling over the next 3-5 years, I would not be surprised to see the stock stay flat ($300 - $600 range) for 2 years and then suddenly shoot up to $2,000.

This car will be priced 10-25% higher than a comparable Tesla, thereby softening demand and leading to further market share loss.\n\nOption 2; subsidizes vehicles to gain market share from Tesla. This will increase losses with limited margin cushion.

Everyone just says \"Who do you believe?\" lol.  Honestly, if you had said \"Whom do you believe?\", I would have had the same reaction, because it doesn't sound right since I never hear it that way.  I would have been wrong though.\n\nA good trick:  Try replacing who/whom with he/him or she/her and seeing if it makes sense, since usually her/him are used in the same grammatical cases that whom is.  \"He also suffered a stroke last year\" vs \"Him also suffered a stroke last year\". The first one makes more sense, so we should use \"who\".  This also reveals that \"who\" functions as the subject of this clause, which is why \"he\" sounds better than \"him\" (him is always used as the object of something, like a verb or preposition).  With the example before, you kinda have to juggle the word order to get the trick to work, but \"Do you believe he?\" vs \"Do you believe him?\" makes it clear that \"whom\" is actually the correct word to use in that case.  As I mentioned, a lot of natives miss the case where who/whom is the subject of a verb, but tend to remember the case where it is the object of a preposition, as in \"to whom\" or \"for whom\".\n\nReference: [Grammarly: Who vs Whom](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/who-vs-whom-its-not-as-complicated-as-you-might-think/#:~:text=Whom%20should%20be%20used%20to,the%20subject%20of%20a%20sentence)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot kind stranger! this is very helpful.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "No he didn‚Äôt lol.

{"title": "The birth of Fiat currency, Neoclassical economics and later, Modern Monetary Theory - MMT.", "selftext": "The year is 1971: the dollar is officially convertible to gold at the rate of $35 an ounce. The London Gold Pool, set up to defend the convertibility of the dollar into gold, collapsed some three years earlier. A belligerent President de Gaulle in France is the first to withdraw from the London Gold Pool and subsequently orders the transfer of large reserves of gold bullion from New York to Paris. He does not, however, withdraw France from the Bretton Woods agreement.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the United States and her allies between 1968 and 1971, a significant arbitrage opportunity continues to be present between the official gold price and the real price on some private markets. Gold and currency speculation hurt the Allies and eventually West Germany gives up on defending the dollar, abandons Bretton Woods, followed by Switzerland and France (again!). This is a very short summary of multiple ructions and currency crises between the 60s and early 70s. We forget very quickly.\n\nIn  France, the Bretton Woods system was called \"America's exorbitant privilege\" as it resulted in an \"asymmetric financial system\" where non-US citizens \"see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals\". As American economist Barry Eichengreen summarized: \"It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one\".\n\nUS reserves of gold had dwindled  from over 20 000 tons to just over 9000 tons. All spent defending the dollar. The Vietnam war is costing an absolute fortune and bleeding the US dry. Literally and figuratively. Unemployment is running at about 6% and inflation at 5.84%. Both seen as uncommonly high since WWII.\n\nIn 1971 Richard Nixon had two choices: either take steps to balance the books, I.e. drastically  cut government expenditure, increase taxes,  reduce US inflation by increasing interest rates, and restore faith in the dollar, or suspend the convertibility of the US dollar into gold. He chose the latter and did it without consultation with Allies. The announcement on 15th August 1971 was accompanied by a mandated freeze on all wages and prices for 90 days. Imagine that today! In addition, an additional import tax on all items of 10% was thought necessary to protect American products against cheaper imports.\n\nOn 15th August 1971, I was just over 12 yrs old. I remember my father, a normally typical restrained British chartered accountant (when that meant something) going absolutely nuts. He opened champagne, started singing and danced with my mum. Guess he knew it was coming but not when.\n\n1971 marked the end of any pretence at backing currencies with gold. We now have fiat currencies backed by nothing but ‚Äôfull faith and confidence‚Äô in the issuing authority. The establishment of fully fledged fiat currencies has enabled all the debt based financial engineering we see around us today. It has worked as long as increase in money supply has been matched by increase in GDP: balanced growth. Problem is GDP growth cannot continue indefinitely without consequences for the environment and planet.\n\nSo what now?", "id": "j3szdw", "created_utc": 1601639045.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "Sir this is an options sub", "score": 123, "replies": []}, {"body": "> So what now? \n\nMoney printer goes brrrrr!", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "buys puts on the Earth", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ever seen the Idiocarcy?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "We're not gonna survive as a species long enough to achieve ideocracy :P", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Go away I‚Äôm baiting", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Now it‚Äôs time to build the Enterprise and expand growth into outer space.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "So, buy SpaceX?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "and AMZN", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Suddenly every corporation and household will take energy efficiency more seriously. It will be a key component of the balance sheet. \n\nNow products will reflect their real cost to the environment.

Everyone will have a gold mine (solar panels) on their roof.\n\nAnd we'll be in sync with how nature does its accounting. Currently, when you include externalities, energy is just too cheap. We waste a lot of it because it's often cheaper than not wasting it. (Insulation, for instance. How long does it take to pay for that LED bulb in saved energy? Etc.) \n\nRight now our entire economy is based on spending an inheritance without regard for how soon it will run out. Energy is the life-blood of modern civilization, but there is a finite amount of oil and coal in the ground. We've been using it a few million times faster than it was deposited.

One is that with lowered energy cost, manufacturing 'synthetic' gold would eventually undermine the system entirely. Another is the inherent weakness of a physical object. It seems anachronistic to talk about gold today, especially with the rise of cryptocurrencies -- which address most the problems with fiat, if properly executed.\n\nBut who knows, I'm no expert. And I personally believe currency is being given too much credit begin with. Security trading didn't go bananas until the rise of computerized, high-speed trading, there were cycles and downturns long before our debt-based economies.\n\nThe much bigger issue is that the general populace is duped when it comes to wealth. The boom in efficiency, access to new, cheap labor markets in Asia, and globalized trade, has deluded us that we're increasing wealth, when we're in fact just decreasing the cost of manufacturing.\n\nAnd the much, *much* bigger issue is real estate. Population increase, deregulation and urbanization, means it's more profitable for a bank to issue unproductive private mortgages, than a productive business loan. Few people mind, it's all magical chairs and the music hasn't stopped yet. \n\nBut why do you think every Western, neoliberal government is obsessed with immigration, and keeping borders open? Because we didn't expect fertility rates to continue dropping. Without a neverending supply of new demand, i.e. humans, the whole system fails. Debt, fiat currency, and FR banking are of course closely intertwined with this problem, but they're not intrinsically bad, if lending is still predominantly used to increase productivity.\n\nReal estate, however, is not a productive asset. But it's a very *convenient* asset for a bank, and finance loves predictability: everyone needs it, there's a limited supply (because of limited physical space), and it appreciates in value as long as the working population grows. Compare that to e.g. a factory, which may take decades to reach break-even, carries a high risk because of unexpected technological and commercial developments, and is constantly under pressure from global competitors, or an incompetent CEO. \n\nOf course a bank would rather issue a mortgage. And politicians, elected by ignorant voters -- allow them to.\n\nThe vast majority have reaped the benefits of this system. For the middle class it has been, and for many still is, a good deal. Normally, the only real losers are young people from poor backgrounds, immigrants, and anyone who can't maintain a stable income, or inherits real estate. These people inevitable enter at higher price levels, and since you need a place to live -- you're forced to either rent at ridiculous rates, or take out a massive mortgage which represents more money than you'll ever earn back from employment.\n\nFertility rates are continuing to decline globally, there's an increasing skepticism to mass immigration (for entirely different reasons), job opportunities are disappearing because of digitalization, and Asian countries have a growing middle class that don't want to manufacture cheap goods any longer... All these things come together to form what we're seeing today, but most voters are busy being distracted by identity politics, menial in-fighting and dumbed down entertainment.

How the fuck is this thing at a 136% short float?!<\n\n>!I would like to actually understand the fundamentals behind what is happening and if its likely to squeeze, Would it be possible that due to the likelihood that the big boys will be hedging their delta we could have a gamma squeeze?!<\n\n>!Please enlighten me.!<\n\n>!Ohh and!<\n\n>!https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities!<\n\n>!GME has been on this list for.. A long time now, what the fuck is that and how does it work exactly?!<\n\n**Edited Post:**\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n**I am retarded and these numbers may not be accurate or up to date.**\n\nWould anyone like to spend some time this weekend adding to the discussion?\n\nSo, I think I have been obsessing over GME and this is what I have come up with.\n\nThere is also a post about this.\n\n[www.shortsqueeze.com](http://www.shortsqueeze.com/)\n\nDays To Cover (Short Interest Ratio) 10.3\n\nShort Percent of Float 136.03 %\n\nShort % Increase / Decrease 15 %\n\nShort Interest (Shares Short) 66,410,000\n\nShort Interest (Shares Short) - Prior 57,860,000\n\nShares Float 48,820,000\n\nFor anyone wondering:\n\n**Days To Cover:**\n\n‚ÄúThe 'days to cover' represents the total estimated amount of time for all short sellers active in the market with a particular security to buy back the shares that were lent to them by a brokerage.\n\nIf a previously lagging stock turns very bullish, the buying action of short sellers can result in extra upward momentum. The higher the 'days to cover', the more pronounced the effect of upward momentum may be, which could result in larger losses for short sellers who are not among the first to close their positions. ‚Äú\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)\n\n**Short Percent of Float:**\n\nNow if your looking at that next number that says short percent of float and wondering what that is all about it is the percentage of shares currently short relative to the total number of shares floated. So yes you are reading that correctly and there is a short interest of 136.03%.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortexceed50.asp)\n\nHow can this be? How can we have more shares short than are floated?\n\nWhich leads me to my next question.\n\nWhat is naked selling? ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp))\n\nNow if your still paying attention I am hinting at the possibility that naked short selling is happening and everyone is trying to drive this stock to the core of the earth.\n\nNow we can also see that from the source.\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\n\nThe number of available shares of the past couple of days has risen from 900 to 550,000 and the FEE has steadily decreased, in my opinion that would be the likely result of people trying to unwind their short positions and the borrower trying to incentivise people piling back into the short position.\n\n**I know this is too fucking long but if you want to make money you like to read.**\n\n[https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)\n\nGME has been on that list now for a long time and starting next week I believe due to the SEC rules short positions will have to start covering, and these are short positions that were opened sub $7 when the stock is now trading at $9.45. This stock is owned primarily by institutions, people are going to get obliterated by whatever happens here.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp)\n\nAs you can see by now I am insinuating that this may be obviously a potential short squeeze situation.\n\n**The Fundamentals:**\n\nThis is the stuff that really matters to the retards here.\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/gme](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)\n\nThis boasts a list of institutional investors such as.\n\n\\- [RC Ventures LLC](https://fintel.io/i/rc-ventures-llc) (Ryan Cohen)\n\n\\- [Scion Asset Management, LLC](https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc) (Dr. Michael Burry)\n\n\\- [VANGUARD GROUP INC](https://fintel.io/i/vanguard-group)\n\n\\- [BlackRock Inc.](https://fintel.io/i/blackrock)\n\nGo have a look, this stock has like no retail movement right now, why on earth would it ever go up from where its currently at? Why are people investing in it?\n\nWell Ryan Cohen‚Äôs interest in the stock brought it back to life due to his association with the E-Commerce giant CHEWY, and Dr. Michael Burry seems to think that this business has some underlying fundamentals that are going to allow it to be profitable in the future.\n\nThe business is cashflow rich right now and it easily has enough money to weather it through this next console cycle which historically has been a great revenue booster.\n\nSo, GameStop is not dying, they are closing stores and reducing operating costs they have an E-Commerce guru and an autistic genius both invested.\n\n**What is the catalyst you ask?**\n\nWell it could be any of these things:\n\n\\- GME call a vote would require board members to call back their shares.\n\n\\- GME announce a buyback again.\n\n\\- Activist investor such as [Patrick M. Byrne ‚Äì Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Byrne)\n\n\\- Burry or Cohen could increase their stake.\n\n\\- Shorts could be forced to cover due to SEC Violations (SHO)\n\n\\- Strong positive earnings due to console cycle\n\n\\- Autistic sentiment\n\nTake your pick.\n\nNow I am invested for 1360 shares.

Though it might be.\n\nIt's possible that there are broker-dealers who are shorting the stock for themselves without bothering to locate it first.  This is illegal, and the whole reason that this list exists is so that the SEC can look into it, so that seems kind of dangerous.   The brokers are required to document what steps they take to locate the stock.  Compliance is a big deal here; places often get fined just for failing to document something properly even when there is no allegation that they actually did anything wrong.\n\nThe other possibility is that the brokers are making good-faith efforts to ensure that the stock will be available when the trade settles, but then it falls through.  Brokers always warn you that there is no guarantee that they will be able to borrow the stock on settlement date.\n\nThis is an interesting read:  https://ibkr.info/node/845  It's IB policy, but most of it is stuff that they are required to do.  It also gives some hints as to what's happening during a short squeeze -- orders are forced to be placed to close out large short positions when the shares to support the short can't be borrowed, or are recalled.  If these are large enough they may not completely fill over the course of a day.
