Tesla and SpaceX are the most wanted destination for the world's best graduates.  They have a HUGE talent gap, and they are unlikely to lose much of it.\n4. Traditional dealerships.

Batteries batteries batteries.  Tesla is at the forefront of both the product technology and the manufacturing technology for batteries.  Traditional auto is going to rely on third-parties to ramp production to enable their production... but those third parties are not going to ramp production until the demand is there.  It's a chicken and egg problem, and the small scale of the battery deals traditional auto is making with those third parties is going to massively delay their ability to scale up.

Tesla understands people need to be able to drive freely around the country in their EVs, and they are making the investments necessary to enable that through this network.  Traditional manufacturers are going to follow the regular model of introducing the product and hoping third-party networks like EVgo or Chargepoint fill that niche like gas stations do currently.

Influenced decisions means it's not DCA.  Influenced decisions mean a someone is trying to time the market.  \n\nThis is a good segue to your next question, but first I should point out that despite pervasive and false industry FUD, trying to time the market is *good*, not bad.  \n\n> 2) Does it really matter?\n\nYes.  Two of the myths most harmful to the average person who has decided to utilize the stock market are: DCA and \"don't try to time the market\".\n\nThey're pushed hardest by sales organizations who desperately rely on those myths for their own interests.  DCA keeps investors captive, it makes them docile and numb to poor performance, and it systematically undermines them by saying investors are dumb and only the institution can be smart. \"You can't time the market\" is an undermining sales tactic that works the same way.  Don't question the crummy securities we sold you, just buy more!  Performance and results don't matter, just effort!  \n\nAnd once neophytes hear these myths, they follow them and then regurgitate them to try and sound smart, when really they just self-indoctrinating.\n\nIn fact, every single individual and organization that has ever pitched \"you can't time the market\" is one that is actively trying to time the market themselves.  Your bank, who has that on every poster and pamphlet?  They have thousands of employees whose entire job is to time the market, and they have billions invested in equipment and research... to time the market.\n\nYou time the market in every other thing you do in life.  You buy insurance when the hurricane season is coming.  You buy leftover Halloween candy for 80% off on November 1st.  You get your boat all spruced up to sell in the summer when you know there will be the most interest, and when soup is half price, you stock up.  It's all common sense.  You'd never just submit an offer to buy a house or a car at \"market price\", you'd shop around and you'd negotiate.\n\nSo why in hell's name would you turn off all common sense and visibility when making potentially much larger and more important purchases and sales of stocks?  That would be insane.  Except because there's a fun slogan (\"remember, stupid customer, you can never time the market!\") people end up doing that.  Or they don't, and just claim they do.\n\nAs for DCA, if you know any calculus, you know DCA is only effective on one certain kind of curve.  And it's a curve that's not entirely common with stock markets.  DCA is mainly a way for institutions and salespeople to take your natural instinct to think for yourself and become a robotic buyer.  They love robotic buyers. \n \nThere's a place for it of course, if one is undisciplined and unwilling to pay the same attention to their investing as they do to their weekly grocery soup prices.  And even then, an ETF where someone avoids DCa tactics on your behalf would be better.  But if someone is here, in this sub, posting about stocks, something tells me they're a bit engaged and bit a informed and a bit motivated to do better than just a blind robot.\n\nSystematic investing is fine.

I'm not gonna lie, some of the \"the bank is just selling you a product\" gives it all a damn-the-man type twist to it, but it's all very intriguing and has my gears turning. Thanks for spelling all this out.\n\nI've abbreviated and simplified, but it comes from a life spent studying the workings of the finance industry, and an interest in helping others avoid mistakes I made.  \n\n> So for your retirement account, you regularly deposit money, but you're constantly making decisions to stop or go as far as which securities to buy and when?\n\nHistorically this was done through \"asset allocation\".  If that term isn't familiar you should read up on it since I'm not going to teach it here.  Long story short I think we have equity vehicles that can suitably simulate most parts of asset allocation anyway, plus I believe we're in a multigenerational period of insignificant lending/borrowing rates, which I now feel makes a big part of asset allocation pointless anyway.\n\nWhen someone is young, they're typically in a scenario where they have multiple competing priorities for their money. How much do you devote to basic living expense, and how much goes to elevating living to \"lifestyle\". How much to debt payments, how much to saving, retirement, education, discretionary.  Typically people gravitate to immediate and lazy choices, so if they intend to invest $1000 but living, clothes, cars, hair, holidays and everything leaves just $200, they tell themselves they'll catch up later.  But some are disciplined, and make the $1000 investment first, knowing they can then moderate other spending choices to fit the budget.  DCA can be an artificial way of setting that up, but better would be systematic savings/investing, where the money is automatically deposited, but the investment choice is not automatic.  Having to consciously decide if one has more faith in say technology stocks or bank stocks or consumer staples or materials stocks... that is useful engagement.  I view investments like exotic pets, they should be watched carefully and constantly.  You can't make up for a month of neglect by feeding them 30 times at the end of the month.\n\n> This is an interesting rabbit hole to go down.

According to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1% of households would see their after-tax income drop by 16% in 2022. That’s an average tax increase of $265,640.”\n\n“The middle 20% of households would get a tax cut worth 1% of after-tax income, or an average of $620.”\n\nMarket watch says [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/how-trump-and-biden-tax-policies-could-affect-your-paycheck-tax-return-investment-portfolio-and-nest-egg-2020-09-21):\n\n“What Trump and Biden tax policies mean for your paycheck\nBefore you get your paycheck, Uncle Sam takes a cut. These are payroll taxes and they consist of 6.2% that an employee pays into Social Security and 6.2% an employer pays for Social Security, combining for a 12.4% payment. The employer and employee also pay 1.45% apiece (a combined 2.9%) for Medicare taxes. Employees and employers currently pay the 12.4% only up to the first $137,700 a person earns.\n\nTrump authorized employers to let their workers making less than $104,000 defer payment on their 6.2% tax obligation between September and December. Experts say a deferral means the employee has a bigger check now, but has to pay the taxes next year, on top of the payroll taxes that come back on. Trump would like to see if lawmakers can pass a bill that would forgive the deferred taxes. Some small businesses have said the deferral isn’t worth the administrative hassle.\n\nBiden wants the 12.4% Social Security tax to kick back in for incomes above $400,000. The move takes square aim at the country’s highest earners. For example, the average salary for a CEO at the 350 largest publicly-traded companies was $1.325 million (as part of a $21.28 million projected pay package), according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.”\n\nNot sure where you’re getting the 9% from (pls source, interested to read!)\n\nFair enough about NY and the minimum wage raise.

Elon announced 1 million robotaxis in 2020 - robotaxis should be at least level 3 with no doubt. As I said, robotaxis seem to be far away at the moment even Tesla expect them to be around right now in a high amount. \n\nLevel 2 means, the driver has to be aware all the time and has to check what the car is doing. In the end, it is worth nearly nothing. \n\nThe real shit is level 3. Level 3 allows the driver to watch videos, movies, write E-Mails, surf in the net etc.) while driving because the driver has 10 seconds to take control over the car when the car is getting in trouble. As I said, it seems level 3 is way harder to reach as everyone expected. So there will be some time until we see the first level 3 car. \n\nAnd that gives the competition time to catch up. I posted it in another thread - Mercedes announced level 3 for the second half of 2021. And Mercedes is not the only big player, there are companies with big IT and AI knowledge like google and apple, companies who know how to build cars since decades like BMW and Mercedes or long etablished car companies with a lot of ressouces like GM or VW. All of these companies research and develop FSD cars.\n\nJust imagine if Tesla is not the first who releases a real full level 3 car. The stocks will take a huge hit.\nTesla is not the hunter anymore. Tesla has become the hunted! And as the hunted, you have to deliver. And Tesla failed to deliver right know (but it is not end of the year right now, there still is some time). That's why I said, they need to get their shit together and either stop announcing things like robotaxis, or deliver it in time. With each announcement the stocks will raise. With each time missing a milestone, the trust of the shareholders will decrease and the market follows. Thats just a normal process. Teslas market value is so high because a lot of people belive Tesla has something that will make their cars sell way better than any other brand. If Tesla can't deliver these things way before the competition (and that should not only be a few months), there is nothing what justfies the current market value.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, but Mercedes announcing Level 3 means fuckall.

My point is that teens should not shy away from learning hard skills to help them later in life. And often, those skills involve trades. That's it. Also, how is that not \"real world work experience\"?\n\nFair. I may have missed your point. Working for a small business is certainly a kind of job experience. I'd argue working for a larger corporation is a more applicable and diverse job experience for a teen, but you're right, working for a back alley trade shop is job experience of a sort. Point taken. It's really the only point we can feasibly argue on where my point would be it is more useful to a teen to graduate high school while working for a flexible multinational multi-billion-dollar corporate organization - one that has a pedigree for working with part time teens focused on school while still learning job skills - and yours would favor Bob's shade tree mechanic that will shit all over this kid for having to adjust his schedule for a school conflicts and probably fuck him on pay somehow because they're a teen and won't figure it out. \n\n>Productivity gains in the last few decades have largely come from high-tech jobs, not blue collar.\n\nI'm not sure what this is other than utter bull shit.

Of course tech-sector employment is a driving force in wage increases, and sort of makes my point: unless you're going to college to work a highly skilled job your ass BETTER AT LEAST go to a trade school if you want to make 80% (adjusted for inflation) what your grandfather did decades ago *without* a trade school education.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> I am absolutely certain of this, yes\n\nAgain, why?
