Instead of monopoly it's \"walled garden\". Instead of overpriced it's \"paying a premium\".\n\nAnecdotally I just had a MacBook for work. The thing bricked itself because the fucking battery went to zero. Let me repeat that: The battery, which loses charge over time by its very nature, went to zero and bricked the computer or at least the battery. Who the fuck designs a battery like that? My 00's and early 10's era batteries didn't do that shit. And because of their walled garden BS you can't just go into a store like any other laptop and buy a new battery, you have to do it through their dedicated repair shops. Imagine if your car broke down and blew out the engine because it ran out of gas and then you got told to go to Honda's repair center and if you use the local shop your warranty for your overpriced car is voided. Utter bullshit. And it's not an isolated case either. I looked up the model(2018) and overwhelmingly people were like \"oh yeah it does that. Gotta keep it charged\". WTF.\n\nHalf their business model is built around building products designed to fail or slow down after x amount of time or conveniently when a new model comes out. They're the very definition of planned obsolescence and have been caught doing it multiple times. Which contributes massively to e-waste on top of being anti consumer as hell.\n\nThe tech they make isn't even good price to performance wise. I'm not well versed on the current laptops mind you but I bet for any price you pay for a MacBook you can easily get a better deal at the same jacked up prices they'll sell at. And instead of Mac OSX you can install any OS you want, like windows or a Linux distro for instance(which Mac osx is in the same family of) and get access to a plethora of open source software and an ever growing gaming library as Linux plays catch-up to windows on that front. Technically you can jailbreak a Mac but it's a pain in the ass and once again voids their warranty because any sort of customization is frowned on. So from both a hardware and a software perspective they lose. They make money from consumers by preying on the tech illiterate and convincing them that because their products are slightly easier to use for basic use cases, that justifies all the baggage it comes with.

{"title": "The bears aren't done, folks! These diamond hands will print.", "selftext": "**UPDATE (11/4/2020):**\n\nA lot of you have been asking for updates. I apologize that I haven't gotten around to it yet. Been very busy. But here is the update.\n\nI liquidated all of my short-term positions listed in this thread on Friday. I'm holding mostly cash and a few long-term positions in TLT at the moment. I will try and update again when I enter a new position.\n\nAs proof, here is a screenshot of my recent trades:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ilm0sourbx51.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9de5239f854eaf7a70cce613dbcd5a5dab422df\n\nAs a general rule, I enter fairly conservative short-term options positions and liquidate around 50-60% return. Most of my positions were above 50% return on Friday, so I liquidated everything. I took a small loss on the short-term TLT play. I thought that the volatility and falling market would be the catalyst to spur a possible short-term rise in bonds as investors fled to safer assets, but that didn't seem to be the case. TLT is still rising and approaching 162 so those of you still holding should be safe.\n\nIn summary: My returns for the week were around 40%, with a total profit around $2500. Not bad at all for a one-week play. My advice for noobies: Don't get greedy. If you break 50% return on options it is generally a good idea to close, unless you are playing a very gambly, far OTM strategy and hoping to pay off big. Thanks for reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position: Puts on everything except VXX and TLT.**\n\nAfter my last post a lot of people have been asking me for my positions and more insight into the markets. I'll be offering both in this post. I'm always happy to help the noobies, as we were all noobs once. :)\n\nToday, at exactly 10 minutes before market close, I stopped everything I was doing, and opened up a chart on SPY. There was something in particular I was looking for... A strong End-Of-Day selloff.\n\nIt took a bit longer than I anticipated, but sure enough, right before the closing bell, SPY tanked $2 to close.\n\nThis was the confirmation I was looking for that my play is still the correct one. The point is that, while people participated in the small correction-rally today, they weren't comfortable enough to actually hold their positions overnight. Which tells you the rally today was never \"real.\" This is a strong signal that fear has still gripped the market, and that the smart bulls are lacking in confidence short-term. As they should be...\n\nHere are my current positions. All seven are still in the green, even after the move against me today. I could have sold yesterday for a large profit, but I'm confident enough that even greater gains are still to come for a bearish position such as this one. No paper hands here, I'm holding until I hit my targets. The very short term options (November expiry) were purchased today after that massive midday runup for a bit of extra juice. I knew that peak wouldn't last, and will probably sell those tomorrow or the day after.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qskyokqc4w51.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=199f4af8c95c95dd6115f0f7e42d3ee493ffb8b4\n\nSome of you may balk at the \"smallish\" positions, because you are used to WSB style stupidity. This is still a nearly $10k position in short-term options, which is always a risky play. I've survived over a decade as a trader because I don't YOLO $100k on a single play. That stuff is entertaining for sure, but let's face it, it's not sustainable trading strategy.\n\nThere are plenty of arguments for a bearish position. Covid cases rising, election uncertainty, stimulus failing, and so on. Plenty of others have made this case, so I won't focus on the small scale issues such as these.\n\nWhat I want to give you is a larger, macro picture. Because the market is simply overvalued, period. The market has become divorced from the overall economy. I understand tech, and why they have a bullish case for growth in the face of Covid lockdowns... My point here is that you need some REAL WORLD measures to tie \"future earnings\" down to reality, to prevent irrational euphoria from taking over your mind.\n\nThe metric I'm going to present here is not new by any stretch. It isn't unique or original. But it is undeniably useful, and carries strong weight, whether modern traders wish to shun it and its originator or not. I'm talking about the Buffet Indicator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bh6fqesle4w51.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=534d2913230896a3408e3f752d653291b7ea9f07\n\nFor those of you new to this concept, it is simply the total stock market value divided by GDP. The point is to compare market valuations with some hard, trailing, real-world metric, in this case GDP. When market valuations uncouple strongly from actual market conditions, it is a strong signal of irrational stock valuations. And that presents opportunity for those paying attention.\n\nNote that this chart has already been detrended down to account for historically rising P/E ratios, and it still shows a strongly overvalued market, equal to what was seen during the DotCom bubble. That's bad news, folks.\n\nThis is the REAL issue in the present market, and why buyers are becoming exhausted. Covid, instability, elections, stimulus... These are all just catalysts to give that equity bubble a little prick. Only the dumbest of the dumb are still \"buying the dip\" under current market conditions, which means mostly clueless retail gamblers on WSB. All these perma-bulls are doing is offering liquidity to the institutional investors to help get them out of their positions. In the end, we all know who is left holding the bag.\n\nThe loss porn posted on this sub the past week is just a small taste of what's to come. People are going to get blown out of their positions hard. Don't be one of them. If you aren't comfortable enough to take a short position, at least go cash gang. And of course, bonds are always a safe bet, especially after the largest bond short in history...\n\nThank you for reading. I'll try and stick around to answer any questions.

I think since a lot of people are cooking at home, so the price will increase. So I go down to the store and say ‚Äúhey, I want to buy 10 bottles in the future at $25 bucks each.‚Äù The store says yes and charges you twenty five cents per bottle to write it down in their inventory book.

Since you made a deal with the wine store you sell your ‚Äúoption‚Äù to buy wine at the lower price. Somebody buys from you for $40, you owe the liquor store $2.50 (.25 cents per bottle) so you‚Äôve made $15 per bottle x 10; $150 minus $2.50: net gain of $147.50. \n\nPuts are a bit more complicated (every book usually says it‚Äôs the opposite but it is a bit more difficult for me to understand so I‚Äôll lay it out for you.) \n\nA friend of mine owns a large wine store.

He says sure and charges you $2 per bottle. You go to a wine meeting and hear this winery mixes junk in their wine and no one wants it any more. The price goes to $20 per bottle.

I really hope I'm not breaking any rules but please don't remove this mods‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThis F/Y I created a relatively diverse portfolio and went from a nice and steady gain of around 50% since May to about -50% from my initial investment as of tonight. I thought I was making the right calls until I wasn't. No I'm not gonna post loss porn but I've got four letters for you..  H Y L N üòÉüî´. Got f'd so hard I can still feel it weeks later. So yeah feel free to keep reading cuz I'm a fucking idiot and you might get a kick out of this.\n\nSo. GME. If you're still reading...\n\n\n**BULL CASE, NO SQUEEZE:**\n\nVideo games have multi-generational appeal. The oldest generation being 40-50 year old gen x‚Äôers that have been playing (and developing) video games since Atari 2600 in the 70s, all the way to single-digit age kids coming to video game age every year. Babies being born provides steady supply of new gamers over time  while the older generations continue to play video games and buy games for their kids, and many have the disposable income to afford the good stuff. The total addressable market is growing and still has a couple of decades to reach full generational saturation.\n*Courtesy of u/Mr_Saturn_*\n\n\nIf we consider the company's\n\n-cash in hand (i.e. ability to stay afloat) \n\n-sold out pre-orders on the new consoles\n\n-brand awareness (how many of us bought something from GameStop as a child? I bought a LOT of shit from GameStop as a kid and I want my fucking money back so I'm in as I'm sure a lot of others are in for a similar reason). On a serious note, GameStop is well known in the UK as well as in the US. They no longer operate here, however, you and I can all bet our asses that my fellow countrymen have been and shall continue FOMOing into this on any future news of a turnaround and/or deal and/or large institutional investor joining the fight and/or short squeeze becoming imminent. \n\n*EDIT:* Also I don't believe the Blockbuster anecdote applies to GME as GameStop is operating in a thriving and evidently growing industry: the gaming industry. Brought to you by the lockdown of 2020-2021(maybe like 2022 at most right??). Blockbuster was struggling in the age of on-demand streaming. If it somehow survived til now, covid would've killed it within weeks if not days of news breaking out. Also Blockbuster no longer offered any cost-advantage to their customer. You could stream for free on pirate sites back then or pay for an emerging premium service called Netflix (who tried to buy Blockbuster but they refused the offer and got rek't shortly after). The cost of said premium service per month would not even exceed the cost of renting a couple of dusty ass DVDs back then. None of these things apply to GameStop. They offer second-hand AND brand new - capturing a wide market (wider now, with the recession and all). They offer a loyalty system which isn't half bad (I'm guessing this will change for the better anyway under new management). They can and do still offer competitive prices on many many items including consoles, games, and all sorts of gaming equipment. They are primed to make a KILLING from this console cycle. Regardless of whatever happens, don't fall for this false narrative.\n\n**GameStop ‚â† Blockbuster.**\n\n-possibility of acquisition of GameStop by a large retailer; think Amazon, Costco, or Walmart acquiring a recognised gaming-industry retail company (GME) with a view to becoming the single biggest retailer of games and gaming equipment by incorporating it into their existing logistical systems. I personally think if anyone ever considers this, it'll be Amazon. They're the only ones (I think) who could handle logistics for the massive customer base they will amass following this. Imagine buying a game from GameStop, and it arrives at your door with Prime Delivery. This would obviously be the \"home run\" so to speak. This type of news alone would, without a doubt, cause the single greatest squeeze ever witnessed. **HOWEVER, DISCLAIMER: This one is pure speculation from my side. I haven't seen anything to support or even suggest this, this is purely a hypothetical situation and most likely will never be a serious topic of discussion**\n\n-constant cost cutting by way of closing down locations which aren't making money \n\n-change of management  \n\n-involvement of Michael Burry (i watched the Big Short and thats all the DD we really need here let's be honest...)\n\n-institutional investors holding a signification amount of shares and not selling even after such ridiculous rallies \n\n-attempt at pivoting to e-commerce\n\n-Microsoft profit-sharing deal on new console sales. Guaranteed to bring in revenue above and beyond what will be generated purely by GameStop's own trading of items. A deal of this type clearly shows that Microsoft NEED GameStop to keep operating - it *could* also be an indication of future deals been the two companies\n\n-rumoured Sony deal \n\n-potential for further deal(s) with more big names such as Nintendo \n\n-increasing retail interest \n\n-retail investors looking for the next success story \n\n-premium meme status \n\nI think the stock price (without any sort of squeeze action) will sit around $30 to $50 by the time earnings from the new consoles come into play. This puts the company at a market cap of around $2bn to $3.5bn, respectively - a fairly reasonable valuation compared to previous gaming cycles and taking all aforementioned factors into consideration (and assuming they all go in favour of GME i.e. no bad news, no scandals, no big investors selling off, smashing earnings reports, securing further deals, etc.).\n\nThis valuation MAY be achievable solely based on earnings from new consoles and other products, as well as a successful pivot to e-commerce. However, I personally believe the valuation of $2bn to $3.5bn is contingent on some sort of cataclysmic news (i.e. more deals with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) carrying the price to the $20 to $25 range PRIOR to the console earnings coming into play. If such a catalyst occurs in time, it may provide the stock with a new floor around $20 to $25 (making the valuation sit at around $1.3bn to roughly $1.6bn) as more retail investors start to take notice.\n\n\n_____\n\n\n**BULL CASE WITH SQUEEZE:**\n\nAssuming that a short squeeze actually takes place, God only knows where it could end up. I REALLY like that one guy's PT of $500 but that's probably not going to happen. With that being said, I can't even fathom what a short squeeze with 170% short interest could actually do to a stock like this.. Please, someone with ACTUAL knowledge of the market feel free to chime in here. \n\nSo... PT with the turnaround story, securing new deals/partnerships with big companies, increase in retail interest, AND some squeeze action on the side?? $100 to infinity. \n\n\n_____\n\n\n**BEAR CASE:**\n\nThe company has been in decline for about 6 years. When we consider WHY the stock is trading so low, one wonders why it would suddenly become worth even $1bn, let alone $2bn to $3.5bn. The rise of e-commerce and now with the ultimate fuck you from the universe (covid) to brick-and-mortar stores.. it's really no wonder why the company is doing so terribly. They may continue to trade at these elevated prices running up-to and through the initial console release period, but it will not last. This is because making a breakout in the e-commerce sector will be nearly impossible because of Amazon (worldwide), eBay (worldwide), GAME (UK/Europe), and large supermarket chains like Tesco (UK), Asda (UK) and Costco (USA/UK) already having a pretty solid grasp on the market in their respective territories.\n\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, the bull case is contingent on so many factors that it is more likely to continue declining in the mid to long term rather than trending up by any significant measure. Contrary to what a lot of people are thinking, the bear case is actually supported by the ridiculous short interest. Why would so many people be betting against a stock with such passion (170% shorted ffs) if they didn't absolutely believe that they are right and that GME is done for? At least one really solid catalyst WILL be required to push the stock up significantly. It seems that the Microsoft deal was not a significant enough catalyst make the share price moon. So how far up is another deal REALLY likely to push the share price?\n\nAlso, If there is no such catalyst until new console earnings come into play, or if big investors start pulling out at ANY point, the stock MAY still spike as console earnings come into play, however, it most likely will not hold above $25 and will crash hard as fuck when people start taking profits/realise what's about to happen.\n\nAlso, why would this console cycle affect GME the same way as previous cycles did? We now have so many options to choose from when it comes to buying ANYTHING let alone games or consoles. Of course, Amazon won't be able to fulfil every single order. GameStop WILL pull in hella revenue as demonstrated by the selling out of BOTH waves of PS5 preorders. However, the effect on the share price will not be the same. We will most likely see some huge spikes leading up to/after earnings, but it will be short-lived as people will see that GameStop is one of MANY retailers offering competitive prices for the same items and as supply and demand meet an equilibrium. \n\nAlso.. what do most people do when they can't find something at their go-to store? Most people I know would look at Amazon or eBay rather than waiting it out. This will pull a lot of revenue away from GameStop as other retailors will fill the gaps and reduce the prospects of revenue growth over time. This, in turn, will make the stock price tumble once again, and probably harder than it ever has because this may be GameStop's last shot at turning it around.\n\nUltimately, I think if any sort of a bear scenario plays out, we could be looking at 52-week low within the next few weeks (I personally don't hold this opinion as I need to keep believing to remain sane).\n\n\n_____\n\n\nI could keep talking in circles about why the stock is/isn't gonna moon and who's gonna get fucked the hardest; bears or bulls, respectively. Every reason FOR either side can be easily followed up with an argument AGAINST it. \n\nI would personally really like it if someone could pump the stock so hard that shorts start covering, causing a domino effect of shorts covering their positions (and their asses), leading to the ultimate short squeeze so I can finally make a little bit (or a lot) of money. But for all we know, this shit could crash so hard I might never be able to bring myself to trade again. \n\n_____\n\n\n**USEFUL LINKS:**\n\n-Explanation of how the squeeze *can* happen.

Agree to disagree I guess but I still feel that the general sentiment here shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the sector that GME operates and how it generates revenue. Sure, there will be some increase now with the console cycle but a large portion of that will be eaten by Amazon. Yes, the balance sheet is strong and that's a good argument for GME. However without a serious business pivot I don't see GME turning their failing model around. I've seen the argument made for an online marketplace for games which would make sense if steam or console marketplaces didn't already exist. Also there's the argument for retro games which I don't agree with either. These markets tend to be second hand and there is no need for a physical store for them.

Blockbuster had ONLY band awareness going for it. What else did they have to show? I'll admit I was not in touch with the stock market when all that took place but as far as I know, Blockbuster had EVERYTHING going against it and only brand awareness working FOR the stock. I'm sure a lot of boomers grabbed Blockbuster thinking it's discounted, not realising the truth of the matter..\n\nBlockbuster, for example, was in a declining industry. I'm certain up to 99% of DVD rental places have went out of business since the rise of streaming services. There is actually one in my city which I know of. The only reason they are even staying afloat tho is cuz of X rated DVDs. That's their biggest revenue puller. So no, not comparable in my humble opinion. Sure, back then streaming services weren't all that - what with most people at the time having slow wifi speeds amongst other issues. But it was still enough to push DVD rental businesses off of the pedestal. Back then most people actually relied on free/pirate streaming sites. Now we have Netflix (i know it was around then), Hulu, Amazon Prime, and God only knows how many more. There is no way Blockbuster would have ever survived in this environment. And now we got Covid? Fuck. I couldn't see a single person I know renting out DVDs with the risk of infection still present, and the availability of various streaming services at their disposal (which by the way normally carry a monthly cost equivalent to renting about 2 old-ass movies from a DVD rental shop or one fairly new one).\n\nGameStop is in exactly the opposite situation as far as this comparison is concerned. The gaming industry is BOOMING. People are spending all their time inside, and a lot of their money on entertainment. Look at Corsair. Absolutely magnificent rally just the other week and it's holding - even when most markets are bloody red. What does that tell you? It tells me that the gaming industry is growing at a rate faster than what has ever been seen before. GameStop doesn't just sell games, they sell accessories amongst other things. Also, they are operating in what is still a very profitable (albeit, very competitive) sector. The gaming industry will only continue to see a rise over the next 3-5 years especially with a lot of companies now allowing their employees to work from home for the foreseeable, or forever in the case of Microsoft. If covid doesn't go away soon, I can see a lot of other companies following suit, further increasing the collective amount of time spent indoors and increasing demand for games and gaming-related products.\n\nAnyway, I'm not trying to convince you that I'm right.

It destroys you, body and mind, and everyone knows it. There was not a statistically significant growth in marijuana use in states that legalized it, it just became safer to buy and sell and people aren't going to prison for it. Victimless crimes having prison sentences wastes tax money and cripples people who get busted, because now they can't find a job because of the felony and can't vote until they've paid their fines, which they can't pay because they can't get a job. Joblessness pushes them back into selling drugs, which puts them back in prison, which is what prisons want because they're owned by private companies that use prisoners for slave labor. \n\nTLDR: Legalizing meth won't cause more meth use, it will cause less imprisonment, less cyclical crime for people who made some mistakes, and less people killed in bad drug deals or with laced drugs.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah if some things aren't a crime there's less crime.
