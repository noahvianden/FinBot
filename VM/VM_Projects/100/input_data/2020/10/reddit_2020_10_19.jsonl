First, the details of the share split are important for how the options are adjusted, so lets look at that first.\n\nArconic spun off into Howmet Aerospace and Arconic Corp.\n\nAt the time of the split, stockholders will keep their shares of Arconic Inc., which will change its name to Howmet Aerospace Inc. and assume the ticker symbol HWM.\n\nIn addition, they will receive one share of the spin-off company — Arconic Corp. — for every four Arconic Inc. shares they hold.

New to options and could use some clarification on something. From my understanding the buyer of an option has the right to buy or sell per the contract. And the seller has the right to cash in on the premium if the option is not exercised. If it is, the seller is liable to buy or sell shares of stock to the buyer at a certain price (in some cases infinite loss theoretically). Say you buy an option for a stock in order to control a larger amount of shares with smaller amount of capitol. You buy the option contract and sell it the next day for a swing trade profit. By cashing out, you are technically selling an options contract to another buyer and thus liable to sell him/her the stock at the strike price if he/her decides to exercise the contract correct? If I bought 10 calls on FB at strike of 270 and I decide to cash out a couple days later for a profit at 300. Am I then liable to sell someone 1,000 shares of Facebook at the strike price if they decide to exercise that contract at, say, 350? That sounds incredibly risky and could easily wipe out any gains you made if the stock continues to go up after you sell and someone else decides to cash in on the calls you sold them. By that logic you would have to miraculously time the top of the market so that you can be absolutely sure (which isn’t really possible) that the person you offloaded your call contracts to, will not choose to exercise it. I just remember reading that selling options is much much more risky than buying them. But eventually, you do become the seller of an option unless you let it expire.

They are true, but it's much more important to understand that a buyer makes money by selling for more than he bought, and a seller makes money by buying for less than he sold.\n\nBuyer: Bought (to open) XYZ call for $5, sold (to close) for $6, $1 profit.\n\nSeller: Sold (to open) XYZ call for $6, bought (to close) for $5, $1 profit.\n\nSince options should not be held to expiration, the facts you mentioned are pretty close to irrelevant.\n\n\n> You buy the option contract and sell it the next day for a swing trade profit.

This is why I put the qualifiers (to open) and (to close) in my example. If you are a buyer, you **sell to close**. If you are a seller, you **sell to open**. Two completely different actions. Only the **sell to open** action carries the liability of fulfilling the contract if assigned.\n\nA buyer is never liable for delivering the obligations of a contract. The buyer is the beneficiary. It is only the underwriter, the seller, who has that obligation.\n\nBTW, it's best not to use \"buyer\" an \"seller\" as they cause the confusion you had. You only need four terms: open, close, long, and short.\n\nLong means you buy to open. Short means you sell to open. \n\nBuyer sells 1 XYZ call (to close) = Close long XYZ call.\n\nSeller sells 1 XYZ call (to open) = Open short XYZ call.\n\nThat makes it much clear that the actions are completely different.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That makes much more sense, I had a feeling that I was wrong somewhere but the “buyer and seller” terms had me mistaken at some points.

Valuations on reopening stocks like the ones you listed (also airlines, cruise lines, Six Flags/Cedar Point, oil stocks, many REITs, even some financials and insurance - all of which are my personal take, not specified in the article) are rock bottom right now and not likely to suffer as much in the even of such a correction. \n\nAs someone who jumped into retail investing to buy the dip, and watched my portfolio spike by 45% the first week of June (more than $75K), only to lose all those gains the following week, I feel like my take is fairly solid: \n\n**Pros**: the value is there, and there are certainly significant gains to be had. I watched the proof of concept in my own portfolio. \n\n**Cons**: What kind of gains, and what kind of timeline, are anyone's guess. Without getting political, I'll consider it safe to say the national COVID response will be more coherent if current polling plays out, but what exactly that means for stocks, the post-COVID economy, and the extent to which the gains return are very much up in the air as a wild card. I lost some good money waiting on OXY and a couple smaller-cap longshots to come around, but IVZ and RWT have paid off for me throughout the pandemic and are likely poised to benefit disproportionately whenever reopening finally gets into full swing. \n\n**Remember time value of money**: time your money spends waiting on the reopening to come to fruition is time it's spending not invested in something that grows in the meantime. Tech will likely also take a hit once the world feels comfortable crowding into public spaces again, so it's by no means a magic carpet ride in the meantime. \n\n**Other options to consider**: If you go with the reopening plays, consider diversifying with something that you think will grow regardless of COVID status. Clean energy has done well recently and certainly has a future. Certain materials and industrials will remain regardless of the pandemic. The FAANG+ plays are not likely to outpace the market in the next six months the same way they did in the last six months, so do some diligence and see where else you think you may want to branch out, but consider allocating part of your portfolio away from the reopening plays for the balance. \n\nOr, you know, scared money doesn't make money, go big or go home, etc. Only you know your risk tolerance.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[Here's a thread from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jdrihy/investing_in_clean_energy_index_funds/) about clean energy ETFs.

First, this opens the idea that people can't cooperate and that investing and all profiteering is a zero-sum game which just isn't true. Let's say I buy a stock at 1 and sell to you at 2 because my goal, that is right, my GOAL, was to double my money, I won, but you bought at 2 and rode it to 4 and also doubled, and guess what? I'm not mad. I don't think you're an idiot or a loser nor are my gains your losses or you gains my losses. We both got what we wanted. That is the real goal of trading.\n\nThe cutthroat, hardcore, buy at the bottom, sell at the top, mindless greed game is silly and unrealistic. No one does that. We all win when we all win; those of use sell the options for instance get the premium while those who buy may be either selling them on to an end user who ultimately just gets the peace of mind who is using it as insurance. This stuff really happens and it is working as designed.\n\nThis is a lot clearer in bond markets. Most people buy and trade young maturities into the hands of someone who wants the bond and just holds it. Everyone wins and profits every step of the way.\n\nNow certainly you can misjudge the chain and you can lose money but the idea that you have to be killing someone to be profitable is just wrong all the way. I would never, ever lose sleep selling my 300% to someone who turned it into 500% or whatever; if I hit my goal and someone ascends beyond that I don't feel like I misjudged anything. I know what I want. I got it. Someone else got what they wanted. Why not be happy about it?\n\nBasically I just dislike the idea that people invest mindlessly with the intent to murder one another out as if there is no rationality in the markets and it only has one value. It just isn't true. I mean yes, if you work in Finance, your goal is to make money from the markets presuming you're in such a role, but to do so isn't really to cause distress to other people and in fact institutional investors are important players because they do all the \"real\" DD; if a company gains a price target adjustment in the minds of Goldman for instance they've done deep analysis that you and I don't and perhaps they are more correct based on things and assets and derivatives and productions that we not only do not see but definitely do not understand.\n\nThis is a long-winded way to say that markets are a Cooperative Game. The losers typically are the ones who fall for these scams which are indeed Zero-Sum and they are structured that way. No one is out to get you if you buy Nio because you like Nio but someone is out to get you if you buy Nio because someone else can't get out of it.

The emotion? Regret. This is how they get you; if I bought it for 1, sold it for 4, and someone sells it 10 years (or 10 minutes) later for 400 *I still win*. I got what I wanted out of the trade. You want to die in this game? You do exactly this; you keep talking about the things you *did not do* and the things *that you missed* instead of having your eyes forward because I'll tell you the truth: The money is *always there*. There will always be another Tesla and another Fastly and another Immunomedics and other 10 baggers and 12 and 20 and 100. Always.

Rather than the numerical return on your capital.\n\nYou're right. I've tried the other way, doing the math, staring at figures, analyzing things until my eyes bled, and all it won me was sleepless nights, frivolous anxiety, and wondering if my brilliant plan to get rich was going to work. But then I thought about the money and what I wanted and I bought what I wanted: Time. I work because I want to. If I lost my job tomorrow and the world shut down for a year or two I'd be fine. I replaced my income with dividends and trade on the excess as I just grow it according to my plan. Okay, it's true, that isn't glamorous but the fact of the matter is we are (were) in the market for different things. I wanted my life back. You want some tendies. Both are available but I certainly don't want to live pretending the bottom line is what my life is worth.

I just know that it is part of the process. But I also do other things a little more professionally so I scale into things slowly and test them to death over and over again before releasing them into \"production\" meaning that while most of WSB just heard of options and instantly started playing them I didn't play options for almost 3 years testing them over multiple strategies very slowly and with great attention to detail in writing in a trading journal. I am the boring one here for certain. I do admit I hate losing money, even like $20, but that's a background thing from my growing up.\n\n>We have a different opinion of what constitutes a \"win\" or \"success\" in trading or investing i suppose.

First, no trade can happen without the consent of both parties. You have to agree to buy it. They have to agree to sell it. So what this means is that, just by the nature of it, both people *are getting what they want*. Now we could both talk about what drives that endlessly with ranges from fear to goal setting to just flat out not caring and disinterest in holding the security anymore but ultimately it comes down to the same logic all over again. While you're focused on what it means to get one-up on someone I've done that and hated it. I feel like a meme of an old samurai who has killed a lot of people and now sits and cuts bonsai or something; it's not that there is no skill and such and that it isn't grueling and terrifying but you kind of grow out of that phase when you look at the bigger picture and realize that when I sell something to someone it isn't because I think they are stupid, it's because I don't want it anymore and when they buy it from me they probably aren't thinking, \"GOD THIS GUY IS A FUCKING MORON TENDIES TO THE MOOOOOON!\" at all, but instead, just trying to make their own plans come to fruition. \n\n>Thanks for the enlightening discussion nonetheless, maybe there's still hope for me someday ;)\n\nI promise you this: If you ever make enough money to not worry about money you will probably not die with the mindset you have now.

Short interest was 99% of float back in April when it first started getting some attention. As of 9/30 short interest is at 160% of float (although I suspect that many shorts covered and exited their position 2 weeks ago based on volume traded that Friday). There are still potentially more shares sold short than available to trade, which is what the entire GME thesis is built on. The more margin pressure applied to the short positions the more likely it is that they will be rushing to cover or have their positions force liquidated with shares that are not even available. The first post by DeepFuckingValue was about a year ago, so I would hardly call this a pump and dump. The fact that it is now a meme stock helps contribute to the short squeeze and now that they are entering the next console cycle which has always increased their market cap seasonally adds fuel to the fire. Your analysis appreciated but adding “muh short squeeze” makes it seem like you have not researched the mechanics behind this one. Just because it is a meme stock does not mean it is a pump and dump. Why not include TSLA in that case, which is the most pumped stock on WSB? Because it is not a pump and dump scheme, just like GME IMO. It is a position that takes advantage of the insane short interest, cash on hand and upcoming console cycle - all three of which work together to facilitate the short squeeze.
