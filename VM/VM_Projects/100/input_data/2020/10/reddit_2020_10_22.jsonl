Walmart, Best Buy, Target, Amazon will all want to improve and compete. No dought this competition would benefit Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. The other issue is retail in general. (GS was not in a good place last quarter with a -5 EPS.) Sales are on the decline and expenses are going up. Things like $15 min wage won't help. Consumers are becoming more used to buying things digitally as well. At some point the incentive for platforms to offer retailers a cut may decline.

Only to corporations. This will result in extended furloughs, layoffs, and unemployment draws until a vaccine is available and the economy returns to normal (not even *starts to* return...  Everything has to be be back to normal).  With no eviction protections we’ll find a spike in homelessness and a glut of foreclosed homes saturating the market.  High inventories and low demand will drive real estate prices down hard.  Around summer I’d say we’ll end up seeing echoes of the 2008 housing market collapse starting and it will cause a similar effect on the economy at large over the ensuing year.  I couldn’t guess how Trump and the Republicans would handle that crisis since Obama wrote the playbook on the last housing crisis and I doubt they’d follow it.\n\nDemocrat win:  There will be massive stimulus going to everybody and lots of individual, consumer, and worker protections put in place.  The markets will flourish and housing will not collapse (right away...  There would either need to be programs to help people behind on their rent/mortgage or a more severe housing crash would occur much later in the game than in the Republican win scenario).  However this will result in massive debt.  Massive debt will result in massive borrowing, massive borrowing will result in massive inflation.  Inflation will help pay loans, but people will be earning less so they’ll have less disposable income, which means less economic activity.  Meanwhile the government will raise taxes on corporations and the rich which will reduce their productivity and raise prices.  This should all add up to a recession occurring a few years after Covid ends as we try to dig ourselves out of this pit.  Maybe not as sudden or severe as a housing crash, but it will probably happen a lot more slowly and take a lot longer to recover from.\n\nShort term (one year), I think Biden is better, long term (1-4 years ahead) I think Trump could pull us out of the slump quicker and more strongly than Biden provided he reacts to the housing crisis well.

Growth valuations **will** have to increase.\n- $1.3b in cash flow plus the huge ATM equity round will basically force credit rating agencies to upgrade Tesla from their still comically low ratings.

(Maybe sooner.) This triggers around $80b of forced buy & holding of TSLA.\n- The 2021 March convertible notes will further improve Tesla's debt position and deleverage Tesla's balance sheet. Tesla will probably communicate their preferred method of conversion sometime in November/December. These will also generate quite a bit of additional cash flow in Q1.

Apparently they have other agreements in place as indicated by previous earnings calls (SA article with transcript snippets). It didn't say with who, so I'm skeptical on whether its major, but its still a positive. They also are getting more than their share of Nintendo switch consoles, which indicates a stronger relationship with Nintendo. Could be because of their new board member, but either way thats a favorable relationship they have.\n\nAnd finally, Cohen. If he gets involved as he has indicated he wants to, I could see this going massive, long term.

To sum it up (for IV Crush), if a stock has a higher chance of going up and down, like TSLA, it had a high Implied Volatility (IV). Now, that IV rises when earnings are near, because there’s a higher chance for it to go up or down. Because it has more IV, calls and puts will cost more. But after earnings, the reason for the high volatility is gone, because there is no anticipation. For Theta, just think of a call like a bet. People always want more time for a bet to be right! So, if you have two days before your FDs expire, there’s a higher chance you’ll get to your strike price. But, if another day passes and it hasn’t gotten significantly closer to your strike, then you only have 1 day left for a huge move, and it’s way less likely. Because it’s less likely, your position is worth less. That’s why these FDs didn’t work, because even though the price rose, it didn’t go anywhere near your strike price, and the IV was gone, so it “crushed” both calls and puts. \n\n\nTLDR: Theta means time; the less time you have to be right the less a contract will cost.
