What happened afterwards?  Intel struck back with the Core, Core2, Core I series and reasserted dominance, this is part of a macro-cycle within the industry.  Why did Intel \"lose\" its product lead?  I believe Intel has always played \"smart\" with their dominant position, if they really turned the screws on AMD when dominant and killing them off, then they would face DOJ/FTC investigations on monopoly and antitrust violations. \n\nDid they get complacent? Yes, however considering they are also sitting on 25B of CASH ON HAND, pretty sure they'll be able to regain footing and bounce back. I believe the bigger shift this time around is the rise of ARM with general purpose/low power and ML/AI with high-throughput compute and Intel has been making inroads to both areas.

I work in the tech industry and the entire industry is moving to arm CPU‚Äôs in the next 5-10 years MAX. Intel or AMD isn‚Äôt even in the race for this. Apple was the first big defector and they will have dropped intel across ALL product lines within  two years. This was announced a year ago. Microsoft is working on Windows for ARM, ARM CPU‚Äôs are starting to even move in to the data center and server markets. It won‚Äôt happen overnight but intel and amd without massive MASSIVE changes are dead in the water and pretty soon. Again not overnight but they are SO far behind it‚Äôs not even funny. I held intel for 15 years and I have sold every last share this year. I don‚Äôt see them ever getting back to their former glory.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think this is the case. ARM being easy to license has definitely made it a broadly adopted ISA, however there is so much legacy software designed to run on x86 in the server space that there would need to be a MASSIVE incentive to redeploy it on ARM processors (such as significant performance increases).  Best case scenario is we'll see ARM performance reach parity with x86 offerings.  Often times people say 'ARM is more efficient' but the comparisons usually involve more ARM cores running at lower clock rates than a smaller number of x86 cores running at higher clock rates (which has a huge impact on power draw).  Comparing 2 cores apples to apples, ARM would likely have a slight efficiency advantage, however I speculate it would not be enough to warrant significant software rewrites.  Beyond that, with nVidia purchasing ARM (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles) the open licensing model is less certain moving forward, further reducing incentive to rewrite existing code for ARM.\n\nIntel is not 'so far behind' either.  Until this month, they held the crown for the processor with the fastest single core performance (only now being usurped by AMD's latest offering).  If you look at their current process node vs Samsung or TSMC's latest under a microscope, they are only about a half node larger.  Unfortunately for Intel, losing the process lead was a huge blow, but I wouldn't expect them to sit idle and let that lead stay unchallenged.  I'd like to see some leadership changes, though.\n\nAs far as Microsoft and Apple are concerned, Microsoft having Windows running on ARM isn't a good indicator, either.  They've had various versions running on ARM since Windows NT.   Apple is a special circumstance, in that they operate as vertically as possible, and were able to license the ARM instruction set to design their own CPUs to tightly couple with their own code, so to them this was an incentive to rewrite their code for ARM.  The same arrangement was not possible with x86.  A vast majority of the other software companies aren't rolling their own silicon, so the incentive to rewrite for ARM doesn't make sense unless someone creates an ARM chip that vastly outperforms x86.  Amazon currently is the only company that has an ARM offering that is even close to competing with AMD and intel server chips with their Graviton 2 instances, and its a mixed bag (and AMD especially hasn't been sitting still with increasing performance of their x86 based offerings).  \nEDIT:  for reference, most common cloud workloads that aren't pure benchmarks run about %40 slower core for core on Graviton 2 instances vs the intel/AMD cloud offerings.\n\nLASTLY, to put a cherry on it, I'm pretty sure both AMD and Intel have licenses to the ARM architecture, if for some wild reason I'm wrong and ARM does dominate the server space in 15 years...well AMD and intel can roll ARM designs.  I doubt that will be the case though, and think other developments in areas such as machine learning will overshadow what's going on in the general purpose CPU space 15 years from now...", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You are missing a big part of the picture I would argue. #1 arm wins hands down at performance per watt. It uses so much less power it‚Äôs not even funny. Therefore even with more total CPU‚Äôs needed your total cost Is much much lower. This is something we talk about all the time with designing data centers.\n\n#2 I would take intel quite a lot to start making arm CPU‚Äôs, nothing that could happen overnight keeping them further and further behind.\n\nBut that‚Äôs why I said 5-10 years.

I am still skeptical ARM will displace x86, though (the cost of efficiency is absolute performance, which is still a very important thing in many workloads).

The app, which has a 4.9 rating in **Apple**'s App Store, uses advanced algorithms and automation to enable people \"to apply for a mortgage, interact with our team members, upload documents, e-sign documents, receive statements, and complete monthly payments.\" The platform's technology also has a texting feature so people can speak directly with lenders at the company.\n\nRocket has also developed other digital solutions. Amrock, a complementary platform to Rocket Mortgage, provides title insurance services, property valuations, and settlement services through digital appraisal and closing services.\n\n## 2. Results to back it up\n\nRocket argues that its technology has led to the company's huge success in capturing more than 9% of the $2 trillion annual mortgage market. It also says the technology helps its team and clients close loans quicker than the rest of the industry.\n\nIn 2019, Rocket said that on average it completed 6.7 loans per month per team member, compared to the industry average of 2.3, citing data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. This year, Rocket claims this number has now grown to 8.3 loans per month. Most loans originated at Rocket close in 32 days or fewer from when the company receives mortgage documents from a client, a number that beats the 43-day industry average, the company claims.\n\n## 3. A large tech team\n\nRocket employs a 2,500-person technology team that focuses on advanced algorithms, analytics and automation, and technology that can be integrated by partners outside the company. The company said it also has developed special tech teams to come up with new ideas and make the mortgage process more efficient. Rocket's Quicken Loans recently enjoyed a five-year stretch as¬†*Computerworld* magazine's \"Best Place to Work in IT\" among companies with 5,000-plus employees.\n\n## 4. Leveraging data\n\nAlgorithms are powered by data, and Rocket has loads of it. In 2019, the company had communications with more than 20 million potential clients. Using its technology and marketing specializations, the company said it has improved its conversion of client leads to closed loans, enabling Rocket to grow home loans without increasing client leads at the same rate. Rocket also does mortgage servicing for more than 1.8 million homeowners, and has access to 220 million unique consumer records and 150 million unique real estate records.\n\n\"Our technology and data science teams are proficient in leveraging this rich data to streamline the client experience, to improve the efficacy of our marketing campaigns, and to offer products and services suited to each client's specific circumstance,\" Rocket said in its prospectus.\n\n## 5. Applying tech in other loan segments\n\nWhile home loans are by far its biggest product, Rocket has also created technology platforms for other promising loan segments. Rocket Loans, the company's personal loan platform, uses analytics and algorithms to approve borrowers quickly, and plans to license the platform to other vendors. Rocket Homes, a website that helps potential borrowers search for homes and connect with real estate agents, received more than 180,000 unique visits per month in 2019, and \"is poised to disrupt the U.S. real estate point of sale market.\"\n\n## 6. Investing in and buying tech companies\n\nRocket previously invested in Lendesk and Edison, two mortgage start-ups that are helping to digitize the mortgage lending process in Canada, which the company says is not as far along with digital mortgages as the U.S. Gilbert told CNBC that the company's expertise in digitizing the mortgage process makes it an attractive place for other companies to land. \"We figure that with the public stock, if we go out and acquire some businesses, we can help them really achieve things, because the mortgage was the hardest,\" he said.¬†", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Or none at all and play the rebound until after the correction.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "With predictive insights like that, why aren't you a billionaire?", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "because boats and hoes are expensive.", "score": 37, "replies": []}, {"body": "Capital protection.

{"title": "PMCC Strategy", "selftext": "Hey gang, this is my first post and I wanted to share my PMCC strategy that I've been doing for the last few months. I wrote it like a guide so it may read a little weird. There's also probably a million of these post but I'd like to get some opinions:\n\n  \n\n**Trading Plan - Synthetic Covered Call** \n\nThis is a monthly income strategy that attempts to minimize risk at the cost of capping upside gains. The basic idea is to purchase a deep ITM call with an expiration date of a year or more and then sell monthly or weekly calls against it, this is known as a synthetic covered call or the poor man‚Äôs covered call.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Less capital required than a traditional covered call strategy.\n\n\\- Risk is capped to the cost of the deep ITM long call.\n\n\\- The short leg of the trade is covered by the ITM long call should the underlying move drastically higher.\n\n\\- The cost basis of the long call is reduced over time until both legs need to be closed or the long call either expires worthless or gets sold for a profit at expiration.\n\n\\- If you can hold on to the long call until expiration and it has been over a year it will be viewed as a long-term capital gain.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- If the underlying moves down and stays down it can be difficult to sell calls against it and may end in a loss if there is a rally after selling a call below your break-even strike.\n\n\\- The short legs need to be managed, this is not a set it and forget it strategy like buying stock and holding.\n\n\\- Premium earned on your short calls that are sold on a weekly or monthly basis will be considered short-term capital gains.\n\n**Assumptions and Variables:**\n\n\\- I am trying to find underlying equities that are high value growth stocks (to me) that I believe will be at or above the break-even price of the long call at expiration. \n\n\\- The preferable monthly return on short calls are greater than 5% of the cost of the long call. \n\n\\- The price of the deep ITM long call is less than around $5,000.\n\n\\- I will only be allocating approximately 50%-60% of my account to this strategy, leaving 30% cash and 10%-20% for other strategies and hedging.\n\n**The Greeks:**\n\nTheta \\- There's no real risk here, you are using it to your advantage with this strategy. The only downside of PMCC vs traditional is that there is some small theta on the long call, but usually when you are talking LEAPs that's not much of an issue and should be offset greatly by the short calls. There could be some risk of theta decay if you are close to the strike price near expiration but hopefully you have taken some action by then or made your cost basis in short calls.\n\nVega \\- IV risk is real when a stock has a large run up (like TSLA, AAPL) and the LEAPs price in that continued movement for years to come. Many bullish stocks have a short term run up and then base for a long time before their next move. The whole time it is basing (can be years) the IV drops and you are losing money on your call even though the underlying price is stagnant. Again, it should be offset by the short calls, but it is worth noting when choosing which underlying to use this strategy on.\n\nCredit for this section goes to u/drewdawg101\n\n**Strategy Breakdown:**\n\n1. Purchase a deep ITM call around an .80 delta with an expiration date of 365 days or greater.\n\nThe strike price of the call plus the cost of the option is the cost basis of 100 shares should you need to exercise for whatever reason.\n\nExample:\n\nI purchased 1 x AAPL call expiring 21 Jan 22 with a strike price of $75 for $37.85 ($3785), my cost basis on 100 shares is $75 + $37.85 = $112.85. This should also be your break-even price.\n\n2. Sell a covered call on either a weekly or monthly basis to collect enough premium that will give you approximately 5%-10% return on your investment (sometimes more, sometimes less). The strike price of the covered call you sell should be above the break-even price of the ITM call you purchased; in this instance I am looking at a strike price of above $112.85. There are two other variables that I consider: probability of touch and delta.\n\nAfter making sure my strike is above my cost basis, I like probably of touch to be less than 50% and delta to be around .30 to .20 because I do not want to have to close out my short call for a loss and I do not want to sell my long call.\n\n3. Keep a log of the premiums that you have earned each month and subtract it from the cost of your long call to recalculate the true cost basis and new break-even price of your shares.\n\n**Possible outcomes and adjustments:**\n\nAll the options listed below are on the table for me in this strategy and will be dependent on market conditions and what the underlying is doing.\n\n\\- The underlying increases past your strike price of your short call.\n\nOption 1: Close both legs for a gain, purchase another long call and start again.\n\nOption 2: Roll the short call out for a credit.\n\nOption 3: Close the short leg for a loss and sell another at a higher strike price and later expiration (this may be preferable if you are worried about short-term capital gains).\n\nOption 4: Roll the long call up to receive more credit while rolling the short call up to keep max profit at or above the original amount (this can reset your long-term capital gains timer) ‚Äì Credit to u/Oh-I-Misunderstood\n\n\\- The underlying decreases but you can still sell calls at a strike higher than your cost basis:\n\nOption 1: Do nothing and let the short leg expire worthless then sell another call.\n\nOption 2: Roll down for a bigger credit.\n\n\\- The underlying decreases and you cannot sell calls at a strike price above your cost basis:\n\nOption 1: Determine a stop loss that you are comfortable with on the Deep ITM call. If you have an open contract on the short side, you will have to consider both contracts at the same time. If you close out the long leg because it is down without closing out the short you can be stuck with a naked call and may end up with big losses if the stock rallies. Credit to u/drewdawg101\n\nOption 2: Let your current short call expire worthless and sell another call, if the underlying rallies and goes past the strike of your short call you may have to close out both for a small loss or buy back the short call for a loss.\n\nOption 3: Do nothing and wait for the underlying to rally to a price where you can sell calls at a preferable strike.\n\nOption 4: Buy the dip, sell calls against your new long call further reducing your cost basis of both contracts while reaping the benefits of the inevitable rally.\n\n**Current holdings and returns:**\n\nFor the month of October, I started this strategy with the following AAPL and QQQ contracts:\n\n21 Jan 22 AAPL $75 Call for $37.85\n\n17 Sep 21 QQQ $210 Call for $74.60\n\nTotal Invested - $11,245 (Max loss)\n\nPremium Earned - $968 for an 8.6% return (this is locked in now and not potential returns at the end of the month of October)\n\nUpdated Cost Basis ‚Äì AAPL $105.64, QQQ $281.63\n\nCurrent value of long contracts: AAPL $43.675 (+$582.30), QQQ $82.43 (+$782.30)\n\nFor the month of November, I have added SPCE, GME, and ROKU so along with my QQQ and AAPL I have a potential gain of $1564 for the month (although I have not sold a call against AAPL yet for November). This should give me about a 7.5% return as it stands on a $20,980 investment.\n\nUltimately, if you do nothing else but sell calls until expiration of your long contracts you should own them for much less and you should be able to sell them for a nice profit. I also plan to compound my returns by using the premium I have earned to purchase more contracts.\n\n**Future plans for this strategy:**\n\nAdditional contracts I plan on adding are 3 more contracts of SPCE, 3 more contracts of GME, DIA, LOW, WMT, NIO, DOW, AMD, and DD with plans to earn about $3,046 a month. This should allow for an additional 1 or 2 contracts a month to start compounding returns. I may wait on the more expensive contracts like DIA and LOW until I have more capital so I can have about 30% allocated to cash for other strategies, and keep each trade allocation to less than 10% (my ideal trade allocation is 1%-5%).\n\nAnother option for this strategy is to buy 2 long contracts but only sell 1 call on each equity, this way you can capitalize on any upside gains but still reduce your cost basis over time. This does however double your capital requirement and increases your exposure.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not a professional trader or financial advisor; I am sharing this for you guys to either learn something from it or poke holes in the plan. The stocks I have chosen are stocks that I like to trade, and I am not endorsing any equities whatsoever. Also, trading options is risky, please only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nTL:DR ‚Äì Buy LEAPS, sell monthly calls\n\n\nIf there's any interest in this I'll post an update monthly on how the strategy is doing.\n\nEdited for clarity and additions to the strategy.", "id": "jhmpyr", "created_utc": 1603597017.0, "score": 286, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 177, "comments": [{"body": "Cost basis is irrelevant to the PMCC. I'm surprised no one else has brought this up yet, so let me know if I'm missing something obvious, but I'll explain my reasoning.\n\nIn the example given, the cost basis is used to determine the minimum strike price of the short call.\n\n> I purchased 1 x AAPL call expiring 21 Jan 22 with a strike price of $75 for $37.85 ($3785), my cost basis on 100 shares is $75 + $37.85 = $112.85. This should also be your break-even price. \n\nAs far as I can tell, the rationale behind calculating cost basis is that if the short call expires ITM and both options are executed, the profit generated from buying 100 shares at $75 and selling at $112.85 will cover the premium paid for the long call. The flaw in this reasoning is that there's never a circumstance in which you would you choose to let your short call expire ITM and execute your long call. As the post itself says, it would be preferable to either close out both legs for a profit or to roll out/up the short call. There's almost never a time you would choose to execute your long call using the PMCC.\n\nSo why include cost-basis as a factor in determining the strike price of the short call? Unless you plan on executing your long call, your cost basis does not factor into the profitability of the trade, and there's no need to avoid selling strikes below the break-even price. The whole concept of a break-even price doesn't even make sense in the context of the PMCC, since your profit will never be determined by 100 \\* (high\\_strike - low\\_strike), unless you plan on executing your long call (which you shouldn't). \n\nThe only time break-even price applies to the PMCC is early assignment, but if that's what OP was talking about, the post didn't make that very clear. And if the price of the underlying falls considerably, I don't think it's worth it to continue to sell calls above the break-even price, for next to no premium, for the sole purpose of protecting yourself from early assignment.\n\nSince we aren't executing our calls, there's no reason to stop selling calls below the break-even price. We can continue to roll them up/out if they expire ITM, exactly the same as if the strike price was above the break-even price. Note that it's the short option's delta, not its strike price relative to the break-even price, that will determine profitability.\n\nI'll take a contrived example to show that the concept of a break-even strike price is confused. Since we determined that the AAPL break-even price was $112.85, let's say we sell an ITM call at $105 for some reason. If AAPL goes sideways or declines, this trade will be profitable and we will buy back the short call for less than what we originally received for it. If AAPL goes up, this trade will \\*still\\* be profitable until the delta of the short call outpaces the long call, due to the gamma of the short call (which has nothing to do with it being above or below the break-even price). You would obviously capture the profits in this case by closing both legs of the PMCC, rather than by letting the short call expire ITM, so I'm failing to see how selling a call below $112.85 caused us to lose money.\n\nLet's talk about the scenario where:\n\n>  The underlying decreases and you cannot sell calls at a strike price above your cost basis: \n\nYou point out that:\n\n> Option 2: Let your current short call expire worthless and sell another call, **if the underlying rallies and goes past the strike of your short call you may have to close out both for a small loss** or buy back the short call for a loss. \n\nI think this part is supposed to be the drawback to selling calls beneath the break-even price. Basically, I think you're saying that if AAPL tanks, and you sell a call below the break-even price, and then AAPL recovers, you would be better off having not sold the call, because now your long call has returned to its original value while you're down the value of the short call.  But this is true any time the underlying rises! If AAPL moons, you will **always** have been better off having not sold the short call. Sure, AAPL, could return to its original price, but it could just as likely go sideways or drop even further, and choosing not to sell calls lower than a certain threshold will result in lost profit. It's important to note that you will never be forced to liquidate the position, and can always continue to roll the call up and out, regardless of whether the strike price is above or below the threshold.\n\nTL/DR: Cost basis and a break-even strike price doesn't make sense except for the case of early assignment. Once we own the long call, we should forget what we paid for it lest we fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. When we find ourselves in possession of a LEAP, we should sell calls at what we consider to be the most profitable frequency and delta, regardless of what we paid for it, because we will never be forced to liquidate the position. IMO this will result in both a simpler strategy and a more profitable PMCC.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "Great topic- I have just started using the PMCC.\n\nQuestion: Does anyone have criteria for closing the position?

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a right answer - choosing when to close a position depends on what you‚Äôre trying to get out of the position. Are you happy with making 20% or do you want to hold out for 200%? Are you willing to cut your losses in a losing position and redeploy the capital elsewhere, or would you rather hang on and hope for a turnaround? Each decision has different implications on risk/reward, and I doubt it makes too much of a difference in the long run. \n\nIt‚Äôs really up to you. And I don‚Äôt think most people have a formula or strict criteria they follow, but idk. It depends so much on what you think the stock will do in the near term.\n\nPersonally, I don‚Äôt really have criteria, I just play it by ear. When I first started, I insisted on rolling everything out because I wanted to hold onto my LEAP forever. I was in the mindset that I didn‚Äôt want to sell my LEAP because I was really bullish on the underlying stock.\n\nBut if I were to use the PMCC again, I‚Äôd probably sell my LEAP and buy back the short call if the short call‚Äôs strike was breached\n\nIf you‚Äôre like me, and you don‚Äôt want to sell your LEAP because you think the underlying is gonna do great in the long term, PMCC probably isn‚Äôt the correct strategy to use\n\nImo, if you don‚Äôt want to sell your LEAP and would rather just roll out the short call because you think there will be more upside in the future, you probably shouldn‚Äôt sell the short call at all, just buy and hold the LEAP. When the strike price of your short call is breached, there‚Äôs really nothing you can do at that point because you already made the decision to lower your upside potential when you sold the short call, if that makes sense. Like you‚Äôre in the max-profit scenario of the position you set up, so I don‚Äôt see the point in rolling out the short call. It‚Äôd be better to just close everything out and start a new position (i.e. roll short call up/out and roll up long call).\n\nI came to the realization that PMCC is fundamentally a trade-off between upside profits and consistent but small gains.

The theta is only there as a backup plan incase the underlying goes sideways or down. \n\nBut people seem to be rooting for their calls to expire OTM, just so they can hold on to their long call and profit off of theta only.

Max profit is not the ideal scenario in this case because then you have to manage the position in some way (or you will be assigned). Stock XYZ can still go up but not breach the short call strike. In this scenario, you make a profit both from the delta on your long call as well as the theta on the short call. The ideal scenario you didn‚Äôt mention is the stock price rising to just below the short strike, but then theta decay takes over. You get 100% of the gains on your long call and you keep the premium collected on the short call. Then you run it again. (As a side note, it‚Äôs probably best to buy back the short call when the debit is 50% of the original credit you received. I use a delta of 30 at about 30-45 days out for the short call and a delta of about 80 for a long call about 1 year out. With this set up you hit it right when theta decay starts ramping up).\n\nYour point about the losses from the short call outweighing the gains from the long call is not quite right. What I meant is if the short call strike is breached, the stock price likely rose sharply. I would roll up in strike and out in time to 1) collect more premium, 2) hedge against price correction (in your case of owning the stock then you would be losing here), 3) consider rolling down again for more premium if the stock corrects enough or 4) just close the short position and wait for another rally when you can sell a new short call for more premium. \n\nTo clarify, when I have been doing PMCCs, sometimes they are really just a LEAPS that I am waiting on to rebound before putting on the other leg (short call).

That‚Äôs the best possible outcome of the PMCC. When you execute your long call, you‚Äôre throwing away all the extrinsic value of your long call. \n\nThe whole point of my original comment was trying to stress that we don‚Äôt *need* to set up the strikes so that its profitable if we execute. Because that‚Äôs just a misunderstanding of the strategy! It‚Äôs just not the right frame of analysis. You need to shift your focus away from the strike prices to think about the options only in terms of their greeks.\n\nHere‚Äôs another contrived example, based on real numbers. We start up the PMCC on JWN, which is hovering around $13. We buy a $7.5 LEAP with delta 0.8 and sell a $14 call with delta 0.3.\n\n\nJWN goes up from $13->14. Our long call grew in value by $80, and our short call by $30, so we‚Äôre up $50 overall. The long call‚Äôs new delta is 0.85, and the short call‚Äôs is 0.5 (since it is now ATM).\n\nJWN goes up $14->$15. Our long call makes $85, but the short call puts us down $50, so our net is $35.\n\nJWN now goes sideways until the short call expires. Let‚Äôs assess our situation. Our short call is $1 ITM. Do we execute both contracts? Well we made $50 + $35 when JWN went from 13->14->15, so if we were buy back the short call and sell the long call, we‚Äôd be up $85. In fact, it would be more since the short call will have decreased in value due to theta decay. Since we sized our deltas appropriately, we *know* that it‚Äôs going to be profitable to buy back the short call and sell the long call.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at taking assignment and executing the LEAP. This outcome will yield the same return whether the short call is at $14.01 or $15. We‚Äôd be throwing away the $35 we made when JWN went from $14->$15, not to mention we‚Äôd be throwing away the extrinsic value of the LEAP which in this case would be around $200 give or take. It will almost always be more profitable to simply buy to close the short call rather than taking assignment. \n\nIn this specific example, the long call would have cost around $750. At the time, the intrinsic value of the call was (13-7.5) = $550, so notice we‚Äôre paying $200 of extrinsic value, which is thrown away as soon as we execute. We‚Äôd get $50 back from the short call if we sold two weeks out, so our ‚Äúcost basis‚Äù would be $700. Executing the long and short calls would net us (14-7.5) = $650, which would not even cover the cost of the LEAP, and would result in a $50 loss. \n\nThis does NOT mean that we should‚Äôve factored cost basis into our initial position and only sold calls above the $14.50 strike. It only means that executing your long call is extremely stupid - it‚Äôs more profitable to liquidate the position, regardless of your cost basis or distance between the strikes. Don‚Äôt execute your long call, you‚Äôre throwing away the extrinsic value that you *just* paid for out of pocket. \n\nThe situation gets more complicated when your short call gets deep ITM and outpaces your long call, but take my word for it, the same principle applies. You would still not look to take assignment in that case, when you can A) roll out the short call, and/or B) roll up your long call, if we‚Äôre talking *deep* ITM.\n\nEdit:\nI should have read your comments in the other thread first, because I think you‚Äôre already in agreement with everything I just said.
