One of the products they offer to merchants is as a credit card processor. Many, many, many companies use that division at Chase to handle their credit card swipes.

Then Chase Merchant Services sends the money from all the transactions back to Square and Square distributes the funds to its merchants. Square is technically the merchant or record with Chase Merchant Services. \nChase in the past really only wanted to deal with very large merchants, so Square aggregated thousands of other merchants to basically become one very large one in Chase's view.

And once the purchase is approved, how do you actually get your money? I mean, who actually pays you, every single bank that every customer uses? What if the customer does a chargeback or disputes the charge? How will you handle refunds?\n\nThat‚Äôs what a merchant card processor is for. They build the hardware to read the cards. They write the software behind that hardware to handle the card swipe, the software that talks to VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and AMEX‚Äôs networks. They handle chargebacks. Their software handles recurring payments. Most importantly, at the end of each month they write you a check for all the charges you made (these days it‚Äôs just a bank deposit, but you get the drift)\n\nSquare built their own hardware, the first big company to make card swipes accessible on every smart phone so any merchant could easily charge credit cards. They wrote smartphone software. They gave millions of free Square hardware out so everyone would use them. But what about the rest of the things a ‚Äúmerchant acquirer‚Äù needs to do? Did they want to try and write software to connect to all the various card networks? Did they want to have to handle all the money and talk to every bank on the planet? There was no time to build all that massive infrastructure, so for backend banking portion of things they made a deal with Chase\n\nEdit - the other comment someone made, explaining how Square aggregates small companies and makes it worth it for a big bank like Chase to work with a million tiny 1-person companies is 100% spot-on", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great explanation.

It is smart for them to re-invest of income as possible (avoid taxation, capitalize on momentum(, but that for unaware eye makes they appear as profitable only due to credit.

Everyone is aware of Tesla getting subsidies, so everyone includes them in earning projections.

That means they have discretion over when they express those earnings.  It *also* means that earnings will reflect the market value of those subsidies, which aren't a reflection of the performance of the underlying business.

Mere fact that Tesla is able to consume those subsidies and other are not (or another perspective, Tesla is selling carbon emission limits others are required to meet, but in more complicated form) **is** in fact result of their business superiority over their competitors. It does not come from products and services, so it is less intuitive, but it does come from their ability to move in market faster than their competition. Subsidies says \"those who can develop fastest in this direction gets this money\", ale Tesla, by consuming them, shows that they are developing faster than competition. And that comes from their \"underlying business\".\n\n> If they did that, their current valuation would be fucked all to Hell and the stock would crash.\n\nYear ago - yes, stock would crash to the ground, no doubt here. But this year and forward, it would \"just\" result in significant pullback. Tesla is no longer in constant danger of disappearing if not subsided, and investors are slowly realizing that. I think we can slowly start calling Tesla \"stable\" company without risking being laughed on (valuation is another story though).\n\nOverall, it just got less risky as investment. Before, Tesla was in risk of: going bankrupt if not subsided, being overtaken by competition, taking wrong business decisions and be ran to the ground by management. In my judgement, this year they erased first risk completely (they are sitting at a lot of cash and can be profitable without credit if required), their superiority in consumption of subsidies somehow implies that they are in better place than competition (this risk is lessened), and fact that first risk was eliminated implies that business decisions are so far sane and correct (this risk is also lessened).

Also this may cause the stimulus to be pushed back even further if everyone is too busy arguing over who won the election.\n\nIf Trump wins however I suspect market will go up. Even though DOJ is suing Google over anti-trust under Trump (I suspect the DOJ would stick to this even if Biden were to become President and new Attorney General), the Republican Congress is not as aggressive towards regulating big tech (they only seem to care about perceived anti conservative bias in the algorithms and mods) and don't seem to be in favor of breaking up big tech.\n\nSome leftists/young people will get mad and protest/maybe some riots here and there for a little bit.
