The point is that with a normal big TV antenna you have to mechanically point it towards your target to receive a signal. You can see in the gif that the direction of the signal changes depending on how the phase between the smaller antennas are offset. \n\nThis phase offset you can easily do electronically so it can be changed hundred or millions of times per second to point the antenna exactly where you want it without having any actual mechanical movement. \n\nThe reason you need this is because regular TV satellites are up in geostationary orbit and don't move relative to the Earth, they're always in the exact same spot on the sky. You just point your antenna exactly at it, and bom you're done. Starlink satellites will be flying in a 300 km orbit and zooming around Earth every 90-ish minutes.

{"title": "$$$ 2.3M BET - Big Dick Energy", "selftext": "Alright Smooth brained hedge fund manager wannabes. Many of you followed the purple DD and made money, some of you bought at the top and lost money, some of you just watched from the sidelines and some of you did nothing. Some of you touched yourself on earnings day as you scrolled through the loss porn. For those that want to follow my next play, see below. u/lurkingsince2006 told me about PSTH and I've had a Bill Ackman Chub all week. Bill Ackman has given me Big Dick Energy and I hope you all can join me in this feeling.\n\nI have slowly started exiting my purple position and investing into PSTH - I got pre-approval from MODS to post this because SPACS are not a typical stock and they come with some unusual terms. I believe PSTH to be one of the best bets available in the market right now due to the asymmetrical nature of the structure. I also believe Bill Ackman will land a monster company at a fair valuation. That being said, invest at your own risk and do your own Due diligence.\n\n**MY POSITIONS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2.3M BET](https://preview.redd.it/2g04cuzvc6u51.jpg?width=1214&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e977f7f9e5561c914546c1088855d34b248a49af)\n\n[currently more than half of my account is in PSTH](https://preview.redd.it/wrwzapvmc6u51.jpg?width=1202&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7dddf0f931db6b43e590db0cce164ad2567c165)\n\nWhat is asymmetrical? it's when two things aren't the same on both sides, kinda like your scrotum. For investing asymmetry it means it has a very limited downside and potentially very high upside ; The risk to reward ratio is asymmetrical.This is very important when talking about PSTH as PSTH has raised 4B in capital for the purpose of buying a stake in a private company and taking it public.\n\nPSTH is a SPAC (Special purpose Acquisition Company). SPACs are vehicles that's sole purpose is to bring a private company public. A SPAC starts off as a large trust, basically a giant pool of money. In the Case of PSTH, there are 200,000,000 units - Each unit was available to buy @ 20.00 during the initial filing but they quickly started trading @ a premium of \\~21.50 and have since climbed to 23.70. A unit consists of 1 common share of stock (redeemable for cash) and 3/9 of a warrant. The units have since split into common shares and warrants. During the split, 1/9 warrants were separated and are trading completely independent of the common shares. The remaining 2/9 fractional warrants are tied to the common shares and will be issued once a deal closes. The purpose of this structure is to sweeten the deal for common stock holders that do not redeem their shares for cash and hold through the merger.\n\n  Right now, the commons are trading at a 18% premium to Net Asset Value, meaning for every 23.70 common share there is 20 dollars of equity in a trust. Pre-Merger, this relationship determines the maximum downside as you will be given the option to redeem your shares for cash or proceed with a merger. As it currently stands, your maximum downside is \\~ 3.70 for every common share. This represent a maximum downside of \\~16%. Post Merger, the market decides the price.\n\n**TONTINE STRUCTURE**\n\nThis SPAC is different than most SPACS because it has a tontine structure, which awards those that hold through merger but re-allocating warrants for the shares that were redeemed. I.E. if half the shares are redeemed you will actually receive twice that amount of warrants as a reward for not pulling out (insert mom joke).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What Targets are possible?**\n\nAckman is likely going to take a 15-20% stake in the company he merges with. That means that the target is likely going to have a valuation in the 30-40B range. Some companies that come to mind and have been referenced are:\n\n* Stripe\n* Airbnb\n* Menards\n* Subway\n* Epic Games\n* Robinhood\n* ETC.\n\nThere has been some posts, one by u/infamousebreadfruit99 that I actually believe might be an accurate theory. If stripe is the target, that would be epic. That being said, nothing is official so this is a hype play.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jat364/final\\_post\\_on\\_psth\\_allin\\_yolo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jat364/final_post_on_psth_allin_yolo/)\n\n**What is the PLAY?**\n\nNow- What is the best way to play this - There are a handful. I for one am buying commons only because each common comes with 2/9 of a warrant. For those of you that are gamblers you can buy march 22.50 calls. I do not recommend buying warrants just because warrants become worthless if a deal fails to occur, whereas common shares are still redeemable for cash and you will still have long dated warrants. I personally believe if you want to play options that you should buy options that have intrinsic value with a strike lower than NAV. If I were buying options, which I'm not, I would buy 15.00 strikes with March or later expiration.\n\nI for one will likely wait for the initial pop and cut my position in half. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Buy Commons as they come with warrants that are long dated call options. This is my preference.\n* Sell puts 22.50 or 20.00 strikes - this is small potato gains.\n* Buy ITM calls, 15.00 strike. If I were doing a strictly options play, this would be it.\n* For big ballers, buy OTM calls but for December or later, March or June is better but I don't think this is the best play. I still believe commons are the best play.\n* For real big ballers, buy only warrants. I think this might be a good play, only if a deal goes through. Warrants have a strike of 23.00 and can be called in the low 30's. I will not be doing this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you all well. God speed.

I have 45 contracts and 1100 common shares. I'll do a brief rundown:\n\nThey have a floor price of $20 for commons since you can redeem your shares for $20 any time before a merger is complete. So after they announce the target, if the target / valuation is extremely unpopular, the floor price for the shares are still $20 since your shares are backed by actual cash (PSTH holds them in treasuries). However - after the merger is approved by shareholders, then there will no longer be a price floor.\n\nWarrants are **extremely dangerous - because warrants have no price floor**. If a merger fails to happen (possible with an SPAC, especially since PSTH is the most well funded SPAC of all time), then warrants will become worthless. Warrants can be redeemed for a share at a strike of $23 - so this does induce some minor share dilution. Deadline for finalizing a merger is 2022-07-22. Ackman is in no rush to jump into a merger since he wants a quality company at a reasonable valuation. He's targeting a family run business or mature unicorn that is already profitable or very close to profitability. \n\nIf you want leverage, go with **ITM options, ideally at a strike of $20 or less**. Long dated (December at earliest) is ideal since Ackman is in no rush. If you want to reduce your cost basis, selling covered calls on your common shares is a great way to reduce cost basis while allowing other degenerate gamblers to buy your options.\n\nSPACs have a bad rap because of founder's shares - basically the SPAC sponsor company gets a portion (up to 20%) of the company for bringing the company public. Of course, IPOs have a substantial cost as well, but SPAC founder shares are considered anti retail. However, PSTH is special because they want to do away with this terrible deal for retail. PSTH has no founder's shares, but instead has founder's warrants. He can buy up to 6% of the company using warrants with a strike of $24. However, they do not become active until 3 years after merger, and expire in 10 years after merger. Therefore, Ackman has a vested interest in getting a good company at a fair valuation for investors, since other SPACs are incentivized to close any deal as fast as possible, even at the cost of screwing retail. **This is why PSTH trades at a significant premium to NAV versus other SPACs that don't have a defined merger target**.\n\nPSTH is funded partially by 1 billion dollars from Ackman's own hedge fund, Pershing Square.

He called our attention to Logitech, and he got completely flamed for it with people saying all of their growth was priced-in. After looking at the chart for 30 seconds, you can see that it has done well, but it wasn‚Äôt an insane run-up given the need for home offices to get set-up, people gaming more with better equipment, etc.\n\nWhen I see an idea like this and I don‚Äôt have much time, I set a reasonable position size and go in. I put about 8%-10% of my one account in figuring a good beat would be a boost, and a loss/IV crush would not be devastating. This thing has been bouncing around, but one strike for me was up over 600% at open.

MLHR was another 5-6 bagger for me (thank you to u/jippiidan who WSB also torched and called a pumper). My best trade was a 27 bagger and that was‚Ä¶TSLA‚Ä¶ but I digress. To go back to the Scott Galloway quote at the beginning of the post, yes, there is a lot of money to be made going into these hyper popular tech tickers that are already flying, but you should also look at the DD‚Äôs about companies that are so mind-numbingly boring and ask yourself if there is an opportunity there. In this market, there just might be one.\n\n**One note of caution:** A lot of the boring ones are low liquidity. So, don‚Äôt buy something crazy OTM, and make sure there is some OI.

These are relatively cheaper though because of lower IV usually.\n\n**TLDR:** Buy into boring tickers that you think can surprise everyone.\n\nBoring Positions:\n\n**LOGI** Nov Calls 500-600% up.
