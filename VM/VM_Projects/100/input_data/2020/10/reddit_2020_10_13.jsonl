{"title": "Why I'm Ridiculously Bullish on Palantir ($PLTR)", "selftext": "As somebody who works in an organization that does work incredibly similarly to Palantir (data science, analytics, and management for organizations), I'd like to share my perspective on why I think PLTR is a future 10-bagger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What does Palantir do?\n\nIn a nutshell, what Palantir does is data science, management, and analytics in big data. They started off working with government agencies, while recently expanding to non-governing entities. As a technology, this is invaluable to both organizations and private/public companies. Most every organization collects data (obviously, right?)\n\nOne of the many types of organizations that I've personally worked on are correctional facilities (e.g. - a prison). Prisons collect **fuck loads** of *your information*. For example:\n\n*Demographics & characteristics*: height, eye color, race, age, number of family members, married vs. non married, education level, aliases (names you go by), mental illnesses, current and past places of residences, who you work for, how long you've worked for them, etc.\n\n*Criminal History:*  current and past offenses, where the offense was committed, against whom the offense was committed (and the same above information for the victim), the sentencing judge, how long you were sentenced for, when you are to be released, etc.\n\n*Prison Behavior:*  did you get in trouble in prison, how was it handled, by which CO handled the situation, did you lose credit for good time, take college courses/classes in prison, how much money do you have in the commisary? what do you spend it on?\n\n*Other stuff:*  weather, recent institutional policy/procedure changes, changes in legislation/law, and other random shit that seems unrelated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above examples are only a fraction of the data that say, a prison were to collect from you. Like i said, they collect **fuck loads of data.** They also store fuck loads of data over large periods of time.\n\n# Everyone collects tons of data. So what?\n\nWhile yes, most if not all organizations collect crap loads of data, a lot of times are just for record keeping purposes. A lot of organizations analyse their data, but use sub-standard and less advanced methods across few areas of data because of the limitations of the data: data linkages, definition of a case, unstandard formatting, etc.\n\nMost organizations that collect their data also do a **garbage** job doing it. Sometimes, using conventional techniques on garbage data gets you zero inferential value (i.e. what decisions should be made from the data). I can't tell you how many times i've worked with data that looks like it was done by a boomer who never took a class on BASIC excel. you would think most orgs/companies know how to collect/work with data, but many don't!\n\nMost organizations also dont LINK their data across different areas or within themselves. Different data are usually seperate and independent from each other, and within like data they don't keep track of what record belong together. While it would be helpful to keep all this data in the same place, for organization purposes they keep things seperate - except this also makes it harder to piece them together if they wanted to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Here's where PLTR comes in.\n\nPLTR essentially wants to interconnect **all** the data sources that were collected by an organization, and use big data analytics, machine learning, and algorithms to help drive decisions. By using machine learning and algorithms, you can link together data to >99% accuracy levels.\n\nNow that you've linked data sources and streamlined them across and within each other, you can explore with greater accuracy/clarity/statistical power, questions such as: how has global warming over time affected purchasing behaviors for automobiles.\n\nHowever, with more pieces information across databases, as well as information over time, you now can link different (maybe unrelated, maybe not) pieces of information to that question to account for any spurious (unrelated) correlations (such as, for instance, the majority political party at the time), to be able to say whether or not a correlation is ***causative***\\*.\\* Causative means that we can say, with confidence, one thing affects the outcome of another thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What does this mean?\n\nNow that a company/organization has all of their data sources being constantly linked together (presently and over time), is standardized, an is being programatically driven by machine learning, PLTR's software can say with certainty: \"we know we need to do X thing to produce more tendies,\" or \"we know we need to do X thing to arrest more people,\" or \"we need to do x thing to save more tendies.\"\n\nHaving a resource that simplifies what decisions around profit, efficency, is bullish AF for any company that would choose to use it, and in turn is bullish AF for Palantir. PLTR is going to tap into an un-tapped market that isn't doing this with their data already (so i'm not talking about AAPL, GOOGLE), but the medium sized and smaller sized corporations in the country that are **absolutely not doing this with their data.**\n\nIt also can tap into the tens of thousands of government agencies (state, county, local) that are in my professional experience, are **not doing this with their data.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe market for the technology is huge and are the implications.

{"title": "Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW)", "selftext": "Alright retards and autists,\n\nAs the 5 of you that listened to me last time will know, I am a pilot flying freight for AAWW. \n\nFor the third time I am posting DD as I have done or commented every quarter, and for those of you that have listened, you are probably buying your 3rd or 4th yacht by now. So here I go again:\n\nSo the business model most airlines, passenger airlines, follow is they want you retards to pay for their gas and us retards to fly you etc by buying tickets, and use the business traveler and belly freight to make their razor thin profit margins. Since demand has fallen off a cliff by as much as 90%, and there is an increased demand for freight capacity, the belly freight capacity normally used by the passenger carriers has now gone to the freight carriers, as well as a significant increase in e-commerce. Add to that that Atlas (AAWW) and Kalitta(privately owned) have pretty much been the go to to lead the charge to bring masks and other PPE over from Asia in addition to regular contracts, its provided a large tailwind to the freight/ACMI industry. Freight capacity is currently in such demand that freight prices have increased 10x normal rates. One charter flight of cargo from China through to Cincinnati nets 1.1 million in profit for AAWW, in addition to regular routes for DHL contracts. If you look at Q1 last year where we were at -29 million, which is a historically poor quarter for us with the impacts from chinese new year, and the Q1 swing to +29 million this year, that illustrates some of the impact. Our most profitable quarters are Q3 and Q4, due to increased demand during the peak holiday season and run up to it. Add to this the fact that our inability to staff due to labor issues (which will be resolved this year) is now solved because of thousands of pilots out of work, there is going to be a growth boom. We expect to hire another 1000 to a total of 3000 by end of year 2021, putting us at the same size in terms of pilot group, as UPS. ATSG and more importantly AAWW also have government contracts for the military, DoS, etc that provide other revenue streams. In summation: a pandemic, moms stress shopping on Amazon, and Wars all provide massive tendies for this sector.\n\nThe Play:\n\nAs I have mentioned before in various comment threads, the way to make money on AAWW earnings is to ride the run up wave to the earnings. Despite massive beats, there is maybe a 10% pop on earnings and then a pull back before it starts to push back up again at a nice gingerly pace throughout the ensuing quarter.\n\nEdit: I would also like to add and make the point that WHEN a vaccine is ready, the International Freight Retards Association and World Health Organization estimate that we will need 8000 747s to distribute a vaccine. AAWW has already been tip of the spear for PPE distribution through Project Airbridge and will be tasked with this maximum autism tendy train as well along with Fedex and UPS. \n\nPositions:\n\nAAWW 70C 11/20\nAAWW 75C 11/20\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.\n\nUPDATE:\nJust so you guys see I am not blowing smoke up your asses, found this recent post by \nu/nathanlongho basically saying the same thing about ATSG which is in the same industry. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfr6lw/atsg_gains_incoming/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nHope this gives you guys some reenforced vigor to weather this dip. \n\nGodspeed.
