If i understand correctly both my legs (hehe, not but really, short and long leg) should both gain value as IV shoots up correct?\n\nNo. The long leg gains value, the short leg loses value, so they cancel each other out up to roughly the width of the strikes. Sometimes IV is not distributed evenly across strikes, so you may have a net gain or net loss larger than cancellation would predict.\n\nWhat was IV at entry? You should record that value for both legs, so you can observe yourself how it changes around earnings.
