{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n> “It looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there’s a will to get something done.”\n*****\n> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. “It’s really hard to read,” said Keon.\n*****\n> But he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n> “I actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,” said Keon.“We’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don’t look that bad.”\n*****\n> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n> “Q2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n> “While the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,” they noted.\n*****\n> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there’s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n> “I think from the market’s perspective, it doesn’t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,” said Keon. “I think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”\n*****\n> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n> “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”\n*****\n> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.\n*****\n> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n> “That would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,” said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # News High for Net New Highs\n\n> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Breadth Booming\n\n> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n> October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # JPMorgan Chase & Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase & Co.

At first these cars move relatively quickly to the dealerships, where they sit while the dealership pays the OEMs interest on their loan. Eventually though, the dealer lots get full and then the dealers either refuse to take more cars, or they demand zero interest on the loans until a car they already have sells. So the OEM puts them in a lot somewhere, but they still can't completely cut production, so they continue to borrow money and pass it back and forth with their dealers, to keep the game going, while interest on their loans rack up. \n\nThis is partially why it seems like the dealers have so much leverage with the OEMs...

{"title": "Last night, it really hit me. This is pure gambling.", "selftext": "Last night, I was watching the Rolland Garros semi-finals (Grand Slam tournament - basically 1 of the 4 biggest tennis tournaments every year.)\n\nI love tennis both as a player and spectator, and as I have been rooting for this particular player for many years now, whom yesterday had a real chance of winning and going into the Finals of Rolland Garros for the first time in his career, I thought to myself:\n\n*Why not place a small fun bet to make it all the more exciting*.\n\nI had never betted on sports ever before this, maybe once with $2 as a joke with some friends around 10 years ago or so.\n\nThe player I am supporting starts to lose during the first hour of the match. So I sign up, deposit the minimum $10, and find that the return rate was 4/1 (I.e. $10 gets me $50 if my player wins, $40 profit).\n\nBeing a massive fan of the player, I thought on top of my own excitement for the game, 4/1 odds were fantastic.\n\nI am about to place the bet, but I find that the odds had shifted to 3/1 as my player had started earnings some points back.\n\nThen to 10/3, then 3/1 again.\n\nI found myself in a disgusting mindset hoping my player would lose a few points so that I can get in on the 4/1 odds, which I thought were great odds. **I had never, ever wished for this player to lose a point before**. This shook me quite a bit.\n\nAnd it happens! I quickly place my bet, **and I realise I had just bought the dip on a fucking tennis match.**\n\nThe match resumes and my player keeps losing. I refuse to believe this will happen as like I mentioned previously, I am a massive fan, believe in him, and want him to succeed.\n\nThe match reaches a point where my player is nearly defeated, at which point I go back and look at the odds.\n\nI see now the new revised odds at 7/1, then one more point is lost and I it goes to 8/1!\n\nOn the rush of adrenaline from the match and from my desire for my player to win, I deposit another $10 and place another bet at $10, with a profit of $80 if my player wins.\n\nIn the moment I realise **I just doubled down on a tennis dip, and I have a position of $20 with a potential profit of $120.**\n\nA few points later and a lot of adrenaline, and it happens. I am thrilled.\n\nMy player makes a comeback, FUCK YEEAH, I scream!\n\nHe gets back in the game and for the next hour or so ups his game significantly, just as I had hoped. **The match is a complete thriller filled with adrenaline and unbelievable tennis**. I am loving it.\n\nI am so happy for him and at the same time, **I am thinking about my tennis tendies.**\n\nThe game reaches a point from near defeat, to perfect equilibrium in score from the two players.\n\nI log back in to the betting platform to look at how the odds are fairing now.\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made early in the game was now worth **$17.40**\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made later in the game was now worth **$31.31**\n\nI now had the option to cash out nearly at 150% return, get out and enjoy the game and root for my player, **or diamond hand this bitch and root for my player still**.\n\nI choose the latter as the $20 was insignificant to me, and think to my learnings that **I will pass the fuck out before I tap out.**\n\nA few exhilarating points ensue, but it turns out my player had become exhausted. The rest of the game progresses and it's clear that he will lose. He cannot keep up the brilliant come back that had taken place thus far.\n\nI go back into the betting platform and noticed that:\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made early in the game was now worth **$0.35**\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made later in the game was now worth **$0.14**\n\nNot only was my favourite player about to lose, but **my contracts would expire worthless.**\n\nAnd lose he did.\n\nIt was an incredible match and he won the hearts of many fans that night. He is an unbelievable player with so much promise as he is still very young.\n\nThe tennis they played was just fantastic.\n\n\\---\n\nThe whole experience left me thinking to myself that the emotions, the mechanics, the complete and utter unpredictability where identical with options trading.\n\nIt was then that it **really** hit me that the term \"investing\", or \"trading\" platforms is the fakest front for what is actually absolute gambling.\n\n I can't help but feel a bit dirty that I took something I am passionate for, something I've kept pure for so many years, a pure love for the sport and put inside emotions and mechanics of greed and opportunism. That's the definition of the ugly side of capitalism and I got the taste of it first hand last night.\n\nI have deleted my betting account and will never engage in sports betting again after this. **The rooting and cheering I had for this player in previous matches VS this one felt self-less and pure, whereas last night I found myself rooting on the fact that I'd make money. This left me feeling pretty shitty with myself.**\n\nI thought I would share this story with all of you retards, hoping that you will learn something and relate on a level which will benefit you in life.\n\n\\---\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n1) Some things are best kept pure and outside the scope of making money.\n\n2) Options are not financial derivatives, they are **gambling** derivatives.\n\n3) Gambling can exist in every single aspect of life, and it can really consume you and your passions.\n\n4) TIM APPLE 122C 11/20, LET'S FUCKING GO YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKS.", "id": "j8i19r", "created_utc": 1602324604.0, "score": 10182, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 709, "comments": [{"body": "The first rule of WSB - admitting you’re just a degen gambler. \nThe second rule - Ignoring all the naysayers and yoloing till Valhalla", "score": 732, "replies": [{"body": "*VALEhalla", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "listened to the vale guy and my sep calls expired worthless. have one for january im still keeping. lets get this diamond hand or that post's OP is gonna get a stern downvote from me", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Heavy bags?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "5% of portfolio. not much risk, Im trying to do educated risks with no yoloing singles more than 5%. but keep loosing 5% stacks up you feel me?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Jan 22 awaits.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You cant be a degen gambler with 10 bucks wtf is this", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If $10 is more than 50% of your net worth, then its degen", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "My net worth is negative quarter million due to debt but my income is high.

Been doing it for decades.\n\nUsed to be I'd just buy something because it was cheap and didn't run, figured if I couldn't get it going I could still part it out. It was hit-or-miss and I didn't worry about the profit much because I enjoy fixing motors.\n\nNow it's like options/stocks. I still enjoy the wrench-turning bit, but before I buy something I'll jump on eBay and see what used/new parts are going for depending on what I think might be wrong with it. That way I can hedge against taking an L or coming out breakeven.\n\nExample 1:\n\nLast year I bought a used Stihl BR350 backpack blower. Retails new for $360. Bought it for $20. It wasn't seized, but the end tubes were missing, the straps were dry rotted, and the coil wire was cut. Ended up buying an aftermarket carb with plug, filter, and fuel lines for $30, ignition coil for around $30, and the middle tube and end tube $50 for both, and new straps for $20. Total cash investment $150, time invested around 4 hours between sourcing parts and turning wrenches.\n\nBeing used I can only retail it about $150, realistically. It's breakeven cash-wise but if it weren't for the fact that I enjoy working on stuff I would be upside down on it due to time factor.\n\nIf I did my DD I would have known this.\n\nBut... when I bought it I wasn't trading options yet.\n\nExample 2:\n\nA few months ago I had a chance to buy up a used Stihl FS120 brush cutter for $40. They retail new (when you can find them) for about $300.\n\nIt didn't run but it wasn't seized. Plug was rusted and burnt, primer bulb rotted, fuel lines screwed. Gas tank smelled like varnish. Head was missing the spool. Otherwise in fair cosmetic condition.\n\nDid my DD this time. A new aftermarket carb with included fuel lines, filter, plug, and bulb was about $25. A new aftermarket trimmer head was $20. That meant for $85 for the unit and parts, there was a very good chance that I could have a running Stihl brushcutter. Figured time turning wrenches at maybe 2 hours.\n\nSo I bought it and fixed it. It runs good now.\n\nI can expect to retail it used for around $150, the same as the BR350 blower, but this time with a potential profit of $65.\n\nThat's over 70% estimated profit on something I enjoy doing.\n\nIf the numbers hadn't been profitable this time I wouldn't have bought the thing. Not even for $40. Could risk parting it out on eBay but the parts market is hit or miss and I don't want to clog the shelves in my shop with too much unsold inventory.\n\nThe difference in the decision-making process, and also in the profit?\n\n\\--> I been trading options for most of a year now.\n\nLost some, won some, but learned how to gauge risk better. Still learning, too.\n\nAnd the risk management strategies apply to any aspect of life involving money.\n\nEdit to add: If I could find deals on non-working equipment like that every day, I would say fuck your stock market bruh and go full retard on wrench turning.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Over half of this was opinion, personal bias and not fact. \n\nLife insurance/health insurance is “gambling” when viewed from certain perspectives.. do you feel ugly and morally bankrupt for betting on or against your’s or your family members lives/health? \nOr is it a tool that can help create balance in a world that we openly acknowledge is out of our complete control. \n\nOptions are primarily investment insurance. \nThe industry has become extremely efficient. That efficiency has now converted these into multipurpose instruments. Why not? Why should the company not be rewarded for their advancement in efficiency? \nWhy should the average joe not have the ability to place a reasonable bet, especially after DD, and be rewarded? Why should he be held back simply because some other people cannot control themselves and self destruct? \n\nYou being a fan of that player is actually your edge. You likely know much more about him than someone who is not a fan. Using that knowledge will allow you to speculate more\naccurately.\nThat player typically makes money on your viewership and purchase of merchandise.\nWhy is it evil for you to benefit from his success as well? Ironically, HIS finances relay heavily on his performance. \nSounds like a symbiotic financial relationship when managed right. \nIf all you want in return for your support is entertainment.. dont bet on him or make longer term less specific bets. \n\nHe is also rewarded by getting to play a game for a living. Speculating a sport and playing a sport are two very different realities. Attempting to vicariously live through the player and applying the “pureness” of competitive play to speculation is foolish. \nTo put it simply, being a football fan and saying “we won a super bowl” is retarded. You didnt do shit. The organization won.\nThe players and coaches won. Its not the same, but betting actually brings these two more closely together. You were trading the short term options of a private company that is his career. The player, organization and team are typically the majority share holders.\n\nJust because you abuse a product or cannot involve yourself in certain industries and acts without allowing greed and selfishness to overwhelm you, doesnt mean the industry or\nproduct is inherently bad. You simply have character flaws and an immature approach to the action which you are now twisting and blaming the industry for, based on some made up moral high ground that allows you to ignore the fact those negative characteristics are in fact part of you.\n\nSorry to be a dick lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You do realize it’s in the name of this sub right?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wallstreet....not Wimbledon.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sounds to me like you just suck at trading", "score": -2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Gambling has nothing to do with capitalism...", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"I had never *bet on sports\" 'betted' isnt a word", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your little half greek half Russian shit won’t win any grand slam anytime soon.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah okay a likely story.

Almost everyone has exhausted what state benefits they had at this point, so there’s nothing that this is being added to.\n\nYou have been fed lies as to responsibility here. Democrats do have their pet measures, but they were willing to negotiate as long as Republicans were willing to compromise as well. It’s McConnell’s failure to find an acceptable agreement in the Senate that has sunk everything. Senate Republicans have no interest in helping ordinary citizens.
