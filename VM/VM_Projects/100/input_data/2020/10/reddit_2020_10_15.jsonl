Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve \"can't save a stock market.\"\n\n\"They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,\" Smead said.\n\nA call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.\n\n\"In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,\" Smead added.\n\nHe suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to \"ride the index to a fault\" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.\n\n\"Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.\"\n\nDespite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/smead-nightmare-us-stock-valuations-driven-by-young-dumb-investors.html)", "id": "jbnkzh", "created_utc": 1602768683.0, "score": 2037, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 656, "comments": [{"body": "Here's a news flash...

You have to able to model the risks and reliability.\n\nThis is a bit of a morbid comparison, but I think you can kinda relate how much people care to how big the Wiki article for the event is, \n\n[Death of Elaine Herzberg (Uber self driving death)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg)\n\n[First Boeing MAX 8 plane crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Air_Flight_610)\n\n[Second Boeing MAX 8 plane crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Airlines_Flight_302)\n\n[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster)\n\nA Level 4 self driving fatality almost seems on par with a plane crash. It's a big deal, the public doesn't take lightly, add on the general fear about AI as well. \n\nThe standard unit to use is Failures In Time (FIT) rate, number of failures in one billion hours of use. For example, Intel processors have a design goal of a FIT under 200 at 55°C.

There's around 700,000 Tesla vehicles with HW2/3 that should be capable of autonomy.

This is my top pick for the next six months. Stock options released yesterday. It will only take $10k to make over $100k easily.**\n\nHere's the S-1 for the real mofuckas..mofucka mofuckaaahhh: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744\\_4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744_4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCorsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand.  Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they  have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.\n\nMy DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n**Generally Speaking:**\n\n* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**\n* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**\n* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**\n* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**\n\n**Q2 2020:**\n\n* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release\n* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards\n\n**Q3 2020:**\n\n* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.\n* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3\n* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.\n* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.\n* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.\n\n**Q4 2020:**\n\n* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years. The rise of RH trading this year (increases exposure to the brand), all of which means more DIY nerds building PC's to finish the year\n* **XBOX release** this year 11/10 will be huge for SCUF gaming (WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary), which makes controllers for the new console. The company's ELITE controllers are sold out online. [https://scufgaming.com/xbox](https://scufgaming.com/xbox)\n   * SCUF PlayStation (11/12) controller has not been released yet for the new console\n* **Stimulus is finally coming** to all the broke boys, in a lump sum fashion ($5,200-7,800 federally), which means people will SPEND.\n\n**Q1 2021:**\n\n* Will be an **easy quarter** to compete against because the company has been experiencing income growth starting Q2 2020, not Q1.\n* **Stimulus payment effect**\n* If there's still **no vaccine** by now, holding CRSR will be a great hedge against the market bc as previously mentioned, WFH stipends, PC building and console gaming\n\n**Fundamentals, for my Buffet & Munger enthusiasts:**\n\n**Literally cannot find a cheaper growth stock in the market.**\n\n* 72MM in free cash flow for the first 6 months 2020, with the latter half of the year historically being even stronger. The 6 months was carried by the strong Q2 2020\n* 58% YOY growth in sales in Q2 with 22.6MM in income\n* Q3 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 35MM+ in income and 50MM+ in FCF (Conservative)\n* Q4 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 75MM+ in income and 100MM IN FCF (Conservative)\n* 150MM in net income and 220MM+ in FCF Trailing Twelve Month by Q1 2021\n   * **I was the Math King in Kindergarten, so don't question my quantabilities.**\n* **1.7 Billion market cap**, implying 11x forward p/e and 8x future free cash flow on 50%+ s.g.\n   * Logitech is trading at a forward P/E of 20-25 and is worth 13.6 Billion\n   * Razer is worth 2.5 Billion and doesn't put up the kinds of numbers Corsair does.\n      * **PT estimate: $36-48, but could go to $60 with favorable peer and market conditions**\n\n**TLDR: ALL-IN on corsair. Ride the wave.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**Me & WSB autists:** $20-25 Bull Call spread for 12/18, 2/19 and 5/21. A ten-bagger play. If markets crash to end the year, sell 5/21 and load up on 2/19. I have been buying these, but haven't been given the volume I want from the market makers. I have been able to get in 12/18 for .45c, 2/19 at 1.15 and luckily one contract of 5/21 for .60c\n\n**Pussy Boomers AND MM's:** 1 million shares, sell 10,000k $22.5 call contracts and use the premium to buy FD call options. If $25's don't print, roll them over.\n\n**Optional position:** Puts on Logitech **or better yet,** ***Puts on the guy who negatively comments my post because that guy is the biggest idiot in the room. So, click on the negative commenter's profile and inverse the fuck out of that guy's positions.***\n\nIf you actually read my DD, thank you.
