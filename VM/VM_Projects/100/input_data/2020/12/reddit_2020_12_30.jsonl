{"title": "Quick year recap / $115,789.10 profits since June", "selftext": "Started with 30k capital in June. Withdrew 25k this past month to pay for a car.\n\nMy first trades were HTZ Bought 6 Oct 16 6C @ 1.48 $888 and H Bought 2 Aug 21 70C @ 5.40 $1080.\n\nMy most profitable strategies were short strangles, short puts, occasionally short calls and deep delta long calls.\n\nMy biggest losses were earning plays on TGT and BYND. Lost 10k/27k respectively. The lesson I learned was to be consistent with my losers, so cut em loose sooner.\n\nSome other things that helped me this year were patience, risk management, exploring new strategies, keeping a watchlist and looking out for patterns/trends. The options sub was my #1 source of education when I started. I always asked questions in the noob thread, and probably combed through 80% of it’s history to learn as much as I can. Very thankful for people like redtexture, papacharlie9, maxcapacity, esinvests (Erik) for being mentors to new traders like myself.\n\nI do know I am still an amateur. I will still be a regular on the noob thread, but I wanted to share a bit of my story to cap off the year.

If you'd like to adjust your risk, consider using [this proof.](https://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4353418-selling-otm-covered-calls-systematically-30-year-backtest) It suggests sticking to selling options at around 0.5 standard deviations. If you get more aggressive, you actually earn less because you're getting called too often.

Well yahoo jumped into the daily fantasy market a few years ago but after both fanduel and draftkings were main stream among fantasy users. Yahoo is probably still #3 in daily fantasy but they are soooo far behind. And thats a big company like yahoo who has name recognition and millions of users already using their fantasy software. Yahoo has even tried “rake free” tournaments where they dont take any cut of the buyins (compared to draftkings and fanduel that take around 18% rake. That still couldnt get a lot of new customers. There was a company called Fandraft i believe that tried doing a monthly membership but no rake on any tournaments. That didnt catch on either.

A lot of people are using the Blockbuster and Netflix analogy, however this is a flawed comparison as Netflix and Blockbuster were direct competitors vying to be the primary distributor for movies rentals. Netflix eventually won, not because of their streaming service, but because it was more convent for customers to rent DVD’s by mail than it was to drive to a physical location. However, in this analogy the movie industry and the companies producing DVD players were neutral parties.

In my opinion this is the only reason GME is still relevant. It has nothing to do with their CEO, management, merchandise, or stores. The biggest factor in GME’s continued success is the lack of high speed internet access in the U.S.. Both Microsoft and Sony have released digital versions of their consoles this year and the moment they feel that enough of their customers have high speed internet access they will remove the Blu-ray drives from their consoles. Why? It’s an additional expense that gives customers an ability to bypass their online entertainment stores.

No. \n\nIn another decade or two the only game sales will be digital purchases or subscriptions, and they tied to their platforms like the Playstation, Xbox, Steam, etc. Of course you could also have cloud based subscriptions were you don’t need to buy the hardware as your running the game off a server, but the point is there won’t be any physical media for retailers to sell.

{"title": "Its a Boomer play, but its guaranteed money: $GE Leaps", "selftext": " So, this DD isn't actual TA. It is a series of (what I believe) are **very** safe assumptions: a combination of political analysis, energy trends, and inevitable nation-wide \"**must have**\" investments. WARNING: this is long. By necessity, one assumption leads to another. I'll give you the **one sentence TLDR** up front, but because this is an assumption-chain, I encourage you to read this post\n\n\\----\n\nTL/DR: \n\n**In order for Biden to get a quick win for what is looking like unfavorable (to Dems) 2022 midterms, he will first shoot for a massive infrastructure bill. Either way Georgia goes, Dems won't blow up the filibuster. Therefore, if he wants to have any \"green\" policies in his first term, he has to make it super amenable to Republicans. (1) Connecting \\*\\*rich\\*\\* renewable areas (mostly Republican states) by extensive HVDC lines to (2) an enhanced nationwide Grid (HVDC lines) will kill two birds with one stone. This \\^ infrastructure is inevitable, either way. $GE is the #1 and only American HVDC provider, 220k workers +. $GE Renewables don't contribute to revenue right now, but HVDC + Wind (which will be yuge) make it a massive discount rn.** \n\n\\-----\n\nI am going to lay down a series of linear assumptions and realities below. I feel like these assumptions are all safe, therefore, it is highly likely that the outcome I describe comes to fruition within the next 4 years. \n\n1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 30% or more of the U.S. fleet will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. \n\n2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. Go google around: Grid owners are ecstatic about this. The average American home uses \\~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3, and BARELY drive (i dont commute) and still use \\~10kWh per day for driving. A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive. By 2025, if \\~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation investment takes time. Grid owners know this is coming. They will beef up generation faster and faster as the U.S. economy becomes more **electrified** instead of based on fossil fuels. \n\n3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. This has 2 causes. (1) Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind + batteries is cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Additionally, Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now, and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end is near. (2) Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion: remember the Keystone pipeline? Natural gas is pretty green and cheap af, but its not everywhere, and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc) are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. \n\n4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. \n\n5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even if the two Georgia seats go blue, there is \\*\\*ZERO\\*\\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause hes ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening.\n\n6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes\n\n7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at these maps ([https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html)) for U.S. solar, and this map ([https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx](https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx)) for U.S. wind. What do you notice? For the most part, **there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest**. **There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South**. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. \n\n8. **Right now, we can't take full advantage of these areas because the infrastructure to transport 2025-2030 sized energy demands to population centers don't exist**. This is key. Right now, the U.S. energy grid is largely disconnected in terms of HVDC lines (high voltage lines capable of transmitting huge amounts of power with minimal loss: it resembles small, little fiefdoms. Google \"U.S. HVDC Map\" (make sure you're looking at the current ones--not the projections). We don't have that much HVDC infrastructure. In this past, there wasn't a huge emphasis because there wasn't that much need....renewables price efficiency didn't make for THAT compelling of a need, and localized Grid owners made-do with the status quo. **HVDC network improvement is INEVITABLE.** Renewables are too cheap, and the efficiencies inherent in concentrating wind and solar where appropriate are too vast. Right now, as you read this, there is an UNDERSEA Ultra HVDC cable being laid between Australia and Singapore to transport solar power. I shit you not. Europe and China are building vast HVDC and Ultra HVDC lines right now. **Look at this wiki page:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_HVDC\\_projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. See how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.? Its a fucking joke.** It is extremely unlikely that we're gonna just slap solar and wind where they are sub-optimal, rather than seek greater ROI. Mass HVDC lines are inevitable. \n\n9. General Electric is the only large American HVDC provider. GE employs 200,000+ Americans. It is literally one of the oldest American companies. It has a super American brand name, and is politically connected. \n\n10. HVDC is **expensive**. I'm not an expert, but because of NIMBY, its likely that a lot of HVDC will be buried along rail lines (From what I read). HVDC between hundreds of wind/solar fields across the U.S. will need to be built, plus HVDC / Ultra HVDC between renewable zones to NE Corridor, Chicago, California. I'd google around for figures, but basically, its $$$$$$$$$. \n\n11. **Right now,** General Electric's Renewables sector barely brings in any revenue (17% 2019 revenue, around $15 billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:\\~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before).). The new CEO is actually pretty fucking great ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\\_Lawrence\\_Culp\\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Lawrence_Culp_Jr)). He turned Danaher around, and is setting up GE for success. GE has a TON of debt (debt/equity above 6.0), but what will happen to the stock when GE is given absolutely gigantic contracts in order to buff up the U.S. Grid? They really are the only American company with the production/size ability to do this. What happens when the GE Renewables sector grows by 4-5x over the next 10 years? Grid improvements + Wind turbines are going to go up bigly. That $15 billion revenue line item may increase dramatically. \n\nIf you read this far, let me restate that this isn't TA. I don't have strikes for you. I don't know how to value HVDC and Wind over the next decade. However, I have a **STRONG** feeling in my nips that $GE is going to be a major American comeback story, and \\^ that political/economic/renewable trends make it exceedingly likely that GE will have huge grid contracts coming up. **How much of this is already baked into the price? I have no idea, but I do know that the big boys don't gamble on Adderall rantings like this, so it probably isn't baked in.** \n\nI'm using GE to add some safety to my current 100% TSLA portfolio.
