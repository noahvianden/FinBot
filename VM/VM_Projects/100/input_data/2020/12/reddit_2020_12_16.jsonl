That model just makes more sense for them. \n\nIf they tried to go completely independent, who would provide the care on the other end of the telehealth? Apple would need a team doctors and nurses. They are then a healthcare provider. That means they need to partner with payers directly. But why would insurance companies want to pay for Apple’s service when their existing provider network already offers telehealth? Would Apple have access to the patients health information from hospital visits? Clinic visits? Lab tests, med lists, allergies, etc? They would need to partner with the patients main healthcare provider to get this information. Now multiply that by hundreds or thousands of independent networks across the states. Or would Apple open their own hospital system? Just in one state? Or across the states? That would take years. Maybe they could tap into an existing network, like CareEverywhere, but that would require not only approval from Epic but also the board of CareEverywhere, which is led by providers from the whale organizations. They don’t trust tech companies. At all. \n\nBasically, under the current US healthcare system, because of insurance networks, interoperability, differing laws across states, and a number of other nuanced hurdles, large healthcare organizations who do it all have an advantage over small networks. That’s why there’s been so much consolidation in the healthcare space in the past 20 years. \n\nNow TDOC is facing many of these obstacles as well. They’re going to provide their own services and will try and compete with the whales. Their only advantage is that they are lean enough that they might be able to partner with the remaining orgs that cannot afford Epic/Cerner. Those orgs still need to offer telehealth to compete with the whales. There’s a market there but it must be a better experience than Epic/Cerner to maintain customers. TDOC is currently offering the better experience, so they are on the right track. So it’s like a niche service that might cost more but is a better experience for the patient. \n\nOr.. Apple could provide a service if they had their own payer network. That’s what Amazon is doing. That’s what CVS is doing with Aetna. They provide telehealth to their own patients.

Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. \n\nThese are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.Don't FOMO**\n\nYes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? \n\nThis takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**\n\nBuying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**\n\nNo one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**\n\nYeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do.

You said you sold winners and it was a mistake. It wasn't. The real mistake about that is to think it was a mistake to sell the winners. Well, you can easily say that 5 years later. But WHO told you 5 years back THAT they're going to be the winners? Nobody. You can't catch every bottom and every high, it's impossible. The real mistake about this is that most people only remember those \"real winners\". But what about all the losers? What about all the losers you sold early enough? Well, they didn't grow those 2000% in the last years but didn't burn your capital either. The thing is that everybody forgets about the losers. Why don't you look back on the losers your sold? What if some of them went to zero? This will make you feel like you did something right instead. There are enough losing stocks out there, but as I said before, everybody just looks at the few extraordinary stocks. And thats the mistake. Only A FEW will behave like that and way more won't.\n\n Also, you weren't able to tell 5 years ago that those companies will be still successful now. That's only possible right now after you saw them continue being succesful. It's a HUGE mistake alot of people in different businesses make.   In the end, everybody is a wise person and able to tell the truth, BUT the only thing that matters is NOW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **3. When the overall market is down, you buy** \n\nEverybody can have an own opinion but I have to say that this is wrong. You first say that no one can predict the market, so how do I know when to buy? What if I buy too early and not only my stock, but everything is still going downwards afterwards? Trying to time the market is excactly what you're trying to do at that point.\n\nAlso, you can't say that when the overall market is down, every stock is on sale. In every crash there were stocks that weren't able to recover and sometimes even whole sectors that took 10-20 years to recover. \n\nIt's the worst time to buy when the overall market is down. You don't know what will happen next. You don't know which sectors or stocks are going to drop further. You don't know which stocks are profiting the best afterwards. You don't know if the overall market will need 1, 5 or 10 years to recover. Theres always a reason why markets crash. And do you really fight it by thinking that all the stocks are just on sale now? With the believe that stocks always go up? Well, if you are able to sit there for 5, 10, 20 years until your portfolio comes back to it's old strength..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **4. Don't be afraid of corrections.** \n\nThis point is connected to the one above. How do you tell me if it's a crash (like in your 3. point), just a correction, or only a selloff? Is 1% a correction? Is 10% a crash? Is 20% a correction? Will it only be a crash with more than 50%?\n\nYou will end up getting slaughtered in a REAL crash when you follow your rules 3 (buying on market lows) and \"keep buying\" after corrections while \"playing the long game\". \n\nOn top of that, you simply can't say that stocks always go up. That's just not true. Maybe if you look at an index,gold or whatever. But it definitely doesn't count for stocks. There are so many (back then successful) stocks and companies that went to zero in no matter of time, went bankrupt, took ages to recover, or never came back. And yes, there were people like you and me that were riding it till the end. Until they went bankrupt too. Did they have the believe that everything goes up in the long run? Yes. Did they live for 100 years to be able to see their portfolio recover completely? No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> **8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction** \n\nThis point does also not fit to every kind of investor or trader. It's totally fine to take profits and get in to the ride again after some time. There are actually people that don't want to sit in stocks that move sideways for ages, because they have a better use for the money. I agree with you on the point of not trying to \"time a correction\" because nobody is able to, but corrections are helpful indicators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Just keep the money in and stop worrying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really don't want to criticize you, because I really like some of your points, but this sentence really is the worst. You can't say something like that. \"Keeping money in\" can cost people their whole lifesavings and sometimes even their lives. \"Stop worrying\" is nothing you can say so easily while being in the stock market. Somebody with 5 years of experience has to know that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong, as I said before, I really like most of your points, especially 1, 2 and 5 because they are completely true. And I also know that you just shared YOUR mistakes, maybe not even with the intention to help others, but that's how I gets interpreted. But I honestly can't believe that you have 5 years of experience and won't share anything about riskmanagement or whatsoever. I mean, nothing is wrong with buy and hold and I believe that's the only thing you've done and not really trading, because in that case your post would look completely different, but it's not the holy grail by any means. I thought that somebody with 5 years of experience might have made excactly this experience. With some points you stated, I feel like you didn't experience a crash yourself, because also then your post would look differently.

{"title": "Don't Touch $SPCE", "selftext": "Good evening, everyone! I know we're in a little bit of a milieu this week, between the Palantir and GameStop hype these last few weeks and the $MT steel stonk parade we're going to be seeing starting next week. I figured I'd take this time to talk about everyone's good friend Virgin Galactic\n\nNow, I know. The stock's down a quarter after their test fiasco. But what's the long-term outlook? Is it going to the moon, and then back again in time to get the latest billionaire back for chicken tendie lunch? Or will it go tits-up and crash into the Mojave Desert? I suspect the latter. Here's why:\n\n1. **The market is very niche.** There's 2,095 billionaires, according to [the first thing on Google](https://howmuch.net/articles/world-map-of-billionaires-2020), and 46.8 million millionaires [according to ABC.](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/half-worlds-entire-wealth-hands-millionaires/story?id=66440320). So, seems like a pretty big market right?\n\nWell, maybe. But maybe not. The initial price for a ticket was $250,000 per seat. That's a lot of money to have in cash. A lot to blow on a fun afternoon sight-seeing flight, and I really doubt most millionaires will have that to spend. So I'm going to make a really unscientific guesstimate and strike that number down by 3/4. So we're down to a market audience of about 12 million.\n\nNext, we'll have to ask ourselves: who really wants to go to space? I do, but I don't have a quarter of a million dollars lying around. Google showed 400 people have pre-ordered tickets, but that only required a $1,000 deposit, and that's about as reliable a metric as the 14,000 people who ordered the Nikola Badger. These are early adopters, sure, but space operations need revenue and revenue requires a large market.\n\n2. **Okay (for) Boomers?** of our millionaire and billionaire market, 99% are over 35. The average age for a millionaire is 62, and of course greater wealth skews older. The average billionaire is 65. Now, the oldest person in space was 77, so these guys should be okay right? Well, that 77 year old was Sen. John Glenn, former Marine fighter pilot and first American to orbit the Earth.  Probably better shape than most of his peers and he was just along for the ride when he went up at 77.  Nasa astronauts generally max out at about 46 years old. If you're just a tourist and you're not going to touch anything, you can definitely go older, but how much older?\n\nAre you going to risk a 65 year-old, in average health? How about a 75 year-old? Or someone in poor health? What's the chance some old guy dies from a heart attack right as you reach the exosphere? Does VG have insurance for the oncoming lawsuit? How much does this eat into profits?

According to TechCrunch it takes about 8 weeks to refurbish a Falcoln 9 booster. Let's cut the hypothetical refurbish time in half, say they got some really fine-tuned procedures going. 4 weeks. We're at a month between each plane's flight. Keeping that 5,100 passenger number for consistency sake, that's still a minimum fleet of 70 planes, without accounting for spares and stand-ins when repairs take longer than 4 weeks.\n\nEvery year each of those planes will make about $18,000,000 in revenue. How does that stack up to, say, an airliner? I crunched some numbers:\n\nAverage profit per passenger is $19.65, or a 9% profit margin. So i did 19.65/.09 to find an average revenue of $216.33 per passenger.\n\nLet's say you have a 737, that seats 189 people. That means the average flight makes $41,265 (rounded) per flight, and assuming 3 flights per day, 6 days per week, we get (41265×3)×[(365)×(6/7)]=123,795×312.857= 38,730,150\n\n$38,730,150 in revenue per year, for a plane that brand new would cost about $90,000,000 meaning it would be paid off in it's third year, before factoring in maintenance costs.\n\nI don't see the VG ships being cheaper than a commercial 737, even with Boeing's markups.

Most of his networth is tied to PLTR. He is the head of the PayPal mafia and really people he has backed formed the back of Silicon Valley post google.\n\nHe loves to provoke controversy by paying kids to drop out of college to start businesses. He promotes seasteading and anti aging research. So why does this matter. Well his ventures funds are all usually 10x oversubscribed so yes it’s nearly impossible to invest into him even if you have billions of dollars. Yes you can throw billions of dollars at him and he won’t take your money. \n\nBut by buying palantir you are literally replicating the same portfolio positioning as the smartest ventures capitalist in the world. The man who foresaw the rise of Facebook, the man who is best buds with Elon musk (backed Tesla and Space X, they actually both nearly died in a car accident in Elon’s Mclaren F1). This man does not fuck around (even if he does fuck other men).  \n\nAnd on top of that his money is directly used to save the world from a mimetic apocalypse brought about by zero sum completion. The man is literally doing it out of Christian duty to save the world.\n\nhttps://www.city-journal.org/peter-thiel\n\nLook, if you don’t give this man more money we will all be living in some sort of dystopia, be it totalitarian AI, matrix, post nuclear war road warrior, factional sectarian violence ala reformations 2.0 or the purge where antifa and militias battle it out on the streets. The only way to hold the apocalypse at bay is to invest in a few genius level people who can change the world and create millions of jobs and the best way to do that is to give all your money to Peter Thiel.\n\nTLDR: buy PLTR, make tendies, save the world", "id": "ke7njv", "created_utc": 1608118638.0, "score": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't find one spelling mistake..in for 5000 shares...🚀🚀🚀🚀", "score": 264, "replies": [{"body": "agree. high level of vocabulary and straight-forward communication. autist here with 1100 shares and strong diamond hands YOLO all my life", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ditto", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A gay CEO with 'Christian duties.'
