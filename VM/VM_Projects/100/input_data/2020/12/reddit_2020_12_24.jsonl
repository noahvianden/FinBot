{"title": "Why GME could squeeze as early as tomorrow", "selftext": "Came across noise that GME has been on the reg sho threshold list for almost 13 consecutive trading days so I  decided to do some digging and boy did I find something interesting. So interesting that I dare predict a short squeeze could happen as early as tomorrow. The magnitude of the squeeze is something that will be hard to tell, and could be dependent on factors currently unknown to us, but it will definitely be an early christmas present for many.\n\n**What does it mean to be listed on the threshold list and what happens on the 13th consecutive day?**\n\nThe Regulation SHO Threshold Security List was created by the SEC in 2005 to reduce naked short selling. Stocks appear on this list when at least 0.5% of shares outstanding failed to be settled for 5 consecutive days or more. If a stock is on the list for 13 consecutive trading days, participants will be forced to close any settlement failures (a.k.a cover the naked shorts).\n\n**Is GME on the threshold list?**\n\nYou bet. 12 consecutive trading days starting from 8th December 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day would fall on 24th December 2020. Shorts will be forced to cover tomorrow basically.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wm6n09bbs1761.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=552c76e3fdf51d81989e7021f53316385030a4ad\n\n**Has this happened before?**\n\nYes. 12 consecutive days starting from 22 September 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day fell on 8th October 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6r3d53lvs1761.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a9f42ae5235bbee1b1044b42f8ce5fa6a0f382d\n\nGuess what happened on the 8th October 2020?\n\n[Price shot up by 41.4&#37; with a staggering volume of 76 million shares](https://preview.redd.it/kktrcq0pt1761.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=d85baa22a8b5666de0e888355c90b8ce02c466f1)\n\n**So there will be a short squeeze tomorrow? By how much?**\n\nI am not a prophet but I am confident a squeeze will happen tomorrow. How much would be up to your own conclusion. All I can say is that back in October, almost everyone and their wives' boyfriend were bearish on GME other than the few OGs we have here. Ryan Cohen only had a 9% stake, GME gang and their theories were laughed off. Shorts were able to cover and close their naked shorts stealthily and without much trouble.\n\nThis time round, Cohen upped his stake to 13%. WSB Capital has entered the foray with approximately 5% stake, which will probably be watered down to 2.5% of diamond hands stake.  Senvest Management has entered with a 5% stake as well. Hedgeye with 90k twitter followers sets a PT of $50 for GME. Some big player has been buying lots of GME shares for the past 2 days. 30M and 25M volume respectively. There are still 68M shares short at the moment. The market closes early tomorrow at 1pm. Shorts will have to buy a shitload amount of shares in half a trading day. Don't forget, GME is attracting a lot of attention from FOMOs and boomers with the Hedgeye tweet. Shorts will have to compete with all these buyers to cover. True available float should be much lower this time round with more big players in, and retail investors knowing about the potential short squeeze, and most importantly pure autistic energy.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to emphasise that this is a speculative take. \n\nMy DD hinges on two assumptions: \n\n1. 8th october price increase is due to shorts covering rather than microsoft partnership news, or both.\n\n2.

I wouldn't be surprised if it starts in the PM lol Also, October 8th was a Thursday, so there was trading on Friday. Market is closed on Friday this time around, so it may explode harder on Monday since people will have more time to hear about the squeeze over the weekend and hop in the action on Monday.\n\nIf we applied the same 46.5% increase to current price, target price is ~$30 by close.

{"title": "My gift to you - a better list of things you can do to stop losing all of your fucking money.", "selftext": "I realize none of you actually care about making money, but on the off chance I can help one person then this post will be worth it.\n\n(1) u/BeardlessPete is a fucking moron. He’s hawking TradingView. His post is an advertisement masquerading as enlightenment on reading charts. He doesn’t know shit about making money. \n\nLearn the story on a stock — the company — and not some tick mark bullshit on a squiggly fucking line.\n\nHis post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kj7p0e/my_gift_to_you_a_list_of_things_you_can_do_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n(2) The best stock pickers are only correct about 40% to 50% of the time. That’s right, not as often as you think!  \n\nWhat does it mean to be “right” or “wrong”? Here’s the answer: \n\nJust because you made or lost money doesn’t mean you are right or wrong. You always have a choice, invest in Stock A, invest in a broad market index, or do nothing.  You might be up 10% YTD and feel great, but the S&amp;P 500 is up 14% YTD. You could have made more money with substantially less risk compounding with an index.\n\n(3) Are you better than the index? Find out!  Practice on tools like caps.fool.com. Make a pick and see how it performs against the market. If you don’t know if you are right or wrong you won’t learn how to make money. \n\n(4) You aren’t going to make “boy band” money if you lose a lot of money.  When you gamble on a speculative stock and lose 80%, you need a 400% return to get back to even.  If you can steadily make 7%, do it 10 times in a row and you’ve made 100%.  Or at 10%, it’s 7 times. There will of course be volatility and varying time horizons. But, aim to (mostly) round the bases with singles, not (always) trying to swing for the fences with a cucumber as a bat. Fake internet points from loss porn are not badges of honor. You think the game different this time? It’s not. Degenerates have gambled since the beginning of markets. An irrationally exuberant market on a stock will end.  Do yourself a favor and learn to be better.  Having some speculative picks is fine — just understand and accept the inherent risks and volatility.\n\n(5) Have a bazooka gun of cash ready when quality goes on sale.  You will have a chance to buy most companies at a fair price. There will be pull backs and market dislocations. Be ready. Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, Intuitive Surgical, and many of the best performing stocks of all time have gone on sale — many times.  Be ready when the market corrects and buy quality. Be patient!  Don’t have always FOMO.\n\n(6) Market corrections with declines of between 10% and 20% happen about 2.5 times each year on average (source: Guggenheim). The average bear market lasts 18 months. Know this and use it to your advantage. Don’t panic sell quality names. Stay calm. If you don’t need the money to survive today, leave it alone. If you do, what the fuck were you doing investing in stocks?  Think about this. How will you act WHEN markets correct next?\n\n(7) Most of your investment returns are going to come from just a few of your stock picks. Let the winners run!  At some point you’ll consider rebalancing — that’s smart and okay. But having an oversized winner at 15% of your stock portfolio can be okay (if it’s a quality stock, not speculative). Let compound returns take over.  Nothing is better than crushing the market with 1% gain from a compounding stock. Better yet, when that 1% gain is MORE than your cost basis.\n\n(8) Trading isn’t therapy for boredom. Go play with yourself and then go for a walk. Trading isn’t going to make your day better.  Have the discipline to trade less, not more.  \n\n(9) Read more. Do you even know what you are investing in?  Know everything about your stocks. For 30+ years now all information ever published is at your fingertips. Yet, most of you won’t bother doing your own research. Readings someone else’s pitch (or article) can help you get started.  But go read the 10-K.  Read industry data. Twitter and message boards are full of morons with pump and dump agendas. Do basic research yourself. Do people like working there? How can that company make more money? Betting on companies is a very different mindset than just betting on tickers. Bet on companies. \n\n(10) What can you learn about a company that (practically) no one else knows.  Make a thesis. Will Facebook be successful on mobile?  Can Microsoft move its massive enterprise software business to the cloud?  Can RiteAid compete with online pharmacies?  Can Google close it’s acquisition of FitBit?\n\n(11) Investor Relations doesn’t care about your cost basis or the number of shares that you own. They don’t. Management says they respect investors — but they mostly don’t give a shit. Jeff Bezos carves out 6 hours a year to talk to investors — just to be polite. Management teams are trying to run a complex enterprise, with major human capital issues. Most management teams are incentivized to build value over eternity. They don’t give a shit about your time horizon.  Most care about themselves first, employees second, customers third, suppliers fourth, partners fifth, the community sixth, and investors last. There’s very little that a company can do to affect share price in the short term.\n\n(12) Add to your winners. Don’t double down on losers, double up on winners. \n\n(13) Find stocks that aren’t always in the headlines. Headlines lead to redlines.  If the story is in the news, you are probably too late (for now). Buying a stock isn’t like lining up to buy one of a limited number of holiday cakes. There’s always more stock.  Wait until the news cycle forgets about the stock and then consider buying. Do research first.\n\n(14) If you can’t sleep at night because you own a stock, you should NOT own that stock. Stocks don’t cuddle. They are like a brutally honest toddler with mood swings and basic needs. Overtime they might grow into a good adult but keep your expectations inline. It’s a long road to adulthood.\n\n(15) Lastly, what do you want the future to look like. Get off the of the news cycle and quarterly earnings game. Go find stocks that are FOCUSED on being massively better and more important in 5+ years. Price targets for these types of companies are bullshit. They always have been and they always will be. You’ll be amazed by what focused teams — motivated by making a better world — can achieve. The stock price simply weighs this impact — it doesn’t mean you a genius. You didn’t do the science. Be humble and donate some to charity and help the impoverished, because you were just a spectator holding shares.\n\nTLDR: u/BeardlessPete is a moron. Don’t lose money by being an idiot.

I am not going to post Chinese news article detailing the entire power struggle, just English. I mean, you monkeys can't read moon runes.\n\nYou see, the power struggle has been happening since Alibaba and Jack Ma became the ecommerce god of China, like Jeff \"the bald Grinch\" Bezos did with Amazon in America. China are commies, worshipping anyone but the party is illegal. That is why despite the profits and everything else, they are still sitting at 300+ and not flying like AMZN. Chinese know the power struggles all to well, smart ones will avoid it like plague. Not even Chinese boomers are touching it.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Mystery-video-suggests-power-struggle-in-China\n\nThe previous power struggles resulted in Ma forced out of CEO position in 2018, cue lip service to western friends who don't give a fuck just to make sure BABA don't drop. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/10/18/alibabas-jack-ma-spent-10-years-preparing-for-his-retirement.html\n\nBut like anyone who had felt the power trip of being the richest and most powerful man before, Ma could not stay retired and out of the limelight for long.\n\nSo he came out of retirement with the biggest fintech IPO in Asia, Ant Group. Now, that really pisses the Emperor off. Recognising his efforts in revolutionalizing ecommerse, Emperor Xi decided to let him spend the rest of his life in retirement... like a charity case. Yet he decides to step in limelight again, and overshadow the most ~~paranoid and insecure~~ powerful man in all of China?! Well Emperor is the party and party is the Emperor, now Emperor finally decides that you must be removed. Especially when they are showing the entire China the power and money capitalism brings. Cue CCP vs CEO power struggle round 2, except this time they are clashing in the open.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Xi-sees-Alibaba-and-Tencent-as-rising-threats-to-power\n\n\"Wait so why western crowds don't know???\"\n\nUh you retards know you don't read right?\n\nSo what happens?\n\nBuy the dip??\n\nCut losses and run???\n\nAnswer is simple:\n\nIf you are holding stocks then just keep holding it.

The dip will not stop until power struggle turmoil is over, it will get even uglier over the months as Politburo falsify more charges to threaten the CEOs to back down.\n\nRecover your call losses with puts, it really is that easy.\n\nI have no options in it because I hate commies and know how they work.
