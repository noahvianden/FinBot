(My dad had just died and I built up some credit card debt, so I refinanced my home and decided to take as much equity out as possible so that I could invest in TSLA with the leftovers).  I was running a good business that allowed me to live a schedule I enjoyed and payed for my own home and Model 3, so if I lost the $70k I knew nothing would change.  But maybe that $70k would work out well and I could use it to pay off my house in 5 years instead of 30, and so I figured the upside was worth the risk.  By early 2019 that had turned into about $50k.  Q1 2019 had extremely low deliveries, which meant there was no demand (actually the cars were still on boats or in ports and there were simple logistics issues).  Elon was getting kicked out of Tesla for his $420 tweet (actually he gave up his chairman title which didn’t matter anyway, and found $40M under his couch to pay the fine).  Teslas were catching on fire.  The Model 3 wasn’t turning a profit.  Company was doomed and all the media and my grandma knew it.  It was about this time that I started learning about options, thanks to some of the comments in this subreddit.  Just learned about them from YouTube.  It was about that same time that Tesla held their Autonomy investor day.  My mind was blown.  As I was picking my brain up off the floor, I realized there was huge opportunity here.  Tesla’s future was never brighter to me.  Eventually I put two and two together and started looking at call options.  I decided to not count on Tesla’s FSD ambitions when picking a strike price & expiry.  I was confident that the Model 3 would continue ramping, costs would come down, and that it would sell like hotcakes.  The Model Y was in R&D as well which should be out within a year.  So in April I decided on some 6/2020 $420 call options.  I sold half my shares and bought like 50 of those contracts.  A few weeks later the stock dropped even more and dipped below $200.  Couldn’t pass up on the opportunity, so I sold the other half of my shares, and bought 70 more contracts.  Ended up with 120 contracts with a cost basis of $4.70/sh.\n\nIt’s easy to look back and see what a good trade it was, but at the time I’m sure I looked like a madman, even to this subreddit.\n\nSorry for the long story, but it’s hard to express what the risk/reward was like for me personally without including a lot of the details.  Yeah, it was risky.  But I wouldn’t be broke and on the street if I had lost the money.  I also wasn’t gambling - I picked a price and date with specific details in mind.  /u/peel7 ‘s blog was quite useful in helping me see how TSLA’s SP/Rev metric was way out of whack and would soon correct itself.  I knew the Model 3 would do well and I knew people’s emotions about the company would soon change.\n\nFinally sold those options when I saw COVID coming in February when TSLA was at $730 iirc.  I tried ringing alarm bells here but nobody was listening back then, lol.  Ended up taking about 1/3 of my winnings and buying short term TSLA Puts.  Those trades turned out well.  Then as the shock of a global pandemic settled down I started to think it was more likely for TSLA to go up than down, so I went back all-in with $1800 calls expiring 6/2022.  TSLA is already above that which I can’t believe.\n\nSo I really did make a lot of calculated plays, but also - TSLA just went nuts and there was no way in a million years I expected the runup that’s happened in the last 1.5yrs.

Your completely right though, in hindsight it’s one of the best trades ever but going back who’d have thought it would’ve worked. Sure you’ve heard about Elon investing his last 30 million in Space x and Tesla back in 2008, its one of those things were if it works people are like wow crazy but when it doesn’t it’s like well obviously that wouldn’t have worked that was stupid but ultimately the decision was the same and the outcome was largely out of anyone’s control.\n\nI’d been following Tesla for a few years and when it dipped in May of 2019 I got in right at the end and have held through all the crazy swings, what especially convinced me was Adam Jonas saying they were going to $10 hahah I just thought everyone’s scared and we know buffets famous line.

{"title": "Story Time: $TSLA, SP500, 2020 Bubble & History", "selftext": "Disclaimer: Copied from [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ChrisBloomstran/status/1340414130658820096) by **Christopher Bloomstran**  \n\n\nLet’s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ \n\nFor all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard & Poor’s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday’s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&P 500 index. 2/ \n\nThe committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what’s hot and eliminates from its august roster what’s not. 3/ \n\nIt’s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 & early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ \n\nPull up the long-term charts to see how these “timely” additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ \n\nYahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ \n\nThe company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ \n\nThe stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn’t high point for another month. 8/ \n\nYahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn’t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \\~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ \n\nIn hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 ¾ years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ \n\nAt the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ \n\nBut the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ \n\nHeck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to “only” 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ \n\nSales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ \n\nYahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ \n\nThe buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I’d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ \n\nAt its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ \n\nHad Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ \n\nQualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ \n\nNever has the S&P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ \n\nOf course, by sales & profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that’s not what counts in the passive index. It’s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ \n\nTesla had cut R&D & SG&A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to “earn” a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ \n\nImpressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ \n\nOn November 16, the S&P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ \n\nThe gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement & addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world’s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla’s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ \n\nThe share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ \n\nLet’s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ \n\n25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota’s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft’s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ \n\n80% of Tesla’s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ \n\nThe stock will come in at \\~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ \n\nWhat prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \\~10% of the market value of the entire S&P 500 today. 31/ \n\nAt “only” 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ \n\nFor grins let’s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \\~3%, Toyota \\~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I’d bet heavily against. 33/ \n\nAt the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today’s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ \n\nTo finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ \n\nCar companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are \"assuming\" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ \n\nThe best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling “at-the-market” blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today’s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ \n\nThrough the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ \n\nSo far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B “at-the-market”). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn’t come from profit or free cash. 39/ \n\nTotal capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ \n\nFrom a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn’t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ \n\nOur example has Tesla’s market cap growing over the next decade at “only” 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don’t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ \n\nToyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ \n\nAuto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \\~3% net margins and earn that same \\~3% on capital and revenues grow at \\~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that’s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ \n\nThe best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won’t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it’s a CAR company. 45/ \n\nIf it earns Toyota’s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software “upgrades,” it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ \n\nThe realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ \n\nAsk the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid “break” here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can \"volunteer their time\" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won’t roll over and play dead. 48/ \n\nMy prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he’d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won’t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ \n\nThat leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ \n\nBy contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he’d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company’s shares. If the auto makers won’t take them in a deal, and they shouldn’t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ \n\nWe’ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla’s shares from here should be considered a “fee,” or a tax on stupidity. 52/ \n\nAt 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to….where Tesla’s shares began the year. 53/ \n\nA 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues & 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ \n\nYou can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit & returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today’s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ \n\nBravo, S&P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to “invest” 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, “Come Monday, it’ll be all right...” 56/ \n\nAs disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don’t take this note as investment advice because it’s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up & down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ \n\nIf Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that’s 70% larger than the entire S&P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END\n\nTL;DR1: TSLA may go down, not probably but maybe at some point after SP500 inclusion. Why? It's mentioned somewhere in above points comparing it to some historical events and what TSLA makes!\n\nTL;DR2 (from u/rch0wdhury): Yahoo failed after being added in S&P.

{"title": "$MT - a further dive into why this IS the steel play of 2021", "selftext": "Fresh off by two day ban in WSB jail, giving me plenty of time to further dive into why $MT is going to moon in 2021.\n\nFirst about $MT:\n\n* They are the world's LARGEST steel maker - and its not even close after #2.  [https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html](https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/top-producers.html)\n* ArcelorMittal also hit its $7 billion net debt target at the end of the 3rd quarter, **the lowest level since ArcelorMittal’s creation in 2006 and a point at which the company can start returning cash to shareholders**.\n* The company is poised to sell its U.S. assets in a cash and shares deal with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc for $1.4 billion in a deal that has allowed it to **launch a $500 million share buyback.**\n*  Under the terms of the sale, **ArcelorMittal has received $505 million cash, 78 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock and non-voting preferred stock which is redeemable for approximately 58 million shares of Cleveland-Cliffs common stock or an equivalent amount in cash -** meaning if $CLF performs well, $MT further benefits.\n* $MT has been selling off assets in the US for years to take advantage of currency advantage of manufacturing in Canada and cost labor advantage of manufacturing in Mexico:\n\n**Commenting, Mr. Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, ArcelorMittal, said:**\n\n*“This transaction is a unique opportunity for ArcelorMittal to unlock significant value for shareholders while retaining exposure to the North American economy through our high-quality NAFTA assets alongside a participation in what will be a stronger, better integrated, US business. I would like to thank all employees of ArcelorMittal USA for their hard work in ensuring the business maintained its reputation as a trusted, quality supplier of steels for American manufacturing. I am confident you will have a bright future with Cleveland-Cliffs.”*\n\n* Favorable valuation achieved for ArcelorMittal USA due to the high synergistic potential of the combined company. The Transaction valuation for ArcelorMittal USA equates to an enterprise value multiple of approximately 6x through-the-cycle EBITDA.\n* ArcelorMittal will participate in the upside potential of the larger combined company, which is more diversified, fully-integrated and has significant synergy potential\n* The deconsolidation of the associated liabilities at ArcelorMittal USA, comprising mostly pension and OPEB liabilities, will improve the Group’s risk profile, reduce net debt and strengthen its capital structure and credit metrics.\n\nLet's move on to mining because there are many that claim $VALE is the play because of iron ore.  $VALE is a good play, but $MT as it pertains to mining:\n\n*  $MT is active in the whole value chain, from exploration and development to mining, concentration, pelletizing, rail transport and port operations. With operations that span Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia, we aim to optimize our portfolio so we can deliver results at any point in the economic cycle, and to manage our assets to the highest standards. We are equally driven to mine responsibly and sustainably, minimizing the impact of mining on the natural environment, and working closely with local communities to build skills and social infrastructure to ensure long-term development.\n* We have a geographically diversified portfolio of 14 operating units in Brazil, Bosnia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mexico, Ukraine and United States that in 2019 produced **57.1 million tons of iron ore and 5.5 million tons of coking coal. Our main products include iron ore lump, fines, concentrate pellets and sinter feed, and coking coal, thermal coal and pulverized coal injection (PCI) coal.**\n\n**VERTICAL INTEGRATION -** so the largest steel maker in the world supplies over half of it's raw materials - allowing them to cost average down higher ore prices, thus expanding their margins on finished product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Global Reach](https://preview.redd.it/tuywroc1de661.png?width=2442&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dbe6c676ca6d74466ba1c8a478667ebb306f481)\n\n[Vertical Integration and #1 steel maker in the world](https://preview.redd.it/6g9xy2u6de661.png?width=2438&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf5e0e5859ece05b3a2fffbbc8f25f9e632b26e8)\n\n[Innovation](https://preview.redd.it/liqoe8rvce661.png?width=2439&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba733802b0cb55aa3b9b5331e73c0650a5dfbe81)\n\nThat brings me to the current DEMAND>>>>>SUPPLY situation the world is in regarding raw materials and finished goods.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE 2005, peaking like a rocket in 2008.  It had more legs in 2008, but the Great Recession put an abrupt end to the party.\n\nHere is where we stand as of last week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgt45uzbge661.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a4357d0d4adce59d8ca1de95c7d039976e24afd\n\nHere is an overall look of the past 18 years, notice 2008 and current action:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Starting to mirror 2008 action](https://preview.redd.it/37avzrvshe661.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5380d1b84263c0dc7ba7ddbb04f2a7b7d517422)\n\nIn 2008 $MT was trading at the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The run up and peak before the Great Recession collapse](https://preview.redd.it/t1nicl3oie661.png?width=1931&format=png&auto=webp&s=15a38b26fcefa2815baf39e518d917db28795ce0)\n\nThe difference between 2008 and today - there was more uncertainty believe it or not then in 2008 than today.  Banks were going out of business, the total collapse in mortgage backed securities and people walking away from homes.  Who in their right mind would ever want to own a home again?\n\nWell, that has changed dramatically, while things are still a bit uncertain - vaccines are rolling out world-wide.  Interest rates are at all time lows and will be in the US until at least 2023.  The exodus of people from high tax states and cities due to \"work from home\" changes has created a housing boom in the suburbs and rural areas.  Homes need steel for foundations, fasteners and more importantly large appliances - dishwashers, washers, dryers, stoves, etc.  Have you seen Whirlpool stock this year?  $74 to $188, went over $200 - demand and higher steel prices = higher revenues.  When new homes and communities are built - the infrastructure follows -schools, hospitals, government buildings, shopping - all large projects that use massive amounts of steel.\n\nSpeaking of interest rates, outside of the US in recent years, an increasing number of central banks have resorted to low-rate policies. Several, including the European Central Bank and the central banks of Denmark, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, have started experimenting with ***negative interest rates*** **—essentially making banks pay to park their excess cash at the central bank. The aim is to encourage banks to lend out those funds instead, thereby countering the weak growth that persisted after the 2008 global financial crisis.** \n\nThe point being to all of this is **THIS IS NOT A LIQUIDITY CRISIS** like we saw in 2008 - banks are printing money at a rate that we are seeing inflation and hyper inflation in commodity prices - the US Dollar Index now stands at the lowest level since January of 2014 and is expected to further decline. A weaker US Dollar buys less in foreign goods, thus further increasing the price of imported goods.\n\nOk, now that I have bored you to death here is the point:\n\n**$MT TAKEAWAYS:**\n\n* Upgraded by SocGen to $39 PT - they doubled EBITDA estimates for 2021 and 2022 **50% above market consensus.**\n* Goldman Sachs keeps buy rating increasing to $29USD PT [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/ARCELORMITTAL-Gets-a-Buy-rating-from-Goldman-Sachs-32032450/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/ARCELORMITTAL-Gets-a-Buy-rating-from-Goldman-Sachs-32032450/)\n* Jeffries maintains buy rating with $27 PT\n*   [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/Market-Chatter-ArcelorMittal-Lifts-Hot-Rolled-Coil-Prices-by-EUR50-MT-S-P-Global-Platts-Reports-32039746/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARCELORMITTAL-34942237/news/Market-Chatter-ArcelorMittal-Lifts-Hot-Rolled-Coil-Prices-by-EUR50-MT-S-P-Global-Platts-Reports-32039746/)\n*  ArcelorMittal has held recent discussions with automakers over annual contracts and has been **targeting a €100-120/t increase**, according to market participants. Carmakers negotiating backdated deals have staunchly refused to pay such increases after securing rollovers or slight discounts from other mills. **But those negotiating calendar-year 2021 prices have been left with little room to negotiate, given the rocketing spot market and higher contract settlements with general industry participants**. \n*  The company’s current stock price of a little over $23 reflects a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 6x, which is lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 7.2x for major iron ore miners and much lower than the average forward P/E multiple of 12.8x for the broader metals and mining industry.  **Thus, at this point ArcelorMittal’s stock seems to be undervalued.** It should be $36-$38 based on this alone.\n\nI believe we will see some bigger moves of $MT over the next 6-8 weeks.  \n\nMy PT is $30 to $40 (BULL) by mid-February and believe earnings in February will smash expectations, further gapping up the stock like we saw in 2007-08.\n\nI do not believe we will see $300 again this cycle, but SUPER BULL scenario could be $100, as I now believe based on futures orders now being pushed at to May, there are further legs for increases throughout 2021.  \n\nI like the common stock, based on the undervalue P/E multiple alone.\n\nI love the options for Feb-June based on earnings and anticipation of a blow-out quarter as more is reported daily on steel and shortages.\n\nGood luck!", "id": "kh2tvc", "created_utc": 1608499967.0, "score": 1254, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 521, "comments": [{"body": "This is the most responsible ticker on wsb and that makes me nervous...\n\n\nBut I already bought some based off a random post from 2 weeks ago so 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "score": 289, "replies": [{"body": "Spits on hands* bring me my mum’s cheque book!", "score": 27, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why does that make you nervous?", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thank u steel daddy", "score": 168, "replies": [{"body": "Welcome", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "Do you think my Jan 15 25$ calls are fucked", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Bro they're gonna be 25 by thursday.", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "I hope you are right.
