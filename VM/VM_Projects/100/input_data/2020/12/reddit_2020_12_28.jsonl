The goal should be only risking 1-2% of your total capital in a single trade. if your starting Capital is like 2k the 100 dollars is 5%. You are already taking on risk by trading larger.\n\nThe biggest reason to keep in mind. You will not win every trade. Trades do go bad, the market does a random walk that no one can really predict.

A typical handling sequence is first the broker evaluates the order for their own accounts. If they like the trade, they pick it up and you get the benefit of a very quick fill.

The underlying  stock is perhaps one of the biggest names in big tech such as AAPL,  AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, etc.  My point for using this detail is to imply that  there is a fairly high probability that the company will ultimately  appreciate during the course of the 365 - 535 days.  With this long ITM  call, you plan to simulate owning the stock and selling weekly OTM  covered calls against it for profit and weekly revenue with deltas  around .\n\nLet's say that something  happens in the economy or specifically with the company you purchased  the long Call for and this issue causes a temporary, gradual downtrend  in the underlying and your long Call option during a period of about 3 -  6 months before the value eventually recovers.  Specifically, after  purchasing the Call option, you eventually realize that you unknowingly  purchased it during a time that it was near the all time high and it has  been gradually declining in value ever since.\n\nYou  want to sell weekly call options OTM expiring on a Friday of each week  with deltas of 0.24 to 0.35 with roughly a 72% - 80% chance of the  strike price NOT being reached for any given week.\n\nDuring  the middle of the 3 month gradual downtrend of the underlying stock,  the total value of your long Call option is reduced by about 40% - 50%  because it has a much larger delta compared to the weekly OTM calls you  are selling.\n\nNow, let's say one of  those weeks during the 3 month downtrend, the value of the stock  increases to a point that is not a full recovery from the original price  it was when you bought the long call, but it increases just enough to a  point where it still exceeds the strike price of your weekly call  option.  What I am saying here is that your long Call ITM is still at a  big loss yet your weekly call option goes ITM and is vulnerable to being  exercised.\n\nWhat do people do in this bad situation?  Here are the only choices I can think of and each one seems really unfavorable.\n\n1. Keep  holding the long Call in hopes it will eventually recover and increase  in value.  As soon as the value of the stock reaches the strike price,  immediately buy back the Call option for more money than you sold it  for.  At the same time, you would feel a little content that perhaps the  underlying stock is partially recovering in value and moving towards  what it was when you originally purchased the long Call.\n2. Liquidate  the long Call by selling it back to the market for significantly LESS  money than it was worth when you originally bought the Call.  Even  though you are coming out at a loss, the money you receive is still  worth more than the cost to buy back the weekly ITM Call option so that  it is not exercised.\n\nNormally,  investors think of the synthetic covered call strategy as being highly  profitable because during an uptrend, their long ITM Call is guaranteed  to always increase in value much more than their weekly provided they  are still far away from expiration and their long Call delta is much  higher than their weekly.  However, you would no longer think of your  long ITM Call as \"insurance\" against the weekly OTM calls if your long  Call is worth less than what you bought it for, correct?\n\nAs  experienced options traders, what would you do in this bad situation?   How would you handle selling weekly Call options while owning a long  Call ITM that is worth much less than what you bought it for?\n\nA  better question for experienced options traders is this:  Do you still  view a long ITM Call as \"insurance\" against your weekly OTM Call options  if it gets sold back at a loss compared to when you bought it?  I  thought the whole purpose of the long ITM call was to be sold back for a  profit.  But do options traders mean \"for a profit\" when compared to  the weekly you'd have to buy back, or compared to the original price you  sold the ITM call for several months prior?\n\nSorry  for so many questions.

But options contracts, and the abilities they grant the contract-holder, are assets that have value based on demand. The average value of all the options contracts should just reflect how much demand there is for them, which will go up or down depending on investor sentiment.\n\nIf money pours into the options market, and the extrinsic value of options increases (say, because of the belief that volatility will be higher), then the average value of extant option contracts and writing new contracts goes up, right? And if money leaves the options market, then the average value of options will decrease, right?\n\nThis is the same basic dynamic as the stock market, which is not a zero-sum game (chasing alpha is), except that economic growth drives money entering the stock market rather than volatility. It's obviously safer to assume that, in general, there will be economic growth in the future whereas it's not safe to assume that volatility will increase, so it's smarter to buy and hold in the stock market than the options market, but that's how the \"sum\" or average gains of the market works, right?\n\nSorry, not trying to be argumentative, it's just the only way I know to ask the question is to lay out the reasoning and have someone tell me where it goes wrong, if it does.\n\nIf I just pick a random (weighted by capitalization) stock, on average, my investment should increase if the stock market overall increases and decrease if the stock market overall decreases.

Today there are very few hunter-gatherer societies in existence.\n\nMany people also create their own businesses (or invest in other people's businesses, which is essentially what the stock market is for), and even more people invest in education/training so they can improve their earning opportunities. \n\nIt seems a little strange to suggest that the fact that people who invest in means of production or in their own skills can almost always make more money than unskilled labor means that the system is \"fundamentally broken\" or \"hopelessly broken\". It seems worthwhile for society to encourage investment in skills by promoting education, investment in savings and means of production by promoting opt-out retirement systems including 401(k), to avoid \"leaving people behind\" by having some degree of social safety net, and so on.\n\nIt's important to be aware that investments almost always carry a degree of risk - the \"sure thing\" investments usually have very low return. In general and over the long run stock market gains exceed the risks, or the stock market wouldn't exist, but the fact of the risk and the need for a financial incentive to take the risk should not be ignored. People who took a large risk and bought TSLA in mid-2019 helped to keep the stock alive and have been richly rewarded by the gains since then. And a large percentage of those people got the money for those investments from labor. On the other hand, many people who invested in NKLA have lost money as the stock price has dropped. Among people who consider investor gains somehow unfair and those who think the investors should be relieved of those \"undeserved gains\", few think that the government should also reimburse investors who lose their money (other than the relatively small tax loss write-off).\n\nIt's also important to be aware that the stocks such as TSLA that grow over many years are often associated with major disruptions in the economic and financial system, in Tesla's case the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles, to energy storage systems, and many other transitions on the way. If these transitions result in net benefit to society, it makes sense for those responsible (including its investors) to gain economic benefit from their actions.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Add to that automation of jobs, including AI, and it starts getting even more complex and accelerated.
