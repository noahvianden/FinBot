Regardless many cloud professionals note that the option of a \"multi-cloud\" strategy offers a ton of diminishing returns.

Regardless on prem data centers usually will always be much more costly for an organization that doesn't make it their business just from a man power and maintenance perspective and then there begins the issue of content delivery networks to speed up the rate at which end users receive content and that becomes EXTREMELY costly for any organization to implement. \n\nSecond of all, on-prem really cannot do stuff better than cloud with cheaper costs. The reason is because of the time and effort required to actually build and prepare servers and the difficulty that comes with scaling up compute infrastructure as needed.

You are entrusting the provider with a lot, and allowing them to very closely study your business. \n\nThere are some major accounting differences, where on-prem expenditures are capex vs cloud costs being opex.

The issue happens when you get into the whole concept of Cloud Native Development since a ton of cloud providers offer essentially pipelines as a service and highly expendable compute resources. Of course there are a ton of tools in place to help combat the idea of being too tied into one cloud provider. The suite of cloud agnostic tools, Hashicorp makes a ton of them. But even those tools still require specific configurations for the vendor that's being used. If an organization opts for an entire serverless implementation with cloud managed gateways and load balancers then most of the time that organization is going to write a ton of code specific for the cloud vendor they chose.

You’re entirely right, I don’t think most people realize there’s much not much to be done at all. We just really have to try and make the most out of what we’ve got and treat symptoms as well as we can. I’m 21 and have had my health decline significantly since my sophomore year of high school. My mom likely has myasthenia gravis, she and I both have small fiber neuropathy, i have crohn’s and PANDAS as well as numerous autoimmune issues not only from the crohn’s, and my girlfriend likely has hypothyroidism and fibromyalgia along with other health problems. I’d say my neuropathy is what probably bothers me this most. Being in constant physical pain is more than most people can even imagine what it would feel like. \n\nI understand your struggles with your flares and making money. I had to medically withdraw out of college because of my crohn’s and my health drastically dropping. I had a b1 deficiency and was throwing up everyday 3-4 times. Then the neuropathy got drastically worse after. It’s been very hard for me to figure out stable income and a job, as i can’t work the usual 9-5. I have a dream of making a social music app to compete with Spotify and Apple Music and am learning programming, but as my health has gotten worse i’ve had to take a step back from it. If it’s ever big and I make bank, I plan on donating to help research for many diseases. I’m considering learning to day trade as well, it seems like a really good option honestly. \n\nSorry for the life story, just thought you could maybe relate.

My philosophy is, if you’re in enough pain or your health is bad enough, you’ll try anything to feel better. That’s why I gave holistic medicine a chance as well as conventional medicine, i think they both should work in tandem together. I won’t go into all of it, unless you’re interested in his work, but he helped me to do numerous lifestyle changes that really made a difference. It helped my crohn’s and neuropathy and health. I’m still struggling a lot, but have made great strides thanks to him. I’ve considered prednisone to help me gain weight if it will, i weigh 120 at 21 years old haha. \n\nI take an herb called kratom that works similar to an opioid and it’s what helps my pain more than anything a doctor has ever given me. It’s cousin to the coffee plant. There’s lots of propaganda surrounding it because it interferes with big pharma’s drug money so they don’t like that, so if you’re interested about it PM me and we can talk. If you run a google search it’ll likely show at the top a CDC article about it killing people, which it never has. So be careful and skeptical with the info about it on a google search. Just wanted to mention that it helps me more than anything with my pain. \n\nYeah being 21 and my girlfriend 19 and struggling with health problems is extremely tough. We feel more like 50 years old with how bad we feel daily haha. I’m sorry to here that about your father and MS, it’s a terrible disease. My mom and I are still trying to figure out why we both have small fiber neuropathy and if it’s genetic. Myasthenia gravis can cause small fiber, so i may have myasthenia gravis too if she does. Still waiting on test results for her. \n\nI am home a ton, I’ll definitely take your advice and look into swing trading. It seems worth my time to look into it for sure. Congrats on the $1000 the other day, that’s awesome. My TDA account is mainly safe, long term companies, but I do have a robinhood account with some play money. I think i’ll research and learn swing trading and maybe try it out on that account. Seems like a great idea for us with chronic health issues. \n\nThank you! It’s definitely a huge endeavor, but I believe in my dream and that it can be successful. I have a full prototype wireframe conveying the idea, but have to learn the Swift language first so I can make it. It’s definitely tough to work with the illness, I hate how many people in the US think you’re not worth a fuck if you don’t work. I would love to be healthy and love to work and create things, so i’d give anything to be able to work all day like some people do. I think many people see us as lazy, but if they took a step in our shoes they’d see how terrible the struggle is physically and mentally. Thankfully, as I’m sure you have the same, I have my good days and bad days. So I’m thankful for the good ones, even if an hour later they might turn bad and my pain gets terrible. I wish you the best of luck on your series on youtube! I just started youtubing as well, it may be a good idea for us to have passive income. Hopefully you can get the flares under control soon.

Buy puts when you think the price of the stock will go down.  \n\n\nThe hard part is: market makers have priced the premiums needed to buy contracts on how much they think the stock price will move.  This is called implied volatility (IV).  To make money, the stock has to move more than the IV.  The other thing counting against you is time.  Unlike stocks, when you buy an options contract, it has a specific expiration date.  When that date is hit and the price of the stock is not above or below the strike (depending on call or put), it expires worthless.  You lose 100% of what you put in.  Note that you can sell to close your contract at anytime before expiration to take profit or reclaim some of your money back.  However, expiration isn't the only thing working against you, every day your option gets closer to expiration, time decay reduces the value of your contract.  If the stock is flat, you lose value.  Since options are derivatives, they move more quickly than the stock price.  If the stock goes up 5%, the option value can up (or down) much faster.  So it's quite easy to be up 20% on an option one day and suddenly down 60% the next.  Unlike stocks, you have to watch options regularly and timing the market becomes much more important.  I guess the last thing to know is that options don't expire when the market closes, it expires some time after.  Which means that AH action can exercise your option if it suddenly makes it into the money.  In this case, you can automatically exercise your option to buy the stock (which costs you more money), but still be losing money because the stock price is above your strike, but not enough to cover the premium cost.

When building such systems the first results are easy, but adding an extra 9 of reliability costs exponentially much, because a system that can do 99.99% might have to be redesigned from scratch to do 99.999%. Most people tend to assume that a 99.99% system just needs \"more time to learn\" to get 99.99999%, but that's not how it works.\n\nEven that might not be enough for European regulators, however. \n\nWhen such things are discussed in /r/SelfDriving, you get banned, because you do not buy into the religion of self-driving cars. I have no doubt that a self-driving car could be produced that reaches a million miles without intervention, but none of the companies have the capabilities to do so for a price that is affordable.\n\nCan a car be created, which drives large sections of a highway under reasonable conditions? Perhaps, but how is Tesla going to show that under all possible conditions it works?\n\nFor example, this happened in 2016: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk. \n\nYou might say \"Hey, that was a long time ago!\", but why does this then happen in 2020:\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/06/02/tesla-in-taiwan-crashes-directly-into-overturned-truck-ignores-pedestrian-with-autopilot-on/ ?\n\nRight, I am a religious zealot, which just sees the proof that even the most basic features don't work?\n\nNote that I didn't even know of the 2020 article before I was writing this comment, but such things are inevitable given that their technology is flawed in its very foundations.

I don't need to see their source code to understand how it works, because based on the kinds of things it fails at, I can derive the design. \n\nI'd tell them to fire all their engineers and hire a bunch of researchers and go back to the drawing board. They quite literally don't know what they are doing. Perhaps some progress can be made, but the most likely outcome is that despite 7nm chips being used, it's just not enough.\n\nThe technology required to make a self-driving car could also be used for other more limited domains and even in those domains nothing is working on a commercial level. \n\nSelf-driving car prototypes only exist, because Silicon Valley is bored and many take Ubers to work; 99.9% of the population doesn't take an Uber to work. I am not waiting to get into a self-driving death trap anytime soon. It's not because I am against progress, but I don't think they are progressing at all. You might point at some features \"But it can do red lights now\" (well, it really can't, because in 2020 I have seen pictures of it failing spectacularly), but ultimately none of those features work as well as in a well rested human. \n\nBy which year does a self-driving car exists that works as well as KITT did in fiction?

{"title": "GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.", "selftext": "So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp\n\nFor example let’s assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.\n\nYou short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  \n\nBorrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.\n\nSo max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.\n\nYour break even is kind of ass but that’s because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  \n\nIf it’s a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it’s 18.8.  \n\nThat’s a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.\n\nSo the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.\n\nFor example today alone 8m shares were shorted.\n\nhttps://fintel.io/ss/us/gme\n\nYesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren’t going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.\n\nBut why has it been spiking if it’s not a short squeeze, and that’s really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don’t buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.\n\nBut Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He’s in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn’t being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.\n\nThen finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That’s what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn’t going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn’t going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.\n\n\nTL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don’t be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options.", "id": "kil4wu", "created_utc": 1608694267.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 447, "comments": [{"body": "Will read when I get the Chance and respond appropriately\n\nEdit: Read it.

Most of them weren’t that smart. And they just followed the pack. There’s safety in the pack. There’s commissions. You don’t left holding the bag, as you find someone else to trade and potential liabilities to, and you trade all those deals on an added percentage meaning you get rich off of two retirement funds essentially betting against one another.\n\nNow a days there is a lot more strict rules about who can be a banker at that level.

Short of a congressional investigation no way to know for sure though.  Again this is personal theory I think Citron pumped it and then switched over to shorting it before releasing a short report. (See PLTR, NIO) with the intent of banking on way up and down.\n\nAt this point instead of it going down it reversed course and shit went off the rails for the shorts.  Basically instead of citron making money on the way down they accelerated the squeeze instead.\n\nAlso adding to this Blackrock had opened up a huge position on the long side.  So functionally not only were the shorts fighting all of retail but two significant institutional investors. \n\nAlso worth noting is that management of GME with appointing Cohen to the board effectively took the relief valve of GME issuing shares off the table as well.  \n\nSome other notes I misread the way fintel reports short sales and interest, which skewed things a bit.  \n\nThis really is the type of stuff that ends up in finance textbooks about risk management as a cautionary tale.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Gayyyyyy as fuck Butt homie", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "You're getting downvoted, but short squeezes are quite rare", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Its also extremely rare for a company to be shorted 3x over lol", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Downvotes are better than losses.

{"title": "$SNOW MASSIVE Dilution Incoming & Easy Put Opportunity $$$", "selftext": "I put together the below DD for retards in bullets so you retards could easily follow. Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a tremendous Put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:\n\n1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.\n2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct.\n3. The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.\n\n* The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales.\n   * Snow CEO makes $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can't imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this\n* Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book.\n   * Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market\n* Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially.\n* The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.\n* Since my balls don't drag on the ground when I walk, I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. Positions below, $10k in each.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS1 showing upcoming lockup expiration of 37M shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpvqrfsaiv661.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=448f95d3fafacb49c7d6909407d9b49b097b26ec\n\nThis shows price to sales ratio for large companies and how massively overvalued SNOW is, this is a few weeks old but still relevant\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vxx36cblv661.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=a35f52e32eaa555e20a0e5ab3fd3e49a55acf811\n\nTwo positions, no I don't use RH to trade but this is the screenshot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd2z7n4giv661.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41b5b22a7a639546ca0f77c43c91722816cf7540", "id": "kina26", "created_utc": 1608702321.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "320P 1/08/2021  here\n\nDown \\~52% now.

So if there aren’t enough buyers as shares flood the market because people want to cash out, the stock will go down regardless of the market. Especially with a very small float today.

Lenin!*  *Vladimir Illanich Uleninov!*\n\n***Donny***:*What the fuck is he talking about, Dude?*\n\n\n\n\nHello again, GME Gang. What a fun day we had yesterday! Could it continue today? Only Melvin Capital (and maybe Ryan Cohen) knows!\n\nAnd an extra special hello today to our newest WSB lookie-loo, Mr. Cramer (Can I call you Jim? I’m gonna call you Jim).  \n\nNow Jim, from what I’ve been able to gather, you and your Boomer stocks and your Hot Manic Takes don’t always get a lot of love around here. But that’s not *all* your fault, Jim. The Paste-Eating Rocket Kids are often good for a solid meme (FYI: it’s pronounced “Mee-Mee.” Feel free to use that on air without verifying). But the Rocket Kids can be a dense bunch and they’re also often one click away from Total Financial Ruin (Quick shout out to SPCE: Pleas fly again). So you have to dig a bit in here to separate the wheat from the chaff, as someone like you actually says in real life. What the fuck even is chaff, Jim? And why do all Boomers seem to think that folksy farm-based idioms are the perfect way to conclude a thought?\n\nAnyway. Those of us who watched your teevee clips last week where you reference your interest in WSB know that you, Jim Cramer, might be one of the Olds, but that you also Think Young(TM). [https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15](https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/stock-market-advice-moderna-boeing-fed-ftc-dec-15). So we’re going to do our best to help your young-thinkin’ brain find the Needle In the Haystack here so you can get All Your Ducks In a Row on GME.  Because we know that you’re a long way from being Put Out to Pasture, and though you may be an out-of-touch millionaire prone to facile yammering, we now ***like*** you here, Jim—simply because you mentioned us and that made us blush a bit since we’re needy Millennials who just want our Boomer mommies and daddies to Tell Us They’re Proud of Us. So even though the Paste-Eating Rocket Kids here are often Buying A Pig in a Poke (Christ, please do not *ever* say that or the kids’ Mee-Mees are gonna fuck you up), we appreciate you recognizing that, every now and then, there’s something worth paying attention to over in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs.  And since you’re actually telling your loyal single-finger-typin’ viewers to check out this WSB shitshow, and “*if they’re running GME, then do some work on GME*,” we assume you might actually be checking this shit out too, since all true Young Thinkers know that What’s Good for the Goose is Good for the Gander. \n\nNow, is the GME play as solid as your recent recommendation to buy Bed Bath and Beyond? Who knows? That seems pretty stupid, and I would look it up myself this weekend but my nice little Saturday is already pretty full so I don’t know—I don’t know if I’ll have enough time. But I’ll tell you one thing: the GME play is **a lot more fucking fun**.  Life in a pandemic is boring, but here in this weird WSB place, these kids like fun.  And for all your Boomer weirdness, you seem like you still like to have a little fun in this Mad, Mad world of ours. So consider joining us here more often.  A word of warning, though: if you don’t like all the dern cuss words we use around here, Jim, well that’s just, like, your opinion man, and we’ll have you know that the Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint. \n\nFirst thing’s first: we have a bit of a bone to pick with you (now there *I* go). The stuff you said last week about GME as the next Blockbuster was D-U-M dumb, Jim. You were a bit out of your fucking element with that.  You even made our largest shareholder and conqueror-in-waiting, Mr. Ryan Cohen, send an emoji-only tweet in response, which if you know the super nice-guy Ryan Cohen like all of us do (we actually know nothing), that is pretty much the equivalent of him bringing his dog over to micturate on your and George Sherman’s rug.\n\nNow, I myself have never been into the whole brevity thing, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get you up to speed on the GME movie you’ve wandered into. And I know you’re down with this because you told all your viewers that if WSB is talking about GME, then “make sure you know GME.” So before you say something Absolutely Mad again and Cohen sends a tweet with an even less ambiguous emoji, it’s high time that you start Making the Sure here, Jim. Just consider this to be CPT Hubbard delivering you some Orange Sunshine and turning you on to some of that Sweet, Delicious Non-Chaff Wheat you love so goddamn much. \n\n**Part 1: GME’s Bonkers-Ass Short Interest**\n\nNow, I’m going to lead with the most crowd-pleasing part of the story here (Get ready, Rocket Kids!), and it’s the one that you did not even seem remotely familiar with in your “Stay out of GameStop, Deadbeat!” rant last week. Maybe that was by design or maybe not. We’ll return to that, Jim. But the point here is: the **short interest here is batshit insane**. And not just your garden variety Boomer in Rolled Up Sleeves Ranting About Buying Estee Lauder While Hitting Buttons On The Beep-Bop-Boop Machine kind of insanity. Really and truly fucking nuts.\n\nSo to TL/DR this shit for you, Jim (to use the parlance of our times): GME is **the** **most shorted stock** **trading today—by far**.   [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) How shorted? Well, the value of shares short exceeds the market cap of the company; there are currently ***more shares short than the total number of shares outstanding***. And when factoring in the institutional and insider ownership, the total short percentage of float is **nearly 300%**. [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp) Even higher, actually, now that Cohen’s interest is over 10%.  Now, I’m not a numbers whiz like you, but that level of short interest and the small available float seems pretty fucked up to me. Like: “how is that even legal?” fucked up. And just for a frame of reference, the **third most shorted** security right now is your beloved Bed Bath and Beyond, with a short percentage of float at a nice and tidy 69%. \n\nAre you starting to gather why some of us in this weird little pocket of the Interwebs are a little excited about GME? You see, as u/Jeffamazon and RodAlzmann u/Uberkikz11 and others have explained in these here corners and on the twitter machine with their top-notch DD, and as I will translate to you in lingo you can dig, the short sellers got way over their skiis on this one expecting a bankruptcy in Spring of 2020 that never came. And yet, amazingly, the short interest has only **increased** since then—there has effectively been no covering in the aggregate and, in fact, the short percentage has only **gone up**. And now, on the threshold of 2021, we all sit atop a massive powder keg wondering what is going to be the thing that finally lights this shit up. And at the end of this little missive, I’m going to tell you what I think that thing might be (Spoiler: It’s Ryan Cohen! Better start getting used to seeing his name, Jim, because this dude does not fuck around and he’s not going anywhere). \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the\\_real\\_greatest\\_short\\_burn\\_of\\_the\\_century\\_part/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann)\n\n[https://thecollective.finance/2020/10/gamestop-gme-a-squeeze-to-44-from-14-can-be-justified-fundamentally-100-of-the-shares-are-short-watch-out/](https://thecollective.finance/2020/10/gamestop-gme-a-squeeze-to-44-from-14-can-be-justified-fundamentally-100-of-the-shares-are-short-watch-out/)\n\n**Part 2****: GameStop Isn’t Going Bankrupt and People Actually Want to Buy Shit There**\n\nSo, you foul mouthed little prick, a bonkers-ass short interest is neat and all, but why is Jim Cramer wrong when Jim Cramer compares GME to Blockbuster you might be asking yourself in the third person. First, the most obvious answer, Jim, which you should fucking know already: Blockbuster was **nearly $1 Billion in debt** and missing debt payments left and right when it was delisted way back in 2010. That was also when there was a bit of a credit crunch, if you recall, right after that whole Housing Crash Unpleasantness that you saw coming from a mile away and from which you made hundreds of millions of dollars due to your contrarian foresight—I’m sorry, I’m clearly confusing you with Christian Bale starring as Dr. Michael Burry, weirdo head of Scion Asset Management, which also holds about 1.4M shares of GME (You really gotta start looking into this stuff, Jim. This story is made for TV, man—and you Boomers were raised by TV and you turned out TV!). Also, in 2010 when Netflix is ripping and when Blockbuster was about to be delisted and bankrupt, an analyst noted the obvious fact that Blockbuster  had “nothing on the horizon that makes it look like Blockbuster is going to be more profitable.” \n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockbuster/blockbuster-wins-debt-reprieve-forced-to-delist-idUSTRE66052720100702) \n\nBut Jim, if your Blockbuster comparison has any plausibility, GameStop must have a major debt problem then, right? And yet just last month GameStop **repaid $125M in debt** several months ahead of time. It’s also really weird that over the past year management bought back a ton of shares, taking the OS from 102M **down to just under 70M** (making a short squeeze even more likely, my Rocket Children). The weirdness continues with a soon-to-be-bankrupt company holding almost $500M in cash on hand. And according to George Sherman’s “Thine Omnichannel Shalt Be The Omni-est Channel of Them All” Conference Call following Q3, by March 2021 GME will have retired a total of $500M in debt and returned $200M to shareholders through stock buy backs. I’m no expert here, and I do not presently own a Beep-Bop-Boop Machine, but that’s all pretty weird shit to be doing if you’re about to go bankrupt.\n\nNo, no – I get it: who the fuck actually looks at balance sheets anyway before spouting off about what a stock is going to do? I sure as hell don’t. That’s why I follow my man u/Uberkikz11, since that dude is a GME DD Encyclopedia and was born to crunch numbers. No, when Really Smart People make the Blockbuster comparison, it’s usually just Mouth Sounds for: A B&M Store That Used to Be Popular But Now Is Not Because Technology, QED. But here even the Really Smart People might be missing something as well. They’re right in the sense that GME must use this new console cycle window and cash influx to quickly pivot to a tech-first gaming company (more on that and our boy RC shortly!), but they’re wrong on the timing and relevance of this Super Smart Insight.\n\nSo fine, they’re doing ok on debt and cash. But who even goes to that 90s-Ass-Looking Cluttered Mall Geekery anymore anyways? I confess: in my darkest moments, as the short sellers manipulate the fuck out of this stock and I curse the names Bell and Sherman, I too have wondered this. But it turns out that, just like I have no idea why anyone listens to Maroon 5 or eats at Applebee’s, apparently a lot of people in America do shit that I do not. Crazy huh? So here is some pretty neat data showing us how out of touch we might be here, Jim: \n\nFirst, when a pretty large sample size of people were recently asked the question: *which of the following stores or websites do you plan to buy holiday gifts from*? The **#5 response** from United States Americans was none other than **GameStop** (Ticker, Jim: GME). Only Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Dollar Store (poor people buy gifts too, Jim) were ahead of little old GameStop. That’s higher than Nike, Macy’s, the Apple Store—and **double** the response of Bed Bath and Fucking Beyond in every category they surveyed. Check it: (h/t to my man u/snowk88) \n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/260983915)\n\nThat’s kinda crazy huh? See Jim, when you Think Young(TM), you really can learn something new every day. And by following our man u/snowk88 (@snowk88 over at stocktwits), I learn lots of cool shit. But guess who already knew that? The guy that wrote this bad-ass letter that identifies GME’s brand and customer data as being one of the most valuable things GME has going for it. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\\_Ventures\\_Letter\\_to\\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) \n\nSo now we know that Real Life People actually buy shit at GameStop here in the year of our lord 2020. But like that analyst from 2010 said about Blockbuster, there must not be anything on the horizon for GameStop to be more profitable in 2021, right?\n\nNow, I will admit that being a bit bearish on GME in December of 2020 would make more sense if, say, GameStop were the nation’s largest purveyor of limp and half-lit pumpkin spice-scented candles and we were exiting the apogee of Shitty Candle Season. But as it turns out, GameStop is currently selling basically the most sought-after items that exist in the marketplace right now—where demand for the Xbox and Ps5 is far outpacing supply and is projected to continue well into 2021.  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-17-microsoft-expects-xbox-series-x-s-shortages-until-q2-2021) I don’t really need to get into the details on that here, because it’s pretty goddamn obvious, but I think 2020 GameStop at the precipice of a new console cycle might be in a bit of a better position than, say, 2010 Blockbuster relying on the latest Adam Sandler release to lift its sagging rental numbers. But I don’t know. Millions of people don’t watch *my* show looking for Candid Analysis from me and *my* folksy man-of-the-people-lookin’ rolled-up sleeves.\n\n**Part 3:** **Ryan Cohen is the Sword of Damocles Hanging Over the Short Sellers’ Dumbass Heads** \n\nAnd now we’ve gotten to the best part. It’s my favorite part of all of this, Jim, and if you give this a little time, I think it will be yours too. You see, all that corporate bla bla bla about balance sheets and console cycles and early debt repayment and overleveraged short sellers and brand recognition is neat and all—and definitely worth a second look by itself. Maybe even a little Beep-Bop-Boop on the ol’ sound machine—I don’t know your methods. But the real thing that’s about to rip all our faces off here is the business and investment decisions of a mild-mannered wunderkind named Ryan Cohen.\n\nNow you can revisit my prior epistle if you want to know a bit more about the involvement of Mr. Ryan Cohen in *Le Affair* *GameStop*. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme\\_tribe\\_a\\_story\\_about\\_how\\_ryan\\_cohen\\_is\\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/).  My fly-by-night theory of his lawyer’s possible use of the consent solicitation could have probably marinated for another day, but the thrust of my argument there was that Cohen and his attorney have been laying the groundwork to come after GameStop for a while now. And that Cohen was likely emboldened by the humiliating, lame-ass CC performance by some dude with a mid-century comic-strip sounding name that we’ll all soon know only as: The Guy With the Punchable Face Who Used to Be CEO of GameStop.\n\nBut here is where things get really interesting. This is a story in the making, Jim, for fucks sake - take notes! This Monday, on December 21, Mr. Ryan Cohen filed a revised 13D showing that last week he started buying a shit-ton of shares—starting on Tuesday December 15th—which is ***the day after*** the stock price inexplicably plunged on Monday the 14th and the very same day you were yammering on the teevee about GME being Blockbuster! Instead of listening to you, however, Cohen started buying more GME shares (super-sleuth dark pool watchers u/rgrAi and u/snowk88 noticed in real-time that there was some very large accumulation taking place), which culminated in the big reveal that Cohen purchased a total of 2,501,000 additional shares last week—500,000 of which were purchased on Friday December 18, 2020 **at the price of $16.02 a share**. Ryan Cohen is still the single largest shareholder of GME with 9,001,000 shares in total, taking his ownership of GME above the 10% threshold from 9.98% to 12.9%. And so he apparently thinks that the floor for his investment is $16.02 per share. Is he still buying? We’ll know soon. But yesterday seemed like a little taste of what it might look like if a large buyer steps in to prevent short sellers from manipulating all of my nervous little Rocket Children here and their delicate little paper hands.\n\nThere was another thing we learned from this 13D filing: Ryan Cohen has apparently hired a new attorney and law firm. Instead of the great Christopher Davis of Kline Kaplan, now Ryan Cohen is represented by Ryan P. Nebel, a partner with Olshan Frome Wolosky, LLP.  Now, if you’re familiar with my prior ramblings, you might wonder if I was a bit confused, and maybe even a little sad, at this sudden change from my man C. Davis. And you might be a little right. But then the wonder of the internet allowed me to learn a bit about these new lawyers. And holy shit, things are about to get fun.\n\nNow, I liked what I knew about Chris Davis and he seems like a genuine bad ass activist attorney. But the folks at Olshan Frome and Wolosky, LLP are Next Level Players and really seem tailor-made for this exact situation. First off, Olshan is ranked as **the top global lawfirm** for Activist Attorneys. [https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf](https://www.olshanlaw.com/assets/htmldocuments/Bloomberg%20Activism%20League%20Tables%20H12020.pdf) (H/t @flummoxed at stocktwits). They seem to be the go-to law firm for major proxy battles initiated by activist investors. But possibly even more important is that Olshan is the ***same firm that represented Hestia and Permit*** in their successful proxy battle earlier this year to appoint two new directors to the GME Board.  I’m not going into the fine details of that, because this is already a bit of a long-form Idiot’s New Yorker article, but GameStop just went through a proxy fight last year with Activist Investors Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, which resulted in two Board seats for our shareholder buds from Hestia and Permit. So, it’s reasonable to assume that the attorneys at Olshan might know their way around GameStop at this point and where the pressure points are here. \n\n[http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/](http://www.globallegalchronicle.com/hestia-capital-and-permit-capitals-two-new-directors-to-the-gamestop-board/)\n\n[https://www.olshanlaw.com/resources-mentions-HestiaCapital-PermitCapital-GameStop-BoardofDirectors-ShareholderActivism.html](https://www.olshanlaw.com/resources-mentions-HestiaCapital-PermitCapital-GameStop-BoardofDirectors-ShareholderActivism.html)\n\nAnd if you follow u/snowk88 over at stocktwits (@snowk88)— you’d also find a wealth of DD on how Olshan rolls when entering these activist-investor-replaces-dumbass-boards-and-CEOs type disputes. To bottom line it: **they get it fucking done**. \n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266158534)\n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266155112](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266155112)\n\n[https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266153175](https://stocktwits.com/snowk88/message/266153175)\n\nBut what else did we learn from the 13D? We learned that Ryan Cohen is definitely not going anywhere any time soon. Specifically, the filing notes that RC Ventures intends to continue to engage in discussions with GameStop’s board *“regarding means to drive stockholder value, including through changes to the composition of the board and other corporate governance enhancements.\"* And while RC Ventures *“desires to come to an amicable resolution with \\[GameStop, it\\] will not hesitate to take any actions that it believes are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders.”*\n\nI really like that last part, don’t you? And although I thought his November 16th letter was pretty goddamn clear, this 13D just ratcheted up the transparency level here. In sum, Ryan Cohen has all of our backs and he’s going to replace this Board and Sherman with people that are on the level and that will help implement his vision.\n\nAnd now seems like a good time to return to those “Ryan Cohen: Boy Genius” articles that were definitely NOT part of a well-coordinated pre-hostile takeover media campaign initiated earlier this year. I think there might be a few things in those articles that Mr. Cohen wanted all of us shareholders (as well as the short sellers and the Board he’s about to replace) to really and truly understand.  Recall also that Cohen is not one for diversification or for playing it safe. So here’s a few choice nuggets for you to ponder:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBloomberg, June 2020: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)\n\n· \"It's too hard to find, at least for me, what I consider great ideas,\" he says. \"When I find things I have a lot of conviction in, I go all-in.\" \n\n· Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”\n\n· He wouldn’t, however, recommend his \\[non-diversified\\] investment approach to everyone. “You need to have the temperament to block the noise,” he says. “Sometimes it feels like a roller coaster.”\n\n· He likens his obsessive focus on building Chewy to his approach to stock picking. \"I don't want to swing for a single,\" he says.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou hear that, Jim? Our man Cohen likes idioms too! But fuck those farm idioms, Jim – we’re upgrading to the Sportsball kind now.  So what’s the takeaway here? I’d say that Cohen has his Eye On The Ball and that it’s time for all short sellers and the Board to Throw in The Towel because Ryan Goddamn Cohen likes to Take the Bull By The Horns and will ensure that he Hits a Homerun for shareholders that believe in his vision.\n\nHere’s a few more things Mr. Cohen wants all of us to know:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nForbes, August 2020: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)\n\n· “For me, each no sounded like they just didn’t understand my vision. It was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ‘no’s never made me doubt my strategy – it was the opposite. I was motivated by all the rejections and they just got me fired up.”\n\n· “I understood that thinking big was likely going to be misunderstood along the way. I’m contrarian by nature, so being misunderstood often validates what I’m doing. It wasn’t until Chewy boxes were on doorsteps across the country that the bulk of investors started to recognize our formula.”\n\n· “\\[M\\]y biggest risk would have been not taking risk. The risk of going head-to-head against Amazon. The risk of insourcing fulfillment. The risk of building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. The risk of spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD -0.1%'s budget. The risk of hiring expensive executives even though we weren’t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.”\n\n· “Dad never swayed when he believed in something. I never compromised my vision, regardless how many investors turned me down I was not going to give up on building Chewy into the world’s biggest online pet retailer. I love to be challenged, and I’m flexible on details, but I’m never willing to give up.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nGoddamn it, Ryan. I was done having children but now you’ve forced me into getting back on that train just so I can name this future child Ryan Fucking Cohen. Thanks a lot, asshole.\n\nBut to return to my point: are those the statements of a man that seems likely to walk away at this point? Or is Cohen trying to tell us all to get ready because he is going **All In** on this shit?\n\nSo where does this leave us? After a huge week where Cohen buys 2.5M more shares and then the SP skyrockets to $20 yesterday on that news? Well, this is where I want to tip my cap to my man Justin Dopierala over at Seeking Alpha and allow him to conclude this section. He, along with his pal Dmitriy Kozin have been pretty clear-eyed on all this shit for a while now and they both deserve some credit. And I know I gave my main man Justin a bit of a hard time in my last novella, but the dude is sharp as hell and helped a lot of us see the forest through the trees here.  And you should also definitely invite him to join your poker nights (seriously: check out the dude’s tweet in response to our own Rod Alzmann’s introduction of the #WeWantCohen hashtag right after the Q3 call debacle). [https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1336446055685230592).  You have no comment on a potential takeover involving Ryan Cohen, Justin after your hour-long googly-eyed call together? Can’t believe you’re just preemptively leaving the WSJ and Bloomberg hanging like that. Justin, I love you dude, but if I’m holding pocket Kings I’m folding after that tweet because that twinkle in your eye lets me know you’re about to drop two Aces on my ass.\n\nAnyway. Here is what our man Dopierala thinks might happen here soon (and he called this way back on November 17th- and sorry - no links here, per the mods, as apparently no Alpha must ever be Sought from these parts):\n\n*I think a very likely outcome at this point is a majority slate next shareholder meeting where Cohen takes over BOD and then makes himself CEO. A majority slate proxy battle would require all institutions to call in shares and would force a squeeze.*\n\nWe’re intrigued, Justin. Please continue:\n\n*If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero.*\n\nAnd now is when I get to speculate on what I think is going to happen here. But I do not necessarily think Cohen is going to put an offer to buy GME to take private. That would definitely trigger a MOASS, but I’m not sure I see it given the attorneys he’s hired and his recent buys up to $16 and the amount of cash that would take. Like Dopierala’s *first* comment, though, I think Cohen is going to nominate directors to replace nearly the entire Board of Directors with a vote happening at the annual meeting and once that Board is in place, they’ll appoint Cohen as CEO. And as Justin notes, if he nominates a majority slate of directors, shares will have to be called in to vote. And this vote and proxy battle will make the prior minority slate Hesita/Permit battle, and the tiny short squeeze that took place when that happened, look tame by comparison.\n\nNow everyone: get your calendars out. Because the date to nominate directors here is in **Mid-March**, and my super-smart corporate lawyer buds inform me that it’s standard practice to file about 7-10 days prior. So, if this actually happening, we should be seeing something on this by **early March**.\n\nBut even though early March is now the mark on the wall, today’s insane price action caused me to think about all of this a bit harder and speculate a bit more. And a major h/t to my buds on the stocktwits board, especially u/rgrAi (@amarbar) for all the sharp analysis on this. But if you were Ryan Cohen and you knew this company was hugely undervalued and you had a high level of **CONVICTION** here and also knew you needed shareholder votes to sweep out these dumbasses and implement your vision—then how would you play this with the short interest here as crazy as it is? I’d keep buying. Why? Well, lots of reasons, you smart alecks. \n\nFirst, so I have more guaranteed votes (duh?). Second, so that when the building starts burning and short hedge funds run for the exits they find that a mild-mannered Millennial with super-good ideas has sealed off all the doors and windows. That’s gruesomely delicious, isn’t it? Why else, CPT? Well, finally, and maybe most importantly, because I would want to excite and delight all my fellow shareholders by triggering a slow-burn short squeeze, raising the SP significantly, so that I can once again make the point (as he did in the Nov 16 letter) that the incompetent management that caused a **HUGE drop in SP** following that utterly incompetent Q3 call and the shelf registration, had **nothing to do with the SP increase** that again happened once Cohen announced his intent and started buying. Not the console cycle, not the cost containment measures, not the buybacks and not the early debt reduction. Nope: rightly or wrongly, shareholders will see Ryan Cohen buying shares and the corresponding SP increase and everyone—especially all new buyers who are delighted at their good fortune and swept up by Ryan Cohen Fever 2021—will start getting #WeWantCohen tattoos on their ass they’ll be so happy. And all of us, newly enriched by Ryan Cohen’s Big Canadian Balls and tactical brilliance, will crawl over glass to vote for him over The Boomer Artist Formally Known As GameStop’s CEO. I could be very wrong on this last point in particular, but if we start seeing 13Ds drop here shortly, things should get very fun very quickly. \n\n**Part 4: A Return to Our Short-Squeeze-to-Da-Moon Discussion: Who’s Side Are You Fucking On, Jim?**\n\nNow, Jim, given the fast friendship we’re creating here, and all we’ve been through over the past 5000 words, I hesitate in bringing this up. But we’ve all seen the video, Jim. You know the one I’m talking about. Yes, the one where you actually tell the truth about how short selling hedge funds manipulate the market to knock down the price of perfectly good securities that many hard-working people *invest in*—many normal-ass people all assuming they wont ever have to Point Where On The Dolly The Invisible Hand of the Economy Touched Them. But that’s not life now is it Jim? And fuck those poor-ass rubes for not knowing how to play the game with you sophisticated Masters of the Universe, *amirite*?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim\\_cramer\\_reveals\\_dirty\\_tricks\\_short\\_sellers\\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/93evx4/jim_cramer_reveals_dirty_tricks_short_sellers_use/)\n\n[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/cramer-market-manipulator/)\n\nSo where are **you** in this whole GME/Cohen story, Jim? You candidly (gleefully?) acknowledge that a prime strategy that shorts deploy is to spread negative rumors that are then amplified by Big Smart Trustworthy Financial Media Titans like yourself to shake out unsophisticated retail players like my Rocket Kids here—who because of their tiny paper hands and you mean short selling brutes often subsist on paste and paste alone. \n\nSo for this particular security, are you the one helping with the manipulation and actively creating the “new truth” or are you just one of the Useful Idiots that these short sellers use to manipulate with an anodyne, TV media-ready comparison like: *GameStop Is The Next Blockbuster*? And how in the fuck does this fit into your Think Young(TM) project, Jim? Because if there is one thing that we over at WSB fucking hate, it’s a bunch of Manipulative Short Selling Boomer Fuckwads. Why on earth would a hip Young Thinker like you want to be included in that crew, Jim?\n\nAnd I know we’re all friends here now, Jim, but I need to push back a bit on some of what you said in that video in such a cavalier whatareyagonnado manner. So if I understand you, short and distort and fomenting negative reactions from retail players based on deliberately false narratives is ***illegal***, but still easy as fuck to do \"because the SEC doesn't understand it.\" But you fucking do understand it, Jim! So why are you helping those short and distorters break the law here? Why are you being such an obtuse dumbshit? Just check out what happens to the borrow rate and short selling every time there is any good news for GME: \n\n[https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950](https://stocktwits.com/Slantedangles/message/264519950) (h/t @slantedangles). This manipulation isn't just happening with GME; it is happening *everywhere*. It’s baked into the cake. And that is pretty fucked up that we all just accept it because *whatareyagonnado*.\n\nI think that one thing that those of us who truly do Think Young(TM) have a hard time understanding is at what point in your lives do you Boomers all finally come to realize that it’s maybe time to stop playing the game like you have been? What point do you finally have enough where doing the right thing matters more than getting paid? Maybe start by telling the truth more often—and maybe don’t go out of your way to help those corrupt-ass hedge fund managers who continually fuck over average people *merely because they were stupid enough to believe you all*. What contempt you Masters of the Universe have for all of them—for all of *us*. There is a bigger story here on GME and this out-of-control short interest (naked shorting, counterfeit shares)   [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) than even Ryan Cohen and the inevitable short squeeze we’re about to witness here. And it begins and ends with people like you and Melvin Capital and Bank of America not giving a fuck about the rules while thinking you’re smarter than the rest of us who do—but who lack power to do anything about it. And you know what? Maybe you *are* smarter than us. You certainly know how to play this game pretty well, as that video shows. But if I know my old school 1980s movies like I think I do, this is usually the part of the story where the rag-tag kids from across the tracks come over to show you hubristic rich fuckheads what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass. \n\nNow I myself have never dabbled in pacifism, Jim, so this isn’t too much of a stretch for me, but seeing that video of yours and seeing the insane short interest and all the manipulation here makes me want to burn the whole corrupt system to the ground—while barricading the doors to trap in those arrogant-ass short sellers who lie and cheat and distort to profit off average people. And though I’m certain that this larger battle is not driving him, maybe that result is one that Ryan Cohen wouldn’t mind too. Though he’s a polite Canadian and would probably just let everyone know that he’s not really mad, just disappointed. But me?  I’m an Angry American and I say: Block the fucking doors and windows and light that shit up. \n\nSo maybe this epistle will be useful for your Think Young(TM) project and cause you to reflect a bit more on what’s really going on out there with this whole GME thing and the likely illegal shorting that has driven the short percentage of float to these insane levels, drawing in new retail shorts too stupid to know what’s even happening.  Or maybe it wont cause you to reflect in the slightest (count me as one of those cynical types that see your overtures to WSB as a transparent play for greater market share from the Young Crowd since your old-ass audience is dying and/or switching to bonds).  But in a few months when all the Billy Ray Valentines and Louis Winthorpes assembled here are toasting each other in stupid shirts on a white-sand beach somewhere, we do not want you to look back on your knee-jerk boomer-ass dismissal of GME and your Useful Idiot blathering with that same tinge of regret and longing you feel when you look at a pre-Client 9 picture of you and your old roomie: warm-toes-and-hosiery-enthusiast E. Spitzer, Esq.\n\nIn conclusion: GME = Blockbuster comparisons are for Simps and Corrupt Short-and-Distorters. Don’t be like them, Jim.  And to my Rocket Children: the only weapon we wield in this stupid game is Diamond Hands with a float like this. Toughen the fuck up.\n\nAnd Happy Holidays everyone.\n\n\\--CPT Hubbard\n\n**TL/DR**: Jim Cramer likes farm-based idioms and apparently being a useful idiot to scummy short selling hedge funds.

{"title": "PSTH – Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd – The \"Once More Unto The Breach\" DD", "selftext": "🚀 **$PSTH – Activist Investor Bill Ackman’s Gigantic SPAC – Updated DD** 🚀\n\nI last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable names.\n\nSince then and since my last post, a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nPSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. For context, Chamath's largest SPAC (IPOF) is worth $1.6B. PSTH is worth $5B with the option to increase to $7B. It is enormous. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a “mature unicorn”. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.\n\n**Two Key points in addition to the TLDR:**\n\nTwo aspects of this stock that most people miss to begin with (I've engaged with enough of them online to know):\n\n**1)** Tontine: detailed below but in essence, for every common share you buy now AND hold through the merger and ticker change, you get 2/9 a warrant exercisable at $23. That means for every 9 commons you own, you will receive another 2 commons later at a price of $23 (the stock trades at $26 today)\n\n**AKA if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each simply for holding through the merger.**\n\n**THIS is what 2/9 Tontine means. It can grow to 3/9 or 4/9 if people choose not to hold through the merger, because the number of warrants is constant and will all be given out to someone.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Another note here: beware the manager's right to redeem warrants. This is in the S-1 but the manager's have the right to redeem warrants if the share price meets or exceeds $36 on 20/30 trading days. They have to give you 30 days notice, so just keep that in mind. The warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) 1 year post listing which was in July 2020. So as long as you are keeping an eye on events, you will be okay. Don't fall asleep on the stipulation though.** \n\n**For example, if the stock price was to jump to $50 on LOI and then the merger happens 2 months later, 30 days post that merger you warrants go live but so does the manager's right to issue a redemption notice. At that point you would likely consider redeeming the warrants since at the end of that window they could be taken by manager for pennies each. No upside cap based on my reading of the S1, but just be vigilant once the merger is announced.**\n\n**2)** The bank set up. Typically the big banks gouge the eyes out of IPOs and traditional SPACS with fees, etc. We have seen big big misses on the order of $3-4B for both Snowflake and ABNB. With PSTH, Ackman has went a different route abandoning the large cap banks and instead giving underwriting privileges to a ton of small and minority owned banks and credit lenders. This is a legacy move. He's more interested in changing the landscape because he believes (and has explained) that quality public entry structures are the best improvements we can make for the economy, society, and the common retail investor. The structure also incentivizes him to make an exceptional deal, that's the only way he makes money through the warrant system, if the deal goes well. This is why HUGE names are on board, but only one big bank is. This SPAC is opposing the conventional bank-led IPO process. That in itself, is a game changer and once this pops and gets press you can bet your boots that future SPAC leaders (Chamath, etc.) will transition to this method.\n\n**Background information and recent events**\n\n· In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH – the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman’s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.\n\n· In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:\n\no He is hunting for a “mature unicorn” - unicorn is defined as $1B or more but \"mature\" here is the key, he's looking for a company worth tens of Billions.\n\no He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth\n\no This means a large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company according to Ackman. He has explicitly said he's also friendly to a FINTECH\n\no He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $30-40B.\n\n**o Ackman has recruit an incredible board of directors at PSTH, leveraging raw talent from both media and fintech sectors:**\n\nLisa Gersh - Former management executive at NBC News\n\nMichael Ovitz - Former President at The Walt Disney Company\n\nJackie Reses - Former executive at Square, mobile payment company\n\nJoseph Steinberg - Current Chairman of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\n\n**\\*\\*We don't want to jump to conclusions, but on review of the board, this is certainly a MEDIA and FINTECH heavy group of executives\\*\\***\n\no He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far\n\no **Investors in the SPAC so far include:**\n\n§ Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, “the next Buffet” and noted value investor) = $450M position\n\n§ Guggenheim Capital = $560M position\n\n§ Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position\n\n§ Soroban Capital = $290M position\n\n§ Wells Fargo = $290M position\n\n§ Kevin “Sharktank” O’Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1\n\n§ **Warren Buffet’s** position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.\n\n**§ KEY Point: \\*\\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\\*\\***\n\no The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).\n\n**PSTH SPAC Design**\n\n· PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:\n\n· PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique “tontine” structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n**Targets**\n\nMuch speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:\n\n· Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.\n\n· Since that interview, Air B&B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO\n\n**· Stripe has generated intense interest online.** Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that “no such deal” had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother’s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).\n\n**· Bloomberg remains in play.** There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.\n\n· Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.\n\n**Target summary based on my view**\n\nTargets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement\n\n1. Bloomberg\n2. InNOut\n3. Stripe\n4. Fidelity\n\n**Bill Ackman**\n\nA few notes on the CEO of the SPAC, William A. Ackman:\n\n· A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you’re interested in looking into it.\n\n· He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.\n\n· In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%.\n\n· Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific\n\n· Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).\n\n**Some other notes**\n\nThis is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.\n\nWhile this isn’t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into.\n\n**Resources**\n\n[**https://images.app.goo.gl/mQUfM5KKEfPkhG1k6**](https://images.app.goo.gl/mQUfM5KKEfPkhG1k6)\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*PSTH S-1\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n[**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520175042/d930055ds1.htm)\n\nGood information re the unique warrant structure and how to avoid making ant mistakes when it comes to warrants:\n\n[https://wolvesofinvesting.com/psth-spac-warrants-explained-simply/](https://wolvesofinvesting.com/psth-spac-warrants-explained-simply/)\n\n· Ackman interviews: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4)\n\n· [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4)\n\n· Klarman position: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html)\n\n· Guggenheim position: [https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu](https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu)\n\n· Buffet leaves JPM: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193)\n\n· Buffet secret position: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html)\n\n· PSTH (Ackman) recent letter to investors, see PSTH section: [https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf)\n\n· My original DD (pinned by mods, is here): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\\_dd\\_klarman\\_buffet\\_ackman\\_the\\_unicorn\\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/)\n\n· u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter provides an exceptional documentation around PSTH with a specific focus on Stripe: [https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt?lang=en](https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt?lang=en)\n\no Many of the other PSTH related twitter accounts are just opinion accounts attempting to either pump or dump specific stocks.

At the same time, they’ve always maintained a “high growth startup” mentality, as they are constantly launching new projects (failing fast and failing often). Some projects are small, like mobile apps and events, others are big like Super Chewer, Eats, Bright and Home. This matters because when you put a data-centric model and a culture for innovation together, you start to realize that what they are really building is a platform. One that targets all dogs regardless of their age (from puppy to senior) and one that owns every aspect of being a pet owner (play, nutrition, health, home). So, in the same way that today more than 50% of Amazon’s operating income comes from AWS, I believe that Bark is well positioned to find an AWS-equivalent business model, that will eventually represent a big chunk of their income. This could come from their newly launched business models, like Bark Eats in the food space, or maybe from new verticals that they haven’t explored yet, like dog insurance (market with tremendous opportunity in the US).

My farm cat (who lived in the house) went missing and I spent hours trying to find her in the bitter cold. I walked the ditches looking for her body, I called for her at the spots she liked to hide in. I thought she had died. It was horribly cold for a blizzard, and I went out on Christmas Eve in the dark to look for her, and checked the machine shop; her favorite place cause it was inside. I heard the faintest of whimpers, and I checked the combine and tractors, but I found nothing, and the whimpering stopped, and I thought I had imagined it.\n\nI checked the other connected shop, nothing. Back to the machine shop and heard it again, and I realized she was stuck in the walls. I tore off the metal on the wall, and was able to find her.\n\nShe was the quietest of cats, never mewed. I put her in the house, went downstairs into the basement to change out of my snowpants, and when I came up the stairs she let out the loudest meow, like a cat that was in distress and scared. It made me cry because I had never heard her meow before. In the 21 years she was alive, that was it.  Part of her ear fell off from the cold exposure in the coming weeks, but that was the best Christmas I ever had, and I had maybe 2500$ to my name.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You bitch...", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
