{"title": "A discussion about “time in the market vs timing the market”", "selftext": "We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. \n\n1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean \n\nTime in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. \n\n“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. \n\nRather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. \n\n2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) \n\nIf you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? \n\nSure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. \n\nOnce you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. \n\n3. Generational wealth\n\nThis is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. \n\nEven on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. \n\n4. Compound interest \n\nSome call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. \n\n5. Dividends \n\nWhether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. \n\n6. On “timing the market”\n\nThis is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. \n\nSpending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. \n\nAt the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them. \n\nI made this post because I have to work on a Saturday and have nothing going on, I hope you at least enjoyed it or disagree with it so we can have some discussion going.", "id": "k7cq51", "created_utc": 1607192796.0, "score": 1002, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 210, "comments": [{"body": "I really dig the comment about selling for a correction and taxes.

In 5 years, maybe the price will appreciate at somewhere around 2% per year and it will approach closer to its intrinsic value. You don’t know and neither do I.

Stock prices reflect all future dividends based on all available publicly available information. This point is irrational. People apply similar logic to buying a stock and if it appreciates to let’s say 300% of its original cost eg $1,000 stock X-> $3,000 and someone sells off $2000 of stock X and says that they recouped their investment, there is no harm done in leaving their cost base in. This is irrational because if you don’t believe you will earn the same return with that $1,000 of stock X as you will with the $2,000 you sold, then you are losing opportunity cost.\n\nThis same principle applies to a dividend stock. Maybe buffet bought coke at $4 and in today’s dollar terms he is earning a 40% yield on it. However, if coke stock sees a disrupter in the beverage industry, and coke no longer will remain as the top dog and the stock price depreciates by 2% every year and eventually they will decrease the dividend for example, it is irrational to say I will keep this investment because my dividend yield on my initial investment is still very high!

I also picked up SGI back in the 90’s for $45/share. It eventually went to the low single digits. Management changed and wanted to shift their brilliant IRIX OS to Windows NT. I lost faith in their leadership, but held on for irrational and emotional reasons. Lesson learned.\n\nEdit.  It's okay to sell to make life changes that are significant to yourself or people you love.  Buying a house is one of those things or giving your parents a once in a life-time trip somewhere.

This has been happening over the last two decades and Tesla's relatively high diversity numbers compared to other automakers can be primarily accounted for in their comparatively young workforce.*\n\nI was inspired to write this because of the emotional response I had in reading your post, especially this. \n\n>A person from a low socioeconomic background has almost no chance of competing with me no matter how hard they work.\n\nAssuming you are an established professional in your career, and have been for a decade, there is real truth to this... someone who grew up in a low socioeconomic position  at the same time you did absolutely did not have the same opportunities that you had, and to this day is at a significant disadvantage to you professionally.\n\nHowever, it has been long recognized that the right solution to this has never been for companies to deviate from hiring the best of the best, the problem has to be solved where it is created... childhood and the educational system:\n\n**Improve home environments for all children, providing social support for the child specifically.** This is something that still needs a lot of work, but can be seen in free breakfast, lunch and dinner at the school, and in keeping school campus buildings open from early AM until late PM for all students, not just athletes and extracurricular participants, so that students have somewhere to do homework & socialize away from difficult home situations. Future programs that provide direct benefits grants to children and not their parents in cases where it is clear their parents are not spending the benefit for their wellbeing will do even more, as will providing educational and counseling to parents in these situations.  The ubiquity of technology is also leveling the playing field... the trend towards raising children with screens means that these children are being exposed to the same content and will be growing up with equal technological literacy. I won't get into the potential downsides here, that is another discussion entirely. \n\n**Attack racism wherever it exists in the educational system**  This includes student and teacher behavior, but larger impacts have been made at the school board, county, and state educational system level, where funding and school boundary decisions have been made.\n\n**Ensure that all schools are equally funded and equipped (with good teachers as well as good technology)** The amazing advances in technology over the last decade are starting to finally democratize access to good teaching, but there is still a lot of work to do with regards to student counseling and educational assistance. Technology is helping here too. \n\n**Encourage, recognize, support and reward any student's exceptional ability and performance, regardless of socioeconomic background.**  This is probably the area where the most progress has been made, as there are numerous nationwide programs and countless local programs providing incredible opportunities for middle school and high school students, especially students in districts that serve low socioeconomic communities and are otherwise financially disadvantaged. I can only point to the example of the university I attended. It was in a major US city, closely located with very some of the most socioeconomically challenged areas in our state. Large groups of students from the local high schools were often on our campus using lecture halls for events. Campus professional society organizations did frequent outreach on high school campuses. Even more importantly, our school ran a large free tutoring facility on campus that was equally open to both college and high school students. Finally, the part I was most involved in, was extreme support by the university of any local teacher led initiative for interscholastic competition beyond athletics... these high schools punched so far above their weight class when it came to Robotics, Math, Coding, debate, dozens of other events...  complaints were filed by much more advantaged schools pointing at unfair collaboration with world-class professors and facilities. Evidence of the success of these programs was that in my senior year there, the local high schools had a higher college acceptance rate among their graduating seniors than the high school I had attended, in a much more \"socioeconomically privileged\" part of the country.\n\n**Ensure that financial capability is never a limiting factor for continuing education.**  This needs almost no explanation. Scholarships and Grants for exceptional educational performance, with special focus on students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, have multiplied over the last 20 years, and at the same time the process of applying for and receiving federal financial aid has been streamlined and simplified to the point that a high school student can complete the application on their phone without any input from their parents at all, completely removing the need for professional or parental assistance that provided an advantage to more privileged applicants. While government backed student loans are a hotly debated topic, the complete blindness to economic background with which they are distributed has also helped remove the financial barriers to education.\n\n**Conclusion; How these efforts are changing the workforce.** All of these things have been aggressively pursued in the US educational system since the early 2000s, and efforts have only accelerated over that time. I think that Tesla's relatively high diversity numbers compared to other automakers can be primarily accounted for in their comparatively young workforce.. A teenager in 2005 had incredible opportunities regardless of socioeconomic compared to a teenager in 1995 or 1985, and these are the people who have been entering Tesla's workforce over the last decade, and are now just starting to make their way into management. Teenagers in 2010 had even more opportunity, and had the benefits of better younger educational systems. Teenagers today are in an even better place. In the next decade society is going to see the results of these programs as a much more diverse pool of highly qualified individuals advances through the workforce.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for sharing your insights. \n\nI sit on a grant panel that distributes translational funding for public private partnerships.  We get many proposals trying to address inefficiency in education.

This is a holdover from a time before networked global communication. Many people are trying to scale education with VR, remote learning, and AI.  \n\nPersonalization is also a major obstacle to efficient education. The education system is designed by people who think a certain way so that people who think in similar ways do well. It is clear from neurobiology that everyone has the capacity to learn the most complex material but the way that things are taught means that 90% of students are underserved by the existing teaching framework.

It wasn't until my last two years of high school where school began to click, and I was lucky that the collegiate system somewhat matches my learning style. I have good friends who I know from long discussions and debates are just as intelligent as myself but didn't ever experience organized learning in a way that clicked for them, and I have seen the disadvantages that has put them under.\n\nI think the reason why the outreach programs I observed/participated in during college worked so well and seemed so effective can be put down to providing learning experiences that are in different learning formats than what students experienced in school. I honestly think that even one \"aha moment\" where learning clicks makes a difference for a young student, because it can overwrite the idea that school is hard because they aren't smart enough, and instead it is hard because it isn't being presented in a way they like to learn... showing that learning can happen in many different ways and all are equally valuable is so powerful.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I'm all for focusing help to people with economic hardship, but to consider skin color is wrong and is by definition racist.

{"title": "Listen retards, CRM should be your major easy-money move next week (fool-proof instructions inside)", "selftext": "**Basics**\n\nSalesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\n**What Happened**\n\nThis is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2\n\nThe sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.\n\nBut Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.\n\nSo, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.\n\n**What Happened Next**\n\nAfter the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.\n\nJim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said \"Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack\"](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.\n\nMultiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.\n\nSince then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.\n\nTraders have a \"3-Day Rule\" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.\n\n**What's Coming**\n\n[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.\n\nAlso, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.\n\n**What Positions**\n\nDo NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):\n\n\\- 230C 12/18/2020\n\n\\- 250C End of year-February\n\n\\- 270C March-May 2021\n\n\\- 300C June-July 2021\n\n\\- The stock (CRM) if you want to hold for 6 months or more.\n\n**When to Buy**\n\nDo not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.\n\nI think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in.\n\nPS: Watch this interview with the CEO of Salesforce (12/6) on the Slack aquisition: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqfLhnrHwcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqfLhnrHwcQ&ab_channel=YahooFinance)", "id": "k6z2fs", "created_utc": 1607134619.0, "score": 496, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 224, "comments": [{"body": "Finally someone in this subreddit with a brain", "score": 149, "replies": [{"body": "if that  was true, they  wouldn't  be in this subreddit. der", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/225da957-9085-322a-ac6f-098ce5dd0306/salesforce-is-paying-a-huge.html", "score": -2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A real autist", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "... one of his first pieces of evidence was that Jim Cramer likes the stock", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "didnt HC@C just go nuts because of Cramer? guy is usually profitable to inverse, sure, but it isnt a hard and fast rule.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely isn’t smart to inverse Cramer when everyone and their mom is interested in stock trading.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "There were a bunch of people mentioning CRM calls this week.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Where?!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "In case you're not aware of how much money they have, their last 5 annual conferences (Dreamforce, which is also the biggest tech conference in the country at 150k attendees held in San Francisco near their HQ) has had Metallica, Foo Fighters, U2, Bruno Mars, and someone else.\n\nThey don't fuck around.", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "Alicia Keys\n\n(source: was there, indeed 150k)", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not sure how I feel about them wasting money on litty concerts tho.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": ">wasting money\n\nConsidering attendees pay anywhere from $1.5-$3k for a ticket, and partners/sponsors fork out huge prices for booth real estate, Dreamforce is actually a profit center for them.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "It prints money for them for sure.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not to mention the main point, which is to attract new customers and get partners to push their product more.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sounds cool as fuck to me.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "And bill gates, Barack Obama, Oprah and a bunch of other super famous people", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Christ I didn't even mention their speakers, you're absolutely right.

However, a pivot point sits at 40.54.\n\nTheoretically, a pivot point is a price level used by professional traders to assess whether prices are bullish or bearish.\n\n\"If the prevailing market price is above the base pivot point, it suggests bullishness. If the market is below the base pivot, it suggests a bearish tenor.\"\n\nOn 12/2, NIO reached through the pivot point and jumped back up, creating a long wicked heilkin ashi. Notice how the open and high prices are currently synched on the downtrend? Theoretically, this indicates a STRONG bearish momentum. \n\nThe next support level on the 1D timeframe sits at 33.16\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlmt8t54cc361.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c26cbddb570571db592222f92d74588df40f608\n\n**Currently, the 30p 12/18 is still in play.** \n\nDec. Sentiment: Bearish\n\n## AMD Recap\n\n0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:\n\n* *If AMD breaks resistance at 94.02, look for PT 94.75 - 96.08+*\n* *Play: 94c or 95c 12/04 exp (only play in the morning)*\n\n## Today's Price Movements\n\nOpen: 92.58\n\nHigh: 94.58\n\nLow: 90.63\n\nClose: 94.04\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It would have helped if you closed your positions when AMD hit 94.58.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c86twjwbcc361.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8b3ab594d3fd1e57fd2c8560574285dca9f1a27\n\n**Dec. Sentiment: Neutral (may have reached the top but let's see)**\n\n# TSLA RECAP\n\nWeekly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: \n\n1. If TSLA breaks through resistance at 595.68, look for a price target of 621.85 between 12/4 - 12/8+\n2.

It exceeds that price, then the bearish wedge has failed, and TSLA's sentiment will be bullish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7z7oxrlucc361.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a5129576857e484537213075a15d7df890d639\n\n**Dec.

{"title": "⚠️ Warning to my EV SPAC Bubble Homies: This Will End ⚠️", "selftext": "I know, I know. This has been talked about here for months now so bear with me as I needed a place to rant.\n\nLike many, I’ve been following most of these EV companies since the summer. I mean who isn’t enticed by seeing people make 300% in a month? It’s completely rationale to want and get in on the action. Hell, I consider myself a conservative investor and even I’ve made money on some of these names so I guess you can call me a hypocrite for even writing this.\n\nAt some point though one has to recognize just how irrational this has become. No revenue until 2025? No problem, here’s a $17 BILLION market cap (talking about you quant scape). Go onto any EV/SPAC forum or Stocktwits and dare to question a valuation or why a stock tripled in a week. Ask about the potential dilution from warrants or PIPE shares set to go out. You’ll likely just get a cocky response about having FOMO. These bulls are getting so caught up in the moment with short term gains, it reminds of those 2 Florida real estate guys from The Big Short:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfu_iFS-UY8\n\nTake PIC for example. Traded around its NAV (basically a price floor before merger) for months before abruptly surging. Nothing has changed about the company -  no new catalysts other than rumors of a potential merger date which is widely expected. What is the rationale for paying double what the company was valued at a couple weeks ago? These SPACs are becoming commodities in a sense that it’s solely supply/demand driven by hype and literally nothing else. \n\nI guess to me the worst part of all this and why it bothers me so much is that 99.9% of the time it will be that average Joe who eventually loses cause they put too much of their savings into a SPAC at $50 after watching some pumper from YouTube who used bright colors and 500% gains In the thumbnail. \n\nYou know who wins 99.9% of the time? Institutions and hedge funds. They are eating this up. Whether it is just shorting these risky stocks or taking advantage of the arb opportunities. I’ve counted 6 recently merged SPACs that have significant spreads between the common stock and warrants. Arbitrageurs are locking in these gains - eventually taking retail money. \n\nI know I sound lame but this EV hype is getting dangerous and people need to be aware of how this will end. Some will make money short term and know when to get out but a lot of ignorant people are going to lose money once the dust settles with all this.\n\nThoughts?", "id": "k77cgs", "created_utc": 1607174374.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "Of course it will end, 90% of these companies have no real value.

Since TSLA wasn't very volatile (small movements = not likely to jump to 3x current value), option prices remain low.\n\nIf you want to see a perfect example of this, look at SPY, the 6/17/2022 550C, it's only $1.09. This has a 16 month to expiration and $550 is only up not even 50% from current price. This is because SPY has very low volatility (16.93%), and moves a predictable 8-13% a year (historically).

If this was truly a screenshot, from his phone, without getting re-compressed (uploaded/downloaded) more than once, then the kerning should be perfectly consistent.\n\nAlas, it is not.  The spacing between the decimal and the 2 on \"$0.23\" is different than the spacing in \"$136.23\" - he probably used paint to make a copy of the \"23\" number from the TSLA break even price and put it under avg cost, but he put it one pixel to the right from where it should be.  NOTE - this effect can NOT be due to compression.  Compression could shrink/enlarge the numbers appearance from their sub-pixels, but it cannot entirely shift a full arrangement of pixels to the right or left.  Additionally, the image is suspiciously crisp to even suggest it's gone through compression/decompression.\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL](https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL) \\- The $0.23 is dragged above the $136.23, aligning decimal points.  Space between decimal point and number 2 is only 5 pixels for \"0.23\" but its 6 pixels for \"136.23\"\n\nAlternate proof: [https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG](https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG) The .23 from avg price was given 50% opacity, colored red, dragged over location to align decimals.  The break even price was colored blue. You can see decimal is perfectly purple, but the numbers of a layer of red on the left and a layer of blue on the right.\n\nEdit - Apparently imgur compressed. So heres a screenshot of it open in gimp for higher resolution [https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k](https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k)\n\nEdit 2 - It's entirely possible Robinhood has a design error on their end.

This has been a crazy ride. I closed out my most profitable core position today. I loaded up on 30 $690 strike CALLs last year in August/September with cost basis of $0.26. I did not sell anything until the first run up in Feb because I was buying and selling shorter expirations on the run up from October very profitably. I sold 9 of the $690 contracts for average of $340 when stock went parabolic in early Feb so was very cash heavy going into March. In March I held all positions and bought many 03/2021 and 01/2022 $1000 strike CALLs on the way down with proceeds from previous sale. The largest \"mistake\" I made was in early may when I sold 5 contracts for $75 hoping that it was cresting and I could exchange for 2021 calls for similar price. The stock kept going up so that didn't work out. Fortunately I used those proceed on Elon's overvalued Tweet day so probably will be no net loss. As the remaining core calls expire next Friday I have sold on the run up with the last 9 selling from $325 today. When averaged across all sales I sold for average of $270 and currently hold about 70% of proceeds in cash/index funds, mostly for taxes, and carry 23 contracts that are in the money going forward. This is a staggering 100,000%+ gain on an intial investment of $760 just in proceeds from initial purchase and as I hold the 2021/2022 expiring contracts (currently up about 900% from March) that could triple or quadruple.

If this was truly a screenshot, from his phone, without getting re-compressed (uploaded/downloaded) more than once, then the kerning should be perfectly consistent.\n\nAlas, it is not.  The spacing between the decimal and the 2 on \"$0.23\" is different than the spacing in \"$136.23\" - he probably used paint to make a copy of the \"23\" number from the TSLA break even price and put it under avg cost, but he put it one pixel to the right from where it should be.  NOTE - this effect can NOT be due to compression.  Compression could shrink/enlarge the numbers appearance from their sub-pixels, but it cannot entirely shift a full arrangement of pixels to the right or left.  Additionally, the image is suspiciously crisp to even suggest it's gone through compression/decompression.\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL](https://imgur.com/a/aL6mYbL) \\- The $0.23 is dragged above the $136.23, aligning decimal points.  Space between decimal point and number 2 is only 5 pixels for \"0.23\" but its 6 pixels for \"136.23\"\n\nAlternate proof: [https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG](https://imgur.com/a/fbZW8ZG) The .23 from avg price was given 50% opacity, colored red, dragged over location to align decimals.  The break even price was colored blue. You can see decimal is perfectly purple, but the numbers of a layer of red on the left and a layer of blue on the right.\n\nEdit - Apparently imgur compressed. So heres a screenshot of it open in gimp for higher resolution [https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k](https://imgur.com/a/Ar9hi2k)\n\nTLDR - The image you're seeing can only be made through repeated compression/decompression, or photoshop.

Hold on to a contract until it produces a profit, then sell to close. Consistent profits because you'll be correct more often than you're not correct, if you manage your bankroll and learn trading this way.\n\nExample: research a stock you are bullish on, you believe the market has oversold it in the past year (for me, this is Intel).\n\nIf any kind of bullish news releases in the next year that causes IV to increase, the underlying doesn't even have to move much, but IV (which is this theoretical value that is constantly fluctuating over time) moves in your favor, then you profit at that point by selling the contract to the bulls who are rallying the stock and driving the premiums up.\n\nIt's almost guaranteed money (edit: I'm exaggerating of course, for those who took this literally, there is always risk involved and a lot of factors will determine the success of ANY strategy applied)\n\nIf you're wrong and picked a stock that actually is decreasing in value over the course of the LEAP (a contract with greater than 1 year to expiry), then so fucking what? At any point you can sell for a loss (but still recoup a lot of your original premium).\n\nAnd you have more than one contract, so eventually you're going to be in the green on most of them.\n\nIf you can't profit from this then you're really bad at picking stocks and should stop or pay someone to help you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you pay $0.09 per contract and buy 100 contracts, that costs you $900 up front  \n>  \n>Stock moves up $4 within the year at some point...

Buying LEAPs as you are suggesting is a less efficient use of capital given the type of gains WSB is going for.\n\n\\*Edit I know you think you know a lot about options, but you just happen to know more than most people on WSB. Still have a lot of learning to do. PM Me and I can send you some really good resources. The point is to get fucking ginormous % gains in a short amount of time, it's a lot harder to do that with leaps because you need a proportionately larger move in the stock price due to time value bloating the option price. Less time value gives you more gamma and helps you realize more gains in that short time frame, along with vega.

Now, if you're an unwoke retard, which you probably are, the first thing you think of is \"They're still alive?\" / \"they still sell phones?\" / \"hurr durr what is this 2010?\" Don't worry, you're not alone, as this assumption doesn't elude even the best boomer trader of them all, Jim Cramer, who just 2 days ago told people to \"sell Blackberry and buy Apple\" after the Amzon announcement (to be covered in a bit). Newsflash -- they don't even compete in the same market anymore, boomer!! They haven't been competing in the same market since 2013, as they quietly pivot from hardware to software. \n\nIn short, Blackberry is now a software company, who has a powerful operating system, QNX, which is used in Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Toyota cars. BlackBerry just partnered with Amazon to develop BlackBerry IVY, which collects a multitude of vehicle data from all these manufacturers. Yes, it is true that Tesla has a HUGE advantage over any other single (keyword: single) automobile manufacturer when it comes to driving and road data, but what happens when you consolidate EVERYONE ELSE who is frothing to beat Tesla for vehicle and road data? BB's data (scaling with AWS) will absolutely catch up and crush TSLA's.\n\nHold on it gets better. BB ALSO does cybersecurity with US FedRAMP certifications, which allows the US government to use their end to end solution for secure communications. They also own AtHoc, which has been crushing it for COVID crisis communications for universities, hospitals, and Fortune 500 companies, including a partnership with ServiceNow for incident management tracking, and in Microsoft Teams for enterprise communications. For a cybersecurity comparison, Crowdstrike (CRWD) trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 40x, Palo Alto Networks at about \\~8x. BB \"only\" make 800-1b annually and growing, (about what Palantir makes), and is **only** trading at 3.3x sales. If someone can give me DD on why CRWD will eat BB's lunch, I will eat my socks if BB doesn't eventually float up closer to these valuations.\n\n If this company were rebranded RaspBerry and fresh IPOing today you bet your ass it would instantly be a 30 to 50bill market cap company. Factor in \"car data\", \"government security contracts\" hype add another 10billion.
