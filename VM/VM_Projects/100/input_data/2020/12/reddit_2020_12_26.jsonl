All that is to say that yes it would be a good strategy: I think this massive 600% run is over but your money will likely at least double in 3-5 years.  If FSD goes well, who knows what will happen.  It could rocket way up. As for there being a dip, yes, it is good to buy during dips but it is extremely difficult to time them.  Over time, it is better to put $ when you can and let time work its magic.  If you get into calls, do so very carefully and do not get into short-term calls or you could very easily lose your $.  Better to stay in shares, at least for awhile until you understand how calls work.\n\nTSLA is a roller-coaster (maybe it is less volatile now), so don't be discouraged if the stock price roller-coasters and you find your $ down.  It will go back up.  It's just how it works.  Don't let it make you freak out and sell lower than what you bought in for.  All you have to do is hold, but just holding can take a lot of energy and will.  If you feel you can handle that, then jump in and get some shares.\n\nEdit: Actually I might not have answered your question.  You already have shares and you're wanting to learn calls?

{"title": "Why you should have all your money in Genetics", "selftext": "I saw Cathie's outlook on Genetics and AI combining, and did my research. It has me convinced I should go super long on ARKG. Here is a video from a [MIT AI Chad and MIT Gene Chad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brslF-Cy3HU&ab_channel=LexFridman) \\- the first of 3 on this podcast and my key takeaways were: Genes are cool as fuck. AI will do for the genome what it did for chess and Go. These companies have the potential to be the next FAANGs in exponential growth.\n\nThis isn't all some hype to make me shoot thiccer rope like Spiderman, but industrial level genetics engineering. Need gasoline? Modify a bacteria to eat plastic and shit gasoline. Need a new organ? Farm that shit off a super pig. Need a specific drug that's expensive to make? Modify a nonspecific fungal enzyme to biosynthesize it. There isn't just one good reason to be long here, there are tons. Shit will actually be a genomic revolution. I think the human genetics stuff is the least interesting actually because of how complicated it will be and all the regulations and red tape. Modifying bacteria/fungus and shit you can culture and scale is going to be the real money. If I could go more specific on those ideas I would but I'll take the ARKG basket for now.\n\nIt's going to disrupt major industries, and I guarantee genetics will help us combat climate change. We'll make bacteria that act as carbon sinks, and then retarded companies will pay tons of moneys to offset their carbon footprint to some assholes with giant vats of this shit in some barren wasteland just eating carbon dioxide and farting oxygen. It's going to change our world and make every industry it touches a level of magnitude more productive. This is the type of generational investment that Apple in 1996 or Google at IPO would have been.\n\nThe keys to unlocking the 'genomic revolution' that ARKG wants are really just processing power and AI. Google is actually important here and will have a hand in the tech end. Deepmind just figured out protein folding. Remember in 2004 when we all tried to cure cancer by running spyware on our computers? It's fucking solved, proteins are solved. These are the building blocks of life and will give us tools to make new novel proteins that actually can turn us into stretch armstrong or make our dicks huge and so on. Now that we figured that out, the next step is learning what genes we can edit to start modifying proteins in our own bodies, or for more profit, bacteria/fungus. You can make a fucking enzyme that eats cancer. This shit is in the pipeline.\n\ntl;dr ARKG any strike. I'm in ARKG 105c 7/16 and wish I had more money to throw at it.

Cathie case for ARKG is rock solid, and people are realizing it. \n\nThat being said, this is a long-term millionaire maker play. It's the perfect mix of tech and health and industry that there is no chance it misses given enough time. The risks are that they make something like killer bees and they escape from the lab, along with some of the insane liabilities and testing regulations for humans.  That's why the real money will be made in bacteria editing for industrial purposes. \n\nI'm excited about new companies that might be out there that Cathie is looking at, because there's tons of room for more genetics businesses that are tailored to specific industries. Most is geared towards health now, instead of the smart factories of the future. There's room for an Elon in this field if anybody really wants to be a billionaire and hasn't picked a career yet.
