Was seen as a money grab (it wasn't - the airline just can't function w/o the subsidy). It turned a lot of people off and they'll remember that for the next few years. \n\n\\- Southwest and Delta were the biggest winners during this pandemic in terms of good press and PR. They kept the middle seat vacant the longest, then you have the no BS story of Delta turning the plane around bc a passenger wouldn't wear the mask. Problem is, Delta's cancellation policy is horrible. Southwest, on the other hand, provides vouchers if you cancel; allows bags to fly free; if you find a lower fare will reimburse you the difference (in voucher form), easier to book with points and cancel, etc.  To me, with so much uncertainty in travel, I'd go with the airline that makes it the easiest to change plans (at least until the pandemic is out of sight and mind - which will most likely be early 2022). \n\nSo yeah, I'm going LUV", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good choice!

Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response. \n\nSince the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir’s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.\n\n“Our partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “We have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.”\n\nThe Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece’s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.\n\n**About Palantir**\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc. is a software company that builds enterprise data platforms for use by organizations with complex and sensitive data environments.

We’ll likely see Robinhooders and wally betters eating it up, as well as larger institutional investors that will now view the stock as more legitimate than an OTC pennystock. \n\n\nHype:\nThe dudes from Dumb Money Live talked about this on their podcast 2 weeks ago. These guys are self made multi millionaires from social arb investing (complicated, but essentially trading off trends, hype, and the like). I agree with their stance that the “shroom boom” has hype written all over it. Psychedelics are cool, new, and interesting! People compare them (often incorrectly) to weed stocks when they first took off. There are some real comparisons there though. The hype could be insane. \n\n\nI’ve been following this stock and the sector as a whole for months, and I’ve watched it catch on as evidenced by one article every 2 weeks or so to a new article coming out almost daily now. People are catching on but it is still very early. \n\n\nLong term there is great potential too, but honestly I’m more bullish on medium term (2-6 months) as the masses catch on and hype drives us to a crazy share price. I’ll start selling a portion after the real hype kicks in (pose-Nasdaq), but will surly keep some for hopes of the trials panning out. \n\n\nOh yea, Kevin O Leary and Bruce Linton are quite involved in MindMed.

Think of otc stocks as more risky, “still-trying-to-prove-themselves as legitimate companies” stocks. \n\n\nMindMed *could* get on Nasdaq as early as next week. Many mmed bulls will say it 100% will after 5 consecutive days of trading at $2usd, but there’s no way they can make that claim. I’m the biggest mmed bull there is and I’m only 75% sure.... it’s just more complicated that what people think and there could be more to it.

It was scary that evening when no one knew why, but the very next day it came out that it was pre planned and was actually not bad news at all (I forget the reasoning). But not worrisome in the least. \n\n\nA reverse split was more of a fear a few weeks/months ago and those fears are getting smaller as the share price climbs. It is agreed on my most (although not 100% confirmed from what I can tell) that the Nasdaq uplisting price requirement is $2usd for 5 consecutive days. Mmedf was way below $2usd when they applied, so the fear was legit. Since then they have gone on a very healthy run and broke $2usd yesterday and held it all day. \n\n\nSo they are likely very close to holding the share price they need, and since they have held out for this long, it would make no sense to do a reverse split now, seeing as they are seemingly so close to meeting the requirement naturally. I can’t say a RS won’t happen for sure, but it is looking extremely unlikely at this point, especially after yesterday. If it holds $2usd again today then even less likely. \n\n\nHonestly Nasdaq *could* happen as early as next Monday, but my DD makes me more comfortable saying within next 1-3 weeks (things often take longer than expected, and covid could even factor a slight delay). **Bottom line is, if you are interested in getting into this stock, get in no later than the 5th consecutive day of trading at $2usd+, which could be as early as Friday, because day 6 could be 🚀. Better yet, get in as close to $2 as you can.** Always do your own DD though, don’t rely on a random internet stranger who is a clear mmed bull. \n\n\nI’m very passionate about the short term gains of this stock and see it as *almost* guaranteed free money, assuming nothing unpredictable happens (pennystocks in general are volatile).

Caveat, of course, is that VW has been threatening this for years (for example they made a universal electric chassis in 2018 or 2019 that they said they could put multiple bodies on like lego) and they're still nowhere to be seen, I bet my bottom dollar though, once we hit economies of scale they're going to splash in, it's not like they're generations behind tesla's tech, also nissan and toyota.

Is it going to get googled to China's baidu? Inside China, 2 years ago, Tesla was hot because you could get around the license plate lottery in T1 cities (only a certain amount of licenses allowed each year) with an electric and Tesla was the only reasonable option, not the case anymore, I see way more of those Nio SUVs now. How about the internet connectivity for Tesla's smart bs? How much snappier will Nio be phoning home / integrating with the Chinese walled ecosystem?

Even if I cut my Tesla shares in half, or sell my calls.... it would still make up a like 30-40% chunk of the account. I was thinking keep the shares, sell the 2021 calls in Spring several weeks maybe even a month or two before the June date then I'd have cash and shares.... \n\nDo I hold everything, sell some part of my holdings take the profits and spread them around?

(2) are you happy with the gains so far? (3) would you rather have cash or shares\n\nPersonally, I am using the profit I made to exercise the deep ITM calls. There have been 4 waves of upswing in Tesla in the last year: from $400 to $900 in February, from $800 to $1,750 in July, from $1,350 to $2,500 in August before the split , and finally right now from $404 to $640. I have ridden all four and made lots of money, but the one thing I regret was not exercising those deep ITM calls I had early on and just get shares. There advantages include: (1) less tax liability, (2) you get to buy below-the-market shares, and (3) flexibility to make higher probability trades\n\nTax liability should be simple to understand. Instead of selling 3 of your calls and pocket 3(x) amount of profit, you are only selling 2 and will only incur 2(x) of capital gains. \n\nYou will get to buy shares at $420, not $640.\n\nSince you own shares now, you can still generate cash very easily by selling OTM covered calls. When IV is high, you can get some really nice premium on some stupid contracts that WSB autists love to buy. For example, what about a March 2021 $1,000 call for about $2,500?

For example, let's say the stock jumps to $1,000 on a squeeze and you don't think it will sustain there and will retrace to $750 (which is still insane if you ask me lol), sell some $800-900 covered call so you can capture the premium but still keep the shares once the stock price falls below the strike price.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I'm a HUGE fan of sell half when up.

I don't think so\n\nIn regards to comparisons between today and 1999 / dot com.  I think the difference is that the market was struggling to understand what these companies were and how they could be profitable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese were completely new products, and were un-monetized at that.  Based on the NASDAQ as a whole, the market correctly intuited that the internet would be huge and, from a discounted cash flow perspective (one of the most traditional valuation methods there is), dot com was \\*not\\* a bubble in the sense that if you bought in '99, you are up on that investment today with a reasonable return.  It just took the market a while to correct.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Tesla, there's no doubt the stock is benefitting from the melt-up in growth company valuations.  Some of the private market / VC -> public market returns over this cycle have been ludicrous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, unlike the dot com bubble, Tesla makes a traditional product with a tried-and-true installed base, predictable consumer demand, and a huge runway of monetizeable growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's be honest, if Tesla cars sucked, no one other than enthusiasts would buy them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs hackneyed as it may be, I think a better analogy of Tesla is to compare it to the iPhone cycle rather than the Dotcom cycle / bubble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one would pay $1,000 for a phone in 2008 (at the depths of a massive market rout)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, Apple increased sales predictably because they created a vastly superior (1,000x?)  product to replace an existing installed base of inventory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy traditional methods, if you had assumed a 5-10% market share and Motorolza Razr pricing for the iPhone - you wouldn't have gotten much,  You needed to understand that the iphone would replace email, video, phone, music, photo, social media etc. etc. etc. and that the best in-class provider of all those services would capture a massive share of the market at a premium price.\n\nNow, Tesla may not be 1,000x vs. an ICE car.  May be 10x? 100x?  Either way, in many ways it's probably not as revolutionary as the iPhone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the one thing TSLA has going for it is a declining cost curve with respect to EV's vs. ICE.  Wright's law says for every doubling of production, costs decline by 15%.  ICE is a mature industry and thus volumes will not double again.  They are bumping up against the cheap end of the cost curve.  And in fact, ICE is moving backwards because they now need to pay for EV credits.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla, on the other hand, has a good chance of doubling production many times over... and lots of people believe many, many, many times over.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think at battery day, Elon said they are planning on manufacturing capacity of 20mm vehicles.  This would be a 40x from their current production run rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of this is a slam dunk, but for what it's worth, i think that while Tesla's situation ryhmes with some of the things that happened during dot com, in lots of ways it's totally different. and better.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Here is my valuation point: \nTesla is operating in a huge operation leverage.

The rounding bottom is a consolidation pattern.\n\nIt appears that a hidden bear wedge is forming - this could indicate downward projection.\n\nIf GME makes it up to the 18.30 - 19.30 range, expect a top and downtrend to appear. Perhaps just in time for earnings cliff dive?\n\nBe mindful of a position fake out and GME to begin forming a cup and handle - bullish pattern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[30m](https://preview.redd.it/ykope0y5vq361.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcefee453a0f0956f613fb67250ba56f5d00a3d3)\n\nRecommended Positions:\n\nHEDGE:\n\n* 17c 12/11 exp and 17p 12/11 exp.\n* If GME passes 17.44 with volume, play 17.5c 12/11 and trim around 18-19.30 area.\n* If GME falls below 16.5 with momentum, play 16.5p 12/11 exp.\n* And take profit at around 16-15.12 range.\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Daily Charting Update Schedule\n\n* ~~6:30 AM MST - Opening Bell Outlook with Bonus TA on the preferred stock pick to the day~~\n* ~~11:00 AM MST - Midday Outlook TOO BUSY SORRY~~\n* ~~1:30 PM MST - Closing Bell Outlook and Next Day Position Recommendation CAN ONLY POST TWICE A DAY GOING FORWARD~~\n* ~~3:30 PM MST - Daily Recap.~~\n\n# Current Positions:\n\n~~NIO Lotto - 40p 12/11 exp~~\n\n~~SPY (Hedge) - 368p/368c 12/11 exp~~\n\nLooking at GME, ~~AMD~~\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# THE NIGHTMAN COMETH ONE LAST TIME to TALK ABOUT NIO\n\nPossible long squeeze happening with NIO due to china delisting fears. IMO. They won't get delisted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast \"Thursday, an analyst gave a negative view of China's EV industry, sending NIO's stock lower by 5%. UBS issued a note on NIO rival XPeng, cutting its rating from buy to neutral based largely on the huge run-up in valuation that XPeng had seen. NIO investors seemed to take that message to heart as well.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNIO is in a healthy downtrend channel and needs to hit support at around the 38.18 range to complete. It should bounce off resistance and head back to  39-40 level where it may find some resistance. If it breaks resistance at that level, anticipate NIO to climb to 41-42 range for the second resistance level. It may bounce or may exit the downtrend since the pattern will technically be complete. If it jumps out expect a  PT of 42-45 within 3-4 days of the breakout.\n\nIf NIO fails to break the first resistance level at 39-4o level, anticipate it to drop to the 38-36 range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNiO shouldn't go lower than 30. 30 PT is a danger zone. We are getting near the bottom so be mindful of your indicators and oscillators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Suggested plays for NIO:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* HEDGE: 42c 12/11, 42p 12/11\n* If NIO breaks 44.28 resistance, convincingly, play a 44c 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 45.11 - 51.93 (not getting even close to 51) range.\n* If NIO breaks support at 41.16, convincingly, play 40p 12/11 exp and trim or take profit at 38.18 - 29.06 range.\n* I recommend you let your hedge expire worthless or you could try to sell you put at the bottom and keep your call for on the way up - this is WSB after all.\n* BIG BRAIN with bullish sentiment for next week towards NIO might hedge with a 42c 12/18 exp. and 42p 12/11. If you take that strategy. Good luck friend.

{"title": "Why Canoo is Ahead of All Other EV SPACs and Will Change the EV Market", "selftext": "**A Quick Intro:**\n\nCanoo is an EV company going public through an SPAC merger later this month. Their 1st vehicle will begin mass production in 2022. You can look at it [HERE](https://www.canoo.com/design/)\n\nIt plans to offer it's product (vehicles) through a subscription based model. These subscriptions could be 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1+ year, etc. The subscription includes the vehicle, registration, maintenance, charging, and access to insurance.\n\n**What Puts Them Ahead?**\n\nThere's a few things that do. The easiest to see is the fact that they have a product. Their first van type vehicle(aka the BangBus) has already went through 50 crash tests and has actually been driving on the  highway.\n\nThe most exciting fact is the **Skateboard Design.** First watch [THIS](https://youtu.be/8m3fRujSlW0). The skateboard is essentially everything that makes the car go. Combine this with their steer by wire design(frees up a ton of space and can be put anywhere) and you have everything you need to make the car drive in the floor of the vehicle. This means for every model they're just adding the top \"shell\" to the skateboard and BOOM: you have a vehicle. Once they finalize the skateboard design(which they pretty much have done) then they can pump out new EV models like nothing. I'm talking delivery van, pickup truck, sports car, sedan, etc. [This picture sums it up](https://i0.wp.com/alabamanewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Canoo_Design_Exterior_Possibilities.jpg?ssl=1) All they have to do is the design work, slap it on the skateboard, and run some tests.\n\nTheir **Subscription Based Model** makes electric cars available to a a whole new market. This includes people who don't want to fully buy/own a car. The monthly fee covers literally everything so it's perfect for them. It includes people who can't afford to buy an electric car. The subscription model lowers the price of owning an EV, making it accessible to more customers. And then since it's easier for them to make new models, they may be the first to put an electric delivery van or pickup truck on the market. This would attract a TON of retail businesses/people.\n\nNow the rest is **Purely Speculative** but there are plenty of potential deals that may arise that make a lot of sense. The most being an **Uber** or Lyft deal. The subscription model makes Canoo vehicles perfect for Uber drivers. No gas expense, no maintenance fee, won't have to dirty your own car, etc. And Uber could then play this up in advertising by saying many of their drivers \"drive electric\".\n\nThis is another popular one but a shot in the dark. **Apple** has been wanting to get into the EV game for awhile. Canoo would be the perfect target for an investment. An innovative product that rethinks how vehicles are traditionally made and sold. It's not like Apple has ever made anything like that before...........\n\n**The Stock Itself:**\n\nCanoo has largely been under the radar until the past week or so. They have a lot of good things happening this month, which could serve as major catalysts. They're unveiling their delivery van on December 17th, voting on the merger on the 21st, and who knows what else might happen. Canoo is being valuated at $2.4 billion through this merger, which is criminally low. The only way I see this company going is up from here on out.\n\n[Watch this is you want to feel as confident as I am in this company](https://youtu.be/9F_W8pev4XQ)\n\nTLDR; Shares, Warrants, Calls. They all go.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that they have an engineering contract with Hyundai and Kia to help them develop a skateboard for their Electric line of cars.
