Potentially use proceeds to purchase more AMD LEAPS at same expiration but deeper ITM strike. Will reevaluate decision if sold. Regardless of profit/loss, I will exit 30 days before expiration. \n\nI'd just add to your exit strategy what you do if there's a major bear market or recession, because this is always going to be the fundamental risk of LEAPS. I'd look back on the AMD chart to see what happens to it during these times. I'm specifically wondering if you're cool to sit with your LEAP at $0.50 or less if/when it dumps 80-90% from current levels, because if you take the time to study the chart before making this kind of investment, you'll see that is what happens specifically to AMD during these times.\n\nOne solution to the problem is to roll the LEAP flat/out or up/out as it is tumbling in price. Another could be to simply wait it out and hope it comes back (I think this was your solution). However, if it doesn't come back on time (those pesky exp dates), you probably ought to have a plan of what to do. Inject more capital by buying another LEAP of a lower strike? Letting it exp worthless? Do you sell premium along the way in the form of a PMCC to lower cost basis enough to do this? Maybe all of these?\n\nSeriously, if you're gonna be committing your hard-earned money, you ought to be thinking of all possible scenarios. I notice there's an implicit bias traders have where they explicitly focus on the upside, and sort of brush off/don't have a clear plan for the down side. Personally, I think it should be the opposite. You should be heavily focusing/borderline obsessing over the downside such that your trading plan covers all possible scenarios, and so you know what to do and don't panic when a random, horrible scenario inevitably pops up.\n\nI'd also paradoxically inform you, as a reddit user, to never commit your capital to anything solely on the basis of what a reddit user tells you. Even if it is a mod. You're likely raring to go/FOMOing about how much money you could be making while you study this stuff, but I'm probably gonna be one of the only people on here to tell you, it never hurts to spend more time studying, there's no easy way to trade, this shit is really hard, you need to read/study/learn all you can before during and after starting, and it's going to be a lifelong process of improvement. \n\nAlso, your first trades will either be wildly successful or horribly painful, because most people have no idea how to manage risk when they first start. I'm hoping this 4 grand that the mods apparently told you to throw at AMD isn't all you have in that account, but considering the yearly limit without a backdoor is $6000 on an IRA, that's definitely no small number to be trading with as a first timer.

X-ray machines have basically two parts: a transmitter and a detector.  The transmitter creates the X-Rays, which are the energized wave that \"illuminates\" the subject being examined.  Think of it as a light bulb.  The detector can be thought of as a camera.  They work together and both are necessary to do the job.\n\nNNOX has developed a different kind of transmitter, a low power LED light bulb if you will.  It's said to be around 100 watts and cost around $100.  \n\nThe usual transmitter is $150,000 and has power up to 150,000 watts.  It uses a cathode system, so it's more like an old school TV or radio tube than an LED light bulb.  Being so powerful, it requires a lot of supporting equipment and installation.\n\nSo on the surface, to someone not in the radiology business, that all sounds great, right?  Get rid of the old $150,000 cathode bulb and just use some of these light and easy new $100 bulbs... revolutionary!  Unfortunately, no.  \n\nIn practice, the $150,000 transmitter tube is part of the machine that clinics buy, it lasts for decades, and since it basically never dies, they come with a lifetime replacement warranty.  The $100 NNOX bulb is therefore solving a problem that doesn't exist for anyone buying a X-ray machine. \n\nAnd an X-ray machine using such a hypothetical 100w bulb would be necessarily quite limited in the range of what it can illuminate whereas machines using the 150,000 watt cathode can be adjusted to do basically anything.  \n\nApparently NNOX is preying on these misunderstandings and saying nonsense things like how their bulb is \"digital\", as if that somehow makes a difference, and ascribing benefits of their transmitter that could only be achieved if they invented a new kind of detector, which they haven't.\n\nI might be butchering this explanation a bit, but that was my read of it, and once I saw that I decided I'd be avoiding NNOX regardless of what happens.\n\nPart of me questions the criticism and asks: \"isn't it a good thing if $150,000 can be taken out of the cost of an X-Ray machine?\"  But supposedly the limitations and the fact there's no corresponding detector change makes it a less than interesting prospect.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Sexy comment", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "oooh.. deep pharma rates them as one of the top companies to watch 2021-22.

Tesla’s ambition is to grow revenues 50% per year through 2025 and achieve 10% net margins. The ambition was outlined in 2015, and so far they have grown revenue almost exactly by 50% annually and last quarter their net income margin was ~4% (this quarter it will probably be ~7%), so they are tracking well towards their goals (especially since they are building out 3 factories on 3 continents this year and next). If they achieve their ambition of 50% revenue growth, their revenue in 2025 will be around $240 billion. At 10% net income margin, that’s $24 billion net income. If we assume 5% dilution in their share count per year, that’s 1.4 billion fully diluted shares in existence by 2025, so the earnings per share is $16.94. If we assign a 90 price to earnings multiple (similar to Amazon today, which is the closest analogue of such a business success story), then Tesla will be worth $1,525 per share in 5 years, or an annual return of 19%.\n\nNow, of course, Tesla might fall short of their ambition. The worst Tesla has ever performed against any long term ambition they had is falling short of their delivery goals in 2018 due to stalled/slow Model 3 production ramp. They had been aiming for 500k sales in 2020 for many years (which no analysts or anyone on Wall Street believed), and after the Model 3 showed so much demand upon reveal, they accelerated the target to 2018. In 2018, they fell short of this target by 50%, but they will likely hit the target in 2020. So, let’s do a scenario where Tesla does $120 billion revenue in 2025 (50% short of the $240 billion target) and 6.25% net income margins, and bump the price to earnings down for worse execution to 75. Then, Tesla would only be worth $397 per share in 2025, or an annual return of -9%. I don’t view this scenario as very likely, as the Model 3 ramp was their only production ramp at the time and they did eventually accomplish their goals. Tesla will be doing several production ramps at the same time from here on out, and it is very unlikely that they all fall short by 50% simultaneously (in other words, they are diversified now). \n\nSo there you have it, if Tesla accomplishes their ambition, they’ll return shareholders 19% per year, and if they fail as hard as they have ever failed, they will return -9% per year. Now you can assign likelihoods to each scenario to come up with your own price you think Tesla should be at. It is worth noting that Tesla may underperform the bad scenario (if every automaker put out plans like Volkswagen’s aggressive plans and actually executed well on them) or outperform the good scenario (especially if they succeed in creating robotaxis or if governments ramp up support for EVs and accelerate the transition to EVs, or if you put some faith in their latest ambition of 50% not just through 2025 but through 2030), but these two scenarios are a good guide.

They have been trying but have all failed,  and your Tesla isnt even #1 in Europe is only due to pre orders of new EV models that come in batches, check again over an entire year, when these new EVs cant find enough batteries to meet demand or keep the price low enough to entice more buyers.... every announced model has less range, less performance for a higher cost so far, and the fact that Tesla has a lock on the battery market means it will be very difficult for other EV companies to compete on price.

To specify here. I mean a car that can navigate by itself in ALL situations. Pretty much you could remove steering wheel and that car could go anywhere you tell it. I am fairly certain this is much more difficulty than a lot of people believe. That's why the announcement 'This year we are really are ready with FSD'  seems to be coming for the past 5 years every year.\n\nI am definitely not a person that says 'it will never happen'. It will but it will take much longer.\n\nThe robotaxis that will take quicker are the ones that drive in very limited area where every inch is mapped in great detail but these cars would be crap if you go outside that area. I believe that TESLA is doing the true AI approach that once it is ready will work anywhere I just think its a long way away.\n\nBtw, I saw the FSD Tesla youtube videos (several) and that just emphasizes my believe that we are a long way away. It is super impressive and I understand its BETA but holy cow people would get in a crazy amount of accidents and most of the cases I have seen weren't even any particular edge cases.\n\nAll that said I would love to have a FSD car immediately I am just being a realist.\n\nBatteries: As you can see with recent announcements there are so many things happening with new battery tech that could be completely disrupting and even established battery technology (especially in China) is already cheaper than Tesla's batteries although there are currently no official price for TESLA battery but its estimated a bit below $100/kwh.\n\nSo you are claiming people had the same choice of electric cars (besides Tesla) 2-5 years ago as they are starting to do now. I hope I am not the only one that disagrees with you here.\n\nThere was super little EV competition until now and the coming Years. Some of the EV's from a few years ago were also only compliance cars. Way more models are released now than in the past and they are coming from established car makers (Ford, VW, Audi, Mercedes, GM, BMW, Porsche etc.). Not even talking about all the Chinese automakers some of which will ship internationally. Than there are a million SPAC EV makers and even Toyota will bring out a decent EV next year and they don't even believe in EV's.\n\nSo to say the EV competition several years ago was the same as it is now / near future is completely wrong in my opinion.\n\nFor tons of people 250mile range is plenty. U.S. is not the only EV market even though thats what some people seem to believe. Europe/Asia has different needs and this is also why Tesla is not even the No1 selling EV car in the EU anymore as they used to be the previous years.\n\nTo finish this up I believe TESLA is a great company and without them there would be no / very little push to EV's which I believe is way better for the environment (depending where the electricity is from, how batteries are made etc.) but I think the days where people only looked at TESLA when they think about EV is over or will be over very soon as there are just so many choices coming up and Europe already proofs this by having other models on No1 for EV than Tesla.\n\nI just think that it will be much tougher for TESLA going forward but competition is great for consumers and EV's are a huge growth market.\n\nWe should check this back in a few years.

They have already looked into all battery tech, have no fear once something new is viable/superior for their cars they will switch quickly.\n\nCompetition: I'm all for competition(own a nissan leaf and model 3), but right now Tesla is 5 maybe 10 years ahead of the competition.  The whole 250miles is plenty is the thinking other car companies use to justify their crappy EV cars.  Add in cold weather, a couple errands, charging to 100% is bad for the battery, forgot to charge last night, a roof rack, low tire pressure, etc etc and that 250 ideal miles quickly becomes much much less(want to go on a ski trip?, nope better have a ICE car)....in order for EVs to eliminate ICE cars it will have to match it's range/price/convenience and Tesla is the only EV maker taking that seriously with the most range, focus on battery supply/price and super charger network....they still have a way to go but they will be the first company to offer a 500 mile range affordable EV by at least 5 years and this is a very very big deal.\n\nGlad you see the bigger picture about how Tesla has forced the rest of the car industry to adapt or go out of business.  But  you still underestimate how far ahead Tesla really is and how difficult it will be for the other players to catch up.  No one else is involved in battery development like Tesla(besides making batteries Tesla is actually mining battery minerals themselves), that is a huge cost advantage...The real problem for the big car companies is their entire business model is centered around the ICE vehicle, the dealerships and finance(loans/leases/warranty)....ICE vehicles require much more maintenance and warranty work than EVs do, and they have a much shorter lifetime, the only limiting factor on EVs lifetime are the batteries, so it wont be uncommon to see 500k mileage Teslas soon and future battery tech could push that to a million miles.  ICE cars are good for what, 100-200k miles if your lucky, lets not forget all the money required to get much passed 100k....This will destroy most big car companies because if they start really pushing EVs they also shutoff the majority of their historical profits(very little profits in making cars as you know, unless you highly vertically integrated like Tesla)...and why no car company has really tried to take on Tesla to date, not because they cant but because once they see the end financial results they just push compliance cars and pay Tesla the regulatory credits, and they still come out way ahead making ICE vechicles(for now anyway)....I'll guarantee most big Car companies will not be able to convert to EVs without declaring bankruptcy or being bailed out first due to this...Allowing Tesla to move further ahead.\n\nOh and to add the energy utility ability of a 500 mile range/1million mile lifetime cars is the biggest deal very few can comprehend...it will make Tesla 10X bigger than Apple when they execute on that but its something few can comprehend unless you've ever dealt with solar/house batteries.

Remember that diversification is for preserving wealth and concentration is needed for building wealth and you are obviously still very much in the building wealth stage of your life. And as your portfolio grows over the years, it will likely naturally become more diversified as you naturally discover more companies that you understand and believe in rather than trying to force in more diversification just for the sake of it which is what you are currently trying to do.\n\nHere are some quotes from some highly successful investors to help drive this point further:\n\n* \"Investors have been so oversold on diversification that fear of having too many eggs in one basket has caused them to put far too little into companies they thoroughly know and far too much in others which they know nothing at all. It never seems to occur to them that buying a company without having sufficient knowledge of it may be even more dangerous than having inadequate diversification.\" - Phil Fisher\n* \"It is a mistake to think that one limits one’s risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence. One’s knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself entitled to put full confidence.\" - John Maynard Keynes\n* \"If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is going to be a terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea.

Futures tend to be priced with better interest rates than those available to the average individual investor. To mirror the stdev of the concentrated portfolio, we can hold 80% of the notional value of the futures position in short-term treasuries against the futures exposure. So now as a return on capital outlay, the diversified (at least as much as the S&P 500) and leveraged portfolio of futures returns 12.5% with stdev of 25%.\n\nIn other words, if your concentrated portfolio has 25% stdev of return due to idiosyncratic risk compared to the market’s stdev of 20%, you’d have to beat the market by 2.5% per year to keep pace on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nI’m conflating risk with volatility here, but I’ve yet to see a better proxy.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This is great advise.

Tesla has a potential positive catalyst coming up the first week of January (January 4th maybe?) when they report their 4th quarter sales, and again January 27th when they report 4th quarter earnings.

They also dropped the ball on cloud, even though they have google docs.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "GCP has an interesting take, and its long term outlook isn't necessarily as dire as you're saying.  At the moment they portray themselves as the disruptor.  They don't have the product set to keep up with AWS or Azure but they do have the resources to catch them eventually.  Some of the things they do have, Google Kubernetes Engine for example, are neat.  They also are one of the leaders pushing for cloud interoperability, for obvious reasons.  Some of those bets could pay off in the medium to long term.  They're clearly in third place of the big three, but with a 9% market share of cloud and growing at 45% YoY I think its unfair to say they dropped the ball.  They were late to the game, and AWS had a near decade head start.\n\nWhat you've not stated is that Google's true crown jewel is the amount of data it has on everyone.  That's unmatched by any company out there today.  The reason ads have been their cash cow is because Google knows what you want to see more than anyone else.  Amazon may challenge that in the B2C space because if you know what you want you can just go and buy it, but what about a longer sales cycle item like a car?  What do you think the keywords to be the first entry for the luxury passenger vehicle sell for?  What about all of the B2B businesses whose sales cycle starts with a Google search.  That will take a lot to disrupt.\n\nAs for its outlook, in the next 10 years, how many ways will it be able to monetize the data it has on everyone?  For example, they'll likely have a solution for self driving cars at some point, at least in major metropolitan areas.  That solution will be much easier for car companies not named Tesla to put on their cars because it you won't need high definition cameras on your vehicle.  You just install an ugly LIDAR system.  Google has the money to subsidize this.  Because 73% of everyone uses Android, it'll know who you are and the best route to drive you home so that it takes you by stores and restaurants you're likely to have an interest in.  Then it asks you if you want to modify your route to stop by on the way.  How much is that traffic worth to businesses and how much will they pay to be on that route?  How much will consumers be willing to pay Google for a premium membership to opt out of advertising in that form?  I'm just some guy on the internet, but Google has smart people working to figure this out right now.  They could actually pay companies to adopt their self driving technology and then give the software away for free and be profitable off of the ads using some of their $121 billion in cash on hand to subsidize the short term loss.  Its Waze (which they own) on steroids.\n\nIf the argument is that Tesla is the leader in self driving because they have the best and most data on car performance, then apply that logic to how much information Google has on people.  From your NEST thermostat, to Google Home, to Android, to every email you've written that's touched GMail, to YouTube to everything you've ever searched for.  Then think about all the different ways you can monetize that data with the head start they have.  That's Google's 20 year business model.

After that they basically gave up and facebook won.\n\nAs for waymo:\n- they divested from it already, because it sucks and is too capital intensive\n- driving you where you don't want to go \"as a type of ad\" won't be effective and people will hate it\n- lidar is more complicated and costs more than HD cams. Waymo has far larger costs for sensors compared to tesla. Mobileye is already moving in the direction of solving the vision problem, like tesla, only they are years behind.\n\nAs for cloud, sure 9% is nothing to balk at, but its google and google has very high expectations. If these expectations don't get fulfilled, they will lose a ton of shareholders, capital cost will rise, etc.\n\nI am hopeful for them, when I hear about things like alphafold.

There are some significant developments on that end as well, which I'll write up later this week. I'll leave you with a little teaser, though - [does this](https://jpeocbrnd.army.mil/docs/default-source/default-document-library/jpm-fact-sheet-surveillance-stick(3).pdf?sfvrsn=55cb2dd7_0) look strangely similar to **SRNE**'s CoviStix, right after they got $37m in funding from DARPA a few weeks ago? Will get to that in the next post...\n\n**DD #1: Pending $1b+ Arbitration: Is it pending, or over and awaiting announcement? See DD2# last 3 cliffnotes...**\n\nPatrick Soon-Shiong (referred to as PSS going forward) was CEO of NantPharma in 2015, and purchased the rights to [Cynviloq from **SRNE**](https://www.genengnews.com/news/sorrento-sells-cynviloq-for-1-3b/) for up to $1.3billion, pending milestones. Shortly afterwards, PSS discontinued development of the blockbuster drug. Why?

Why is this significant? **NantKwest’s CEO is PSS from DD#1.**\n\nYou may be wondering - well, so what, how does that affect **SRNE?** Great question. [**SRNE** owns 10 million shares of ImmunityBio](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/node/11421/html) (Ctrl+F “ issued 10 million shares of NantCell”). What the hell is NantCell?

That filing came a couple days after the last meeting in the arbitration case - go to [LA Court Website](http://www.lacourt.org/casesummary/ui/index.aspx), type in these two case numbers: 20STCV08789,19STCV11328. Oh, and the next court date for both is a “Post-Arbitration” next year.\n* October 21: Court hearing for the $1b arbitration\n* October 27th: SRNE voluntarily cuts agreement to sell up to $250m in stock\n\n**DD #3: SRNE rejected $7 a share buyout offer when stock was under $1.6 in November 2019.**\n\nOn Monday, November 25th 2019, Sorrento released [this PR](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sorrento-therapeutics-inc-received-and-rejected-unsolicited-all) stating that they received and rejected a $7/share buyout offer. The trading day prior, the stock price was $1.60. They rejected a buyout of almost 330% premium because they felt **“the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento”** and unanimously rejected it. Keep in mind, this was pre-Covid pipeline, so based on their ownership of their IP / products at the time.\n\n**DD #4: Unusual options activity again!**\n\nBack in March, when SRNE was trading at $1.8, I made a thread on r/options asking about [Unusual Options Activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fl38vh/question_about_unusual_options_activity_does_it/). On March 12th, [someone had purchased ](https://imgur.com/a/rwStwJJ)3700 calls 250% out of the money. SRNE a couple weeks later started its infamous run from $1.8 to $19, and our fellow autists learned about it.\n\nLast week, I noticed unusual options activity again in SRNE. This time, [it was 8500 calls purchased for Jan 15, 2021](https://www.optionsonar.com/unusual-option-activity/srne) representing over $400k in volume for that strike/exp. After a little more digging, I noticed today that there was over $1.4m in Jan 2022 deep ITM calls purchased **just today.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DD #5: CEO Compensation Incentives:**\n\nAccording to the filing below (Ctrl+F \"CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD\"), Dr. Henry Ji's options begin to vest when the market cap is > $5 billion dollars. His options can be exercised at $17.30. Any shares he acquires must be held for **5 years** after acquiring them before.

A lot of speculation and worry comes from his grammatical errors or poor choices in words despite genuine talking points/updates. \n\n\nI've seen the ups and downs with this stock and I've noticed Ji is being smart now, keeping his mouth shut and focusing solely on practical announcements. We are now only hearing about definite progress, authorizations and pipeline goals being met, not anymore on the \"its going well! cover shorts! soon!\" \n\n\nJi is too honest and forward for his own good. A lot of people back in the summer and fall months wanted immediate results and products on the market, but this shit took time to play out. Biotechs are like that, you need to follow the right procedures, tests and FDA guidelines to get shit out there. A lot of people heard \"wow a great solution to covid! look at all this stuff!\" and wanted overnight results. Luckily we are on the tail end and should be seeing those results in Q1 of 2021. Lots of EUAs now on the table, stage 2/3 trials and endorsements/funding coming through. \n\nAlso, worth noting that they have a pretty incredible cancer non-opioid pain management drug on the horizon too. (It uses capsaicin, yes the hot pepper chemical)\n\nOverall this stock to me is one you really need to do your DD on to feel comfortable with, because you sure as hell wont get it from day traders who get angry when they dont see the huge pop overnight.

{"title": "PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/22", "selftext": "Told you 25 was the bottom\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr\\_technical\\_analysis\\_from\\_a\\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdrvdm/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)\n\nWe are going to 40-45, mid January. Originally was targeting beginning of the year because we looked like we were moving 50% faster than the run-up of NIO and about 100% faster than TSLA , now it looks like the moves are about the same as NIO, so a target of 40-45 to late January is a safer bet. This is why I told you guys to use 1/15 and 5/21 calls, because you can roll those with less theta decay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ayjurt9xr661.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=aabc196dfa12af7353fb341180c3630f7123f8d7\n\nI rolled half of my 1/15 30 strikes to now 2/19 30 strikes with a slight hit (10% off purchase price) and increased the 2/19 30 strike position by 100%.  Basically increased total option positions by 50% to now 60k. Holding about 130k in shares.\n\nI expect us to be pinned around 27-28 before Christmas, then we'll have another run up to 31-33 when the shorts unwind for the gamma pin on monday/tuesday. Then a pinning of around 29-31 before year end. Then we'll have a large rally for the first 2-3 weeks of January, maybe ahead or after the public demonstration of PLTR.\n\nWe are in a game where we push up the value of companies so they clear multiple market cap and liquidity hurdles to be included in various ETFs/indexes, these then create a base level of support, such as with NIO and TESLA, the ultimate of which is inclusion in the S&P500, then really there is not much to the game left. This is why i recommend you sell your TSLA and get into PLTR, because the game is only getting started with PLTR. In the meanwhile we have to contend with various antics of MM who are trying to make sure options expire worthless, which drive interim moves.\n\nIf you can't handle the volatility, just buy shares. If you are playing options, be very aware of option expiry dates, gamma positioning through max pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1: Getting a lot of comments on insider selling post lock-up. It is absolute bullshit. I know you guys can't read, but its literally right in the S-1**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1u34w149jv661.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=68ba8763bffc5616f80e2e981d703a03ec95bd4a\n\n60%+ of the company is owned by Thiel, Karp, Cohen, and SOMPO (A Japanese Strategic who has a JV with Palantir in Japan), none of whom will sell major stakes in the company any time soon.\n\nOut of the cap table about 20% is held by VCs which may need to liquidate due to fund life terms. Half of that is probably going out next year as they appear to be cross fund investments by all these VCs, the earlier vintage funds will have liquidation pressures while the later funds can wait. So maybe half these shares need to be sold in 2021 post lock-up.\n\nEmployee option is peanuts. The only thing being sold post lock-up is 10% by the three VCs (Foundrs Fund/Thiel, 8VC and DTS. That is nowhere close to 1 billion shares, it’s closer to 250 million shares or about 4 days trading volume, which is no big deal. They will be exiting that 10% over likely the course of 6 month/1 year, it won't even make a dent in the market liquidity.
