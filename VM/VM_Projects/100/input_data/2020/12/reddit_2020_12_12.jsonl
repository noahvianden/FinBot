{"title": "Making money off this AAPL leap", "selftext": "Made a pretty big move last week that I already kind of regret. I dropped about 48k into AAPL Jan 2022 leaps. I like to buy ITM to lessen theta, but should have thought more about the break even price of $140. Over the past week I've had less and less confidence in this play. I've started to think AAPL is overvalued, and even if good news does continue to come out, it's already a 2.1 trillion dollar company. What's left to catalyze this stock to a bigger market cap? \n\nThen you have the vaccine. Money will surely be taken out of tech stocks like Apple and allocated into beat down stocks. I should have thought about this play harder. What's your take on it?\n\nAlso, I'm thinking about selling some weekly calls against it, but can't decide if I should just abandon the position. Would appreciate some others' insight here.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6aVtUsj](https://imgur.com/a/6aVtUsj)", "id": "kbpbvq", "created_utc": 1607780703.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "Since you posted this on r/options Im less inclined to troll you.

However, if you can learn the fundamentals of the market in which a security trades, and the catalysts for demand, then when exogenous forces, for example trillions of dollars given to insurance co’s, money managers, banks etc., one can project with reasonable certainty that a security’s price will move in the direction towards a strike. \n\nI’m 26 and by most standards “poor”, so I’m interested in your active management system...

This is because one the premiums are relatively higher and two you can aim your strikes better. Sounds like a no brainer right? Wrong. Most people go for monthlies or quarterlies. Makes no sense to me but hey, what do I know. \n\nBasically I find stocks I wouldn’t mind owning. I then short a put or call option (so cash secured put or covered call) for the premium, with strikes usually ATM or slightly OTM if I’m a little bearish for puts or bullish for calls. I never sell or let my stock get assigned below the purchase/assignment price. So basically I’m okay with breaking even on the stock or profiting, and meanwhile writing options on it the whole time. \n\nSome people call it the wheel but the wheel has a lot of rules that I think are bullshit. For one, never judge a trade by its expiration. If I sell a put at 40 and it finishes at 38 for the week, I turn around and sell calls until it hits or surpasses 40 again. Therefore I never lose. Even if it takes months or even years. It’s all about patience. But in the meantime, no matter what I’m making money. \n\nOther dumb rules are avoid earnings and volatility, and stuff like that. Being afraid of movement is like being afraid of the thing you’re trying to do. \n\nIt’s somewhat of an art form. But that’s the gist. I do this in my Roth because it’s tax free. In my regular account I’m long except for margin, which I use as collateral for more CSPs.\n\nEdit: over the long run you will run into times when you’re ‘stuck’ with a loser. That’s why you should be able to run at least 8-10 different names with this strategy. Like I played CVS and it’s never recovered. If it was a market wide problem I’d just be patient. But it’s just down and costing me in opportunity. So I just waited until I broke even in total, meaning premium total minus loss on the underlying equity. I bailed and started onto better trades.

Some of the quality issues are things that Tesla catches and fixes (rework) before they deliver the vehicles. Some are things that the customer complains about and Tesla fixes under warranty. Some are cosmetic issues such as uneven panel gaps, which bother some customers while others others don't care or don't care much. And of course some are unfixable problems (lemon laws) or a fix doesn't become available until sometime later.\n\nAccording to recent reports, in the US the Model Y (considerably younger and with more quality issues than Model 3) is already outselling Model 3. It's fairly widely known that the quality issues are more common for the Y but customers are still clamoring for Model Y. Some customers always wait a while when a new model comes out, and they will push demand even higher later on. It appears that in general Tesla customers are pushing more for new features and greater quantity than for insistence on complete perfection.\n\nThe recent Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey bears this out - even though customers reported relatively high rates of quality issues, Teslas got high customer satisfaction ratings compared to other brands.\n\n> the GP was clearly saying that standards shouldn't be lowered to hit speculator targets based on this email\n\nAgree that Tesla should continue to work hard on quality, which they have been doing. The Model 3 production in Shanghai has reportedly been producing very high quality vehicles, and the Fremont factory has significantly improved its Model 3 quality. I expect that the new Model Y lines in Shanghai, Berlin, and Texas will produce significantly higher quality vehicles than current Fremont Model Y production.\n\nBut what Elon is saying is that at this moment in time, high volume of production is particularly urgent. \n\nYour words seem to indicate that you think the current quality issue rate is fine - just don't let it get any worse. But do you really feel that way? Or would you prefer for Tesla to make quality the top priority? They could do that, but production volume would suffer. I believe that for non-safety-related issues, it's reasonable to have a balance between quality issues and production volume, and what Elon is describing appears to be consistent with what the current customers want.\n\nAnd as I mentioned above, I believe that Tesla quality will continue to improve (other than temporary spikes in quality issues as new models are introduced).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Is that why demand is so low, as Elon has been complaining about? ;-)\n\nThis is a stupid way to look at it.

The question is will they think \"Well the Tesla was good but there were all these little issues, maybe it's worth looking at Hyundai...\". We want to nip that in the bud.\n\n> But do you really feel that way? Or would you prefer for Tesla to make quality the top priority? They could do that, but production volume would suffer. I believe that for non-safety-related issues, it's reasonable to have a balance between quality issues and production volume, and what Elon is describing appears to be consistent with what the current customers want.\n\nThat's not how it should work at all. Look at how Toyota and Honda build cars. They don't build them and say \"eh, it's close enough\". They get the quality right AND they produce in massive quantities.\n\nThere's no **need** to compromise to get production up, but there's a very reasonable worry that there may be compromises on the production line to get production numbers up, and that's what we're talking about here.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that quality is very important, and that it's not desirable to lower quality to meet an end of quarter or end of year push.

As I understand it, solid-state batteries are not advantageous for individual users because the current non Tesla charging network is not a high enough power to achieve these 10 minute recharge rates. Additionally, home chargers are never going to be able to dump that amount of power. Additionally, the second advantage, namely the fact that it does well in colder temperatures, is also dealt with in Tesla via the heat pump right? Regardless, electric vehicles have been doing very well in cold climates like Norway anyways…\n\nSo as I understand it, charging speed and temperature advantages aren’t that big of a deal, my question has to do with energy density. While this third thing is indeed true, they have higher energy density, is this just an issue of cost? Because energy density, as long as you aren’t facing space limitations, simply boils down to cost per unit of installed energy capacity right?\n\nTo me, I don’t feel like solid state is challenging Tesla.

I believe that solid state would increase gravimetric density allowing for weight savings for things like a plane.

Exceptions are performance vehicles, semi trucks and aircraft.

{"title": "CRSR - WSB's Next Millionaire Maker Big play", "selftext": "**CRSR -** Corsair Gaming should be looked at again for WSB's next big play. WSB was high on CRSR after earnings and hit a ATH high of $51.37 earlier last month and is currently trading 35% below its ATH. With the success WSB has had on bringing in retail investors and media recognition, CRSR could easily double from current levels. Let me break out why\n\n**IPO and history:** CRSR ipo'ed back in August 21, 2020. Selling 14 million shares to investors/retail (This float will be important later on) at a price of $17. The stock traded mostly sideways until its first earning report where it blew out estimates on November 10th and rallied from $27 to $51 in a 14 day span.\n\n**Revenue Growth:** CRSR has been growing revenues rapidly year over year, with 17% growth from 2018 (937M) to 2019 (1.1B). CRSR is on track for its best year yet with revenues YTD 9 months of 1.1B and Q4 earnings coming up expecting revenues in the $450m+ (low on guidance, I expected $600m+) range due to the Christmas sales bump/blackfriday/cyber moday. Representing 55% revenue growth from prior year and drastically exceeding its computer accessory peers. (LOGI 11% 2019 growth and 6.3% 2020 revenue growth) This factor alone should pay dues in its upcoming earnings  come February 2021.\n\n**Valuation to competitors:**\n\nLOGI: 15B market cap - 3B annual sales (6.3% annual growth) Price to sales: 5.06\n\nCRSR: 3B market cap - 1.66B+ annual sales (51% annual growth) Price to sales 1.91 \n\n(severely undervalued) PT of  $65 would still put this at under half of LOGI's Market Cap which would be reasonable considering CRSR's revenue growth rate.\n\n**Inventory:** CRSR has expanded its production facilities over the past year and began to stock pile inventory for the upcoming increase in demand during holiday season (christmas, black friday, cyber monday). Inventory levels of 210m Sept 2020 vs 144M June 2020. All old inventory on the books went on fire sale and were on the top deals pages for slick deals/walmart/amazon. With prices slashed up to 50% off these items were quick to sell out and these sales will be reflected in the upcoming earnings call. Guidance was forecasted at 450M for upcoming quarter, which is on the safe side and inline with their Q3 earnings but I expect it to blow these estimates out of the water and coming in at the 600M+ range which would be inline with their quarterly sales growth excluding holiday sales bump (generally a 15% increase in sales from Q3.\n\n**Margin Growth and turning a profit**: CRSR has been implementing economies of scale and recent revenue growth to begin to turn a profit. CRSR has gone net income in Dec 2019 of 6m to 36m as of September 2020.\n\n**Balance sheet:** CRSR has a strong balance sheet with no red flags. Consistent increasing cash positions, Strong working capital, Increased inventory levels for the holiday season rush and minimal debt. The IPO raised238 million dollars from the proceeds and was directly applied toward their debt. Reducing it from 500m to 370m. Which should be paid off by the end of 2022. They are cashflow positive and will no longer need any cash injections/share offerings in the future.\n\n**Recent Sell off:**\n\nTaking profits: People who rode the stock up from earnings from $27 bucks to $51 taking profits and investing in other hot sectors EV/SPAC/IPOs. The dry up on volume has resulted in this stock heavily following the SPY.\n\nAnalyst Downgrade: Cowen & Co downgraded the stock with a price target of $37 causing it to drop 15% early last week, stating the risk is to high with its recent run up and is overvalued compared to LOGI. (see analysis above, on a price to sales where CRSR is currently trading at below 2 P/S compared to LOGI at above 5 P/S\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FLOAT!!!!!!!:** The main reason this should be WSB's next play is its tiny float. Of the total 91.92m shares outstanding only 17.79M represent the public float which was offered during their IPO. The remainder of the float is still locked up until February 22,2021.\n\nOf this 17.79m Float institutions own 14.47m (all purchased between October 19th to November 27th)\n\nSome key holders include -\n\nBlackRock: 2.16m shares\n\nJP Morgan : 1.96m shares\n\nMassachusetts financial : 1.55m shares\n\nCitadel advisors : 1.9m shares\n\nJPM small growth : 1.27m shares\n\nFMR: 1.06m shares\n\nThe remaining public float is sitting at **3.32 million shares for a 3 billion dollar company**.  This stock can be manipulated and pumped by our autistic forces easily. Which is one of the reasons why this stock ran to $50 bucks on minimal volume. (this was before institutions loaded up, will be even easier to pump a second time around)\n\nFloats previous pumps:\n\nNIO: 177 Million\n\nPLTR: 1060 Million\n\nHCAC: 30 Million\n\nCRSR: 3.3 Million (TO THE MOON)\n\n**Short interest:** 1.6 million shares are currently shorted (50% of the active float), these shorts will have to call at the first sign of another run up, sending this to the moon.\n\n**Bid/Ask spreads:** the daily spread on this stock is alone is anywhere from .7% to 1.2% which further proves how tight of a float we have here. Once we get our autists to slap the ask we will see this thing pump 15-20% days.\n\n**TLDR: CRSR is generating record revenue growth and undervalued to its peers (LOGI), has a strong balance sheet and to kick it off has a public traded float of 3.3m which will send this stock flying the moment we get behind it. Calls are relatively cheap due to recent sell off and volume drying up. Best case we send this back to ATH's where it should be, worst case you have money invested in a undervalued company that will crush earnings come early February.**", "id": "kbp0eu", "created_utc": 1607779291.0, "score": 608, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 283, "comments": [{"body": "I'm going to assume this is true and sticky it without doing any research because that's how we roll around here, buyers beware\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/6dbe4d050af44be3a6956a8b10b35d34.png", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Demand growth, and inflation. In stable countries, both of these result from population tending to increase over time. This is ultimately not sustainable, and given patterns in developed nations, population growth is unlikely to continue without massive replacement immigration (usually from poorer countries that may not share the host country's values or culture), and it's a question of how crowded and degraded an environment, society and lifestyle we allow ourselves before we say enough is enough. \n\nThis is why we to colonize offworld I suppose- corporate profits require it.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Indexing actually doesn't effect price discovery because there will always be active managers who sell their management skills to \"beat\" the market.
