I would be interested in buying some of the big names,, I just like to time my entries. My strategy so far has been to swing some trades to load profits into my etf's. In hindsight, I should have just thrown all the money in at once, but I chose to just drop some in each week. I have been thinking about some metals etf like GLD. I have also given some thought to putting something in UVXY to hedge against a large dip in the market. What else should I be looking at? Thought about jumping into AMZN today as well.\n\nJust looking for ideas....Thanks!", "id": "k49450", "created_utc": 1606781802.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "VTI", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Ignore everyone else trying to pump their investments.

Don’t see that many people with the ”boomer” view on this. I think it’s kinda weird considering that you’ll have a much better chance of succeding if you pick market leaders with good and stable growth, revenue, low debt etc. This made it sound really easy, but you get what I mean.\n\nLike, I get it why the companies like PLTR, NIO and SE get a lot more attention, since the biggest and the quickest growth and winnings come from the companies that are new and have a lot of potential, but it still bugs me out that people are doing ”investing” more and more from a trading stand point rather than the traditional buy and hold strategy. People are lacking patience.\n\nPeople can do whatever they want, but if we forward to 10 years in time, how many of us can actually provide solid returns with the constant buying and selling that can perform better than the S&P 500, so about 10% annually. It’s gonna be real hard with timing the market consistantly. Even picking the right growth stock can be really hard eben though Reddit and the amount of speculation does help a bit with it. There isn’t any guarentees that PLTR can be a blue chip company in 20 years. Sure, there isn’t anything sure about AAPL or MSFT either, but at least they’ve proven they can do it on a solid basis.\n\nDon’t want to be mean or anything, just wondering if it’s really worth trying to time the market if you can get steadier profits from the already existing market leaders. I do enjoy reading newsand staying informed, but IMO it’d be safer just to stick with the blue chips. The point of investing is gaining wealth steadily, not gambling with it, right? The biggest bonus with growth stocks is probably the possibility of getting huge profits in a short term which isn’t a reality with the blue chips. You can still get tons of profits with MSFT, JNJ or AAPL, it’s just that it won’t happen overnight. I think you should have a healthy mix of both market leaders and growth stocks.\n\nI don’t know what I’m trying to say with this.

{"title": "Nio stock gets upgrade at Goldman Sachs", "selftext": "‘In hindsight, we underestimated’ Nio, Goldman Sachs says\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts flipped their stance on Nio Inc., saying that in hindsight they underestimated the benefits that the Chinese electric-vehicle maker would get from breakthroughs such as its battery-swap idea.\n\nThe analysts, led by Fei Fang, upgraded Nio’s NIO stock to the equivalent of hold, from sell, saying in a note Tuesday that when they tacked on their sell rating in July they did so on valuation. They believed that “the share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations.”\n\nWhat’s changed? Mostly, Nio unveiled its battery-as-a-service program, expanding its market. Most households in China lack conditions to install private chargers, especially outside of main cities, Goldman said.\n\nThe analysts also upped their 12-month target price on Nio’s American depositary receipts to $59.00 from $7.70.\n\nNio launched its battery-as-a-service program in August; service users purchase a Nio car without the battery, “making it more price competitive against existing powertrains, while also providing the flexibility to change battery capacity depending on their needs,” the Goldman analysts said.\n\nExisting public charging stalls are often busy, but within “10 minutes, Nio car owners can swap their depleted battery with a fully charged one, which is much more time efficient than the fast charger stall that requires around 2.5 hours.”\n\n“In addition, (battery-as-a-service) also represents a systematic solution to the long-existing challenges for EV penetration, including battery degradation, battery upgradability, and lower resale value,” they said.\n\nNio’s ADRs have gained nearly 1,100% this year, compared with gains around 13% for the S&P 500 index. SPX The average rating on Nio of the 13 analysts polled by FactSet is the equivalent of buy, and the average price target on the ADRs is $42.18, representing an 11% downside from Tuesday’s prices.\n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nio-stock-gets-upgrade-at-goldman-sachs-11606844454)", "id": "k4rvp7", "created_utc": 1606850375.0, "score": 1129, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "I mean they changed it from $7.70 so I wouldn’t read too much into this, basically just updating their price which was clearly way behind the times.", "score": 391, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck these fucking banks and analysts, it's all just legalized pump and dumping because rich people rarely face the music", "score": 152, "replies": [{"body": "Reminds me of the movie Margin Call.

Retail traders provide much needed liquidity for institutions. When an institution needs to dump very large amounts of shares which would drive the price way down on themselves, they can manipulate some stock’s pricing in certain ways which causes it to go up on retail... so that entire time when the stock is ‘rocketing’ and everyone is raving about it on these subs and people are all jumping in with fomo, etc, guess whose shares are the retail traders buying on the way up? Those institutions. \n\nAnd same works the other way. If an institution is short a large amount of a stock and they risk triggering a short squeeze on themselves if they cover all those shares, magically some bad news about the stock comes out and retail runs to panic sell their shares, guess who is buying all those shares on the way down to cover their short positions? The institutions. And once the institutions are done with their play and step back, retail itself isn’t able to maintain price in that direction and it pops back to where it was and more... leaving a majority of retail traders scratching their heads thinking ‘but I always do everything right and yet every position always goes the opposite on me’. \n\n\nGranted this isn’t as easy to do with something like AAPL for example which holds a $2T market cap so even several million dollars are just a drop in the bucket, but it happens. This is exactly how ‘pump and dumps’ with penny stocks work also, except that those are often smaller ‘mom & pop’ style pumpers also and not necessarily large institutions, and due to their relatively smaller market caps and smaller float size, they are way easier to manipulate for the insiders & and others involved to get rid of their shares at their desired prices before they leave and the price dumps, leaving retail traders with bags of shares that literally just got dumped on them.\n\nThat all being said... retail traders also always cry ‘manipulation’ and ‘institution pump and dump’ on every single move on a stock that happens against them.

As you said, they are massive, and if they need to buy/sell, they can’t just decide to click the buy/sell button like we as retail traders do (unless they intend to drive the prices up/down on themselves). They need to ‘make’ a market for those transactions to be absorbed and trying to one-up retail is part of making that market. Institutions/funds are also trying to one-up each other as well, not just retail, but that’s a different game between the big guys. Wall Street is a dog eat dog business, that’s a well known fact and I don’t feel anyone should feel the need to sugarcoat it. The likes of Jesse Livermore from almost a century ago to other well-known traders between then and now have often spoken about this phenomenon in detail as well. \n\nThat being said, again, as I said at the end of my last comment, retail traders have a habit of crying ‘manipulation by institutions’ on every single move that happens against them, and I’m definitely not for those conspiracy theories. I just trade what I see and try to be on the right side of the order flow based on my analysis, while having a profit and loss target and managing my risk. That’s about all one can do and there’s no use in crying manipulation on every single move. \n\n>For example, did you know that a lot of funds are forced to stick to large cap companies because they have so much capital that a properly sized investment into a smaller company would result in 5% ownership and the need to publicly report their stake?\n\nYes.\n\n>But of course this post has a bunch of upvotes because this sub would rather believe borderline conspiracy theories that markets are rigged against them instead of read about the actual truth.\n\nWell, I welcome yours and anyone else’s downvote who doesn’t agree with what I’ve said :).

That means, the Rob Approved 115M shares float retraction doesnt hold and has to be replaced by a front runners float reduction value. Which can be higher than the 115M shares.

In a time of accelerating change due to advances in technology there will be other opportunities out there.

Also helps show how having multiple factories can in theory allow them to be a bit more flexible in how they can build things via being able to easier shift things around.

Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992388944774938626)\n\n-Elon Musk\n\nOh Elon, sorry to steal your thunder. But GME will make TSLA vol look like TLT. Jeff haunting your every accomplishment yet again.\n\n-----\n\nI’m back with the final warning bell. The next time I post in 2021 will be to recap the squeeze’s results and post gain porn along with u/Deep_Fucking_Value, u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT, u/Tomatotowers, and more. *This is the last stop before the moon mission.*\n\nIt’s currently not too late. But after Q3 earnings on Dec 8th, it will be. And of course, as always, not financial advice. Just for bragging rights and entertainment. Here goes:\n\nHere’s a comprehensive GME overview for all new and returning WSB-monkeys. Sit down and grab some tea. This is a long one unlike the previous posts.\n\n**GME Overview:**\n\nThe GME story can be broken up into 2 main theses. The first is a deep value play which has credibility all on its own. The second is an infinity short squeeze like we’ve never seen before in history, which has credibility all on its own. When combining the two, you get the trade of a lifetime. \n\nIn all my (albeit limited) days, I have never EVER seen a trade set up like this before. I’ve pored over every source of historical finance material I can get my hands on, and still have nothing to reference to. IMO, this will look more like the 2008-MBS bet, or the Ackman 2020-COVID “Hell is coming” bet, than TSLA, OSTK, KBIO, or VW.\n\nJust a fucking face-ripping, out-of-nowhere, legendary-HOF-ticker bet that will bankrupt some funds and get people fired - and of course, with no community other than WSB’s name next to it in the history books (and if I could pencil in our lovely GME discord and u/RoaringKitty’s YT stream).\n\nLet’s begin.\n\n**Act 1 - The Set Up:**\n\nQ: Why is GME so heavily shorted in the first place? Why are we betting the long? Aren’t they going bankrupt ala Blockbuster? If not, are we just trading this short term like a HTZ/CCL meme stonk?\n\nA: NO. This is a fundamentally solid deep value play at its core.\n\nFirst let’s go back a few years. We must give the shorts due credit in order to understand where we are now. GME has been profitably shorted since 2013 when the market correctly bet on the digitization of video games and spread of mobile gaming. Some data here:\n\n* GME sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.\n\n* GME Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.\n\n* Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.\n\n* In the two most recent quarters alone, GME lost another $277 million.\n\nThe shorts are betting on $0. \n\nHowever, in the last 12 months, GME has shown that their terminal velocity does not lead to bankruptcy. GME has a strong balance sheet. [Cash on hand is worth over $12 a share. Net cash is worth over $5 a share](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment) and is FCF positive (nixing the bankruptcy thesis). They also paid off $125M in debt last month just to show Moody’s they are healthy due to their incoming console cycle FCF (which may lead to possible bond upgrade, enticing more institutional investors).\n\nSo give the shorts credit. They had a legitimate case until the last 12 months, when George Sherman (CEO), Reggie Fils-Aime (ex-Nintendo, current GME board member), and others have been conducting a phenomenally well executed turnaround.\n\nThat explains why we currently have ~70M shares short out of ~65M shares outstanding - but they’re all now caught on the wrong side of the trade.\n\nIn case the severity of the short interest hasn’t hit you yet, **there is a bigger market for shorting GME than the business of GME itself.** This is not even taking into account the long holders ([Senvest, Ryan Cohen, Burry, Donald Foss, Sherman, Hestia/Permit](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) which takes ~25M shares out of circulation. So short interest in reality could be around 180%+ of true float. \n\nA true head-scratcher. \n\nAnd a worthy opponent.\n\nBut they’re wrong.\n\n**Act 2 - Avengers, Assemble:**\n\nQ: Why am I so sure GME is prime to blow? Isn’t this just another meme stonk hunch driven by WSB and Michael Burry hype? How can a few online gamblers and a few activist investors turn a dying business into a trade of a lifetime? \n\nCouldn’t the shorts be right? Also, hasn’t it blown already?\n\nA: NO AGAIN.\n\nLet me show you the ridiculous Avengers team we have. By Avengers team, I mean all the bullish cases:\n\n**1) Ryan Cohen**\n\nIron Man of the bunch, some call him the Dog-Man.\n\nThis guy is a crazy entrepreneur. He took on Bezos with a pet food company (CHWY) and won. Let me repeat - he beat Jeff Amazon without AWS subsidizing his loss leaders.\n\nIn other words, he built Markk I (CHWY) in a tiny cave with scraps all by himself with his dad, and now that he has billions, he wants to build nanotech Markk 50 (GME). Read up on this guy. He’s as crazy and as smart as they come.\n\nHe also wrote a scathing [letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) to GME leadership, but if you read between the lines, he’s not addressing the existing board, who had only been there temporarily. He’s setting this letter up in order to potentially offer a takeover bid (rumor mill - unconfirmed). \n\nEither way, GME leadership needs to address this letter in the Q3 earnings call on Dec 8th - which means they need to either post a good quarter, provide good guidance, or add color to existing developments.\n\nOtherwise George Sherman (Cpt America)’s ass is out the door and Cohen takes over as the leader of the Avengers through a vote or buyout. Either of which requires shares to be recalled.\n\nOne more thing to note about RC. There has been no 13D/A filling since his initial purchases. Which means he is STILL IN. He has not sold a single share. \n\n\n**2) GME Leadership and activist investors - Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Very Strange Burry, and the old Captain trying to fit in with the youngsters:**\n\n\nDr. Very Strange Burry - AKA Big Short Man. Supreme numbers aspie who might have a screw loose but is unmatched at spotting contrarian trades. *Edit 2: BTW for those asking about his holdings drop. He's trimming to stay under 5%, but still has a large position: \n\n- Q1: 3,000,000 shares worth $10,500,000\n\n- Q2: 2,750,000 shares worth $11,935,000\n\n- Q3: 1,703,400 shares worth $17,375,000\n\n\nHestia/Permit/Senvest - Contrarian, activist investors.\n\n\nCpt George Sherman - Boomer CEO who knows what he’s doing.\n\n\nReggie Fils-Aime - Beloved ex-Nintendo President.\n\n\n**3) Bond repurchase**\n\t\nGME just bought back [$125M](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18286/html) of debt maturing in 2021. Who cares? Yes - normally this is a nothing burger even for a micro-cap, but if the shorts are betting on $0 - this is clear evidence against that bet.\n\nSecondly, rumor mill has it that this debt repurchase plus positive Q3 earnings/guidance will allow Moody’s to upgrade their 2023 debt to A or maybe higher.\n\nThis is HUGE because it allows institutional investors to long GME without further restrictions. In other words, they may not be allowed to long companies with B- debt. Once this is upgraded, more buyers are allowed to come in.\n\nVery underplayed story here.\n\n\n**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here’s an excerpt from our resident astrologist u/JayAreW:**\n\n> Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80. \n\n> While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from – mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).\n\n> The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is $JMIA [(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run.\nCompare $JMIA with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily – figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (~$15.80). The difference between $JMIA and $GME is that $JMIA was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME’s cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it’s African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don’t be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on.\nThe other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG).  Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn’t just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day. \n\n> This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn’t going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade.\nSo to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial “line in the sand” for existing short positions.\n\nJeffAmazon here again: Note Jay and I don’t agree on a few major points, but are nevertheless both seeing bullish action to come very very soon.\n\n\n\n**5) Product Mix**\n\nGameStop is expanding their product mix to include monitors, PC parts, and [more](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/). GME is no longer a Disc-Drive only store (which is fine itself), but an all-things-tech e-commerce growth start up. Or you can at least bet that’s the narrative.\n\nGIVE ME THAT F-ING CHWY SALES MULTIPLE.\n\n**6) Three signs of a bubble: leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus.**\n\nThis is an inverse bubble - it will rise as quickly as other bubbles drop. KBIO and VW are often quoted as short squeeze examples. Those are wrong comparisons. The only similarity is the fact that shorts were involved.\n\nInstead, think of any other market bubble. It’s simply about leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus. We have all 3 in GME. Everyone thinks GME will go like BlockBuster to $0 and is using leverage to short (by definition and current SI).\n\nSo instead, think of Burry’s 2008 MBS trade, Ackman’s 2020 COVID trade, PTJ’s Black Monday Trade, or Chanos’ Enron trade. \n\nSame thing, different direction. Will go up as fast as the others went down.\n\nAnd oh boy do we lack liquidity. Crowded party, one exit.\n\n\n**7) Phenomenal numbers due to current console cycle.**\n\n$GME bull Rod Alzmann [(Uberkikz on Stocktwits)](https://stocktwits.com/Uberkikz11) has great breakdowns on Q4 EPS/order count due to console cycle. He tracks orders by order number among a slew of other information [here](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann).\n\nCheck out his models. In short, we expect over $5 EPS in Q4 base case. Which is bananas.\n\n\n**8) MSFT Partnership gross margin**\n\nGME is getting free money from Satya Nadella.\n\n[Conservative estimate $180M, 100% margin for 2 years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).\n\n\n**9) January and April option OI**\n\nOI in option calls for Jan and April are almost 4X that of Decembers. Is GME going to exercise the ITM calls for a squeeze? Why are they so insanely large? Who are these buyers? WTF are they doing?\n\nNo clue. But something is about to go down.\n\nNote put call skew isn’t that low, so no infinity gamma squeeze yet, but it will come as GME obtains meme status.\n\n\n**10) Most importantly, YOU.**\n\nCNBC and other misled, egoistic mass media companies and institutional investors continue, time and time again, to look down upon the new generation of traders and laugh at WSB.\n\nTell me, which one of them has read all of Moody’s credit reports on GME? Which one of them live streams collaborative GME DD 20+ hours a week for 6+ months straight? Which one of them tracks order flows by the f-ing second based on skimmed CC data? Who scours r/GameStop to see how leadership is treating their employees and customers at a testimonial level? Do they even know about the bond repurchase?\n\nThey don’t know jack s-.\n\n\n**Act 3 - The Trade**\n\nWhat more evidence do you want? Time for action.\n\nFirst, the PT. u/ronoron summed it up well:\n\n> A 3 billion market cap (not even 0.5x of their revenues) would already leave GME at $46/share.Going back to their 2013 peak at around 6 billion market cap would leave them at almost $100/share already, not the $56 peak/share. The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.\n\n> For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).”\n\nPT can easily be over $100. The JeffAmazon target is $420 which gives them about ~$25B market cap at a P/S ratio of 5, maybe 4 with console cycle revenue. That wouldn’t even be considered an euphoric price with today’s growth stocks. For comparison, NVDA is 22, TSLA is 20, and CHWY is 5.\n\nTiming:\nThis all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.\n\nHere’s my responsible trade (do whatever you want): All in calls and shares now. If IV and $GME is sky-high before earnings, sell half to secure profit. If GME misses and tanks, bet your bottom dollar a takeover bid will be announced shortly.\n\nIn all honesty, I'm going to probably hold everything through earnings WSB style.\n\nMy positions:\n1/15/21 $30Cs, shares\n\n(I would buy April $30Cs too, but I'm all tapped out of cash).\n\nShorts and longs both have their cases. All the cards are on the table. Which side are you on?\n\n-------\n\nIf I missed anything, comment and I will update above. I’m aiming to make this the final stop for all high-level GME DD.\n\n*Edit 1: Educate yourself right now on IV crush (in short, we expect a lot of vol now, so option prices are high. After earnings, expected vol normally decreases, so your option prices will normally drop).  GME is the king of IV crush after earnings. If you're playing FDs, prepare to get destroyed like always. Safer bets are LEAPs or FDs after earnings.\n\n*Edit 2: All these beat earnings recently: SNE, MSFT, BBY, BBBY, NTDOY, ATVI, TTWO, JWN, M, KSS", "id": "k4csaa", "created_utc": 1606793922.0, "score": 2637, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 914, "comments": [{"body": "Come children, sit, gather:\n\nThe whole market took a massive shit today, not just GME.

Pull out impairment to goodwill and you see continued degradation to operating profit - losses getting worse on an operating basis. Yeah we saw reductions to sg&a and others but not enough to keep up with declining sales. Huge cash position - cool!

Which also means store sales down over 40%... digging a little deeper we see hardware sales down 21%, while software sales down 31% GME looks to be more and more where you go to get hardware not software. All this said- management is making cuts, finding new strategy, and trying to run a good business. Sure thing to the moon- fuck no... can they get enough sales from new consoles to hold off their creditors long enough to continue to cut costs drastically to try and get a little profit from online- maybe?

Rumors on console sales and the hype around new consoles. Long term I still think this is negative trend. Only way Sony and Microsoft even partner with GME is because the distribution is less expensive for them that way- msft doesn’t want to deal with physical locations and mall leases- as physical location declines GME becomes less valuable to Sony/msft... actually the bigger the consoles hype the less valuable GME is to the Sony and the gaming ecosystem. if I were management or looking for positive trends I would be looking for anything exclusive that GME can compete on. Exclusive marketing/ sales deals on collectibles or other type things on the periphery of gaming that keeps the buyer connected. In earning report I would continue to talk to as large of population as possible- GME management should be looking for 1 million investors at $2,000 each I doubt they will even talk much to institutional. Robinhood investors are actually GME greatest hope for future in my opinion. Look for lots of hype in earnings over new console, and continued revenue degradation. If GME can hold on long enough, I see boredom from the shorts if the small investor stays engaged. For short squeeze you would need to see significant narrative change beyond anything currently being talked about. Call me when Elon starts offering free rides to Mars for a used PS4.

If you go long calls, you will be positive delta, positive vega, and negative theta. This means you will profit if IV goes up as well as price, but lose money as time goes on.

We can take advantage of that by using those two facts to *pay* for our delta exposure. \n\nYou get your positive delta exposure by purchasing an ITM call. This gives you high delta, low theta, lowish vega (i don't worry about gamma rn because as long as you set up diagonals correctly, you won't have true gamma risk). You then *short* a call against your long. This will give you a negative delta, negative vega, and positive theta.\n\nThis strategy works in low or high IV environments because in high IV environments, you will collect MORE premium from your shorts. More premium = cheaper cost basis on your long call.\n\nThis works in lowering IV environment because your shorts will decay much faster than your long.\n\nTheta decay is a lot faster for your short calls as expiry is so much closer.\n\nThis means theta and volatility decay will give you gains if GME doesn't move. This means you have more time to wait for GME to move up bigly.\n\nImagine you have a 5c and sell a 25c. If GME goes up to $24, you made premium AND the appreciation from delta exposure.

I know I entered a casino at Wendy’s but I’m crossing my fingers that my gains will allow me to buy one share of GME this coming week and from that moment, things might work out where my lil one and I can move into an apartment bigger than a shoebox studio.
