If you are careful, you will never get close to either one. They only apply at expiration anyway, and you should not hold option positions to expiration in the first place.\n\nBut here's a quick way to remember. \n\n* Debit means you paid to open the position, so that is your max loss, what you paid. Your max profit is the width of the strikes minus the debit you paid. Simple.\n\n* Credit means you received cash to open the position, so that's your max profit, the cash you received. Your max loss is the width of the strikes minus the credit received. \n\nNotice the similarity to the first recipe? You just have to remember the credit vs. debit part, flip the profit and loss bits accordingly, and then apply the same recipe.\n\n> Perhaps I should just focus on 2 of them?

Other competing vaccines in the pipeline have much cheaper logistical costs, in both the supply chain and product transport and storage, and requires 2 doses over the newer vax that only require 1, so PFE's vaccine is pretty much already obsolete out of the gate. By September, nobody is going to be using the PFE vaccine any longer. They got a boost from being first out of the gate, but that's not going to be sustained, unless they do something about the costs and storage requirements, or all of the dozen or so competitors in the pipe fail to get approved or have too many adverse reactions.\n\nBack to your question.\n\n> So a bullish credit spread but since PFE has a high dividend output, i tried to look at the short legs corrosponding call option and can see that it is currently trading at 2.64 $ at strike 44 exp july 16 2021.\n\nShort puts are not subject to early assignment for dividends, so this whole section is off track already. This is only an issue for short calls, because a call means you get shares. A put means you are *selling off shares* and would not receive the dividend, because you don't own them any longer.\n\n> has to be more that 1.52$ for this to not get early assigned correct?\n\nYour method is correct, but your yield calculation is wrong, though I can't understand why. 3.8% x $40 / 4 = $0.38. I don't know how you got $152!\n\nYou can often get a more accurate forecast by just looking at the dividend history. The quarterly dividend for PFE has been $0.38 for the last several quarters.

Ideally, you want to buy calls 3+ months out. Time decay (theta) is not a straight line, it's curved. You proportionally lose a lot more value in the final month of expiration than you do in the first two.

If you're selling milk, you want the milk that expires soonest in front of the row to sell it first. Same with options.

When you're buying milk, if you're like me, you're reaching to the back of the cooler to grab the jug with the longest expiration date. When you're buying options, same idea, you want that longer expiration so time decay hurts you less early and you give yourself more time for the trade to move in your favor.\n\nYour calls were cheap because you bought milk expiring tomorrow.\n\n2. The second thing I'd say is, I'd predetermine your acceptable loss before you even make the trade. You can look at it from a % of your overall account value.

An XYZ $98 call for March has a delta of 60 and a premium of $3.00.\n\nThe OTM scenario would then be restated as an XYZ $140 call for March with a delta of 15 and a premium of $0.15.\n\nIn the ITM scenario, your win rate is 4x the win rate of the OTM call (since the probability to expire ITM is roughly equal to delta), but your cost basis is 20x larger than the OTM call. On a delta/dollar basis, your ITM contract gets you 20 delta per dollar, while the OTM gets you 100 delta per dollar.\n\nA $1 gain on the ITM contract is a 33% ROI, while a $1 gain on the OTM contract is a 667% ROI. This is what gets people excited about OTM contracts, the huge leverage of the small upfront cost. The fact that the OTM contract has to work 4x harder to make that same $1 is often overlooked, not to mention the lower win rate, and thus higher frequency of losing money.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is pretty helpful.

Since it was paper money and I had nothing to lose, I just went on Market Chameleon, sorted by IV rank, and sold strangles on some symbols with an IV rank of literally 99% or 100%, without regard to liquidity or whether I knew anything about the company.  (So I know that because of the liquidity issue, many of these orders probably never would have been filled in the real market.)  Turns out some of these were acquisition companies, like TRNE and KCAC.\n\nA few days later, I noticed in ToS I didn't have an option to close my position.  When I would pull up the symbol, it would say \"Instrument KCAC has no options.\"  \n\nIn the case of KCAC, I had sold a 12.5p/35c strangle, expiring 12/18, on 11/25, for a premium of 1.95  I then immediately placed a GTC limit order to close at 50% of max profit.  If I look back at my account statement now, that order says \"expired,\" and there was a day order placed on 12/14 (which I did not manually place) to buy 100 shares of KCAC at a limit of 23.52 which is also expired.  Meanwhile, if I go to the TDA website to get a quote, it tells me \"The symbol you entered, **KCAC**, changed to **QS**.\"  My position statement shows no position on KCAC.\n\nIn the case of TRNE, on which I opened a short strangle expiring 1/15, my GTC order to close at 50% max profit is still \"working,\" but again, ToS tells me TRNE has no options, and the TDA website tells me TRNE has changed to DM.  My position statement shows that I still have an open short strangle position on TRNE, expiring 1/15.\n\nI know these acquisition companies probably aren't underlyings you'd want to be doing this on IRL anyway, but what happened here?  I can't find any news by searching on these symbols.  If you held positions like these IRL, how would you have known in advance that this was going to happen?

And would your strangles just expire worthless, leaving you with 100% of the premium?\n\nExcellent questions.\n\nFirst, let me observe that screening for IVR often catches equities that are in weird situations, like bankruptcies or rumored acquisitions. So it's not that surprising you stumbled upon two of them.\n\nSecond, options that go through some kind of corporate action get adjusted. You can find the details of the adjustment by googling \"theocc XYZ adjustment\", replacing XYZ with the corresponding ticker symbol.\n\nHere's what I get for KCAC:\n\nhttps://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=47903\n\nHere's what I get for TRNE:\n\nhttps://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=47975\n\nBoth are just a symbol change. Nothing else about the contracts changed. It sometimes takes a broker a few days to do the updates required to reflect the contract adjustments in your positions. Paper trading may take even longer, assuming it ever gets done and they don't just cancel the positions and pretend like they never happened.\n\nSo for this specific very low impact change, nothing would happen to the strangles IRL, other than a few days of inconvenience in not being able to trade the position until your broker catches up. Of course, what happens to the underlying stocks is another story. They could gyrate all over the place, since the market reacts to new information, sometimes violently.\n\nAs for how to keep informed about such changes, the best thing to do is set up a news alert or news feed for any symbol you trade. Then you'll see the announcement of any corporate action. Once you see the alert, you can start doing the google search above. It takes a few days for The OCC to formalize the corporate action into an adjustment, so you'll have to do the search daily until it published.\n\nFor further reading.\n\n* https://www.optionseducation.org/referencelibrary/faq/splits-mergers-spinoffs-bankruptcies\n\n* https://investorplace.com/2011/04/options-faq-splits-mergers-spinoffs-bankruptcies/", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, but they can't be just a symbol change, since QS and DM were stocks that existed before the change, can they?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Simply read the linked OCC Memos.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Still testing the waters with options trading and I want to know the best way to handle this trade.\n\nI was long GDRX on a diagonal spread 35C Jan 15 - 5.50 and sold 40C Dec 18 - 1.50.

{"title": "Made $16k in 24 hrs on PRPL last options expiration, or how to play max pain!", "selftext": "Yep.   I made $16k in 24 hours by playing against MMs move to max pain on the last options expiration.  \n\n\nProof:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2rmkpgtm2561.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4964298a012ca2bc8535d44a85909f6403bc2a1\n\nI sold 400 30p 11/20's for \\~$0.40 each for about $16,000 in profit on the day before expiration when the stock price was about $29.70.   Why did I take such a \"risky\" move?   Because PRPL religiously follows max pain when it isn't in the middle of its mid-quarter run up.\n\n# What is Max Pain?\n\nI'll spare you my own detailed explanation and let you google it yourself (or for the lazy, start [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp)).\n\nBasically, Market Makers' delta hedging actions, in the absence of an underlying or external force driving movement in the stock (aka news event), will force a stock to land at the max pain price on options expiration.\n\nNo, it isn't some sinister coordinated action against you.   It's just the math of the position and strategy that Market Makers take.\n\nAnd yes, this is a controversial topic in some circles, but so is Wall Street Bets.  Those circles are clearly stupid on both accounts.   We know what we are doing here.\n\n# Why don't all stocks follow this and how come everyone doesn't just play this?\n\nTwo words:  retard strength.  Never ever, ever, ever attempt to play this against a stock with a constant influx of retards buying up positions on the stock (looking at you Tesla!), aka retard strength.\n\nRetard strength and major news events present a gamma risk to the market makers and can cause movements in the underlying price of the stock that they are unable to \"manage\" to the same degree.  As the market makers are constantly trading their hedges, new buyers (or sellers as it may be) can provide price support outside of max pain targets.\n\n***THIS*** is exactly why PRPL is PERFECT for max pain plays.   Outside of its traditional late-quarter run up into ER, PRPL is about as boring as it was for your date your first time in bed.    There's very little short-lived action and nobody is talking about it much the next day.\n\n# PRPL and Max Pain\n\n[Historical Max Pain Data from Opricot](https://preview.redd.it/qey2gnwvp2561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=0609d0a040260fa5c1f22b7044647f39f7974108)\n\nLet's look at how well PRPL has tracked against max pain, EVEN for post-ER price action.   See, PRPL tends to get very excited on the run up to ER (it blows its load early), and disappoints when it is time to score (Joe Megibow, while a great CEO, is the anti-Elon-Musk in terms of ER excitement).   For max pain plays, this is perfect because there is no external price support outside of MM's driving to max pain.\n\nEven for the infamous Q2 ER that I called wrong, PRPL ended at max pain just days later.\n\nPRPL works really well for max pain because there is an inordinate amount of option activity compared to a relative small amount of stock volume.   It's the perfect scenario for a MM to maximize their strategy, but it makes PRPL price action ***PREDICTABLE.***   If you can predict the price and the timing, you can make money using options (and stock trades), ***ESPECIALLY*** because PRPL tends to have fairly wide swings between expiration dates (noted above).\n\nAll you simply need to do is make a play on an outside swing betting that it will return to max pain, and voila: tendies.\n\n# What are the risks?\n\nClearly, you are in the wrong sub if you just asked this question.   For the benefit of the outsiders who don't truly belong here:\n\n1. max pain is a moving target\n2. max pain can't be perfectly calculated\n3. news events can break the pattern (which is why this works on boring stonks with high option volume relative to stock volume)\n\n**Max Pain is a Moving Target**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ck0rcxoer2561.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7b6678cdd1cc09e0131252a19b0abfb4c1d7c42\n\nOur very own [Swaggy Stocks](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/PRPL) has one of the best max pain calculators I've seen ([this one](http://maximum-pain.com/options/PRPL) is ok too, especially if you don't want to pay for Opricot).   Towards the bottom of Swaggy's is a historical max pain chart which helps explain that max pain is a moving target.\n\nPeople are constantly buying and selling options.   The net of the open interests and strikes is the max pain price.   So, max pain can move on you after you've made your play (which is why I wait till closer to expiration).\n\n**Max Pain Can't Be Perfectly Calculated**\n\nWhile we know open interest and strikes, we don't necessarily know WHICH SIDE of the play the market makers took on each play.   This doesn't invalidate max pain theory, but it presents a risk that should be understood when making these plays.\n\nIf you assume that the market maker is always taking the short side of an options play, you will likely be generally correct (because who's theta gang, really?  Oh right, me.), and can rely on max pain as a guideline.\n\n**News Events Can Break the Pattern**\n\nAn inordinate amount of volume from a news event or retard strength can break max pain theory on a stock (see the PRPL expirations BEFORE ER that are the run up to ER).   I probably won't play January on PRPL, but I'm playing December.\n\n# Prediction and Positions\n\nMy prediction is that PRPL ends very close to max pain of $30 again on 12/18, which would represent a nice movement up from the close on Friday of $27.435.   Of course, you autists could all pile in and move the max pain target on me, but I thought I would take that risk and share this.   Assuming you guys don't bring retard strength in a bad way (move max pain and then deflate the price action activity at the end of the week, allowing a max pain ending at a different price), then we will see $30 by week's end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gc0yec3at2561.jpg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cd9b05b0f7797c4ec37da569b4c170cab2f7cc3\n\nI'm playing 100x each of 25c, 30c, and short 30p.   All 12/18's.\n\nThis isn't investment advice, nor a recommendation, but for you autists who can't put two and two together:   shares and ITM calls.\n\nIf you guys jack this up, then lesson learned from me, and I'll never remind you of this again.   You will all forget about it like the goldfish you are and I'll play it again after next earnings for some tendies.\n\n# Technical Astrology\n\nYou all know what I think about Technical Analysis.    Confirmation bias at best, and a cheap fortune cookie most likely.\n\nThe Technical Astrologers on Stocktwits are calling for similar price action to the 30's next week based upon magic charts:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrr7a86du2561.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=57f9a6cbef45634f68cef6cdbb7e8f23b7269c21\n\nI shamelessly swiped this from some guy's post calling for a double bottom, which means things are looking up.    I don't know about you, but a double bottom means a threesome to me, which means things are looking up.\n\nI put about as much weight into the above TA as this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85sylewmu2561.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb4395192ae24c5f4a1975bbc42aeb65af3444b\n\nThe above is still related to double bottoms and threesomes.   Clearly she didn't take into account her own game when making this stupid COVID rule.   For any man or woman brave enough to take that on, it counts as a threesome.   Legally.\n\nThe in-between skin on rolls is usually purple, so buy PRPL.\n\n# The Big Boys are Doing It\n\nBlackRock increased its holdings by 53.7% in PRPL during 3Q, according to their latest 13F, so they know own about $36.3M in PRPL.

{"title": "NIO will Moon - The best opportunity this year", "selftext": "Tl;dr - NIO is a generational investment opportunity. Buy the dip ya fools!!!   \nTake this DD from your neighborhood genius asian man and friend of WSB. \n\nChina's Domestic Issues:  \n\\-Car ownership is rising in the millions as the middle class income is rising along with its soaring population. So is China's air pollution problem--a huge issue and international embarrassment.   \n\\-China is the world's 4th largest oil producer, behind the United States. This is not enough oil for China's voracious demand, so they must import tons of barrels from OPEC nations. Of course, they don't want to rely on them. Who does? Will they go to war with them like the US has done in the past twenty years? NO! Because the Chinese want to rely on a more tech-driven solution. \n\nEV's. Nio is an answer to many of China's problems. With battery swap technology making battery charging more affordable and faster for the driver, Nio's EV ecosystem will net billions of dollars from China alone. EV's used to be for the rich. NIO will increasingly make cars affordable for the middle class. Also, imagine if GE or Toyota made money off \"fuel\" in addition to selling their cars. That's what NIO will do with their subscription-based charging stations. \n\nInternational Upside:  \n\\-Why do you think China accepted Tesla into their country and not other businesses like Amazon, Google, or Facebook? Well, they say there's no free lunch. China wants to sell their cars to the United States. China also wants to set up EV charging stations throughout the US as Tesla will do in China--this is the next gas station business. Imagine Standard Oil level income for NIO!!!   \n\\-If the US doesn't agree with Nio, then China will say, \"bye bye Tesla\".   \n\\-Europe is a lock. NIO has offices in UK and Germany. Like it or not, Europe is swayed by China's money in a way that the US is still not. \n\nComparables:  \n\\-If you wanna see how China will do in the future, look no further than Japan and South Korea. Very similar in every respect. Japan thrived after it transitioned from an agrarian economy to a manufacturing one, of cheap electronics and cars. Then it transitioned into making quality products, right after they hosted the summer Olympics, like Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, etc. It was made possible due to the Japanese people's industriousness, denial of self, national pride, and quite frankly, Asian smarts.   \n\\-Similar thing happened in South Korea--transitioned from making rice to making cheap manufacturing of electronics and cars. Like Japan, they're now in the process of making quality products--the surge also happening after around the time they hosted the Summer Olympics in '88. Think Samsung's phones. Think higher-end Sonatas, or LG flat screen TV's.   \n\\-China? China has been a manufacturing powerhouse since the 2000s. But millennial sand boomers should remember all the cheap \"Made in China\" jokes. This image is slowly fading as China now has Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent making new innovations in AI and commerce. This again, happened after what? The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  \n\\-So where the hell are the Chinese cars? Where is China's Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, or Kia? \n\nNIO!!!! Unlike Toyota, Hyundai, etc. China's manufacturers can scale to levels no other country in the world has ever done in the past.\n\nNio will outgrow Tesla even if it doesn't make it to the United States. But Trump is no longer in office, and I doubt Biden will be capable of doing anything meaningful to stop Nio's rise. \n\nCEO Upside:  \n\\-William Li has a perfect track record. He took a failing Auto-Review company, invested in it with his own money and became its CEO. Within years, he IPO'd it on the NYSE, making himself and fellow investors billions of dollars.   \n\\-Forget Jack Ma, William is often called the Steve Jobs of China. That Elon Musk Battery Day flop? It will never happen with NIO. William has an immense eye for detail. He's a showman with the most anal high standards. In 2018, he got one of the Nio cars to talk about Bruno Mars and then had Bruno Mars frickin' show up on live stream to give a talk.\n\nNio is a steal in the $40 range. For you impatient ones, there'll be a catalyst in Nio Day coming up on Jan 9. But if you can buy leaps or hold shares long term, this will surpass 100 bucks for sure.\n\nBuy Nio.", "id": "kd2i2c", "created_utc": 1607968296.0, "score": 193, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 194, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 191, "replies": [{"body": "Amen.

Smart money and savvy investors USE China to  make a profit until it's more profitable to not use them. There is no  emotion involved (emphasis on this - no emotion).\n\nEmotions and feelings are the guideposts for having laws, morals, and human rights in the first place. Purely un-emotional action and thinking will rationalize anything. Sure as traders we have to be rational to make money, but there are places I draw the line.\n\n>You're trying to imply there is some loss of integrity or morality for  personal gain by saying 'selling out' when there isn't - that is your  pride talking. Pride is an emotion.\n\nYes there is. Does investing in Juul not imply some compromise of morality? Oil, gas, and coal companies? Gambling casinos? What about selling fentanyl on the dark web? Even being on the side of a successful trades happens because there was usually a loser on the other end. Every trade we execute is also a trade of our integrity and our values, even if in a small way.\n\n>But I can understand where you're coming from if you have something  against China, which I don't. They have the greatest prowess in  manufacturing in the world, which the USA needs in order to keep costs  of goods low, and is a commendable country, with its negatives and  positives just like the USA. For example, my pride prevents me from  investing in weapons so I won't invest in Raytheon or Lockheed Martin.\n\nYou do you, but the fact people will choose to enrich a totalitarian, anti-democratic, anti-Western superpower which is actively engaging in multiple genocides, and somehow think this is morally preferable to investing in defense companies that can actually help hold the line against them, is pathetically short-sighted to me. Yes you have a point that individual traders can benefit, but we as a society collectively have made awful choices. Thirty years ago this country was high on its own \"end of history\" farts and chose to pursue cheap, off-shore labor over sound, strategic policy, and now here we are.\n\nAs a closing thought for you, consider that academics and corporations made the same arguments for continuing exchange with Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

We didn't \"decide\" to move manufacturing to China lol, we HAD to. Companies run on revenue growth and profits, so in order to have those numbers increase year over year, you need to reduce cost and increase demand. When competition is fierce, especially in a consumer driven market, you need to offer the best quality products at the lowest cost, if you don't, get ready to close or have your stocks plummet. \n\nWhen China opened up trade, it had the largest population with abundant resources, the CCP at the time was pretty open to working with rest of the world because their economy was shit and they wanted to pull ppl out of poverty. It was a win win for everyone.\n\nThe situation now is, most of the manufacturing goes through China, despite having way higher labour costs now compared to Vietnam, India, etc, companies still prefer to manufacture their products there. Why? Because they have the most advanced manufacturing infrastructure and pipeline in the world. If the US decided to make iPhones domestically, do you know how much money it would take? Do you know how long it would take before quality and output is even comparable to China? YEARS. \n\nSo when retards like you say we \"decided\" to move manufacturing there, it's so fucking idiotic it literally pains me, so I have to spend time to write all of this shit out just so you are slightly less retarded in the future. Economics and human behaviour says that moving production to China was inevitable, especially if you believe in Capitalism.\n\nInvesting in Nio isn't more morally fucked than investing in Apple, it isn't any more morally corrupt than investing in Amazon.

In fact, emotions lead to stupid decisions the vast majority of the time - I would argue that Hitler's hate or people's envy/jealousy/pride all have contributed to some really bad stuff.\n\nNo, investing in Juul, oil/gas, or gambling doesn't imply a lack of morality at all - it's your judgment of these things that makes YOU believe it's immoral and not everyone believes in the same things you do. Juul can be seen as an alternative way to smoke via vaping, rather than burning a cigarette. Oil/gas are hugely important for society and building all the things we love and enjoy in society.

You are selling the call short.  If it moves enough in your favor (underlying price goes down), you can buy out of it and keep partial premium. If the underlying moves up (against you), you can wait until expiration or assignment.  In this case you have to sell shares (100 per contract) at the strike price. This is not so bad since you already have significant profit built in.  You are taking some money off the table.\n\n2) If you want to accumulate more stock, you could wait until you have taken some cash from step (1) after being assigned.  Then you will have a cash position to buy more shares. You can use this to sell a cash secured put.  You are granting the right to sell at a strike price, while accepting the obligation to buy at that same price.  You will receive a premium for this.  You sell to open when the stock dips a little.  When the price of underlying goes higher, you can buy to close the option and retain partial premium.

Please, please do not go through with this play. There's YOLOing, there's outright gambling, then there's this. Make no mistake about it, you are burning money here, and not in an admirable way. I know your initial instinct is to try to be funny and just respond with \"No.\" But please hear me out before you do something stupid. This is a life-changing amount of money, even if it's not millions of dollars. You could buy one or two used cars and give them to families in need. You could pay in full for your cashier's first several years of college. You could travel the world and see something you've always wanted to experience in person. You could pay for every single meal you eat for the next six years.\n\nOr you can do whatever the fuck this bullshit is.\n\nRegardless of what you choose, you need to understand one thing. Assuming you see this through to expiry, there is absolutely no alternate universe in which this move comes out positive. Think about how you will feel two years from now if this play goes south and you aren't able to afford something you really want because. Think about how you will feel when you have to look your child/nephew/niece/friend's child in the eye and tell them that you would love to help with college or their first car, but you can't because you spent $15k on a bunch 56% OTM Tesla calls that didn't work out two years ago.\n\nNow if that isn't enough for you, let's think about this from a financial standpoint instead.\n\nIf TSLA hits $1000, Elon Musk will 81.8% as rich as *Jeff fucking Bezos*. To put that in perspective, this company has 38.3% of the market cap of Amazon despite having only 9.1% of the revenue. If we use this Market Cap/Quarterly Revenue metric to assess value (and assuming Amazon is completely fairly valued), Tesla is overvalued by exactly 420% (while funny, this is still an insanely high number). And again, that's assuming Amazon is fairly valued, which may not be the case.\n\nHowever, you are probably still not convinced, so let's talk about another metric used to assess value: Price/Earnings ratio. The highest P/E ratio in the S&P 500 right now is GE at a ratio of 362.3. The median is 24.4 and the average is 11.5. Other notable P/E ratios would include AAPL at 37.3, MSFT at 34.6, and AMZN at 92.5.\n\nRight now, TSLA is at a ratio of *1,162.6*.* One fucking thousand.* That is 47.6 times the median (and 101.1 times the average) of the S&P 500 (companies whose values are scrutinized enough that you can be pretty sure they are valued fairly).\n\nOne year ago today, TSLA stock was at $76.30. In the past year, this stock has gone up 738% ($639.83 ). In order to meet your strike (not even accounting for break-even), you will need 56% growth just hit that strike. In 25 days. And before you say \"What's 56% more, it's already up 738%,\" let me clarify something since it seems math may not be your strong suit despite you claiming to be a programmer. Your one-year growth target is not 794%. It's 1310% and you have to cover half that ground in 19 trading days. Again, this is not accounting for your break-even so it will need to be even higher. And this stock is already overvalued by every metric imaginable.\n\nI'm not saying Tesla never reaches $1000. But I am also saying with absolute certainty that it will not reach it in 25 days, and you will lose money in this trade if you see it through. [Here is the chart for the best-case scenario](https://i.imgur.com/WMFD7z9.png). The white cross is where you have to end up just to break even and the green line is what has to happen for you to get there. You have to go almost vertical, and that assumes absolutely no negative days.\n\nLet's pretend TSLA is a balloon. [This is what it looks like right now](http://members.tripod.com/the_common_loon/inf-over.JPG). What you're trying to do with this play is inflate it to twice this size without it popping. Pretend I offered you $125 if you could double the size of that balloon in 19 seconds, but you get nothing if it pops. If you choose not to play, I give you a $100 bill for simply walking away.\n\nWhich would you choose? Look long and hard at that balloon and then ask if you would play that same game for with [one and a half of these](https://previews.123rf.com/images/zentilia/zentilia1109/zentilia110900086/10654054-3d-rendering-of-a-stack-of-100-dollar-bills-.jpg). If you respond with \"no\" and tell me you still want to go through with it, that's fine. But four years from now when you are kicking yourself for being a dumbass, you completely forfeit the right to feel sorry for yourself. You could have stopped this.\n\nTL;DR You bought calls on arguably the most over-valued company on the planet (after that company already went up 738% over the past year), with a strike price 56% OTM and 25 DTE (only 19 being tradable). Instead, I suggest not having to think about paying for food for the next six years of your life. Or pretty much anything else besides evaporating $15k into thin air for absolutely no reason.\n\nEdit: TSLA closed at $880 on 1/08, $120 OTM.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "You done fucked up", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sell that on the next spike and switch over to barely otm calls.
