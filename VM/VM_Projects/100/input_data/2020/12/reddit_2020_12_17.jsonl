The infrastructure needed to support a fleet consisting entirely of EVs would cost Japan between ¬•14 trillion and ¬•37 trillion, the equivalent of $135 billion to $358 billion, he said.\n\n‚ÄúWhen politicians are out there saying, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get rid of all cars using gasoline,‚Äô do they understand this?‚Äù Mr. Toyoda said Thursday at a year-end news conference in his capacity as chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Local news reports in early December said the Japanese government was about to announce a ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars starting in 2035, while it would still allow hybrid gas-electric cars.

Officials at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said they haven‚Äôt made a decision on the future of gasoline cars.\n\nEV maker Tesla Inc. passed Toyota this year as the world‚Äôs most valuable auto maker by market capitalization.\n\nIn a country such as Japan that gets most of its electricity from burning coal and natural gas, EVs don‚Äôt help the environment, Mr. Toyoda said. ‚ÄúThe more EVs we build, the worse carbon dioxide gets,‚Äù he said.\n\nHe said he feared government regulations would make cars a ‚Äúflower on a high summit‚Äù‚Äîout of reach for the average person.\n\nWith models like the Prius, Toyota is a leader in hybrid cars, which combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor and can be refueled at traditional gas stations.

The only requirement is they are put in ahead of time (not sure if up to 4PM or 3:58PM) and they cannot be at a higher limit than the highest theoretical limit order that would be filled (e.g. if there is a limit order for $1,000 a share that would be the highest limit order to cover the MOC buys you can't put in a higher limit order then that will be filled. This prevents being able to manipulate the closing price after the MOC orders are locked... in other words the maximum price a MOC buy order can cost is known at 3:55PM).\n\nWhat will happen, probably between 3:50PM and 3:55PM (when imbalance info is released and the MOC book locks) is the current price will adjust to reflect the expected closing price. The reason is very simple. If the expected closing price is higher than the current price, then big players will buy as many shares as necessary and then post limit orders at a higher price (each new limit order will be lower than the one before bringing down the closing price), until the market price reaches an equilibrium with the expected closing price.\n\nWhat Market on Close does is allows a large chunk of stock to be bought at a single moment at a price that should better reflect the market price.\n\nLiquidity for the funds is not an issue as their computers will monitor the expected closing price up to 5 minutes before and will adjust as necessary their MOC sells of other stocks to match the liquidity needs.\n\nBasically, I don't think you need to concern yourself with MOC, the stock price will immediately factor that price in before closing.

All of you think the price will magically go up, cause no one is selling right now. This is biased opinion as most of the selling and buying will not happen until tomorrow. Ill explain how all this works.\n\nTomorrow at eod, the closing price will be used to set the weight and the price for the sp500 inclusion.  This is because most of the tracking funds will be trying to buy as close as possible to the eod of price to minimize variance (index tracking errors, which is their funds performance to the actual sp500 performance). So how will these funds accomplish this? Simple, its called an on close order. There are two types, market on close, and limit on close. These are almost identical to the market orders and limit orders. The only catch as per Nasdaq, Market on close orders must be received prior to 3:55pm, and Limit on close orders must be received before 3:58pm. Therefore, if the funds do not get the required # of shares they need to be filled by 4:00pm, this will cause a buying imbalance, essentially shooting up the price of the stock and dictating that the price will go up next week, as there is more demand than supply. **HOWEVER,** if there is more supply than demand, then tesla stocks price will decrease greatly, as everyone who has been holding, will be trying to get rid of as much of the shares as possible.\n\nWhat about dark pool acitivites?\n\nAll dark pool activity must be reported almost immediately (within 10secs of transaction) so if any sells or buys were happening, it would have been consolidated  and yahoo finance would most probably have reported it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: yes this has been said by Rob, but im posting this for the people out there who hasnt seen his video.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like you watched Tesla Dailly and reiterated his eli5.

Holy smokes... Once the MOC book is locked, the market will price that in right away.

Once they put in their MOC orders (which they will do with plenty of lead time as to put them in last minute would be insane and drive TSLA share price to the millions for a few lucky sellers), the NASDAQ imbalance report will show not enough sellers. As a result sellers will start putting through MOC limit orders in a competitive process until enough shares for sale are offered at a price people are willing to unload them (I am guessing it will be $800+ a share, but what do I know?).\n\nThe market price will then adjust right away to factor in the expected MOC price.

Will just mean as they get closer to closing they are adjusting their MOC orders on all their holdings to ensure their net sale and purchase (in dollars) equals. The more TSLA goes up the more the broader SP500 goes down. As TSLA is, I think, 1.6% (well might be higher by close tomorrow), it roughly should mean they sell 2% of their other holdings at MOC to buy TSLA. Assuming 25% of all funds (i.e. assuming these funds hold 25% of the SP500 stocks) are involved, this reflects a 1/2% of SP500 stocks being sold. Nothing that significant.

Also have a rental house w/ ~$360K in equity.\n\nI want to retire soon as I don't really love my job, will turn 42 in 2021. Need to have ~$120K / year to maintain current standard of living. My wife is self employed and earns $3-$5K / month w/ potential to grow.\n\nI'm thinking we could sell our rental house, take the equity there and invest it in a brokerage account and live off it + add'l investment income it would earn + my wife's earnings (she likes what she does) while we do a roth conversion ladder to set us up for 2026 and beyond. I might volunteer while I continue to hock weekly CC's.\n\nDo you think that's a feasible plan? I'm pretty sure I'm still going to work 1 more year just to build a bigger cushion and justify a triple motor cybertruck, but wanted to get your take since you've done a lot of thought along similar lines.\n\nThanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "A couple of suggestions. \n\n1. Wife may want to consider opening up a self-employed 401k. I think it‚Äôs called a Keogh account, I use Fidelity. It‚Äôs a pretax 401k account your wife can then use to sock away savings (she can go over $19.5k/year in such an account), but the best part is that it‚Äôs self directed so she can put money in TSLA there. Maybe too late for you since you‚Äôre nearly at your number, but something to consider if you haven‚Äôt thought about another account type to use. \n\n2. I think a lot depends on your risk tolerance and ability to flex to minimize spend if you need to have a ‚Äúlean year‚Äù. I personally would want more of a cushion if my goal is to maintain $120k/year. For me that either be 50% more than my goal (to absorb a potential 33% portfolio drop), or it would be retire to a part time job or other pursuit that I could rely upon for that extra cushion and peace of mind. \n\n3. I don‚Äôt know about your mix of money in which accounts. I believe from past comments you are like me and have perhaps too much in Roth accounts. I looked deeply into the whole SEPP payments thing to pull money out of my Roth; I really don‚Äôt want to do that (too much accounting, rigidity, and risk of fucking it up). I am going to stop backdoor Roth contributions. I also took a maximum CARES act withdrawal ($100k) from my Roth 401k, just to put it into TSLA in a taxable brokerage account. I may, next year, pull out all my cumulative Roth contributions to put it into a taxable brokerage, but I‚Äôll still be working so I‚Äôm still growing my taxable that way.\n\nOn my CARES act withdrawal, it makes sense for me but it may not make sense for you. First, it is currently invested in an index fund. Growing well but not TSLA (so the move grows my concentration in TSLA). Second, withdrawal from a Roth means I do not pay taxes on the portion that is contributions, only taxes on any earnings (no penalty because of CARES act). Taxes can be paid back over three years, but I can also pay back the $100,000 within 3 years if I want and not owe those taxes. If TSLA does what we think it will, it‚Äôs an easy, interest and tax-free loan of $100k to boost my taxable account. Or I can just eat the taxes; Roth is so big it doesn‚Äôt really matter to me that much.\n\n4. Does your rental house generate positive cash flow? If so, I‚Äôd keep it. Maybe consider taking equity out of your rental or current primary residence to then invest? The higher payments should be covered by your gains, and it‚Äôs more risk. Just some thoughts.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Awesome, really appreciate the in-depth reply. \n\n1. Thanks for the heads up on the Keogh account!\n\n2. Super high risk tolerance and I don't mind going back to work if need-be.\n\n3. You have a good memory - I had commented before that I was too heavy in my Roth IRAs, but that was before I fully understood how a roth conversion ladder can help. I'm at ~57% in a pretax traditional IRA and 43% in our Roths, so I now think I've got a pretty good blend there. SEPP payments really seem to suck. I suppose they have their place, but the lack of flexibility with those turned me off. Also I think you discovered that Roth SEPP payments are taxable, which totally sucks. Maybe a SEPP would be ok if you took them from a pretax IRA, but I don't like locking in anything for ~18 years.\n\nThe rental is slightly negative cash flow, and is in Austin which means it has a high capital / rent ratio. Plus property taxes are high. It's been a great investment overall (used to be my primary residence) and it's an ok rental, but I believe I would do better putting the equity into the stock market, and ridding myself of the potential headaches and liabilities. I've thought about opening up a HELOC and leaving it untapped to take advantage of a stock market dip, but am more excited by the prospect of just liquidating the whole thing and setting up a nice brokerage account.  I could buy shares w/ that and sell covered calls against those and roughly equal my rent income while enjoying even more TSLA upside. It definitely concentrates me even more into TSLA...but I'm ok w/ that. The only downside of selling it is that it would be subject to capital gains taxes but we can avoid those by reducing our taxable income below $80K in the year we sell.\n\nI'll look into how well a CARES act withdrawal would fit w/ my plans.\n\nThanks again for the detailed and thoughtful reply, it's super helpful!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You need to determine you monthly cost, your post tax funds that can be liquidated, your burn down on those funds, and you interest rate on those funds.

I would look at refi‚Äôg any mortgages your have and using that to pay off short term debt with higher payments, such as auto on a 5 year loan.  That only works if you have the equity and keep the property.\n\nOtherwise you can also pay penalties to withdraw from retirement accounts early as a backup.\n\nYou may also be able to find private investment companies/banks that would let you take asset based loans against your retirement account.

{"title": "I think TSLA S&P500 is the ultimate trade", "selftext": "Remember how $TSLA did a secondary on Dec 09 that brought the stock down from $650 to $585? And how the next day it went up almost 12% to $630? They're DESPERATE trying to bring the stock price down. Tesla knows that it will be hard to capture new talent if their stock trades at their 2025 earnings... that means no returns for those engineers if the stock goes down from here or trades sideways.\n\nBut see how hard it was to keep the stock under $600? Well there are a bunch of traders and fund managers that know that $600 is an important level of support and that keeping the stock down would lead to a chain selling reaction... they can't afford that. So they've been doing their best efforts to keep the stock below $650 and above $600.\n\n**There are three forces at play here:** momentum hedge fund managers that bought shares in November and have been selling this week to secure profits; Tesla which tried to hit the stock hard selling 5 BILLION dollars in shares in ONE DAY (who does that if you want to keep the stock up?); and WEALTHY TRADERS that don't wanna be bag holders and are waiting for FRIDAY to send this stock to the moon.\n\nAll traders until now have been bag holders and funds. These traders will try to push the stock on Friday as far up as they can, I can see it going to $700 premarket and get a 20% day after that. **THE REAL WAR BEGINS NOW.**\n\nI'm all in on this. It will be insane but we must fight like Spartans and I wanted to post this to give some perspective, because some of you might've felt discouraged by the couple last red days. But I think we can win this.\n\n!!!!\n\n**AROO**\n\n!!!!\n\nEDIT:\n\nMany champs saying that these funds have been buying up until now and will exchange the shares on addition date. First, there are trading funds that wanted to capitalize momentum but here we're talking the index tracking funds, these index funds don't wanna beat the index they must and want to imitate it, so they will try to add TSLA at as close of a price as possible to official closing price on Friday 12/18. Second, it is ILLEGAL as per SEC regulations to cross sell shares between funds even if the funds are own by the same company (E.g. Vanguard), SHARES MUST PASS THROUGH MARKET. That's why when Ark invest shows that they sold Tesla shares they show the shares sold per fund, or if one fund buys and the other sells they show in the trading report because the shares must pass through market, they can't simply move them from one fund to the other.
