[**Price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500**](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) \\- currently is 32.95, and it is higher than the average ratio of 15.85 which is apparently not a good sign. During the dot-com bubble it was 32.9. But we need to look at the other indicators.\n2. [**Shiller P/E Ratio**](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/table/by-year). This indicator addresses the market inflation and is considered more accurate. Currently it is at 30.27. This is a lot higher than the average P/E ratio over the last 100 years of 16.75. Average over the last 20 years is 25.6 which makes things seem more reasonable.\n3. **The Buffet Indicator** which is higher than what it was during the  **dot-com bubble** crash. \n4. **Returns you get in market vs other asset classes** \\- 3.03% is the average market return. The growth in these earnings requires adding the average US GDP growth which is between 2 and 3 %, so let's say 2.5%. Therefore, 2.5%+ 3.03% = **5.53**%. Meaning if we buy stocks now we can expect an average annualized return of 5.53%. Since the 1920s the average was 10%. What this means, apparently, is that because stocks are at very high prices their returns have gone dramatically lower. Compared to other asset classes such as bonds/banks are very low.\n\nWhat this points to is the market being overvalued. However, since banks and bonds have low interest rates, lower than inflation, you end up losing money, this is why investors are still investing in the stock market even though prices and indicators are showing they are very high.

There's no guarantee that this won't change and it could be for a number of completely unpredictable reasons. Nevertheless, my approach is to stay invested in American companies. Namely:\n\n* I own businesses (balance sheets) that could at least withstand a rise in interest rates (as well as inflation*) or even benefit from it\n* I own cash-generating assets so that if/when the market re-rates and falls (hopefully for a prolonged period), I can take advantage of that\n* I plan to keep investing a large % of my disposable income for years to come ie I have not yet purchased most of the stocks that I intend to eventually own (and therefore a market crash or a lull is desirable to me).\n\nWhat keeps me up at night:\n\n* Business risk in the stocks I own (have I misevaluated either the risk or the value of the business or both)\n* Opportunity cost (have I chosen those businesses poorly and missed great opportunities in other, better businesses)\n\n---\n\n**To the OP: inflation is generally _not_ good for stocks, it depends heavily on whether or not the business can raise prices without losing customers while not being negatively impacted by increased capex due to inflation.*", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It does, in fact, *change* the value of the underlying investment, because it changes the discount rate with which the company is objectively valued.

If you get assigned after selling a naked put your broker will buy the 100 shares on your behalf and you'll most likely be margin called to pay them back either by depositing enough cash to cover the cost of the shares or by liquidating some of the positions you already own.\n\nSelling a cash-secured put at a strike price \"you wouldn't mind buying the stock at\" is a very popular strategy but I don't think it makes sense most of the time. If the stock price continues to rise you'll only make a fraction (like 30% or less) of what you wouldve made if you'd just bought shares.

What has always confused me is why would you map out the area before if your AV is supposed to be able to successfully navigate an area given similar inputs that were already collected using a human-driven vehicle with lidar? Ultimately both the human-driven vehicle and AV share the same sensors used to collect data on the world around it, which just makes the human version seem redundant and pointless. The only answer I've been able to come up with on my own is that the AV are incapable of handling or processing the complexity or size of data taken in from the lidar + cameras. Therefore you use the human-driven lidar system to map out a rough \"sketch\" of the location to which the AV would compare its data to in order to cut out static objects(buildings, trees, edges of road) which would reduce complexity and load on the neural networks. Using this system the AV could then focus it's neural networks on dynamic objects(other cars, people, dogs, leaves) that it has to predict the future of.

But if somebody wants to try leveraged TSLA ETFs, I believe it would be very good idea for them to be aware of the risks, and I also believe it will take a lot more skill, calculation, nerves of steel, and good fortune to do well than just holding TSLA the stock. I believe the article you referenced supports my views on that.\n\nYour flair appears to say you have a large number of TSL2, \"Leverage Shares 2x Tesla ETC\". I couldn't find much about it on a search of Yahoo Finance - would you mind looking at the prospectus of TSL2 and see if it says something like \"intended for short term trading\" and risks of long term holding associated with volatility?\n\nThe Yahoo Finance article on TSL2 doesn't say much about the performance of the ETF over time, but I notice that the gain over the past 3 months (the longest period it listed) is +28.11%, not as good as  +40.8% for the unleveraged stock TSLA.

If you hold longer than a day, it may be less than 2x, or it may be greater than 2x.\n\nNot sure what data you are looking at, but if you just type the ticker symbols into Google, the last 3 months (since 17 September) is:\n\nTSLA: 47.08% gain  \nTSL2: 81.87% gain\n\nSo not quite 2x, but much better than underlying.

They add to the demand for shares, but they will also have been trying to locate shares to buy at closing cross. \n\nOr, u/conndor86 has a theory that for a benchmark fund that has an index counterpart, the benchmark can go overweight after announcement, and sell to the index fund at closing cross so that both are equal weight. \n\nFor 2, I personally think all the shares the funds need for closing cross are in hand, ie 50-75%.

Example:\n\nA) Let's say you have x dollars, and you need 2x dollars to reach your goals. You are already half way there, no point to risk the x that you have.\n\nB) Let's say you have y dollars, but you need 10y to reach your goals. Having y dollars doesn't really change anything for you. At this point maybe you want riskier plays - if you can't have 10y then you'd rather have nothing at all.\n\nIn my own example, I had z for a while, but I really needed 5z to reach my goal. I made some option plays and got lucky on some and unlucky on others. I still held most of my investment in stock. Now I have 10z. Getting to 100z will not change how I live my life, but going back to 4z will change a lot.

We can see this because ETFs report daily. Is there an example of any sp500 ETF holding any Tesla shares? I don't think any sp500 fund would have any Tesla shares on the books right now.\n\nWhat makes more sense is the company that owns the funds like SPY, IVV, and VOO to acquire the shares and sell them to all its sp500 funds on inclusion day.  Vanguard for example has $27Billion in Tesla shares as of 9/30; the VOO ETF isn't going to be buying shares on the open market but rather transferred from vanguard through an off market trade and the price recorded will be whatever the market close is.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "But those shares are sitting in other funds and who knows how many they can actually transfer between funds.

I doubt that many shares were accumulated by any big player for SP500 inclusion. As to backend transfers, while there may be some, I don't see how it can be nearly enough to meet the required demand (all those shares Vanguard and American Funds hold, are in existing funds and doubt they have many extra to unload). I think there has to be several tens of millions of shares bought on the open market over the next week. By the time this is over next week I would suspect we are up to 850-915 range (it may go way higher, but would not be surprised to see us reach those levels). Not even sure about any quick collapse as the amount of traded shares will decline. For many shareholders who want to hold the stock long, selling is not worthwhile until you get up a lot higher as taxes will result in you netting insufficient money to buy back the same number of shares.\n\nLook, the simple reality is that index funds don't care if they buy the shares at a premium. Their job is to track the SP500 not beat it. Why should they take risk (by buying shares) to sell them at a controlled price to the index fund, when there is no penalty for buying them at a higher price? If they are going to take the risk, they will want the price to go up to unload the shares at a nice profit. Whichever arm of their business owns the shares is going to want to profit as much as they can get away with.\n\nEven funds that benchmark against the SP500, all they likely care about is being able to say, look, we beat the SP500. If the Index funds buy on the open market prior to close Friday then any benchmark fund buying right before that is pretty much guaranteed to beat the SP500.\n\nMaybe I am wrong about all this, but I just don't see why the counter-parties here would go along with an attempt to get the shares to the Index funds at a lower price.

The new Rural Digital Opportunity Fund payouts come well below the hundreds of millions in annual cash CenturyLink enjoyed under past programs, endangering a stable revenue source. Filling the void with more winning bids: new players like cable operator Charter Communications and SpaceX. (andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com; @drewfitzgerald) \n\nMany saw this as a huge blow to revenues, but this was business that sharps believe LUMN did not want to win due to the low margins. \n\nPlus they have more lucrative contracts already locked up and we all know Elon has no problem running in the red to build a business. \n\nActually there were more bidders for ever for this business and the FCC had set aside $16B for this auction and only had to use $9.6B - it was a race to the bottom. \n\nThe average 10-day volume before the dip after hours was 10MM shares a day. \n\nThe next day over 16MM volume and the stock rebounded - it was a buying opportunity for the heavy hitters to add on the dip and they did. \n\nToday the overall market pulled back and LUMN was up again on higher than normal volume - 13MM. \n\nIt is being acquired by institutions, also the dividend is very attractive for these types of investors that hold 5-7 years. \n\nThe play on LUMN is 5G fiber and here is how:\n\nCenturyLink can thrive in a 5G world\nDespite this massive, long-term decline, it could see an upswing as analysts forecast an increase in profits. Why? Put simply, instead of destroying CenturyLink, 5G may have saved the company.\n\nAs it so happens, 5G networks remain heavily dependent on fiber. From an infrastructure perspective, the biggest difference between the previous 4G LTE standard and the current 5G is the number of cells needed. Instead of one cell every few miles, 5G requires numerous small cells located close to one another. \n\nAs a result, carriers have exponentially more cells, and they all need to connect to their networks. To do this, carriers such as AT&T (NYSE:T), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will need CenturyLink's fiber. Hence, instead of fiber becoming obsolete, it may become more important than ever to the telecom industry.\n\nWhich brings me to:\n\nAn old company with a new name\nWill Healy (Lumen Technologies): The fiber company long known as CenturyLink has become an afterthought as consumers increasingly embrace wireless. Moreover, some investors might assume that a wireless telco industry makes fiber networks obsolete.\n\nThey should think again.\n\nThe exponentially higher number of 5G antennas will depend in large measure on fiber networks for backhaul. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) will also rely heavily on fiber to enable edge computing.\n\n\nAdditionally, Lumen is also well positioned for a popular Democratic program -- rural broadband. Based in Monroe, Louisiana, Lumen has used its network to offer high-speed internet to some rural areas. This could help Joe Biden, who has pledged broadband for \"every American\" in an effort to reach rural voters. Biden also worked to expand broadband access when he was vice president.\n\nLumen stock has experienced a secular decline since 2007 as consumers dropped landlines and cable TV. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than eight does not seem so cheap given tepid earnings growth. Furthermore, missed deadlines on SEC filings and a falling dividend have also hurt the stock.\n\nHowever, even the reduced annual dividend of $1.00 per share still yields just over 9%. Also, with a free cash flow of $803 million exceeding the $291 million cost of its dividend in its most recent quarter, the payout should remain safe.\n\nRegardless of who wins the election, Lumen stock could benefit as the company repurposes its network to support 5G and IoT. Nonetheless, if a Biden administration subsidizes rural broadband, Lumen could receive an additional boost.\n\nIn summary, this is not Century Link anymore, it’s something much different and ready to be a 5G PLAYER.  \n\nI would have YOLO’d this one as well as I have 140 January 2022 $15c at an average of .50. \n\nI believe this has the legs and from what I laid out here think $30-40 could be realistic by Q4 2021. \n\nLots of value and the big boys know it and are acquiring it.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "And it’s from 23.30 down to 22.90!

{"title": "PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/15", "selftext": "So I did an update a week ago telling you why PLTR at 25 was likely the bottom. I also told you to get the hell out of the 12/11-12/18 options as those would expire worthless.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr\\_technical\\_analysis\\_from\\_a\\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)\n\nnow I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks. I am cutting down the number of words I am writing because it has come to my attention from comments in my previous posts that a lot of you guys can't read. So I am going to keep it even more basic.\n\nWe are now approaching where TSLA and NIO were after their first initial rally, correction and consolidation before the second leg rally which then forms the symmetrical triangle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzim1gl5ke561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e35a306b95241794ff00e6c69b14e6285bae886\n\nAgain, this was the same chart for Tesla for the first phase of the run-up and transition to the second run-up. The slight skew of the triangle doesn't matter, what matters is you see a narrowing of the band before the upward movement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obkgayjake561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c53d79f93f758ee43d8b46c61646088f1f7293\n\nNow we look at option pricing. Option deltas  are the most attractive that I have seen on PLTR for almost 1+ month now. These tell me that there are very few buyers of call options at this point and we are in a lull before periods of significant more option buying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v2btc0pyje561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e01729545a596866a3b062935bee7d25f6ebe41\n\nWe are about to start the explosive second run phase of Palantir and my target still mid to low 40s by end of the year/early next year.  Again, don't be surprised if we still dip down to around 23. But the downside is largely done. This is of course assuming we don't get a massive stock market crash for which I have small amounts of hedges on VIX calls that are rolling on a monthly basis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1orczd5xje561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef76cf4df7324f0779a1949f980dd78d29f2f150\n\nTLR: go long PLTR now, risk reward is quite favorable. 23 is the lowest it can probably go in the short term. You are already seeing doubters on PLTR on WSB. This means from a psychological stand-point, most would be sellers are already gone. The market is now open widely to incremental buyers. I bought some 12/24 calls at the 30 strike and added more to my 5/21 50 strike.\n\n**Update 12/16.
