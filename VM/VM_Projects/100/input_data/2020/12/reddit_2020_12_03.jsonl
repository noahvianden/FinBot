That‚Äôs just my opinion, but it seems likely.\n\nRoku helps bridge the gap for software and older technology. Personally, I would consider that a HUGE market in itself since not everyone gets new TV‚Äôs every couple of years. \n\nFinally, you can download third party apps on Roku devices that are either brand new or unsupported in their regular App Store for various reasons (such as adult content). \n\nThis is a big deal, because the apps are usually ones that aren‚Äôt available via a smart TV‚Äôs app selection, or even Roku‚Äôs APPROVED app selection. \n\nNOTE: It‚Äôs complicated, but basically, you have to determine the app code and search it manually, then install the app by logging into your Roku account.

I'm new to this and am trying to learn while I have my 1 month free of L2 data", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, sort of.  To be appointed as a market maker for a symbol, you are required to meet certain requirements or you get fined/kicked out of the MM program (it comes with lower fees, more rebates, etc.).\n\nFor instance as an option market maker on say, CBOE in TSLA, you need to be quoting for 70% of the total open seconds across all options in the front 9 months of the symbol with a maximum quote width of, say, 5 dollars and a minimum size of 10 lots.\n\n(I am mix and matching requirements from several exchanges here cause I don't know if any of this qualifies as protected IP with the exchanges or the MMs I have worked for).\n\nFurther, if you want to trade with a quote, you need to be the best price, and be there first.\n\nEquity market makers have similar rules.  While Citadel is the largest equity market maker, there are others.  Having a quote at 620 (more than 20 away from the current price) would almost certainly be outside of the requirements for a valid, qualifying quote in almost all circumstances.  The spread on TSLA shares is currently 587.41 <-> 587.68  With a 27 cent spread, the requirement is probably something like 1.00 or 2.00 wide AT MOST to qualify.  MAAAAAYBE 5.00 wide would qualify, but in reality, a market maker does not trade if they aren't the best, so they are usually at the tightest spread they can feel safely able to manage risk and make a profit after fees.\n\nMost importantly, market makers always have both buy and sell orders, they do not pick directions (in the options market).  The equity market is a little different, in many ways they use options to hedge the stock rather than stock to hedge the options.\n\nGenerally speaking, it's quite hard to predict the day to day movement of any stock (obviously), so to be a market maker, and to trade as much volume as they do (literally hundreds of thousands of options per day, and millions of shares per day both bought and sold), a large price move can destroy you.  Market makers are always protecting from moves in the price and making their \"bets\" and determining their profit based on more complex reasoning like volatility, theta, ro, complex combinations of options that give guaranteed profits, and most importantly of all, flattening the levels and areas where they have types of risk.\n\nThink of it this way.  You are long or short every option from 200 strike to 1000 strike in the first 9 months of tesla expiries.  Which way do you want the stock to go?  And when?  Almost impossible to say.  \n\nSo the focus is \"if the stock drops I have a large level of risk in the 580 strike area currently, if I can find any profitable trade that will decrease my Vega risk in TSLA 580s, I will make it, assuming I can get .02c/contract of profit.  Now, to increase my rick, instead of my normal .05c of profit, I will require .15c so that increasing my risk is less likely than decreasing it\"\n\nTHAT is how market makers trade.  The ONLY time they care what options end up in or out of the money is if they had some rick metrics run away from them and it's close to expiry.  Often they will make losing options trades that morning to remove the risk.  Pushing the stock around is not as doable as people think.  Sure, your firm might have the money to do it, but every time you try you increase a different risk, run into a risk limit, and a compliance officer turns off your trading app, calls you and tells you to fix your damn risks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is great.

We create a cohort that is composed exclusively of incompetent managers. We will define an incompetent manager as someone who has a negative expected return, the equivalent of the odds being stacked against him. We instruct the Monte Carlo generator now to draw from an urn. The urn has 100 balls, 45 black and 55 red. By drawing with replacement, the ratio of red to black balls will remain the same. If we draw a black ball, the manager will earn $10,000. If we draw a red ball, he will lose $10,000. The manager is thus expected to earn $10,000 with 45% probability, and lose $10,000 with 55%. On average, the manager will lose $1,000 each round‚Äîbut only on average. At the end of the first year, we still expect to have 4,500 managers turning a profit (45% of them), the second, 45% of that number, 2,025. The third, 911; the fourth, 410; the fifth, 184. Let us give the surviving managers names and dress them in business suits. True, they represent less than 2% of the original cohort. But they will get attention. Nobody will mention the other 98%.What can we conclude? ***The first counterintuitive point is that a population entirely composed of bad managers will produce a small amount of great track records.*** As a matter of fact, assuming the manager shows up unsolicited at your door, it will be practically impossible to figure out whether he is good or bad. The results would not markedly change even if the population were composed entirely of managers who are expected in the long run to lose money. Why? Because owing to volatility, some of them will make money. We can see here that volatility actually helps bad investment decisions. ***The second counterintuitive point is that the expectation of the maximum of track records, with which we are concerned, depends more on the size of the initial sample than on the individual odds per manager.*** In other words, the number of managers with great track records in a given market depends far more on the number of people who started in the investment business (in place of going to dental school), rather than on their ability to produce profits. It also depends on the volatility. Why do I use the notion of expectation of the maximum? Because I am not concerned at all with the average track record.

A lot of OEMs already have battery supplies planned and negotiated.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The total supply from the suppliers is not sufficient for even a single one of their plans on the stated timeframes.  VWs is 10M cars by 2025 right?\n\nIt doesn't matter that they have all inked supply agreements for X Dollars worth of batteries.  The issue is the amount of batteries available at all compared to the nameplate capacities of those supply agreements means that their plans are guaranteed to be delayed, unless one OEM gobbles up all the supply pushing others deals into the future.\n\nFrom your article:\n\"W√∂llenstein said that by 2025, the Volkswagen Group's battery capacity needs in China will reach 150 GWh\"\n\nSo VW needs 150GWh from CATL in 2025 (just for China!).  CATL current capacity is LOWER than 150GWh (its 40GWh).  So what are their plans?  \n\n\"By 2028, it is estimated that battery manufacturer CATL will produce lithium-ion batteries with a cumulative capacity of 307 GWh\"\n\nSo, VW needs half of CATL's planned 2028 capacity, and they need it in 2025.  Meanwhile, CATL also has supply agreements with Tesla, Audi, Daimler.\n\nSo where is CATL right now, capacity wise?  Best info I can find is from 2019:  \"CATL shipped 32.5 gigawatt-hours equivalents of automotive lithium-ion batteries in 2019\"\n\nIn any scenario, the OEMs will badly miss targets due to supply constraints which will mean they are physical incapable of taking much if any market share overall from Tesla, due to Tesla having significantly higher supply than their peers.\n\nThe best data I can find for total capacity across all Chinese suppliers in 2020 is \"Within Asia Pacific, China dominates the pipeline capacity and is expected to double its capacity from 345 gigawatt-hour (GWh) in 2020 to more than 800 GWh by 2030\" but it doesn't have any documentation attached, so I'm not sure of the accuracy of the 345 GWh number, and the article states this is the pipeline capacity, so some or much of this is not active but \"planned\" production with unlisted end dates.\n\nA chart here:\nhttps://energycentral.com/c/ec/world-battery-production\nshows that at December 2019, the cumulative total battery supply for automotive and other products, only 140GWh of supply existed in total with LOG/CATL/BYD/Panasonic.  I could not fund numbers for Samsung, but LG at 50GWh is being called the leader, so its less than 50.\n\nSo anyway you slice it, If you pick 2 major OEMs and add their planned volumes together, the total planned battery capacity of global EV battery producers is LOWER than that number.  Add in Tesla, and the other OEMs which ALSO have high targets by 2025 and the nameplate capacity is off by a significant amount until about 2028 when the suppliers catch up some and their new production comes online.  This is ignoring the fact that there are several GWh scale stationary storage projects planned for the same timeframe that will steal some of this capacity.\n\nTesla is guaranteed to maintain their current market share numbers for the forseeable future (3-4 years) just because of battery supply constraints.  This appears to not be the case anymore somewhere between 2024 and 2028.  This ALSO requires the OEMs to hit their production plans and targets, which they have failed to do over the last 10 years.\n\nSo in conclusion.  Not enough supply, and for Tesla to lose share multiple OEMs need perfect execution while changing their core business and dealing with supply constraints.  You won't see Tesla drop below 15% and probably not below 20% global EV share.\n\nThe X factor that COULD hurt is Small Chinese companies using extremely inferior battery tech in small vehicles with different supply chain, but only if those cars make enough of a dent in the total numbers.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not even going to bother reading this wall of text and I'm going to ask you a honest question:\n\nDo you realistically think the company that has supply agreements with Mercedes, Huawei, Honda, Tesla, Volkswagen, Daimler, Toyota, and Volvo is going have a difficult time sourcing capital to expand production to meet those supply agreements?\n\nThis is the difference between my understanding of the manufacturing industry and sourcing capital, and you getting all your information through a biased channel. \n\nIn my business (manufacturing), we take the supply agreement, figure out what equipment we need to meet the supply, and then we hit up a handful of lenders to see which one has the best offer.

{"title": "Options Explained - The Intermediates", "selftext": "Alright Neanderthals, (if you understand CCs, CSPs, The Wheel, Debit Spreads, move along)\n\nI'm back with a second post explaining option things.  I was overwhelmed by the positive feedback from the first post, which can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2a2j8/options_explained_a_quick_beginners_guide/).  Before proceeding, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the following topics (if you can answer these questions you're set):\n\n* What is a call/put?\n* What is the difference between Selling to Open and Buying to Open? Which has more inherent risk and why?\n* What are At the Money/In the Money/Out of the Money for both calls and puts?\n* What is intrinsic value?\n* What is extrinsic value?\n\nIf you can't answer any of these please read the first post or simply Google/YouTube the things you do not understand.  If you are really struggling with any of them and you've tried these resources please don't hesitate to message me or ask your question in the comments of the first post.\n\nIn this post, we are going to cover:\n\n* Credit vs. Debit\n* Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls\n* Cost Basis\n* Selling Cash Secured Puts\n* Debit Spreads\n\nGrab your phone, open up your brokerage, and follow along.  I encourage the consumption of bourbon on the rocks and the listening of Mac Miller during the reading of this post.\n\n***Credit vs. Debit***\n\n* Credit - any money that a trader **collects** as a result of selling an option.  For selling calls/puts, if the seller places an Ask and the order gets filled, they will be credited with the money, meaning that it will immediately be placed into your account.\n* Debit - any money that a trader **pays** as a result of buying an option.  For buying calls/puts, if the buyer places a Bid and the order gets filled, they ill pay the money for that option, and now they own that option.\n\n***Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls***\n\nCovered calls are an option strategy where the trader uses 100 shares of the underlying as collateral to sell calls.  The sold calls should be out of the money and always needs to be above the cost basis of the owned stock to avoid loss.  This is a safer strategy than selling naked calls (selling a call when you do NOT own 100 shares of the underlying) because if the price of the stock breaks through the strike price and the buyer exercises you will not realize an immediate loss by buying shares above the strike and selling them for the strike.  Lots of words, lets take a look.  I, again, am going to use $MSFT as an example.  This is only an example, any sentiment towards this stock expressed is solely hypothetical.\n\nWe're neutral to bearish on $MSFT and don't think there will be any significant price spikes in the underlying.  We'll look at selling naked calls first.  Below is the 12/31 options chain for $MSFT Calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ogjfcs7iw261.jpg?width=885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b2cc8b36f737034b0f1945b8b5f46d4e72bc8b2\n\nWe think $MSFT is going to trade sideways or decrease in value, so we are going to sell the 12/31 $220.0C.  You put in an ask for $4.05 and it is filled, so that $4.05 is technically immediately credited into your account.  Robinhood will not immediately show this in your account because it is an open contract but as the option price changes those changes will be reflected on your daily P/L chart.\n\n* Best case scenario for you: $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, resulting in the option decreasing in value.  At any point when the option is under the price you paid for it you could Buy to Close the call and that would be your realized profit.  For example, on 12/15 $MSFT is trading at $200.0, the call is now worth $2.05, so you could buy to close your contract and your gain would be $4.05 - $2.05 = $2.00, or $200.\n* Worst case scenario: You go to sleep in the evening, smiling because you think you made an easy $4.05, you've figured out how to beat the market.  BUT $MSFT announces that it has been contracted by NASA to put computers on the Moon.  $MSFT rockets up to $300.  The person that bought your calls decides to exercise, this means that you would have to BUY 100 shares of $MSFT at the current market price and sell them at the strike price, or $220.0. Your max loss would be \\[($300 - $220) x 100\\] - $405 = $7,595.0.  If the price went higher or you had more than 1 open contract you could see how this is insane risk.  THIS IS WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT SELLING NAKED CALLS.\n\nCovered Calls - Now lets say we have 100 shares of $MSFT that we bought during a dip at $205.0.  We are bullish on the stock and are holding long but don't think that it will go to $220.0 from $214.0 so we sell the same call.  Again, the money is *credited* to the account.\n\n* Best case scenario the stock finishes just below the strike on the expiration date and you can sell another call further out for more premium.  If the stock is at $219.0 on the day of expiration, you can just sell a $230.0 call further out and collect more premium.  You can continue this until you are assigned the stock.\n* Worst case? The underlying goes through the strike to $225.  Your total gains for the trade would be \\[($220.0 - $205.) x100\\] + $405 = $1,905.0.  Now, if you hadn't sold the call you would have realized more gains if you sold the 100 shares at $225, but only by $95.  ***THE IMPORTANT PART IS THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE 100 SHARES AS COLLATERAL YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THEM AT THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE.***\n\n***Cost Basis***\n\n* Cost basis is the price you paid for a stock minus any credit you have received for selling covered calls, receiving dividends, etc.  This is done at the single stock level.\n* Example:\n   * We buy 100 shares of $WSB at $100.0 per share\n   * We Sell to Open an OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00.\n   * Our 50% profit trigger is hit, and we Buy to Close the contract at $.50.\n   * Our new cost basis is ($100.0 - $.50 = $99.5)\n   * We Sell to Open another OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00, but this time we let it expire worthless.  Our new cost basis is ($99.5 - $1.0 = $98.5).\n\nCost Basis is important when selling covered calls because you should not sell covered calls for a strike price that is less than your cost basis.\n\n* Example: Our cost basis on $WSB after a few CCs is now $90.0 and is trading at $110.0\n* $WSB takes a little nose dive with the market and falls to $80.0.  If we sell an $85.0 CC for $1.00, we reduce our Cost Basis to $89.0, but if we are assigned, we realize a total loss of $400.0 if the stock finishes anywhere above the strike price and is exercised.\n\n***Selling Cash Secured Puts***\n\nThe risk associated with selling naked puts is the same as selling naked calls, but reverse.  If you sell a put, the stock tanks, you are now obligated to buy from the owner of the option the stock on the higher price than market.  For example, you sell a $20 put, the stock falls to $10 and the owner decides to exercise the option, you are now OBLIGATED to buy 100 shares at $20.0, when they are selling on the open market for $10. Your loss would therefore be \\[(20.0-10.0) \\* 100\\] - credited premium = Max Loss.\n\nSelling a cash secured put is selling a put with an adequate amount of cash available to buy the shares if the underlying does drop below the strike and the option is exercised.\n\nSuppose we are neutral to bullish on $MSFT so want to collect premium by selling a put.  Look at the option chain for 12/31 $MSFT below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uk00p9qj3w261.jpg?width=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e785e8ae40260339e52dc44034187fbc63551e9\n\nWe can sell the $MSFT 12/31 $205.0P and be credited $2.41, or $241.0.  There are a few things that can happen.  When you do this, you will need $20,500 to be a cash secured put. (Strike Price \\* 100 = Necessary Collateral)\n\n* The price of the underlying goes up, and the seller of the option (us) can *Buy to Close* the contract.  We have no further obligation to sell any shares at the strike price and the money that was held for collateral is released.  The profit of the contract is simply the difference in the premium when we Sold to Open and the now lower premium when we Buy to Close.\n* The price of the underlying trades sideways.  This will result in theta decay of the option and we can Buy to Close once we hit our desired exit price or % gain.\n* The price of the underlying drops below the strike price.  If this happens you can:\n   * Buy to Close at a loss to release your collateral.  This might be a significant loss\n   * Be assigned the stock.  By doing so you have now aggressively entered $MSFT at a lower price than it was on the day you sold the OTM Put.  As soon as you get assigned the shares, guess what we can do?  Sell to Open a Covered Call\n\nSome quick notes on the CSP, you should only sell CSPs on stocks you are comfortable with being assigned and ones that you are bullish on.\n\nSelling CSPs and CCs are the fundamentals of doing a strategy called the wheel, but not a strategy I am going to get into with this post.\n\n***Debit Spreads***\n\nDebit spreads are a way to bet on the directional movement of a stock while reducing both your maximum loss and your potential profit.\n\n*Call Debit Spreads*\n\nThis is done by Buying to Open a call while Selling to Open a call with a higher strike price.  This allows us to use the credit received from Selling to Open (-1) contract to help lower the cost of the option we Buy to Open (+1).  Look at the $MSFT 12/31 options chain below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k20t4uy48w261.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cde6714f5d20c7a86651e713b226fbfe4f0b624f\n\nWe want to Buy to Open the $MSFT 12/31 $220.0 call, which would cost us $4.15 if we do not use a debit spread.  BUT if we simultaneously Sell to Open the $225.0C for $2.56, we can lower the DEBIT we would need to open this trade.\n\n1. This lowers the debit we need to pay for our trade from $4.15 to ($4.15 - $2.56 = **$1.59**)\n2. This limits our max profit we can receive from the trade to the difference in the strike prices, so \\[($225.0 - $220.0) \\* 100\\] - $159 = $341.\n\nCheck out this example put into Robinhood desktop below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl46ylb3bw261.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f49eba1d7ceaf4ad64aebe85fd765aad426ac3cc\n\nNotice my absolutely God Awful drawings.  We need to confirm that we have selected the right strike prices on the right expiration, and that we are DEFINITELY Buying to Open the lower strike and Selling to Open the further OTM higher strike. Robinhood helps us autists by putting a \"Call Debit Spread\" by our order.  If it says anything but this, you fucked up.  Notice circle 2, where we can see the strikes of the Calls we have chosen to Buy/Sell.  Below is what it looks like in mobile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3y4e47tlew261.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c87ee245fac4ac48067bb8ea8c7b4d10612218a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iltws7tlew261.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=54325eb21995aeb479c90f4f759d92fc56082155\n\nBelow is a P/L chart I created with [optioncreator.com](https://optioncreator.com).  This chart is only applicable on the day of expiration and will change depending on DTE and volatility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivge56pwew261.jpg?width=1407&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44946041b92c31004c74fb4807d95cb7f1e2bb0e\n\nNotice how our max loss is realized until the stock price passes through our long call, increases, then it flattens out and is capped regardless of the price of the underlying at our max profit at stock prices $225.0 and beyond.\n\n*Put Debit Spreads*\n\nThe process is exactly the same but inverted.  You are Buying to Open a put and Selling to Open a put with a lower strike price, but the principles are all the same.  If you don't understand this, let me know and I can type out a full example like the one above.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nI hope that this in addition to the first one have been helpful.  I think these strategies will give everyone on this sub an advantage over the house we are trying to beat.  Again, best of luck.  Trade well.  Trade with passion.  YOLO but YOLO smart.\n\nPanda.\n\nP.S.  Due to the positive response from last one I will continue to create these until told to royally fuck off.

How many PLTR shareholders wish they sold say Dec 28c last week for 5?\n\n2. People like to say that you can only lose the premium when selling covered calls - but this is only 95% true. If you sell a covered call on a dividend paying stock and get called out, you have to pay the dividend too.\n\n3. Related to #2: don‚Äôt assume that the counter party has to wait until expiration date to get your shares. They usually wait, but they can do it anytime they want, and ex-dividend date is a popular time to do it.\n\n4. Many people think that your initial position is your final position with options. This is absolutely not true. Let‚Äôs say you have AAPL and don‚Äôt want to sell it, but you sell an OTM covered call. Then AAPL goes up more than expected, and that covered call is now ITM and you are showing a loss (on paper). You could reach in your wallet and buy to close, but you can use options to pay this loss. Say the covered call goes $2 ITM. You can pull up the options chain and find a future dated call to sell at a higher strike price that covers closing the older position. You might even be able to collect more premium to boot.

One thing that‚Äôs important for aspiring traders to know about CCs is that‚Äôs not really the worst case scenario. At least you shouldn‚Äôt look at it that way. Technically, the worst case scenario is the underlying goes to zero. You still own the underlying stock. If the underlying price drops more than the cost basis (stock purchase price minus call premium(s)), you‚Äôre losing money. So for any covered call, worst case scenario is however much the underlying drops in price. I imagine eventually you‚Äôll talk about the Greeks, where it becomes clearer that your position‚Äôs risk is tied to‚Äîamong other things‚Äîthe underlying stock price. I‚Äôm that sense, a covered call isn‚Äôt materially different than any other strategy with a similar risk profile. I only mention this bc from a number of other well meaning comments here, covered calls do not help or save you in any way when the stock price starts to tank. Before and during the financial crisis, I sold a shit load of covered calls on stocks like Washington Mutual and Wachovia. At first, it wasn‚Äôt a big deal when stock prices started to drop. I just kept selling calls.

The purchasing of 40% of TSLA's float will undoubtedly result in crazier volatility because it exacerbates the balance of supply and demand as ETFs buy up million and millions of shares making it easier for idiots like us to move the price on trivial PR. The reason TSLA is in the SP500 is because at current fair (not current) valuations, they would still qualify, and that doesn't mean they deserve or are validated in their current valuation. The sp500 is not an ETF, its a collection of the 500+ largest American companies that turn a profit for at least a year - this has nothing to do with anyone believing in them, rather they met the criteria for inclusions and thus are in. Thinking this signifies anything other than what it is, TSLA being one of the 500 largest profitable public companies, doesn't change anything except TSLA's volatility will not be added to a bunch of ETFs. \n\nThe only way to stabilize TSLA is to grow their business to meet it's valuations.
