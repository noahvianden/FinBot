These seem to be the driver behind Tesla's large COGS, and it really is seeing how much they can trim the costs of batteries, particularly with more EV automakers and next-gen battery companies needing lithium.  If costs don't come down dramatically, they will be in a tough position.  \n* 96% of their energy storage & generation revenue went into COGS, which is worse margins than some (all?) of their competitors (First Solar, Enphase, etc).

The technology may be there shortly, but I guarantee you that regulatory hurdles will stop this from being a reality except for in specific commercial applications.  The driver behind self-driving is to reduce salary & wage expenses for taxi and logistics operations, and if widely adopted, would directly trim at lest 4 million jobs from the US alone (and thereby, income tax revenue, while also reducing people's MPC, so would decrease other tax revenues, and have a larger negative ripple effect). \n* Neuralink, SpaceX, Boring, and Starlink, are all unaffiliated with Tesla the company; Elon is their connection point.\n\nTesla is a tempting investment because they are first to the market with these kinds of vehicles, and there are very high hopes resting on their battery & storage technology, and how autonomous driving will change the transportation industry.  However, there is a lot of risk involved when it comes to predicting government regulations, trust in dramatic cost reduction, and serious prayer that they will have minimal advertising expenses.

What software services and upgrades are they going to add to their vehicle?  Also, I am not convinced that this approach of software license upgrades is feasible for the mass market; this structure is typically seen in enterprise environments, and rarely for products and services marketed towards the individual because quite frankly it's an awful and costly structure, and is intended to be leveraged in enterprise environments that are married to a solution.  At the end of the day, Tesla needs to dramatically improve finished product margins before it can hope to offer addon software licensing for vehicle upgrades.\n\nI suppose they can always have a Battery as a Service solution similar to what Nio is offering, however I don't think that this service will be utilized except for perhaps in dense population centers where a personal parking garage to install an EV charger is not always a reality.

There are plenty of resources out there to learn options, so I'd recommend both reading about them and watching videos in your spare time. I've also loved investopedia. They have really simple, easy to follow sections on beginning with stocks and more advanced stock investment strategies like options.   \n\n\nSecond, look into ETFs as they allow you to get exposure to markets with less risk than investing in a single stock. Some good ones follow major markets, they can be actively or passively managed and are reasonably safe investments longterm. VOO is good, so is SPY, and many others. I'm happy to divulge what I do know about them and which have been solid picks. There are obviously newer ones as well, for example if you wanted exposure to the EV market MOON is a good one, or technology ARKK or even the newer GINN are good choices as well.  \n\n\nThird, don't rush into it. Take your time and try to understand as much as possible. One thing I've found helpful is looking up stocks on Finviz, MarketWatch, yahoo finance, and morningstar - looking at what the EPS is, P/E, PEG, beta, and sometimes looking at MACD and Bollinger bands (saved my ass today). Research the companies, does it align with what you think is a good investment? Why invest in it? There are other questions I ask myself but I'm just trying to give you a starting point, but unfortunately, this might be like the blind leading the blind here.   \n\n\nRecognize the risk you are taking. Obviously diversify, and invest if you have the means. Definitely be careful with options, I had a contract exercise on me because I was ITM (in the money), and had I not had funds in place I could have been up shit creek. Maybe more people will chime in and add to this, since we are all here to make money while being (hopefully) levelheaded.

If share price stays below 700, I am not sure there will be a pullback. 600-700 is a price that the market would consider fair after battery day and Q3 numbers, where we did NOT see an appropriate stock price increase. So the share price was artificially suppressed, which is now released.\nWith S&P500 inclusion, I would think somewhere above 700 is a realistic value for the stock. Thats at least what I think the market would value the stock (I am personally more bullish because I think near certain future benefits should be priced in already which are not at moment).\nSo assuming the stock goes significantly above 700, say above 800 and 900, I would guess there will be a short lived, drop and a re-bounce to 700 over a few weeks afterwards. But this is very uncertain in my mind, I wouldn't count on it.\n\nIf it goes to any price above 900, I think a drop afterwards is unavoidable. Its going to be a wild ride in there. I wouldn't exclude the possibility that it goes below 400 in this circumstance, just because all the gamblers exit all at once.\n\nI am very unsure about the timing though.

{"title": "Michel Burry Short On TSLA", "selftext": "***Michel Burry Short Position***\n\nOn **$TSLA**\n\nAs we all already know the news on shorting TSLA by Michel Burry came out Dec 3, 2020\n\nFrom his standpoint on the position, the argument is that the price of TSLA is overvalued and there should be a correction made in the market. The profitability of TSLA and the rate of expected profitability is high but however, they are not on the rate of profitability for their projected Q1-Q2.\n\nHe showed on his tweet about the trade; The total Revenue, Market Capitalization, and EBIT of 32 companies in the auto sector and compared them to TSLA. It shows us that TSLA is underperforming and is in fact overvalued.\n\nI will now go in-depth of my review of TSLA and break the companies performance using multiple financial benchmarks.\n\nIn this review I will use companies in the auto sector, TSLA’s direct competition and EV ETF’s I will, however, account for the future probability of the company since I think that it has high importance.\n\nBellow are key benchmarks shown: ( total Revenue, Market Cap, And Ebit)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xd9g29de3461.jpg?width=1815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80a05b1a18c5d96795caa2cc5ffdac0e57e405f4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this spreadsheet, we can see the comparison between the total  (Revenue/Market Cap/Ebit) of the whole auto sector. and in compression to TSLA.  From this, we can determine that tesla in Market Cap alone beats all other Auto manufacturers.  Their EBIT this year is about 1.7 Billion to the 40 Billion total. But does the company truly have the potential and the value that it is at?\n\n***Bellow, I will add more benchmarks to TSLA compared to the industry to see the true value in the company and its financials and external sources of value to TSLA that would make this trade go in the wrong direction.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v48shyje3461.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a1038c71293b90ca474810c614651038aec6e30\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look purply at the (share price) we clearly see the massive 867% yearly gain on TSLA. However, if we look at the metrics where the company excelled in would be P/E, Price/Book.\n\nWhere the problem is would be the profit margins. Both EPS and EBIT metrics are low for the value of the company.  That is the main problem of the overvaluation of TSLA is that they don't make enough profit to validate their share price. We can say that the future value is there however in the short term the price is moving in a way that would indicate to us a bubble. And a correction that should affect the price of the stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8bdwsdmle3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1e57b3f2277c41f216b8e29a3d46aff1a4ce1b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere I demonstrate mixed metrics on all the 32 companies in the auto sector. To show how TSLA is underperforming in most of the benchmarks. This is to show where the company has overvalued and how.\n\n* MKT cap ($616b)\n* Accounts payable turnover:  ( The accounts payable turnover ratio is a short term measure used to quantify the rate at which a company pays off its suppliers. Accounts payable turnover shows how many times a company pays off its accounts payable during a period.)       -Here TSLA has a rate of 5.43 that states to us; they are taking time to pay to their creditors and compared to other companies in the auto sector are underperforming in this benchmark.\n* Profit Margin: -2.56% of the cost of production exceeds total sales. TSLA has more costs than they are able to cover by their profit. Other companies that have a negative profit margin in the sector all have a share price lower than their valuation.\n* Gross profit: $4.07B where the value is $616B this indicator alone shows us that the company is way overvalued. We can argue that they are in the Tech sector more than in manufacture or cars. But however, their model of operations demonstrate to us that they are heavily weighted on that side of the business and not tech.\n* Supply chain revenue: 0.19% this benchmark demonstrates that they are not generating enough revenue from their supply chain operations.\n* Inventory days: ( how many days on average does it take to take 'product to market') 59.3 days Higher than the average of the auto sector.\n* Inventory growth: 14.09 in the past 12M\n* ROA: -1.96% losing money on their return on assets.\n\nAnalyst Predictions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uc8x2ydne3461.jpg?width=1749&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1befc6f8f9915bd8660e7933183c006110d6b2f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe average target price of TSLA is **$375** however there are indeed more buy signals at 35.9%\n\nBut Burry's target price would be around $300-$350\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0ta8j8oe3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4b82d8668e7a8364b80bb61da96202bd0773d19\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVerdict:  Based on the financials it is overvalued \n\n'Options'\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3k0fnr3re3461.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42b16c2166724ef88aeb9d3f5ddbd5bdf618bb9c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe level of puts on open interest is increasing in the market this would indicate that Bearish volumes in the market on TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5tyx8xre3461.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce5536d5244900e9e888f2a06dbf9488ec0b7e28\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ1 of 2021 shows us the options volumes where the market is pumping more volume in the lower level of the stock price.\n\nI strongly agree with the numbers and that this stock is overvalued but has a lot of extrinsic potential and value in the future, but there should be a market correction that would take place and we can profit from this move. TSLA is a great company and has a bright history but at the levels, it is at now. I personally do not see it going higher.

However, if the price is then $750 and the drop is to $525, then the person shorting is screwed on those positions. So it is very difficult to short ahead of time. It is difficult even right afterwards, because we don’t know exactly how it will trade on such a large direct index add. For example, loose tracking funds may still be acquiring, which means a drop and pop is quite possible, which can nuke a seemingly positive short position.\n\nRight after is Q4 production and delivery numbers.

It is like valuing a new house based on a slew of houses that need serious remodeling or will be torn down. Overall, the industry is going to be shedding ICE related assets and will be cell constrained going forward. So likely the overall auto market shrinks while the EV specific market grows dramatically. Tesla is the leader in the disruption and is a pure play without any legacy distractions. On top of that, Tesla is really an automaker, plus dealer, plus solar module maker, plus solar installer, plus utility scale and residential stationary storage vendor. You have to add all of that together even though automotive revenues currently dominate. That won’t be the case going forward.\n\nFinally, their Autopilot software has built up quite a large amount of deferred revenue. As they release updates, they recognize more of that revenue which is basically near 100% margin. That can blow out the current earnings... another perspective is that it re-writes previous margins, which makes your DD blow up.\n\nIt is definitely quite profitable to be a tactical short in TSLA with great timing and more profitable to be a strategic long on TSLA.

If you remember 2014 GoPro was trying to tout thembselves of as a tech company, a social media company, a brand of sorts, and more. I believe they were trying to tell people they were going to also be a drone company. Stonk was soaring. I remember thinking this is just a fucking camera company. All they make is a above average to low premium camera. Why are the large camera companies of the world not crushing them. Well turns out the company was actually valued at around 5 bucks eventually. I believe the same will happen to PTON. It may not go to 5 bucks but I believe it could definitely go to 30-40 dollas by the fibinachi bands. My take is boat loads of people are not going to purchase a 2-4k dollar bike that does not even move. This is during a pandemic where money is supposedly tight. They also have lots of people aggressively fighting for market share aka ... Nordictrack, Mirror thing, Apple, Plain old normal bikes.\n\nI dont see them as a tech company or a social media company. I see them as a fad excercise equimpement. Half of going to the gym is actually going to the gym. Most people never work out as well at home. This bike will be ridden by my fat wife Becky for a few months then after that it will go in the corner. After a few more months I will trip over it and move it to the garage. After a few more months of pay the subsription I will cancel it. After a year or so my wife even fatter than before will now drag the bike out of the garage for a couple weeks and watch spin class from youtube on her ipad or phone. After a few months the bike will go back in the garage where it will stay for another few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; PTON is the shakeweight of stonks. It is a meme in it self.

{"title": "TSLA S&P Purchase Chart - 73B in TSLA purchased around 12/18 - Where will it come from? Is it possible? At what cost?", "selftext": "All funds, ETFs, etc that directly track the S and P have to buy TSLA on or around the 18th. The majority will be purchased directly on the 18th. almost **15% of TSLA Float** will be bought on or around the 18th. Locking it up for as long as it is in the S and P.\n\n**Can They Buy Enough TSLA on 12/18?**\n\nWhen only counting S&P and tracking index funds / ETFs, at current Tesla Price, they are scheduled to purchase **$73 Billion in TSLA.**\n\nThis gets progressively larger, as the price increases.\n\n[TSLA Price Changes Changes S and P inclusion purchasing](https://preview.redd.it/qsv4203674461.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deebe56d8351bcd988ac5698ae07ddf8c86b1d87)\n\nThey have to buy 113+ Million shares, or about **15% of all available shares.**\n\n**How are they going to do it?**\n\n1. **Institutional Investors - 52.96%** [Institutional investors](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&subView=institutional) Hold 402M Shares\n2. **ETFs - 4.6%** \\- 35M Shares. These aren't for sale. Example QQQ owns 10M shares - [165 ETFs that control 17B of TSLA](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA)\n3. **Retail Investors - 42.4% -** The rest I assume.\n\n**What percent of this TSLA can actually be traded on or about the 18th?**\n\n**ETFs can't sell** their shares, they are tracking something, they just can't sell TSLA.\n\nI believe less then **20% of the retail investor shares will be available.** The rest are held by people that won't even log into an investment account on 12/18 or next week at all. Think of retirement funds, long term investors, etc.\n\nThis would mean that **64M** TSLA shares might be available for purchase from retail investors --if the price is right. I don't think these investors are going to liquidate at the current stock price. They are still holding for a reason.\n\nThen there are institutional controlled shares, I believe that a lot of those shares are locked up, think of mutual funds, and investment groups. Baring an emergency they must have meetings and votes on what they trade. It takes weeks or months for many of them to divest in one area and invest in another. They aren't setup to switch strategies at a moments notice, especially for a stock that is having a rally. Also, Think of funds that are filled with just manufacturing or car companies, etc. They won't decide to exclude TSLA for a day / week / month because the price is too high.\n\nSome of the institutional investors have had TSLA for a long time, they have already decided that they want to keep it, and aren't ready to part with it just because it has a high value.\n\nAlso look at Capital Group management and Vanguard Fund, together they control about 10% of TSLA (15% of float) and I'm assuming it is intermixed within many of their combined 170 mutual funds they control. I can't imagine that they can divest TSLA from most of the places they have it stashed on one day. Maybe they already have started, but I doubt it.\n\nI think less then  **40%** of the institutional shares will be available on Dec 18th, I think this would be a very 'high' estimate. I also think that the price would have to be North of 750 for these people to think of liquidating. They have TSLA for a reason, and it has done very well for them, a lot of them sold some shares last quarter, and I bet they regret it now.\n\nThat would mean **161M** Shares might be available from Institutional Investors, if the price goes astronomical.\n\n**225M Shares actually available on 12/18 (Based on my guesses) - THEY NEED 113M+ and the price will be sky high to get that number.**\n\nI think that it would be very expensive to get 113M shares out of the grips of investors. I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before seems unlikely, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**\n\nThere is a speed that this has to be done at as well, Even if only 80% has to be done on the 18th, They have to buy **13.9M+ SHARES ( $9B @ 650) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a ***B******lood Bath***. Yes some funds can invest a few days before, but it's a small percentage of them, and it still doesn't change the fact that between now and then 113M shares minimum need to be locked away.\n\nAlso, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.\n\n**Wildcard 1: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.\n\nI am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.\n\n**Wildcard 2: Options**, What happens if investment firms start buying options just to exercise them and get the shares? Naked Short Calls will be popped at the worst times, causing market orders to be placed and force buying all over the place. There will be margin calls that require short stocks to be covered, etc. I can see chaotic price increases. \n\n**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:** I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.\n\nThe S&P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.\n\n**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?** Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.\n\nTheir biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** \n\n**S and P Benchmarked Funds:** There are another **6.6T** in funds that are **Benchmarked** to the S and P, but they are actively traded, and they aren't going to be required to buy shares on the 18th. Some, are already buying shares, those shares will most likely be unavailable for the 18th. This could easily add another **25M - 50M more shares** to be purchased on or around 12/18.\n\n**One last thing to consider:** Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S. Korea alone](https://observer.com/2020/08/tesla-stock-fueled-by-korea-retail-investor-apple-microsoft-amazon-tech/#:~:text=As%20of%20Friday%2C%20Korean%20retail,were%20first%20reported%20by%20Bloomberg).

Here's the reality here:  The leader of the NIAID and NIAIH (Dr. Fauci) changed the rules of clinical trials specifically for COVID treatments only after Remdesivir received \"full approval\" to where even Phase 1 trials were required to provide some form of \"efficacy.\"  This is 100% a lobbyist/political change to impact the current or incoming president because people are stupid enough to believe a drug approved under 1 person vs another increases their status or image (real petty shit I know.)**\n\n**Here's what the reality of what real clinical standards have long been established as (Table of phases below) and will likely revert back to (if their politically aligned person takes office or the lobbyist gets removed) once they get called out for this anti-scientific political bullshit being pressed into science we could maybe have this happen but it's unlikely.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dow87ryhy661.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed025ddc05078507f77a3d49157a135dfe33cbb\n\n**As you can see above; Phase 1 has NEVER EVER BEEN A CHECK FOR EFFICACY, PERIOD.  There's just not enough people within the test group, 20-100, to provide any statistically meaningful results towards efficacy.**\n\n**Even phase 2 trials are iffy as they only take a sample size of 100-200, it's a check on the dose ranging to determine if they are in the correct range or to change the dosing slightly for Phase 3 which is 300-3000 people.**\n\n**Phase 3 is where the real efficacy check is, and is why it's the final check for all drugs coming to market.  The safety profile gets well established during this phase as they are more likely to include people with other health problems (unrelated to the treatment target/problem) into the trial pool as to better represent the real demographics of populations.**\n\n**When this trial was changed to need to establish efficacy, obviously Phase 2/3 standards using only 20 people, it would never ever pass muster and will never happen.**\n\n**Here's data and the example as to why:**\n\n**Remdesivir's efficacy could not be established until data got cherry picked by the NIAIH/NIAID even though they had data on 10,000+ people from MULTIPLE Phase 2-3 studies on Remdesivir vs COVID performed early 2020.**\n\n**The FDA used data on 1060 patients:  The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with Remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with Remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received Remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).** \n\n**What you see here is actually a very small % differential of \"efficacy\" and it's not good.  It's likely the worst data of \"improvements and efficacy\" to ever receive full approval since 2000 or maybe even dating back to the 80's and here's why...**\n\n**Remdesivir's \"efficacy\" was 5.2% improvement in short duration treatment and 3.8% improvement for the longer term use.  Long term use should almost always show greater improvement but in this case it didn't.**\n\n**If you want to be upset about the great information BCRX published which met every single standard of Phase 1 trial standards, don't be.  Instead look towards the lobbyist's of big pharma (Gilead) and the people changing the rules (NIAID/NIAIH director Dr. Fauci.)**  \n\n**This unethical change of Phase 1 studies required to produce \"efficacy data\" on 20-100 patients is to prevent better therapeutics from coming to market for the treatment of COVID and we will likely see other drugs halted under this new anti-scientific political standard.**\n\n**Sorry folks, this is our world, the leaders are all politically motivated and they really don't give a shit about saving people over public image of who they do and don't politically align with/like.**", "id": "k9usp6", "created_utc": 1607530757.0, "score": 234, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 231, "comments": [{"body": "You know DD is legit when the bar graph is horizontal", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "yea I used that free shit called google sheets, I kept it horizontal to show they got pushed out past the 100% mark a little easier. :D  The shorts past the 100% mark is the $ that will be feeding this squeeze.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Hey man this squeeze still happening.

(even on things like GME I don't expect the grand squeeze anymore, because the smart shorts pick up FD's/short term calls to cover their short positions if /when a squeeze becomes imminent.)\n\nThis is a a successful growth pick because it's a 30 yr old company which never had it's own product under it's own full control, (this is important) and it will forever be the Name Brand product for oral HAE medicines now.

I believe if we see good patient uptake in the US for Q1 (reports in Q2 sept but could get update sooner) we could head on up to 50/share this year, according to my 80% earnings rev model and \\~ .7 conversion to real earnings after expenses I believe the company should have a cash break even target around 600 patients/yr while the 3 addressable markets contain near \\~15k patients/yr currently meaning if they can take 4% of the market the company might turn profitable 10% should be a cakewalk given the ease of administration.\n\nI tried to get word out about options but they kinda fuckerood me on the last options I posted for Dec and Jan so I'm not gonna hype it anymore, it will just be extra $ for me if they turn profitable as I have a large (for retail I think) amount of share holdings for the long run.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the write up. very informative.

As we now know, almost immediately after the NIAID decided \"we don't need antivirals\" 5 distinct mutations in different places in the world emerged. We now know it is a highly mutating virus, which means it is not time to rest on our laurels.

We should know by now that pandemics are not a Sci-Fi concept -- they happen.\n\n(d) In animal trials against filoviruses, the only time Remdesivir and galidesivir were tested next to each other, Remdesivir failed out for lack of side effects. It also has a much worse safety profile than galidesivir, is more expensive to produce, and has no oral availability in addition to more expensive manufacturing. There was nothing intuitive or logical about the decision to early develop Remdesivir in place of galidesivir.  The government just failed to take a stance on antiviral and deeper pockets owned the rights Remdesivir.\n\n(f) Most likely, we will need \"antiviral cocktails\" or many of them on deck to control covid and prevent the next pandemic.

It was basically a lean post office.  Then they cut their legacy business off and invested deeply in online before it was clearly better than disc service, becoming the defacto streaming service and inventing a category.  They hit luck with the advent of smartphones and tablets and other orthogonal viewing methods.  When streaming started to become a lagging business they invested in content and went even farther away from a 'rental' company.  It's hard to change the identity and central mission of a company that many times in 17 years.\n\nHow would you apply this to GME? They need to find a new service model beyond retail.  They missed out on a Steam like service, even an also-ran like GOG or Epic Store.  They have to be ready to cut many more stores, maybe all stores, loose at some point as a declining business, and I'm not sure they can.\n\nThey had a digital sales platform in \"Impulse\" with Stardock, and were developing a streaming service with Spawn Labs up until it was cancelled in 2014.  They didn't lean into these concepts enough to execute effectively then and they missed out.  Retreated to a basic retail mentality. They didn't even focus on digital sales or defensive retail (like collectible games or exclusives).  They could have been the go-to place for VR and other premium hardware, prebuilt PCs etc.  Gaming Cafe, esports, anything.  Bad management during this period.  I think the current management is better but they don't have any plans to change service model.  Short squeeze or not, that means their business will eventually end.  They are running about as tight a ship as B&M can and the shorts are premature, but time is fleeting.\n\nI've always wondered, ironically, why Gamestop didn't just fucking rent games.  It may sound like moving backwards but they could have started a subscription service combining digital and physical rentals and sales, then transition to fully digital and layer streaming on top.  All the while their inventory of rentals would have complemented their used disc business until that was no longer viable.

False equivalence. Both of those stores sell things other than video games and video game accessories, like the items that actually make them money (appliances, TVs, audio for both stores; Wal-Mart also has groceries, clothing, outdoor gear, sporting gear, shitty knick knacks). Neither Wal-Mart nor Best Buy rely on video game shit to maintain their bottom line. Try ordering a washing machine on Amazon and let me know how that works out for you. \n\n2) RE: Digital vs physical games. The article linked doesn’t support your assertion in the slightest. UK retailers reported that 25% of their supply was the cheaper digital only console. That’s all it says. It has no reference to any data on actual consumer preferences. However, digital downloads of games are at their highest point ever. As of October, digital download revenues were up [14%](https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/worldwide-digital-games-market)year over year. That’s a trend that has continued every single year for at least a decade. It’s not reversing. Physical games are going the way of the audio cassette. Sorry if that is hard to accept. \n\n3) Bonds. This isn’t determinative of financial health or future bankruptcy. The company could (and should) pivot to embracing more fully the online distribution universe. It’s good they are currently reducing debt. If other trends continue, however, the cost cutting measures responsible for such debt reduction will only go so far. \n\nTL;DR: Fuck the hedge fund shorts they deserve to eat their losses and feed us for a change.
