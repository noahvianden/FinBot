Some people are already stretching pretty far to afford a Model 3, they just can't spend another $10k on a gimmick.

On the Semi it can be a very expensive subscription (+$1k/month), on normal cars they can take a large cut from robo taxi revenue.\n\nThe final thing is that it's still software and it's the same as with Netflix and pirating movies.

However if the TV show isn't available or only available in US, not EU then people will find workarounds.

The current take rate for FSD is ridiculously low right now at 30%-ish. \n\nLet’s say, as a thought exercise:\n\n- Tesla sells 1M vehicles in a year\n- 100% take rate for FSD at $10K price\n- full revenue recognition for FSD revenue\n- 1M x $10K = $10B, and nearly all of this is gross profit\n\nWith a market cap at $700B...divide by $10B (paying $0 for TSLA auto biz hardware gross margins, $0 for TSLA Energy, $0 for Robotaxi and other future biz lines) and you’d pay 70 multiple on this FSD income.\n\nIf you’re thinking a 70 multiple is a little high, remember that it scales with a double multiplier: FSD grows with TSLA unit volume growth multiplied by rate at which TSLA decides to increase FSD price.

EVs dont need much service as they have far fewer parts and most parts are electronic not mechanical. So selling EVs is bad business for dealers as a result they sabotage EV sales.

Just as Tesla's are the safest cars in its class, I wouldn't trust another car that barely made it pass the government's minimum bar. But I believe there will be differentiators in the better autonomous driving AIs. For example, Tesla aren't just simply going from point A to B, they're avoiding potholes, automatically closing their side-view mirrors to squeeze through tight spots. These aren't things I would have imagined them doing. But besides that, other car companies aren't even aiming toward the same goal as Tesla. Other companies, including Google, rely on fully mapping out every square inch of a city in order to drive it. That's simply not scalable. Tesla is trying to have the car drive on unmapped roads automatically. This is similar to when Yahoo dominated search by simply manually linking the entire web. That was fine when only a few (thousand) companies had websites, but once everyone and their grandmother had a geocities account, you couldn't possibly index the entire web manually. Google came along and indexed and ranked the entire web using a PageRank algorithm. So Google's search approach compared to Yahoo is Tesla's approach compared to the rest of the industry. And yes, there is a network effect with data. The more people that drive tesla's, the more data they collect, the better the AI gets, which makes driving a Tesla more appealing. That's the feedback loop. There are 3 resources you need for AI, in order of importance: the data, the brain (ie smart data data scientists who analyze the data and develop the models), and the hardware. You can argue that several big firms have the brain and hardware resources. But Tesla has the data, real-world driving data. Other companies use simulations, or have a few million miles driven by an employee around the same city over and over again. This is not real data.\n\nI can't speak about monetization of FSD. My domain expertise is not in economics or finances. Maybe yours is.\n\nBut I don't believe this stock's price is currently based on PE ratios or price-to-sales revenues, and maybe that's why many people have a hard time understanding it. I think PE ratios are inappropriate for a growth company. Amazon was over 1000 PE at one point and it was worth $600 then. I would kill for a chance to buy Amazon at that PE and price now. I don't believe ratios say anything what a stock price should be worth. Why is the average PE for one industry higher than another? It's just a random number just like the stock price itself. Ultimately, I think it all comes down to simple economics 101: supply vs demand. If more people think the stock price is fair or undervalued than people who think it's over-valued, then the price rises, otherwises it falls. As long as Tesla continues to execute on its plan and rewards us with periodic updates that show it's heading in the right direction and the right pace, people will continue to buy and hold. If in some quarter, that doesn't seem to be the case, then that should decrease the demand for shares at that price and decrease the share price. Even if many people believe Tesla is overvalued, I believe the market is still working perfectly and Tesla's share price will always reflect that fact.\n\nWhat is your motivation with the post?

Problem is nobody knows the actual capabilities of any of these things before they are realized.
