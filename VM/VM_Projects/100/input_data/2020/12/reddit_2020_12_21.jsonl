See the links posted in my colleagues reply. Unless that's what you meant by OTM IC assignment?\n\nSo, to be clear, it's very unlikely for an OTM IC to get assigned at expiration. Not impossible, since what would have to happen is a) the underlying would have to have significant after hours trading, b) the underlying would have to rise/fall by enough after hours to switch it from OTM to ITM, and c) that has to happen before the cutoff for making exercise decisions a 5:30pm, so not a wide time window.\n\n> Basically, I need to do nothing, but because I am new to options wanted to confirm.\n\nThat is correct.\n\n> Add to that the narrow strike width of my iron condor may (being only one dollar difference), might trigger an unintended assignment, but I do not see that making whole lot of logic, but I could be wrong.\n\nWhich part is narrow? The spread between the wings, or the wings themselves? If the latter, your assignment risk is *decreased*, not increased, since your liability is smaller. If the spread between the wings is narrow, that would increase your risk slightly, but still the abc I listed above would all have to happen. **However**, a narrow wing span means your likelihood to expire OTM is drastically reduced, so it's not so much a risk issue as a low win rate issue.\n\nFWIW, don't get hung up on expiration max profit. You can sell to close the IC on expiration day and only give up a few pennies of credit, but in exchange drive your assignment risk even closer to 0%.

Greeks (low IV/vega and low theta on entry for debit, high IV/vega and/or high theta for credit)\n\n> How do the strategies for each differ?\n\nThe main difference is how you make your money. Delta is important for either, but delta does almost all the work for a debit spread (with maybe a little help from vega), while delta, theta and vega all do work for a credit spread. Even if you get no help from delta because the underlying stays in a narrow trading range, theta will make you money on the credit spread. Also, for a credit trade, you *start* with max profit and the game is to see how much you can keep after you close the trade.\n\nThere are also certain additional risks that come with credit trades. Pin risk is more likely with a credit trade, for example. But most if not all of these risks can be avoided if you exit the position before expiration, in both debit and credit cases.\n\n> I read that a strategy for credit spreads is to use them for near expiration dates to profit off of time decay in the final days of an option. Why is this not a strategy for debit spreads?\n\nBecause theta makes you lose money over time. Remember, profit for a debit trade is buy low, sell high. You want your value to go up, but theta makes it go down. Profit for a credit trade is sell high and buy back low.

It's mostly irrelevant. What matters more is projecting a direction and a time frame. Your stock doesn't have to go from $110 to $115 for you to make money, it just has to go up (or down, or stay the same).\n\nSecond, *consider delta*. Delta determines your risk/reward for every long call. What delta do you enter at and how much does that delta cost? Once you've got that figured out, you can then make a guess at your expected return on investment.\n\nThird, *consider theta and vega/IV*. Your delta evaluation is contingent on what theta and vega/IV end up doing. You could have 99% certainty that your stock will move up, but still lose money on a long call because IV goes down. So have a strategy for either exploiting or mitigating theta and vega.\n\nAll of that is homework you do up front. Once that's done, you can pick a reasonable exit strategy for profit, loss, and maximum holding time.\n\nFor example, for long calls on equity index options, I exit at 10% profit of the initial debit for a near ATM call (delta 45 to 55), when IV is either low or IV Rank is relatively low. Low IV at entry means higher probability it will go up rather than down. I also pick an expiration that is around 30-35 DTE and plan to exit before 20 DTE, when theta starts to really take a bite out of premium. That keeps my holding time down to a couple of weeks and mitigates theta. \n\nI will also exit at a 20% loss over the initial debit (assuming a win rate of greater than 67%), to limit my losses.

How do you choose suitable companies? And how much, in real terms and minus any fees, would you be expected to return per cycle?\n\nHi, Im a beginner when it comes to trading, so I have questions to ask, but not a complete beginner, so I understand the terminology - My question is since you need to be willing to own 100 shares to run the Wheel Strategy, how large of an initial pot do you need to make it worth doing? Would £1k suffice or do you need in the region of £10k to see a good return?\n\nSecondly, how do you go about choosing a Stock to run the Wheel on? What sort of metrics do you consider? And are there any that are always good to run the Wheel on? I read about people doing this strategy on AMD and Apple often, is this a recent development or something that is common?\n\nFinally, how much would you be expected to return per cycle?

And Merry Christmas!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> TL:DR - How much do you need to begin the Wheel Strategy?\n\nIronically, the Wheel strategy requires more capital up front than many other credit strategies. Even if you try to start with low priced stocks, you are still buying 100 shares or putting up collateral in cash for 100 shares, and that can be a lot of money.\n\nSo the way I would answer this question is figure out which stocks or funds you want to Wheel first, then add up the collateral costs. That's your minimum. \n\nJust keep in mind that diversification is important. If you've only got enough cash to afford one wheel on one stock, that's a sign that you are below the minimum capital to be successful. How many is enough will depend on how correlated the underlyings are, but at least 3 is a good starting point. For example, I recently had three wheels going on GOLD, T and XLE. There is relatively small correlation between those, compared to AAPL vs. AMD, for example. \n\n> Secondly, how do you go about choosing a Stock to run the Wheel on? \n\nThat's a popular topic on this sub and on r/ThetaGang, so just do a search on \"wheel stocks\" on both and you'll come up with tons of suggestions for every budget. That said, my advice is stay away from penny stocks (anything below USD$10) and option chains with low liquidity. If the stock or fund isn't in this volume ranking screen, avoid (US market): https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks\n\n> Finally, how much would you be expected to return per cycle? Ive heard anything from 1% to 5% but these rarely, if ever, mention any hidden fees that a novice like myself would not expect.\n\nHow long is a cycle? I'd expect 1% to be less than a month. I have single trade Wheels that are much higher than 5%, but I also have losses, which pulls the average down.

E.g. you sell a Jan 15 put for GME at the $15 strike, someone will pay you $1.75 per share (x100) to obligate you to buy 100 shares for $15 each IF the stock drops below $15 and stays there on Jan 15. So if you sold that put, you get paid the premium and you only buy the shares if the stock ends below the $15 strike. No matter whether or not you bought the shares, you get the $1.75 per share x100.

{"title": "CLDR - The Other, Massively Undervalued PLTR", "selftext": "Long time lurker and I’m finally deciding it's time to show you retards the biggest missed opportunity of any IPO in the past 5 years.\n\nI know that PLTR is going to the moon, and these past couple weeks have been super frustrating as it seems to currently be refueling for a run up. But while you wait for your pockets to return to tendie town, might be worth checking out a company that does basically **\\*the exact same thing\\*** that is currently valued at 10x less than PLTR.\n\nFull disclosure - I used to work at Cloudera and was there when they IPO’d in 2017 - the same day as CVNA. At the time, Cloudera was one of the biggest unicorns in Silicon Valley as they had billions in funding from some pretty notable VCs and a hefty amount from Intel.  After a super disappointing IPO, I sold off every share I owned over the next year as companies like Carvana soared. At the time I was convinced that nobody would ever understand the complicated software that Cloudera built and sold, and despite solid growth, lots of enterprise customers, and a road to profitability, it just kind of… fell flat.\n\nThat is, until WSB took over the world. Fast forward to 2020 and a PLTR IPO that grew massively over the next several months - I was completely shocked. Yes, I know you’re all retarded but I didn’t know you were \\*that\\* retarded that you would give PLTR, a company founded 5 years before CLDR with only 20% higher revenue and lower margins, a 10x higher valuation (\\~$50 billion market cap for PLTR vs \\~$4 billion for CLDR). I have former colleagues that worked with me at CLDR and who now work at PLTR and they think it’s complete insanity that PLTR has a valuation that much higher than CLDR. If you all fundamentally believe that PLTR is worth more than $40 billion, then you are missing a huge opportunity with CLDR.\n\nCloudera and Palantir use basically the same exact underlying software components to build fundamentally the same exact solutions for their customers. Don't believe me? Go look at the [CLDR](https://github.com/cloudera) and [PLTR](https://github.com/palantir?page=1) Github repos and look for terms like \"hadoop\", \"spark\", \"parquet\", etc. Yes, there are some differences in their product but they are more the same than they are different - at the end of the day the biggest thing each of these companies do is data integration and analytics. However, their approaches, technology influence, and sales methodology should yield a similar or better valuation for CLDR than PLTR for a number of reasons:\n\n* Though PLTR has higher quarterly revenues, CLDR has much better [gross profit margins](https://ycharts.com/companies/CLDR/gross_profit_margin) (81% most recently and increasing vs 63% for PLTR), likely due to their revenue mix being more heavily weighted in software subscriptions vs services. For the latest quarter, [CLDR had 91% of revenue from subscription software sales](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001535379/ec48b119-7c21-4fa4-a3fa-2e3bf020c6fb.pdf) and 8% from services, while PLTR doesn’t seem to break this out in their 10-Q. CLDR subscription software margins are 87% as of last quarter. [PLTR has a 3.5x higher cost of revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/8a404f13-53a8-4610-9f9a-34add0ec1742.pdf) which all but confirms that their mix is much more heavily weighted towards services with 10-20% margin vs subscription software that has 80%+ margin.\n* CLDR reported an EPS of  .15 for the [most recent quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLDR/analysis?p=CLDR), which was a beat of almost 67%. While PLTR reported an EPS of .09 for the most recent quarter, GAAP net loss is much worse (PLTR earnings were -$853M for last quarter and -$110M for the prior quarter, vs CLDR at -$14M and -$36M, respectively). Accounting for the effect on earnings of their recent IPO, PLTR is probably at least 3x less profitable than CLDR despite having been around for 5 years longer.\n* As another reference point, FSLY is currently trading at a 3x higher market cap than CLDR on negative earnings with a 3x higher net loss and 3x lower revenue.\n* Cloudera has surprised on earnings by at least 50% for each of the last 4 quarters, and should within the next 1 or 2 quarters no longer have a GAAP net loss, and their profitability should continue improving as they continue their pivot to [cloud-based SaaS solutions](https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-data-platform.html). PLTR seems to be years away from achieving the same thing.\n* CLDR has broader sales reach and a larger sales force - they have some government customers (e.g. [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers/us-census-bureau.html))  but they [target traditional and high tech enterprises](https://www.cloudera.com/about/customers.html). I never competed even one time against PLTR when I sold CLDR software, which shows that they are much too focused on a particular vertical/industry and/or do not have traction in the broader market.\n* CLDR has greater influence on the underlying technology stack that both PLTR and CLDR use (and AMZN/MSFT/GOOG clouds) because they contribute more code than any other company to the open source community that they all use. They also partner more heavily with big cloud service providers and technology providers (have [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/bigdata/big-data-appliance/5.1/bigli/cdh5.html#GUID-5B5969CD-FE64-46A2-A7BE-53AF6D11AE77)/[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/partners/cloudera) co-sell solutions, CLDR software works in all 3 major cloud providers and they have a SaaS solution that runs in all 3 cloud providers)\n* CLDR has a [more broadly applicable suite of products](https://www.cloudera.com/products.html), as it can fit in the data warehouse/analytics space, the machine learning space, and the data processing space. It competes with other well-known software like traditional data warehouses (Oracle, IBM, Teradata), cloud native warehouses (Snowflake software, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift), and data science and machine learning unicorns like Databricks. Because of this, it has broad applicability vs PLTR who seems to target very specific use cases.\n* Given its cross-cloud compatibility and influence on the open source technology ecosystem, they would be ripe for an acquisition by a traditional enterprise software company who is trying to gain more cloud traction - for example an IBM or an Oracle. I would not be surprised to see them gobbled up in the next year or two. CLDR has a large growth SaaS solution that [grew 40% in the last quarter](https://investors.cloudera.com/news-and-events/news/press-release-details/2020/Cloudera-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx) that would be a good buy for any of these old guard companies.\n* Both PLTR and CLDR have an 'L' as the second character in the ticker and an 'R' as the fourth character in the ticker which makes them easily interchangeable in any already existing shitposts or memes you've worked on\n* CLDR offers a lot of opportunity for cloud and weather-related puns and usage of cloud emojis, which WSB desperately needs more of.\n\nFor these reasons and more, I fundamentally believe that CLDR is massively under valued at a $4 billion market cap/$12.68/share and represents a great buying opportunity, especially if you are in the camp that thinks that PLTR should shoot through $30/share, to a $50 billion valuation and to the moon. I mean, SNOW has an absolutely retarded $200 billion market cap. There is no way that CLDR should be valued 10x less than PLTR and 50x less than SNOW.\n\nPositions: GOOG (100 shares, long), SNOW 320c 12/24, CLDR 05/21/21, 20c\n\n**TL;DR** **- If you believe in PLTR,  CLDR makes basically the same products, has a 10x lower market cap, is more profitable, and is worth a serious look as both a solid investment and as a potential acquisition target. Even if you believe it to be half as valuable as PLTR, that's 40$ upside on shares currently standing at 12$ a share.**\n\nEdit: Hope you all are enjoying the tendies ", "id": "khjrx6", "created_utc": 1608565302.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "OK Il buy some.

{"title": "Everyone has it wrong. This is what $PLTR ACTUALLY does and why it's valuable.", "selftext": "So I had a long conversation with my friend who works in the AI space about Palantir and how you could begin to value their technology. I'll try to keep it concise and simple, but TL:DR; buy 2023 calls right now. Any strike, at any price.\n\n1. Everyone and the financial media has it wrong. If you are reading an analysis, article, or price target revision, and they call it a \"Data Analytics Company\", you can ignore it entirely.\n\n2. The real value of the company is basically in creating models for algorithms. The model is basically a piece of code that can be implemented into an application. It's essentially the algorithm. A model/algorithm is created by giving it a goal, and inputting a set of data the AI can use to get to the goal more efficiently. \n\n3. By basically creating an intuitive, easy to use software that Data Engineers can use to create models, they are eliminating the need to build one from scratch. This is a huge efficiency for companies that want to use AI and algorithms to improve their business, software or application. It means that instead of hiring an entire team of Data Engineers, you only need to hire one or two.\n\nIf you are having a hard time getting your head around this, here is an analogy:\n\nSay you are a new company that wants to sell tendies online. Are you going to hire a team of developers to code and build a website and entire e-commerce platform from scratch? No. You are going to hire one person, who has a more diversified set of talents, to manage a Shopify site and Shopify template.\n\nThis is why Shopify is valuable.\n\nNow, consider the following scenario:\n\nLet's pretend Spotify doesn't exist yet and that you want to create a music streaming service that generates recommendations that increase listening time by using an algorithm. Are you going to hire an entire team of Data Engineers to figure out how to use a massive set of user data to develop a model, or are you going to just use Palantir, and maybe even contract one of their Data Engineers to do it for you, without paying anybody a salary?\n\nLook up the salary of one Data Engineer.\n\nThat's why Palantir is valuable. They can benefit anybody who wants to implement AI/algorithms into their software or applications, without the massive investment of hiring Data Engineers to create it from scratch. For years, this has been the \"edge\" of companies like Google and Amazon, who are at the forefront of AI. Palantir is democratizing this \"edge\".\n\nI will not be responding to comments from people here saying this is incorrect, because you are all retards and I understand this is a gross simplification. It's also, of course, not the only thing Palantir does. But, I think it is the most scalable in the short-term.", "id": "khlj8u", "created_utc": 1608570777.0, "score": 758, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 222, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR\n\nmoon\n\n\n🚀", "score": 445, "replies": [{"body": "Is $TLDR new stock?

Maintenance had to MEL something de-ice related. MEL stipulates aircraft can't be dispatched into known or forecast icing. Ended up cancelling the flight as the route had forecast icing. Maintenance argued \"we're not responsible for the cancellation, the aircraft's serviceable.\" Well, technically yes, it's serviceable, but not for what it needs to do. \"Oh, well, we didn't want to pay OT for someone to clear the fault, so we MEL'd it.\" \n\nSo some maintenance manager wanted to penny pinch his way out of paying overtime, only for the airline to cancel a flight and pay passengers compensation far exceeding the OT.
