They don't actually hold the debts themselves, so if bankruptcies or defaults occur, that doesn't hit them.  Most people don't understand that though. \n\nTheir revenues are huge and have been growing.  \n\nThe detractors - and why the stock price is low - is because of the narrative that they've just had their best year and that future years won't be as strong.  Even if that's true, so what?  An \"off\" year for Rocket would be a dream year for any other their competitors.  And I believe that even if 2021 is an off year, as bears suggest, Rocket, being the biggest and highly efficient, will just thrive anyway the same way that big box stores and Amazon thrive when times get tough for their smaller, weaker competitors.\n\nIt's a bit stunning that Rocket gets no respect when they are basically a mix of fintech like SQ and LMND which have both exploded.  I think Rocket's day will come when markets remember that value matters.  \n\nNormally, with the narrative about future growth being slowed, a stock like RKT would be drilled lower and lower.  In this case though, it's hard to short them on fundamentals, plus last ER they announced provisions for for a monstrous buyback.  It's unclear how much of that provision they'll use or under what circumstances.  But knowing that they have arranged the right to potentially buy back half (I think?) the float would make it quite risky to short.  The buyback announcement itself was a bit interesting.  They offered a chunk of the company as an IPO in 2020 and the consensus was that was worth about $18/share.  So for them to effectively take in $18/share one day, and be willing to buy back shares at approximately the same level the next, is unusual.  \n\nSo thus we have it locked in a very tight range between people betting that future quarters will be merely \"strong\" instead of last year's which were \"super-strong\", but also not willing to sell it lower and get crushed by buybacks.  For all we know, maybe the stable price is a result of buyback activity.  \n\nI use 3 position sizes, small/medium/large and my RKT hold is size large.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "RKT is a very profitable and growing company with a strong market share.

Tesla's current market cap is greater than the top 10 car makers in the world by volume combined.\n\nTesla has not replaced cars. It's not Amazon vs malls. It does not have pricing power for its products. Tesla keeps having to slash prices to increase volume. These are not the characteristics of a company with a strong moat.\n\nTesla's financial results are very meager for the amount of capital invested in this company. Its revenue growth rate is in the low double digits. This does not bode well for a company trading at a P/E of 1350. Typically, car companies trade at a P/E of 10, because this is a cyclical industry. If Tesla grew their profits at 25% per year, and their stock price did not change, it would take 22 years for them to grow into their current stock price.\n\nIn practice that won't happen. Tesla's gross margins are basically stuck at around 18-22% for the past 6 years. Profit increase will mostly have to come from volume growth. Tesla's current share price is at normal car company valuations would require selling 50 million cars per year. This is around the same as the total annual car sales of China + US + EU combined and half of total global annual car sales.\n\nRealistically, EV is a brutally competitive industry. A ton of capital is pouring into this sector, and the future profitability of EV companies is going to be below that of the car industry as a whole. This is the same dynamic as with shale vs the non-shale oil companies. Growth at the expense of profitability, investors lost hundreds of billions in the end.\n\nAs long as investors keep giving EV companies such high valuations, EV companies will keep raising cheap capital and expanding capacity. The resulting massive capacity expansion will kill margins. This is exactly what happened with fiber companies in the late 90s, solar companies in the 2000s, shale companies in the 2010s.

So they basically buy my shares and I get my $80k but this would have been a bad trade because TSLA went much higher than that ($850) and if I kept my shares it would be worth $85k.\n\nBut if TSLA went to $750 then the call doesn't execute and I keep my $262. I just made some money I can use towards buying more shares.\n\nThe price for these calls fluctuate based on the volatility, the news that might be coming up (e.g. earnings reports etc.) and how far out of the money they are.\n\nThe others go ahead and just google if you want to learn more.

The key here is that I don't open too big CFD positions. Since it's a margin deal, my strategy is to open so big positions as I would not have a problem with temporal dips by even 50%. Since I am convinced TSLA will keep going in the long term, then when I open a CFD position I close it only and only on a profit, if needed I am ready to wait for a year, but at the end the CFD position will always be closed on a profit. The important hint here is that you have to plan a possible  taxes from the interest of keeping the position open for this one year. There's an overnight interest on opened CFD positions for each day which you have to pay to the bookie, but on a year basis it's around 4% from the position value, so you just have to aim grow of more than 4% on a year basis which is absurdly small for TSLA :)\n\nI was lucky to hit the bulls eye on the inclusion day my first big CFD positions - setting limit-on-close order @ $694.20 and being executed @ 695.

I hope it's not only luck but a well planned and good strategy : )\n\nAnd then the profit from the CFD deals is used for a living and for accumulating more real shares.

Net equity is measured on the ‚Äúfiling date‚Äù ‚Äì usually the date SIPC files an application in court to have the brokerage firm placed in liquidation.\n\n- Cash and securities held by the broker-dealer for customers comprise a fund of ‚Äúcustomer property‚Äù which is shared pro rata by customers based on each customer‚Äôs ‚Äúnet equity.‚Äù For example, if the fund of customer property consists of 90% of what should have been held by the brokerage firm for customers, then all customers receive 90% of their ‚Äúnet equity‚Äù claims from this fund.\n\n- In many liquidations, the fund of customer property is not sufficient to satisfy fully every customer‚Äôs ‚Äúnet equity‚Äù claim. In that case, SIPC advances its funds ‚Äì up to $500,000 per customer (but not more than $250,000 for cash claims) ‚Äì to make up any shortfall.\n\nSource: https://www.sipc.org/for-investors/investor-faqs", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Happy new year to everyone in this brave and rich sub!\nMy best wishes to you, from South America.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Off topic, but seems like genomics biggest challenge is in data analysis at this point (and just production/scaling).

That number is so big, no computer will ever guess another person's random coin flips, but in theory if someone guessed it, they could steal the coins. \n\nA miner has a wallet, and using cryptography can direct the coins it mined to go to this wallet without actually exposing their 256 coin flips.\n\nI a non miner can also create a wallet by flipping a coin 256 times.

That gets included in the \"block\" \n\nThen all the other miners look at it and try to see if they cheated.
