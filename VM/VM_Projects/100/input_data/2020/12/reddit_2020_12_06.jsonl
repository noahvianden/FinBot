If you're selling a covered call and your shares get called away *you're paying more for the shares* so you're actually losing money.

On top of this if you did buy it on APR 23 after assignment for 279 and sold a 10% CC on that over a month again you'd basically have gotten no premium and you'd have barely cleared assignment by a week. My guess is however that you want to play SPY and get more premium so you're not shooting for 10% OTM (which is pretty far) but maybe 5\\~7% which would have seen you assigned multiple times this year while also having to come up with the difference again and again.\n\nSo again, how do you finance this?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Whats the difference between this and buying the same amount of shares monthly?\n\nWell, in percentages then, you've made 10% plus say 1%. So 11%. The stock has gone up 22%. I am asking you basically can you finance this internally to itself. When you DCA *you don't buy the same number of shares, you put in the same amount of money* but in your case you need to buy at least 100 shares, period, for this to work.\n\nThis is not an averaging because unless you're \"building\" up to 100 shares over time and then risking them all just to do it again you're lagging. This is especially true the more spaced out your dividend; if you got assigned your shares the month before the dividend you can't afford, internal to your system, another 100 shares. That's the problem.\n\nI get that you keep explaining that it is like DCA but DCA specifically does *not* aim to use an actual set number of shares (hence DOLLAR cost averaging, not SHARE cost averaging) so you're basically burning yourself because you need *constant reserves* but in an ironic bid the greater your external reserves, especially in DCA for dividends, the lower your returns over time. \n\nI understand your explanations perfectly but I am having trouble trying to figure out how you think a non-specific system integrates into a specific-system that requires basically a very large reserve fund to work. You have to have enough funds in your reserve fund for any type of sudden increase beyond your own expectations and then the longer dated your CC the greater the risk (and premium) so your best bet for these wouldn't be monthly anyway, probably quarterly, and specifically in the highest IV environments you can get.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWhen you DCA you may buy 10 shares one month and 50 the next depending on the price and maybe only 1 in the next month. That's extreme but follow me here. If you lose 100 of the shares due to the price increasing the DCA buying power you had goes down so the ability to ensure you have enough to DRIP successfully over time goes through the floor. The main problem is that if you're going to do this you would do it with very high premium risks which are longer plays and thus have greater odds of assignment because upfront cash is worth more (Time-Val Money) so ultimately this collapses on itself backwards: You either have to risk what you cannot afford or you have to collect and reinvest at a loss in order to protect the dividend itself.\n\nThis basically sounds like a Wheel with two replacement spokes that don't work as well.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your assumption is backwards.

This means that your risk is multiplied because if you lose 1,000 shares the costs are linear but scalar to your loss so your ability to replace these shares is diminished. In essence what really occurs is a cataclysm that you cannot cover because you have to keep these \"reserves\" relative to the actual risk of loss which means either a lower investment or a larger reserve pool that scales likely faster than your earning power.\n\nBasically your problem lies in your financing structure.

Exactly when it is too high to keep reserves to protect this strategy is unknown to me and I won't interfere in your model but I imagine it is probably lower than 60%. \n\nBasically if you have to build a trench and a moat and a castle to protect a hen house you're probably better off without the hens.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You shouldn't be telling me to backtest this.

Yeah, it's all really cool and generally good stuff, but at the end of the day, most people just want something that will play a specific few games at a decent framerate. Only a tiny fraction of people ever think about the drivers or wish they were better. I bet most people never even open the driver window lol.\n\nFor someone playing at medium or high settings at 1080P (i.e. the vast majority of people), there is still not a good reason to consider ray tracing in your purchase decision (or any of Nvidia's other addons). So, that leaves raw rasterization performance per dollar, and in that area, AMD is still extremely competitive. And actually, their latest cards beat Nvidia's in many cases (with ray tracing disabled or in games without it). This is especially true at resolutions below 4k (again, where most people are playing still).\n\nIf $1,500+ and a power supply upgrade with one of the biggest generational jumps in GPU performance we've ever seen **still** struggles to hit 60fps at 4k with ray tracing...and it **still** manages to lose to a card less than *half* the price from AMD in some games...that really doesn't sound worth the premium. \n\nWe'll see how things look once things are in stock, but...I'm no longer itching for an Nvidia card like I was before seeing the performance comparisons tbh lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "you like investing into amd over nvda at this time? more upside?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ok?... lol AMD drivers are garbage compared to Nvidia, ray tracing is also garbage on AMD.", "score": -8, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Cause your statement of Nvidia only doing ok makes no sense lol.

Energy arbitrage is buying electricity when it's cheap and selling it when it's expensive. Areas with lots of PV have lower energy prices during the day, because solar power has basically zero marginal cost. Areas with lots of fossil plants have lower energy prices during the night, because the power plants are somewhat idling when there's low demand (because everyone's sleeping). Electricity markets and grid services vary per country and state, so it will be difficult to roll out autobidder worldwide.

This thought experiment is further made difficult considering that it assumes Tesla captures literally 100% market share of the entire global automobile output to even come close to the $2T you yourself proposed (including a pretty silly multiple at that, given that if one company owns literally the entire market there is by definition no further exponential growth, so the multiple would theoretically decline).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> I will play your game because it seems that you are being intentionally obtuse.\n\nI'm not playing games and I'm not your economics teacher. \n\nAnd assuming a 5 multiple is just silly since they're, and most companies, are well above that. \n\nNo, they can capture nearly two trillion of valuation at 20 million units.

The only company which comes within spitting distance of that figure on a reasonably regular basis is Apple, followed by Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil.

{"title": "Jews and Gingers - A Degenerate's guide to investing $3,000,000 in PSTH Conjecture!", "selftext": "# The Synopsis - Nothing new, just wrapping it in a bow\n\nAlright Handi-Capables, buckle up - I am going to tell you about a little WSB speculation that may be either the biggest fraud of all time or the most epic DD ever to have occurred in WSB history. A lot of this information comes from a real dick head named breadfruit. This guy is a real piece of work, but I've come to have a real good working relationship with him as we've discussed theories behind Pershing Square as well as the most hyped target being discussed, STRIPE. This thread is really meant to just outline all the history, the theories, the risks and the potential moves that you can do to minimize risk. **I don't want this to turn into the great NRPLing of 2020, where PURPLE had the best quarter of all time but you Degenerates all sold off because they didn't announce an electric vehicle or an Ipad powered exercise bike. Warning to all: This is purely speculation, this SPAC is trading at 30% above NAV which is pretty damn unprecedented without any news. So be cautious as the downside might be 5-6 dollars per share should Bill announce a terrible DUD of a target. This post is not advice, really just general information that I am trying to present in an un-biased way. PSA: I am biased as hell though, hence my 3M investment, although I don't buy all the theories presented by some people on the forums. Also, there is a very good possibility that this SPAC doesn't acquire STRIPE.**\n\nFirst of all, for those of you not aware, PSTH is a SPAC led by Bill Ackman **(A very successful billionaire Jew, hence the title - Not an anti-Semitic post, genuinely aligns with the theory of an announcement soon)**. A SPAC is a special acquisition company that aspired to bring a company public through a reverse merger. The new entity receives a cash infusion and the SPAC holders shares become stock units in the company that trade on the open Market. SPACS are essentially just a giant cash reserve used to purchase a company. This particular SPAC IPO'd with Units being traded for 20.00 and 20.00 NAV in the trust. The units have since split into Warrants and Shares. As of last week, warrants were trading in the high single digits and shares were trading just below 26.00. Regardless of what the stock trades at, the NAV will remain fairly constant at 20.00 per share. For discussions sake, I am going to consider 20.00 as the theoretical floor as it would be very unusual for a Pre-Merger SPAC to drop drastically below NAV. Once a SPAC merges, the 20.00 floor is removed and market demand and market conditions determine the share price going forward. There have been many theoretical questions thrown around about how much this will jump on an announcement and the answer is **that no one knows until the terms of the deal are announced.**\n\nThe SPAC Structure and Anchor Investors\n\nNow that we have this out of the way, let's talk about Bill Ackman's SPAC. This SPAC launched on July 22nd, 2020, the SPAC sold 200,000,000 units for a total trust size of 4 Billion USD. There were additional clauses in this filing that allow for even more units to be issued to increase the buying power of the SPAC to somewhere in the 7B range. The SPAC was subscribed by some very Reputable investors. Investors Included :\n\n[Large institutions](https://preview.redd.it/4hl94rpxhm361.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb7bfe45088a3c7d2b1b35800cd519b86b31f879)\n\n# Largest Institutional Investors\n\nAs you can see, you have some whale investors that include Wells Fargo, Baopost hedge fund, Soroban capital and Guggenheim. Well over 2B dollars is held by these 12 investors. According to the filing, institutions own about 65% of the public float. On Bill Ackmans last hedge fund call he indicated that because there was so much interest in this SPAC, he was able to hand pick his investors. Many of these investors are likely sovereign wealth funds or family offices that do not file and therefore we have no insight into whom they are, but Bill does.\n\nEach one of these investors owns common stock that was likely issued after the units split. For those of you that aren't aware, this SPAC has 3/9 of a common warrant per share. 1/9 was issued during the split from the units and the other 2/9 are issued to common share holders that hold through a merger. These warrants have a 23.00 strike price and they can be redeemed after the stock trades above 36.00 for a defined time period. If you don't know what a warrant is just ignore this paragraph.\n\nThis SPAC was designed with very favorable terms that ensure the sponsor's goals align with the company goals and don't create a conflict of interest. Many Many Many Many SPACs have very favorable terms that leave the sponsor's rich and the investors holding bags.\n\nThis is a very very good article that defines conflicts of interest within SPACS. PSTH has eliminated many of these issues and Bill Ackman's interest align with ours, in fact Bill can't make money until the investors reach a certain threshold of gains.\n\n[https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/](https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/)\n\nThis SPAC hard garnered many anchor investors and its structure is very very favorable as compared to its peers. Bill is setting a new precedent in the SPAC world and it will be interesting to see if other sponsors do the same. This is a key differentiating factor as to why this SPAC is very premium.\n\nTargets and Timing\n\nWhen this SPAC first launched, Bill Ackman indicated that he would likely find a target within 6 months and merge shortly thereafter. Bill also indicated that he was looking for a minority interest in a unicorn that met certain criteria. Here is the criteria as pulled directly from Pershing Square's website. On the last Pershing earnings call, it was indicated that Bill so no reason that he wouldn't meet his original timeline of having a target announced by Q1 and a merger by Q2. January 22nd is the official 6 month milestone from when the SPAC first began trading. **EDIT: The theory is Bill will announce before Hanukah which starts on Dec 10th or 11th.**\n\n* **Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative.** We will generally seek companies with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long term—however, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the initial business combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the business’s cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;\n* **Formidable barriers to entry.** We will seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or “wide moats” around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;\n* **Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control**. We will seek companies that are not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;\n* **Strong balance sheet**. We will seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the de-leveraging effects of the initial business combination;\n* **Minimal capital markets dependency**. We will seek companies that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but will prefer companies that are not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow their businesses;\n* **Large capitalization**. We will seek companies with large enterprise values and significant long-term growth potential that will be likely candidates for inclusion in the S&P 500 index;\n* **Attractive valuation**. We will seek companies at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic value; and\n* **Exceptional management and governance**. We will seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCM’s experience in identifying and recruiting new management.\n\nAfter providing this criteria, Bill indicated there were likely 150 companies that were considered mature unicorns and \\~50 of them would meet all of Bill's criteria. Also, Bill indicated there may be other potential targets that are subsidiaries of other companies.\n\nAccording to the World Wide Web, here are the list of some potential unicorns.\n\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies)\n\nSome of the most well known being:\n\n* SPACEX\n* COINBASE\n* BYTEDANCE\n* STRIPE\n* AIRBNB,\n* INSTACART\n* EPIC GAMES\n* Door Dash\n* DJI\n* SHEIN\n* CHIME\n* JUUL\n* ROBINHOOD\n* WISH\n* ARGO\n* TOKOPEDIA\n* SOFI\n\n# The Stripe Conjecture - Initialize Tin Foil Hats\n\nIf you don't want to hear the theories, then stop reading now as this is just going to really summarize many interesting snippets of information that don't necessarily mean anything but are certainly interesting.\n\n* Jackie Reses Stepping down from Square and maintaining a board seat on PSTH\n   * Jackie was the head of capital for square\n   * Stripe just launched Capital\n   * Jackie is a baller and has more big Dick energy than any man, woman or child alive when it comes to finance.\n   * Jackie has liked several PSTH related tweets, but she has also like other tweets about other financial institutions. This might just be purely coincidence.\n   * Why would Jackie step down from Square but retain all her other board seats, including those on Chamanth's SPACS. Is there a conflict of interest?\n* Bill Ackman following Collison Brothers on Twitter, he doesn't even follow the CEO's of all his biggest investments.\n   * Bill only follows 182 people\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Lowes\n   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Chipotle, as far as I can tell - CEO's twitter appears to be private\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Hilton's account, CEO doesn't have twitter as far as I can tell\n   * Bill DOES follow Starbucks CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Agilent CEO\n   * Bill Doesn't follow Howard Hughes companies or leadership as far as I can tell\n* John Collison Following Breadfruit on Twitter (Yolocapitalmgmt)\n   * This dude is a billionaire that is following a WSB degenerate posting conspiracy theories.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spvepib4im361.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=767c5a23b4f64208d9c11d2d27f1e69f040ccf5f\n\n* This dude is one of the original Irish stripe employees.... he has since unfollowed but he was. His name is Brian Delahunty\n* Wells FARGO invested in a PRE LOI SPAC - What the hell?\n* This is the one that I can't figure out. Why in the hell would wells FARGO invest in a shell company if they didn't have any inclination as to the target. HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE? We know that wells fargo and stripe do have a relationship\n* SETH KLARMAN INVESTED IN A PRE LOI SPAC\n   * This is another ODD one. This is basically Seth Klarman saying hey Bill, your Hedge fund can invest my 400 million better than me?????????????? These are two different hedge fund manager and one of them is investing in the other. This is absolutely weird.\n* The size of the SPAC limits targets: why so big Bill???????\n   * Why in the world would Bill limit his options to such a small amount of companies, companies that are typically already backed by big money...... This is another point I can't wrap my head around, why in the world would bill launch a SPAC of this size without having preliminary top level talks. The sheer size of the SPAC is telling, he knew he wanted a whale and if he didn't think he could get one he would've maybe gone with a 2B dollar SPAC with the option to increase to 4B, INSTEAD he went with a 4B SPAC with option to go all the way to 7B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n* Why would the Collison brothers have talks at all with Bill if they didn't intend to go public? The brothers are some smart ass Ginger Snaps and they knew Bill had a giant ass blank check. Many people are saying the Collison brothers will IPO and they don't need Bill... Why waste your time meeting with Bill if SPACing wasn't a possibility and going public wasn't a near term event?\n* Why hasn't Bill or the Collison's denied it\n   * Bloomberg denied rumors within an hour\n   * Airbnb Denied rumors within days\n   * Not a single Denial statement from Collisons or Big Dick Bill.\n* So far only known talks have been between Bloomberg, Airbnb and Stripe. These are all tech plays so we can hopefully expect the final deal is a tech play.\n* Collison Brothers are going for funding at a much higher valuation\n   * Why would they be going for funding, they just got funding in April. Also, it's rumored that Stripe is potentially already profitable.\n* Bill Ackman indicated his biggest regret was missing the boat on Mastercard\n* Bill Ackman is taking a minority stake so the terms are more appealing to unicorns as they can maintain control, raise funding and have large anchor investors that aren't worried about short term gains.\n\n# The ANTITHESIS to the conjecture\n\n* John Collison is trolling - If there was a deal why would John troll.\n* The Collisons just indicated they were not preparing a flotation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kxncd8him361.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c8a4b2a3124c3c781cb634a29bbcf7582275e66\n\n* The Collisons are a freaking darling that can raise private equity whenever they want, they really don't need Bill\n* Jackie Reses has trolled Breadfuit AKA Yolo on twitter\n* STRIPE doesn't need funding\n* Bill Ackman's historical investments are not fintech, why would he start\n* Big Unicorns don't want bill because he is an activist.\n\n# The Risk to Reward\n\n* You need to be aware that this is trading at a 30% premium to asset value. This means that for every share you buy at 26.00, there is only 20.00 of money in the trust being used to acquire the company. This means that we need to land a good company with good terms to justify the premium.\n* This SPAC is huge, it's not likely to quadruple like some of the other spacs.\n   * If a great deal is reached with a real hype company then we might see 35-40 pre merger and 40+ post merger. Otherwise, we will probably see 30-35, depending on the terms.\n* The SPAC has 2 years to make a deal and we are only \\~5 months into this duration. Your money could sit idle for another 18 months.\n* Warrants expire worthless should a deal fail to materialize. This is why I am not specifically buying warrants, although I do expect a deal will materialize.\n\n# Why I invested\n\n* I like Bill Ackman, he gets it done, he is smart, pragmatic and he learns from his mistakes.\n* This is really an investment in Bill, similar to investing in TSLA, it's really an investment in leadership, not so much the product.\n* Bill does have a relationship with some big players and he will land a good deal no matter what. Even if this is not Stripe, I will likely hold everything long term.\n* Tontine structure is appealing and it rewards holders. Google Tontine if you don't know what it is.\n* If they do get Stripe, you are getting Young visionary leadership and frankly I think the Collison's are probably stand up guys. In the back of my mind, I believe that they might SPAC to give the average joe an opportunity to invest; they seem more motivated in building an empire of amazing financial infrastructure products than getting egregious valuations\n* If they Don't get Stripe you are still getting Bill Ackman and Jackie Reses hunting for a company - they are both legends.\n* Anchor investors presented above indicate they are bullish on Bill, not to mention they limit the available float and if it is a epic deal, anchor investors holding will help push price of stock upwards.\n\n# The Plays\n\n* I am only buying commons.\n* For those that want options, I wouldn't buy any options earlier than a march '21 expiration and a 20.00 strike.\n* If I were buying options I would buy June expiration 15.00 strikes.\n* My previous posts outline why I believe just buying common stock is the way to go. Ticker is PSTH.\n\n# MY POSITIONS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My Common Stock](https://preview.redd.it/7ywotz3kim361.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=e66fa3bffd4b93319883bdd3196c7f954479237a)\n\n# TL:DR\n\n* Bill will probably buy Subway and we're all FK'd.\n* Don't buy because it might be stripe, buy because it's Bill and Jackie.\n* Don't buy lotto's as I don't believe this SPAC will react like others.\n* This isn't investing advice.

Baupost is 39% tech but also 34% consumer cyclical, with a scattershot of other stuff. Millennium has a relatively small position compared to the top two or even the pension funds.\n\nI wouldn't categorically say they don't have insider info, but I also don't think it's a silver bullet that indicates a specific sector or company. SPACs are relatively low downside pre-merger, especially in a market that's as inflated as our current level, and if they have faith that Ackman knows how to value a company then they know they'll probably be in a solid position on any target.\n\nSince Ackman is putting in a minimum of $1b of his own fund's money, and an additional few billion on top of that potentially, they probably feel he has a vested interest in seeing it do well. His company portfolio is solid, so they know they're going to get a decent name brand at a decent value for low downside.\n\nBut who knows, there's a lot of gossip in finance and it's possible someone on his team spilled the beans about who the top contenders are for merger.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know that's kind of a non-answer but the truth is no one knows and I don't see the point in trying to guess the target - I just don't like when people push targets that have been debunked to spread hype. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with thinking it's a tech target, just be prepared for a good chance that it's not.

My company has major contracts with Becton Dickinson and Abbott Nutrition. On their individual shipments, they get roughly a 75-90% discount, depending on distance from the home service center. But Becton pays out the ass for us to leave ten empty trailers at their facility at all times and for us to do same day swaps within 4 hours of notifying us that they're ready. They also pay heavily for their one day a week of five scheduled swaps.\n\nAbbott pays significant fees for up to three live unloads at our cross dock per day.\n\nSo while that little bill of lading for your mom's 16\" big black dildo may say they're only paying $1.75 to ship it instead of the standard $17.50, UPS is making their money by being paid to leave equipment on-site for Amazon to load at their leisure.\n\nIn shipping, there is no such thing as a \"loss leader\" because margins are already razor thin.

There are some parts of possible deals with FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Amazon I do not know about but I think what I said is an educated conclusion.  I am really kind of winging this comment so I don't know how coherent and concise it will be. Anyways...\n\nHere's what I do know about UPS and Amazon. It is a huge portion of total packages shipped out, especially through the holiday season. They cost of shipping an Amazon package through the UPS network is a fraction of the cost as packages sent by normal customers. Like you said yourself, margins are already razor thin, so at the very least extreme discounted rates make them even smaller. The most profitable segments for UPS (FedEx as well) is our small businesses. A lot of focus for sales and marketing has shifted in past years from big business to small business be sure of the larger profit margins.\n\nFedEx at at least one point (I think they did it twice though) has dropped out of delivering Amazon packages. I assume this is due to losing money and possibly the additional stress those packages put on their delivery network (their one-time deliveries decreased quite a bit in recent years). Seems odd for them to do that if they had such a 'cherry deal' with Amazon. However, they jumped right back in their deal with Amazon almost immediately. My management has said that the only thing worse than possibly losing money with Amazon, is having the U.S.'s largest retailer work solely with your main competitor. \n\nYou may be right that UPS has some amazing deal with Amazon and they are making a good bit of money. However, it seems more likely that UPS and FedEx are just locked in battle using Amazon to remain in front of customers rather than give any of that edge to the other guy. Also a big point that I do know has circulated through UPS management many times is that we are very afraid of Amazon transitioning into a shipping carrier of their own. They have yet to make it work on a large scale. \n\nBut, UPS and FedEx would be completely screwed if that were to happen so they are proving to Amazon that they are perfectly capable of delivering their packages even if it means they lose a decent chunk of profits to so.\n\nI honestly think it's a combination of UPS getting some sort of Amazon deal in addition to them taking a hit on margins to stay in front of customers and keep Amazon out of their territory.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "FedEx told Amazon to piss up a rope because Amazon was rolling out their own fleet to compete and FedEx is so well diversified in the freight industry they don't need Amazon to be successful.

Their LTL wing was through buying a single national carrier, Overnite Transportation. FedEx bought several small regional carriers along with two national carriers (American Freightways and Watkins).\n\nSo, like I said, you don't know what your talking about.

{"title": "Why your next stock purchase better be HYLN", "selftext": "**I MEANT CALLS FUCK**\n\nMany of you know that the next big move in EV's is who can take the biggest share of the transportation industry. I'm not talking about your mom taking you to the nearest autism center, I'm talking about the transportation of moving your favorite fidget spinner into your Gay Bear hands.\n\n**Why HYLN when Tesla providing trucks soon you fuck???**\n\nVery simple answer, Tesla trucks are nice and all but they have two major limiting factors. \n1.\tThe truck range is only 500 miles (Hyliion's ERX is 1300 miles)\n 2. CHARGING A SEMI IS NOT THE SAME AS CHARGING YOUR MODEL S E X OR Y. \n\nMany reports have come out that state that to charge a tesla truck, it would require revamping entire grids to support those key charging areas. Now imagine when you have to deliver something to bumfuck nowhere, aint gonna be no efficient chargers. The technology just isn't there yet. \n\nhttps://www.greenbiz.com/article/electric-truck-fleets-will-need-lot-power-utilities-arent-planning-it\n\nOk, what does Hyliion do to \"solve\" this problem. Simple. They use natural gas. NATURAL GAS??? WHAT? Yes natural gas. There is already 700+ natural gas stations around the United States, that means that it can easily travel anywhere it needs to, and it is much easier to establish new natural gas stations than it is to revamp electrical grids for tesla chargers, (think of how long its taking to fix flint's water) \n\nAdditionally, it uses an onboard generator under the hood so that when you are driving, IT IS ALSO CHARGING THE BATTERY, this means that the range of a hyliion ERX truck is 1300 miles with an increased payload than Tesla's semi truck. You probably don't know this but many truck companies send out truck drivers in pairs, because of regulations, one drives while the other rests. With tesla trucks you can't do that since it only goes for 500 miles, they would need to stop and charge, while hyliion ERX truck will keep on going.\n\nAlso Hyliion's products are actually net negative carbon emissions. HOW? When cows fart, they give off methane (a pollutant), which is used to create natural gas. As our population grows, more meat eaters, more cows, more methane. Natural gas takes methane out the air and powers shit. Hyliion uses natural gas, that means using hyliion products not only produce clean efficient energy, you are also rapidly removing methane out of the air, a net negative carbon emission.\n\nNow their current amazing product that Hyliion produces is that they  convert the rear axle of EXISITING TRUCKS to electric. Many companies do not want to do the jump in EV because they have already spent millions on their existing trucks. Well that whole market is up for grabs for hyliion because their product will give those existing trucks a 10-30% fuel cost reduction and will give them more torque and power so that when they go up hill, they have a much easier time than now. Additionally they use algorithms to help the driver get the most efficient drive possible and gives them points, think of a mini game for those truckers. \n\n\n**Yo autismo, I just saw their stock and it dipped massively recently, what happened???**\n\nHyliion on November 30th announced that they will redeem their public warrants. Now some people can say that's bad, others say that they are using that extra ~~144 million that they will receive to finish up their infrastructure etc. Either way, do you want to buy on a day its up 50% or do you wanna buy when the stock is red???\n\nNOW IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE STOCK FOR LOW PRICES.\n\nThe stock had a 20-40% short ratio against it in the past week, and it refused to break the $18 support level. It is itching to go up from here once the news of the warrants are settled. \n\nI am in at 100 shares and buying 600 more in the upcoming days NEXT YEAR DATED CALLS\n\nTLDR: YOUR NEXT STOCK PURCHASE BETTER BE HYLIION DO NOT MESS UP ON THE NEXT TESLA TRAIN.

It is also true that even if RNG is technically carbon-negative because it is produced from biomass, like dairy farm waste, that would otherwise decompose releasing methane into the atmosphere, it still produces plenty of nasty particulate matter locally that will find its way into your tender pink little lungs.\n\nTesla will also be facing some major hurdles, when it attempts to disrupt long-haul trucking since the Tesla Semi can only travel half as far on a charge as a conventional diesel-powered semi, with a drastically reduced payload due to the weight of the battery I might add. Also freight logistics would be severely gimped by the long delays required to charge the Tesla semi.\n\nCONCLUSION: The trucking industry will be seriously disrupted when William Li swoops in to install battery swapping stations across the US, so Nio trucks can efficiently ship jelq sticks to your wife's boyfriend.\n\nIs this really the man you're trusting to make you tendies?\n\n[https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-78511753,width-650,imgsize-92526,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-6.jpg](https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-78511753,width-650,imgsize-92526,,resizemode-4,quality-100/untitled-6.jpg)", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Have learned this lesson the hard way every time..never bet against Elon", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ur not betting against him, there’s gonna be more than one EV maker just like there’s more than 1 automobile maker rn lmao.
