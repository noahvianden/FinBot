I‚Äôve been thinking about how to do this ‚Äî by combining 3 concepts: Buffett style investing, Dividend Stocks, and Thetagang. Goal is to create a snowball that continues to grow indefinitely. Half my portfolio is buy and hold (preferably dividend stocks, though not always). Use Wheel on high premium stocks to acquire more Dividend stocks (with Margin as needed). Reinvest Dividends.\n\nFor FI, I can live off dividends + premium. I would bank 6-months expenses and put aside for stability, similar to FIRE strategies. I have two rental properties to hedge some income.  Remember, dividends are tax free under $80K a year (filing married). I like the idea that I can continually acquire stocks indefinitely via thetagang strategies. \n\nUnlike FIRE folks, I do enjoy trading almost daily and watching market news.

To make it easier for you laggards out there. it doesn't matter if TSLA's price hits $1000 they still need over 100million shares. That's ALOT of buying pressure. Here's another blog that allows you to download the excel spread sheets and play with the numbers. I advise you to do so to gain deeper understanding of not only why the statements i am presenting are closer to grounded facts than conjecture. read through it thoroughly if you would like: [Tesla Blog](https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/11/teslas-s-500-inclusion-part-2.html?m=1). I'm going to take a few excerpts from it.\n\n**Fact: They must purchase these shares the day before the day of inclusion** (in this case the 18th).  They also can NOT have done this months prior for it would throw off the precise tracking of the s&p 500 etfs and those following it. And they cannot have done it after for the same reason.\n\nSources: Tesla daily on YouTube:\n\n\\[tesla daily #2\\]([https://youtu.be/ d\\_t4Cmuib6w](https://youtu.be/d_t4Cmuib6w))\n\n\\[1st article \\]([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/teslas-stock-will-be-added-to-the-sp-500-in-a-single-step-before-the-open-on-dec-21.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/teslas-stock-will-be-added-to-the-sp-500-in-a-single-step-before-the-open-on-dec-21.html))\n\n\"The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization **before the open of trading on Dec. 21**, the index provider said.\" That's a vote for the **18th.**\n\n\\[2nd (pay or subscribe wall but scroll and see. i can see it on my laptop not my phone)\\]([https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897))\n\n\"The index company said Tesla will be added to the broad stock-market gauge before the start of trading Dec. 21, meaning most index-tracking funds that follow the S&P 500 will engage in a flurry of trading the Friday before.\" Another vote for the **18th.**\n\nLinked Study(pdf). If it doesn't open, go to google type in 'can a stock be added \"before the inclusion date\" '. 2nd link. Page 10. [Study(page 10)](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/33763/MA-Thesis-Robert-Kaptein.pdf)\n\n\"Index funds try to follow the return of a specific index **as accurate as possible**, therefore they will need to buy the included stock before the actual inclusion takes place. To find the exact moment on which index funds buy the included stocks and sell the excluded stock, Think ETF¬¥s, a Dutch ETF provider was interviewed about their trading procedure in case of an annual review (2016). Martijn Rozemuller, founder and managing director, and Aaron Renkers, fund manager, confirmed that Think ETF¬¥s ideally buys the included stocks at the **market close of the day before the actual review takes place.** Index fund providers need to make sure that that they have the **included stocks before the inclusion day in order to prevent the risk of not completely following the index. Therefore index funds buy in the period before the inclusion date and at the latest at the market close of the last day before the index inclusion.** Therefore one would expect an upward price pattern in the days before the inclusion, and vice versa for exclusions.  \"\n\nI previously thought it could be done 3 days before and after the inclusion date, but i cannot find any evidence indicating this, so i will leave it out. but this makes it pretty clear that the 18th is the big day where over 100 million shares need to be bought. so don't be fooled by naysayers or those who seek to gain something by telling you its another day or its already have been bought. now you can clearly see they are fools, who are ignorant of the truth. Now I will not count out illegal activity because lets be honest, this is wallstreet fellow degenerates. But all funds buying before in liquid accounts this big to alleve buying pressure? likelihood is low,(and that it doesn't get caught) but there will always be those anomalies.\n\n**Fact: The 5 billion Offering was less than 1% of the company's current value.** This lowered the selling pressure a bit But not much.\n\n\" With Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization at $598 billion, the new offering represents less than 1% of the company‚Äôs value. \" [CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html)\n\nSo I think I've made the landscape pretty clear for this upcoming week.

And don't believe the b.s. people are pushing without sources to back it up.\n\nEDIT: thanks to u/psycobusa who brought up an excellent point, and i did some research it seems if you have any 12/18 calls they will expire worthless seeing as how the funds usually buy AFTER MARKET CLOSE on the day they have to add(thats friday)!!

{"title": "Quantum Scape is about to take a Quantum Dump (QS)", "selftext": "Alright you *shrimp-dick fuck nuggets*, listen up because we‚Äôre making fucking tendies. QS or QuantumScape has been seeing crazy momentum in the market recently. They are trading at around 63, but I think this is going to absolutely DUMP on December 21st and possibly longer.\n\nSo let‚Äôs look at Quantum Scape, they are a battery company that merged with KCAC (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp), and what is even more interesting, is that Volkswagen has been invested and partnered with this company since 2012.  \n\nAccording to this source\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/)\n\n‚ÄúVolkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million this year.‚Äù *Pay attention to the 200 million this year, it may be very big, but we will come back to that at the very end.* \n\nThe same article states the following, ‚ÄúQuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors including **Fidelity Management & Research Company** and **Janus Transaction**‚Äù\n\nSo we see 500 million of 700 million dollars are from PIPE shares. Here‚Äôs the part where our dick go a slack 2.5in, to firm 3in‚Ä¶\n\n**Pipe shares can be sold after a certain amount of time**, and we all know what happens when massive sell off‚Äôs happen.  \n\nAccording to the Registration Statement published by the SEC about Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, ‚ÄúPursuant to the Subscription Agreements, Kensington **agreed** that, **within 15 business days** after the Closing (the ‚ÄúFiling Deadline‚Äù), Kensington will **file** **with** the SEC (at Kensington‚Äôs sole cost and expense) a registration statement **registering the resale** of the PIPE Shares.‚Äù\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520290474/d14810ds4a.htm\n\nLet‚Äôs break down what this means exactly because the language can be confusing (at least it was to me at first because I‚Äôm retarded, why else am I here?).\n\nThere is a 15 day countdown starting AFTER their closing day, this was Nov 27th when they officially merged, which was a Friday. Because this 15 day ‚Äúcountdown‚Äù only includes business days, that means the countdown actually starts the following Monday, Nov 30th, since that is the next business day that follows the closing day. Now, during this countdown Kensington will file WITH the SEC a ‚Äúregistration statement registering the resale of PIPE shares‚Äù. So this registration statement will register the shares to be sold. Now, the word ‚Äúregister‚Äù for the resale of the shares may sound ambiguous. Does it mean they now have the potential to be sold, but maybe on a different day? Does this registration mean they CAN IN FACT be sold once they‚Äôre registered? Well this next piece of info will be useful to understand, hopefully making your smooth marble brains get some fucking wrinkles.  \n\n‚ÄúSince this offering was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC.¬†**However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders**.‚Äù *(We will get to the importance of the bolded area at the end)*\n\nSource: \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:\\~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders).\n\n‚ÄúOnce the SEC declares the registration statement effective, the PIPE investors are then generally able to freely resell their shares in the trading market.‚Äù\n\n[https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf](https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf)\n\nYou might ask ‚ÄúIs there a lock up for these PIPE shares?‚Äù And the answer to that is that it is contingent on whether or not the resale registration statement is *effective* or not. So far as I can tell (once again, am retarded), at the end of the 15 day countdown, it‚Äôs merely a countdown to have a resale registration agreement written up in general, not necessarily an effective one.  \n\nHowever, from the same SEC document it states ‚ÄúKensington is separately required at all times to maintain an **effective** resale registration statement for the benefit of the Holders.‚Äù\n\nSo, now we know they have to make this registration AND they have to do it in a 15 business day period. With some math we can figure out exactly what day PIPE shares can be sold off. I‚Äôm not going to talk down to you autists, even though you‚Äôre retarded, but 15 business days after November 30th is December 18th. But December 18th is the fifteenth day of the countdown, so it can‚Äôt be sold then. Keep in mind that December 18th is a Friday also, so we can expect a BLOODY RED MONDAY for QS if they are going to sell their PIPE shares. Now that‚Äôs a big IF.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at just how much PIPE shares make up of the total shares.  \n\nFrom the same SEC document‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòPIPE‚Äô means the sale of PIPE Shares to the Subscribers, for a purchase price of **$10.00 per share** and an **aggregate purchase price of $500¬†million**, in a private placement.‚Äù\n\nSo what we are looking at is 50 million shares potentially sold off on Monday the 18th. How much is this in reality?\n\nWell according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings)\n\nTheir outstanding shares right now are 189 million. This means that these pipe shares make up 26.5% of ALL of QS‚Äôs shares. If we were to see a sell off of this amount, the value of QS would plunder to such an inconceivable amount we could walk away with major tendies.\n\nNow the question is‚Ä¶.are they going to sell their shares? Well if we take a look at WHO bought these PIPE shares, we can most likely answer that. Fidelity and Janus are both investment companies who are involved in mutual funds and have clients that they make money for. Because these pipe shares were valued at 10 dollar each, while also looking at QS‚Äôs current price. They are currently up 600%+ with 50 million shares‚Ä¶would you take that profit?\n\nNot only that, but the discussion of the ‚ÄúSPAC bubble‚Äù has been trending for a few weeks now. As we know, SPAC‚Äôs have been huge this year, and the ‚ÄúSPAC bubble‚Äù is the fear of overvaluing company‚Äôs that IPO in mass quantities which results in a huge crash later on.  \n\nDo you think Fidelity hasn‚Äôt heard of this? Why would Fidelity and Janus take a risk of getting more money when they are up 600%+ AND they have clients to look after? The fact of the matter is, is they won‚Äôt take this risk, the amount of money gained and any potential of a SPAC bubble popping would have any investor taking profits ASAP.\n\nNow, there were two things I mentioned in the post that I would discuss now. That is Volkswagens involvement in QS and this quote \n\n‚ÄúHowever, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.‚Äù\n\nIn regards to Volkswagen, they have been involved with QS since 2012, they could potentially have shares that they want to sell. They also gave 200 million dollars this year, could this be the purchasing of PIPE shares? Who knows‚Ä¶.I sure as fuck don‚Äôt, but the potential of more shares being sold from another company involved in QS is something that is good for this. If not, it doesn‚Äôt matter all that much given the other information, since it still stands true with or without Volkswagens involvement.\n\nNow, in regards to the quote mentioned before, it could be the case that on December 21st, only 20% of the 50 million shares that Fidelity and Janus hold will be sold. Even so, 20% of 50 million is still 10 million shares or around 5.3% of the outstanding shares that QS has.  \n\nIn conclusion, I think we are looking at a great opportunity to make tendies boys.  \n\nTLDR; Eat grass, smoke ass, short QS, make tendies\n\nPositions to get in on: Dec 24 50p \n\nYou could go further expiration, or you could go further OTM. Who am I kidding though, you idiots are gonna grab FD‚Äôs.
