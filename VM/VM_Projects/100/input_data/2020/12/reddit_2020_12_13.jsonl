In a sign that bodes well for Tesla, 14 of the 15 stocks that have been added to the S&P 500 so far this year have seen their share price move higher since joining the index, including Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER), and Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR).\nThere are currently over $11.2 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500, with roughly $4.6 trillion of the total in indexed funds, meaning significant portfolio adjustments will have to be made to accommodate Tesla.\nAccording to Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, that could result in $80 billion worth of Tesla shares having to be bought by index investors.\nDespite strong gains and lofty valuations, we anticipate the bump in demand resulting from its S&P 500 index inclusion will likely push TSLA stock even higher in the coming week.\n\n\n\n>\t\n\n\nThe one to sell is GameStop", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "After you pasted that the page loads for me.

If they think a bigger move is happening (like near earnings), the premium will be higher and you have to have the stock move higher than the strike + premium by expiration to make money, although you can make money way before expiration if the stock has a big movement (hard to predict)\n3. time decay means that every day, your option loses some amount of value.  of course, if there is a big enough movement, this will counteract the cost of time decay.  however, this is the reason to buy long dated options (LEAPs) instead of short term options\n\nOf course you can hold some stock and buy some calls if you really want to play some options, but I'd suggest only spending money on options that you can afford to lose (the same is true for stock, but doubly so for options).", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate your breakdown.

{"title": "Challenging FIRE with Theta", "selftext": "Working on my goal to retire in 5 years, but if you spend any time on the FIRE-related subs (FIRE = Financial Independence Retire Early), they mostly preach a SWR (SWR = Safe Withdrawal Rate) of 3% to 4%, depending on which sub you're on, which then requires a portfolio of 30-ish times your desired allowance. Substitute in whatever reason you want, here (I hate my job, I'm impatient, trading using thetagang = retirement and I'm ok with \"working\" a couple hours a week, etc.), but I'm wondering about a DIFFERENT philosophy, maybe call it FIRESOFT (Financial Independence, Retire Early, Supplemented by Options Focusing on Theta).

Thinking through the requirements, and PLEASE feel free to add to this list:\n\n1.

{"title": "TSLA to the moon! Part 2 (the DD)", "selftext": "I'm making this post because I'm tired of the misinformation and lack of understanding. So? Time to break out the big boy thesis: Tesla is going to the moon,or atleast minimum $700.\n\nPlease see my first post about what I'm doing--> [TSLA to the moon! Part 1(the non DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbyju1/tsla_to_the_moon_part_1_the_non_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (if you curious)\n\n**Fact: Tracking & benchmarked Funds have to purchase over 100million of tesla shares.**\n\n\\-to help illustrate this point see rob's video [Tesla Daily](https://youtu.be/QgCt2LRUj0k?t=248) it illustrates the need for shares, how many, and why exactly the price isnt going to change the number much. To make it easier for you laggards out there. it doesn't matter if TSLA's price hits $1000 they still need over 100million shares. That's ALOT of buying pressure. Here's another blog that allows you to download the excel spread sheets and play with the numbers. I advise you to do so to gain deeper understanding of not only why the statements i am presenting are closer to grounded facts than conjecture. read through it thoroughly if you would like: [Tesla Blog](https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/11/teslas-s-500-inclusion-part-2.html?m=1). I'm going to take a few excerpts from it.\n\n**Fact: They must purchase these shares the day before the day of inclusion** (in this case the 18th).  They also can NOT have done this months prior for it would throw off the precise tracking of the s&p 500 etfs and those following it. And they cannot have done it after for the same reason.\n\nSources: Tesla daily on YouTube:\n\n\\[tesla daily #2\\]([https://youtu.be/ d\\_t4Cmuib6w](https://youtu.be/d_t4Cmuib6w))\n\n\\[1st article \\]([https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/teslas-stock-will-be-added-to-the-sp-500-in-a-single-step-before-the-open-on-dec-21.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/teslas-stock-will-be-added-to-the-sp-500-in-a-single-step-before-the-open-on-dec-21.html))\n\n\"The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization **before the open of trading on Dec. 21**, the index provider said.\" That's a vote for the **18th.**\n\n\\[2nd (pay or subscribe wall but scroll and see. i can see it on my laptop not my phone)\\]([https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-enter-s-p-500-at-full-weight-in-december-11606780897))\n\n\"The index company said Tesla will be added to the broad stock-market gauge before the start of trading Dec. 21, meaning most index-tracking funds that follow the S&P 500 will engage in a flurry of trading the Friday before.\" Another vote for the **18th.**\n\nLinked Study(pdf). If it doesn't open, go to google type in 'can a stock be added \"before the inclusion date\" '. 2nd link. Page 10. [Study(page 10)](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/33763/MA-Thesis-Robert-Kaptein.pdf)\n\n\"Index funds try to follow the return of a specific index **as accurate as possible**, therefore they will need to buy the included stock before the actual inclusion takes place. To find the exact moment on which index funds buy the included stocks and sell the excluded stock, Think ETF´s, a Dutch ETF provider was interviewed about their trading procedure in case of an annual review (2016). Martijn Rozemuller, founder and managing director, and Aaron Renkers, fund manager, confirmed that Think ETF´s ideally buys the included stocks at the **market close of the day before the actual review takes place.** Index fund providers need to make sure that that they have the **included stocks before the inclusion day in order to prevent the risk of not completely following the index. Therefore index funds buy in the period before the inclusion date and at the latest at the market close of the last day before the index inclusion.** Therefore one would expect an upward price pattern in the days before the inclusion, and vice versa for exclusions.  \"\n\nI previously thought it could be done 3 days before and after the inclusion date, but i cannot find any evidence indicating this, so i will leave it out. but this makes it pretty clear that the 18th is the big day where over 100 million shares need to be bought. so don't be fooled by naysayers or those who seek to gain something by telling you its another day or its already have been bought. now you can clearly see they are fools, who are ignorant of the truth. Now I will not count out illegal activity because lets be honest, this is wallstreet fellow degenerates. But all funds buying before in liquid accounts this big to alleve buying pressure? likelihood is low,(and that it doesn't get caught) but there will always be those anomalies.\n\n**Fact: The 5 billion Offering was less than 1% of the company's current value.** This lowered the selling pressure a bit But not much.\n\n\" With Tesla’s market capitalization at $598 billion, the new offering represents less than 1% of the company’s value. \" [CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html)\n\nSo I think I've made the landscape pretty clear for this upcoming week. If I've missed anything please let me know so I can update this. Thanks for reading!\n\nTLDR: Tesla is mooning, hop on board. And don't believe the b.s. people are pushing without sources to back it up.\n\nEDIT: thanks to u/psycobusa who brought up an excellent point, and i did some research it seems if you have any 12/18 calls they will expire worthless seeing as how the funds usually buy AFTER MARKET CLOSE on the day they have to add(thats friday)!! (those fuckers). SO i will be rolling my 12/18 calls to 12/24 to profit and hopefully the dump monday morning isn't too bad so i can get mine off at 9:30 sharp!

{"title": "Quantum Scape is about to take a Quantum Dump (QS)", "selftext": "Alright you *shrimp-dick fuck nuggets*, listen up because we’re making fucking tendies. QS or QuantumScape has been seeing crazy momentum in the market recently. They are trading at around 63, but I think this is going to absolutely DUMP on December 21st and possibly longer.\n\nSo let’s look at Quantum Scape, they are a battery company that merged with KCAC (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp), and what is even more interesting, is that Volkswagen has been invested and partnered with this company since 2012.  \n\nAccording to this source\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/)\n\n“Volkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million this year.” *Pay attention to the 200 million this year, it may be very big, but we will come back to that at the very end.* \n\nThe same article states the following, “QuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors including **Fidelity Management & Research Company** and **Janus Transaction**”\n\nSo we see 500 million of 700 million dollars are from PIPE shares. Here’s the part where our dick go a slack 2.5in, to firm 3in…\n\n**Pipe shares can be sold after a certain amount of time**, and we all know what happens when massive sell off’s happen.  \n\nAccording to the Registration Statement published by the SEC about Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, “Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, Kensington **agreed** that, **within 15 business days** after the Closing (the “Filing Deadline”), Kensington will **file** **with** the SEC (at Kensington’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement **registering the resale** of the PIPE Shares.”\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811414/000119312520290474/d14810ds4a.htm\n\nLet’s break down what this means exactly because the language can be confusing (at least it was to me at first because I’m retarded, why else am I here?).\n\nThere is a 15 day countdown starting AFTER their closing day, this was Nov 27th when they officially merged, which was a Friday. Because this 15 day “countdown” only includes business days, that means the countdown actually starts the following Monday, Nov 30th, since that is the next business day that follows the closing day. Now, during this countdown Kensington will file WITH the SEC a “registration statement registering the resale of PIPE shares”. So this registration statement will register the shares to be sold. Now, the word “register” for the resale of the shares may sound ambiguous. Does it mean they now have the potential to be sold, but maybe on a different day? Does this registration mean they CAN IN FACT be sold once they’re registered? Well this next piece of info will be useful to understand, hopefully making your smooth marble brains get some fucking wrinkles.  \n\n“Since this offering was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC. **However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders**.” *(We will get to the importance of the bolded area at the end)*\n\nSource: \n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:\\~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp#:~:text=Since%20this%20offering%20was%20a,prior%20approval%20from%20current%20shareholders).\n\n“Once the SEC declares the registration statement effective, the PIPE investors are then generally able to freely resell their shares in the trading market.”\n\n[https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf](https://www.paulhastings.com/docs/default-source/PDFs/715.pdf)\n\nYou might ask “Is there a lock up for these PIPE shares?” And the answer to that is that it is contingent on whether or not the resale registration statement is *effective* or not. So far as I can tell (once again, am retarded), at the end of the 15 day countdown, it’s merely a countdown to have a resale registration agreement written up in general, not necessarily an effective one.  \n\nHowever, from the same SEC document it states “Kensington is separately required at all times to maintain an **effective** resale registration statement for the benefit of the Holders.”\n\nSo, now we know they have to make this registration AND they have to do it in a 15 business day period. With some math we can figure out exactly what day PIPE shares can be sold off. I’m not going to talk down to you autists, even though you’re retarded, but 15 business days after November 30th is December 18th. But December 18th is the fifteenth day of the countdown, so it can’t be sold then. Keep in mind that December 18th is a Friday also, so we can expect a BLOODY RED MONDAY for QS if they are going to sell their PIPE shares. Now that’s a big IF.\n\nLet’s take a look at just how much PIPE shares make up of the total shares.  \n\nFrom the same SEC document…\n\n“‘PIPE’ means the sale of PIPE Shares to the Subscribers, for a purchase price of **$10.00 per share** and an **aggregate purchase price of $500 million**, in a private placement.”\n\nSo what we are looking at is 50 million shares potentially sold off on Monday the 18th. How much is this in reality?\n\nWell according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qs/institutional-holdings)\n\nTheir outstanding shares right now are 189 million. This means that these pipe shares make up 26.5% of ALL of QS’s shares. If we were to see a sell off of this amount, the value of QS would plunder to such an inconceivable amount we could walk away with major tendies.\n\nNow the question is….are they going to sell their shares? Well if we take a look at WHO bought these PIPE shares, we can most likely answer that. Fidelity and Janus are both investment companies who are involved in mutual funds and have clients that they make money for. Because these pipe shares were valued at 10 dollar each, while also looking at QS’s current price. They are currently up 600%+ with 50 million shares…would you take that profit?\n\nNot only that, but the discussion of the “SPAC bubble” has been trending for a few weeks now. As we know, SPAC’s have been huge this year, and the “SPAC bubble” is the fear of overvaluing company’s that IPO in mass quantities which results in a huge crash later on.  \n\nDo you think Fidelity hasn’t heard of this? Why would Fidelity and Janus take a risk of getting more money when they are up 600%+ AND they have clients to look after? The fact of the matter is, is they won’t take this risk, the amount of money gained and any potential of a SPAC bubble popping would have any investor taking profits ASAP.\n\nNow, there were two things I mentioned in the post that I would discuss now. That is Volkswagens involvement in QS and this quote \n\n“However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.”\n\nIn regards to Volkswagen, they have been involved with QS since 2012, they could potentially have shares that they want to sell. They also gave 200 million dollars this year, could this be the purchasing of PIPE shares? Who knows….I sure as fuck don’t, but the potential of more shares being sold from another company involved in QS is something that is good for this. If not, it doesn’t matter all that much given the other information, since it still stands true with or without Volkswagens involvement.\n\nNow, in regards to the quote mentioned before, it could be the case that on December 21st, only 20% of the 50 million shares that Fidelity and Janus hold will be sold. Even so, 20% of 50 million is still 10 million shares or around 5.3% of the outstanding shares that QS has.  \n\nIn conclusion, I think we are looking at a great opportunity to make tendies boys.  \n\nTLDR; Eat grass, smoke ass, short QS, make tendies\n\nPositions to get in on: Dec 24 50p \n\nYou could go further expiration, or you could go further OTM. Who am I kidding though, you idiots are gonna grab FD’s.

Their investors wouldn’t profit at all especially since QS seems to be a very solid long term play and there is a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now.\nVolkswagen has for sure zero interest in selling shares, their investment in QS is due to an operative interest not an investment interest. Volkswagen partnered with QS and relies on their battery technology.  \n\nIf your speculation about the possible start date for the sales is correct the only thing that might happen is a fractional sell off to lock in some profits, which will cause a even higher buying pressure from investors who are waiting to get in.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "If anything.
