If everyone uses doves and stamped letters for mail but one company decides to use email then in the long run the whole society adopting more efficient higher technological quality communication measures will only lead to a better world - like the internet. More companies switching to vehicles that eat sunlight and don’t need oil and have a million mile engine life range, will only lead to better efficiency. \n\nYes, if I had invested $10,000 last year in December I would have more than $80000 for a nice Tesla. 500%+ growth in one year is excellent. \n\nI suspect Tesla has 100% more growth in 2021 before it stabilizes and begins improving the PE ratio by finally reaching the technological innovations necessary to build solar powered electric autonomous vehicles at a level the public can benefit from. \n\nRight now only about 2% can afford a Tesla yet the vehicle is subsidized by the government so the public pays so that 2% of the most wealthy can spend $50,000 to $100,000 on a luxury vehicle that 100% of the population pay for. That $25,000 Tesla that has 1 million mile lifetime battery life range, 500 mile range for a one hour break, 4 door serene quiet luxury with self-driving capabilities will be what ends internal combustion engines - it will be what internal combustion engines were to horses. And Tesla is showing the competence to actually achieve that goal. \n\nTesla is Elon’s only public company - SpaceX, StarLink, Neuralink, the Boring company, are private and they all have synergetic effects. Their achievements help each other. \n\nI am 100% planning on having a Tesla.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "10 miles is 16.09 km", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I'm going to hold on to my 1 share of Tesla.

That being said, I always saw what was happening here in the background, but my lack of investing experience put me off. This was until I saw what happened around the split which was the main catalyst to move some of what I had into Tesla in early September.

I was clearly trying to time the market and I had yet to learn that time in the market trumps timing the market.\n\nThankfully (I think), battery day didn't have as much of an immediate impact on the stock price as some may have predicated, so I stayed invested through the more gradual rise. I eventually changed my strategy again - this time it was a combination of not wanting to miss out on potential rises like I had in 2020 and knowing what Tesla had ahead of itself. Nothing is certain, but it sounds like there's an exciting and promising future ahead.

( [TSLA](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=TSLA) \n\n📷Loading...) Chief Executive Elon Musk is set to be interviewed during The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council annual summit following a highly successful year for the electric-vehicle maker that, despite the coronavirus pandemic, has secured a place on the S&P 500 index as its shares skyrocket.\n\nIn an interview scheduled Tuesday with the Journal's editor in chief, Matt Murray, Mr. Musk is expected to address how the Covid-19 crisis threatened Tesla's ability to meet production targets and whether Silicon Valley is losing its status as a global center of technology innovation.\n\nStartup executives and employees have fled the San Francisco Bay Area for cheaper locales since the pandemic has led to remote working conditions. Last week, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whose origins trace back to the founding of Silicon Valley, has said it plans to shift its headquarters to Texas. The exodus has led many tech leaders and industry watchers to question whether the geographic region is losing relevance as a tech hub.\n\nMr. Musk threatened to move Tesla's operations out of California while sparring with authorities there in May, after local shelter-in-place orders required him to shut down his lone U.S. car factory as part of measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. He criticized local officials as \"breaking people's freedoms\" by imposing the curbs.\n\nThe auto executive later filed a lawsuit against Alameda County, home of the Tesla factory, and defied local authorities by proceeding to reopen the plant, daring them to arrest him. The county eventually blessed the plant's reopening and didn't arrest Mr. Musk.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott told CNBC over the summer that Mr. Musk now had a Texas driver's license, suggesting the CEO has become part of the Silicon Valley exodus. Texas has no state income tax, and Mr. Musk this year qualified for billions of dollars in stock-option compensation as part of a pay package agreement. Mr. Musk filed paperwork in late October to move his personal foundation from California to Austin, Texas, according to local records. The move was previously reported by Bloomberg.\n\nTesla also said earlier this year that it would build a new car plant in Austin, its second in the U.S. and first outside Silicon Valley. It is slated to start production cars next year. The auto maker said Tuesday that it would raise up to $5 billion through new sales of stock, the second time this year it is raising that amount of money to finance its expansion plans.\n\nMr. Musk's other big company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, also has operations in Texas.\n\nSpaceX launched four astronauts into orbit last month, marking the company's first full-fledged operational mission with humans on board and beginning regularly scheduled commercial flights to the International Space Station.\n\nTesla, despite a temporary factory closure early in the pandemic, is\n\n\\--on pace to deliver around 500,000 cars this year, or roughly 36% more than last year. It is also on track to achieve its first full calendar year of profitability after posting a record profit of $331 million in the third quarter.

Long time to the date?  More expensive.  Date is tomorrow and we are far away? Basically worthless, etc.\n\nYou profit anytime the price of the option is worth more than you bought it for or less than you sold it for, same as a stock.  Additionally, you profit if the price of the stock on the expiration date is more (or less) than the price you paid (or sold) for the option + the strike of the option.\n\nFor instance, you paid 20.00 for a 650 call option, the price is now 680/share.  If the price is above 650 + 20 = 670/share which it is, you can exercise your option, buy at 650, and then sell at the current 680 and make 30/share - the 20/share you paid for the option and make a guaranteed 10/share.\n\nNormally, you do not hold till expiration or exercise an option, you simply sell one you bought or buy back one you sold at a profit (or loss) before the expiration date when it goes in your favor.  The reason for this is, options are a means to provide leverage.  That 10/share guaranteed profit sounds pretty nice, but if the stock price is 680 2 weeks before the expiry date, your option may very well be worth 30/option.  A 30 dollar price vs you paying 20 is a 50% ROI.  10 dollar profit on a 650/share is much lower ROI.\n\nBasically, since options cost less than the stock (almost always true), the rise in them means a higher percentage gain than the rise the stock made to get the option price to rise.\n\nYou can buy or sell call and put options.

So a Call with a price of $800 on Jan. 2023 means even if the share price is $2,000 in 2023, you can buy 100 shares at $800 a piece. You have to pay a price up front for that 'option' though. So if the cost of 1 Call option is $200, and all option contracts are for 100 shares, it would be $20,000 up front to hold the contract. If you have to pay $800 per share to buy them in the future, and $200 per share to buy the Call option, it would need to be above $1,000 to make a profit. If it's not, the option will expire and you lose the money it cost to buy the contract up front.\n\nBy comparison though, at $650, it would be $65,000 to buy 100 shares of Tesla at todays price.

(“Tesla”) entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, SG Americas Securities, LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents (each, a “Sales Agent” and collectively, the “Sales Agents”), to sell shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Tesla (the “Common Stock”) having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $5.0 billion (the “Shares”), from time to time, through an “at-the-market” offering program (the “Offering”).\nUpon delivery of a placement notice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Sales Agents will use reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations, and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market to sell the Shares from time to time based upon Tesla’s instructions for the sales, including any price, time or size limits specified by Tesla. Under the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Sales Agents may sell the Shares by any method permitted by law, including in ordinary brokers’ transactions, in negotiated transactions, in block trades, and in transactions that are deemed to be an “at-the-market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Sales Agents’ obligations to sell the Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including customary closing conditions.\nThe Equity Distribution Agreement provides that the Sales Agents will be entitled to compensation for their services in the form of a commission of up to 0.25% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of the Shares, and Tesla has agreed to reimburse the Sales Agents for certain specified expenses. Tesla has also agreed to provide the Sales Agents with customary indemnification and contribution rights. Tesla is not obligated to sell any Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement. The Equity Distribution Agreement may be terminated by Tesla at any time by giving written notice to the Sales Agents for any reason or by each Sales Agent at any time, with respect to such Sales Agent only, by giving written notice to Tesla for any reason or immediately under certain circumstances, including but not limited to the occurrence of a material adverse change in the company. The Offering of the Shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Equity Distribution Agreement by Tesla or the Sales Agents.\nThe sales and issuances of the Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement will be made pursuant to Tesla’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-231168) (the “Registration Statement”) declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 2, 2019. On the date hereof, Tesla intends to file a prospectus supplement with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nThe foregoing description of the Equity Distribution Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThis Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities under the Equity Distribution Agreement, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nCopyright © 2020 Benzinga (BZ Newswire, http://www.benzinga.com/licensing).

I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you’re boarding a rocket).  I'm holding the all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I’ll know pretty soon.  \n\nI know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.\n\nAnd then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen’s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that’s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you’re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the “Chewy-fication” of GameStop – efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.\n\nAnd if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn’t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn’t like Sherman’s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he’s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He’s saying: Don’t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.\n\nAnd the “or else” is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the “or else” is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn’t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman’s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it’s done. He’s got the eye of the tiger, he’s still in that young and crushing it phase. He’s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he’s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He’s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30M. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.\n\nThen take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company—the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!). And he knows that he’s going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \\*him\\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn’t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.\n\nAnd this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It’s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call – one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it’s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you’re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?\n\nOr do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don’t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It’s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I’m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman’s incentives – financial, ego – point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn’t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that’s coming to him. But even though I’d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I’m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren’t hard see here.  We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits. \n\nThis is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "This just convinced me to load up on more shares\n\nGonna be a hell of a ride, but fuck it, this saga is way too interesting to be on the sidelines", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holy crap you wrote a lot.

{"title": "PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor - Update 12/8", "selftext": "So I did an update 4 days ago telling you why PLTR at 22 was the short term bottom,\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr\\_technical\\_analysis\\_from\\_a\\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)\n\nnow I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, we are replicating the movements made by Nio in the first phase of its run-up. We had the initial run up from about $5/share to $16 and then a fall and consolidation to about $10. It then subsequently moved up to about $15 giving the illusion of a double top and trapping all the bears when it then fell to $12 before rocketing up to $20.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2q9pv3310461.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4617e401f9dbbfc32d1e925972834c40306f529\n\nAgain, chart looks the same as Tesla in the transition from the first run-up to the second run-up. You had a short term top at around 185, a drop to 68 (much higher fib retracement likely due to more short seller interests being accumulated at this point), recovery to around 170 and then a small drop to 150 before the next leg up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eguhknb1k0461.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7b8c5f61d6197e949a76d7be1b039feaa307f8f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a similar way, expect consolidation for a couple of days and a near term bottom of around 23-26 before the next leg moves up. If we go by Nio, expect a target of $41-45 over the next 2-3 weeks. So get out of your 12/11 weekly calls now, those won't pay out and will likely just eat theta.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wemw3ofszz361.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3d6ba992b74ea6260ff956ba5c2dc300a5f8cf\n\nOption convexity is also sort of at a mid point between the lows achieved on 12/2 and the extremes exhibited on 11/25, which tells you we are sort of nowhere near a short term bottom or a short term top.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlpdfz1hzz361.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2d7e5841e6d5517b4c93d3e2d5182a26e392b12\n\nI did not bother playing this expected short term volatility as I bought 1/15 calls at the $22 low. But you'll probably get another chance at it if we see PLTR at the 24-26 range.\n\n**TLDR: roll out your 12/11 options, bet on 12/25 options at the earliest, best strikes are 25-35. Cashout at least 2/3 if PLTR hits $41-44.Don't be surprised if we have a couple more down 10% days this week to burn out the 12/11s.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate1 (2:25PM): Rising wedge developing on the 5 minutes, don't be surprised by some big drops in the coming couple of days. Good time to build position.\n\nUpdate 2 (11:00AM): had a initial drop. Got a another rising wedge. We are going below 27 today and probably bottom about 24-26. I doubt we’ll move too much above 25 until next week. Again the 12/11s will expire worthless\n \nUpdate 3 (10:45AM): we likely bottomed at 25.2. We had a double bottom this morning at 25.7. There is still a small chance maybe we'll drop down to 23-24, but its pretty unlikely at this point. We'll be somewhat range bound between 26-27 until next week when the full run-up will start.", "id": "k98p6h", "created_utc": 1607448926.0, "score": 635, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 317, "comments": [{"body": "Tldr: just hold onto your shares.", "score": 472, "replies": [{"body": "OP, are you telling me I'm going to have high class prostitute money soon?\n\nI'm tired of the street walkers, if you fall asleep anywhere near them, they steal your tendies.", "score": 109, "replies": [{"body": "you got any organs for sale?", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "I do have a couple of unexplained scars...", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "*China has entered the chat*", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You could get an elite quality whore for 1k.

{"title": "GME Q3 Call Thoughts on the clash between Cohen and Sherman [Insert Rocket Emoji Here]", "selftext": "I posted this on stocktwits and in another comment thread, but given the feedback I've received, I thought I would create a new post to let this august community think Deep Thoughts about all of this as we approach the moment of truth.  I'm not a social media guy so I usually don't get how all this shit works - just a 40-year-old lawyer who hates his job and sees a ticket out.  Do your own DD and figure your own shit out.  But the time is drawing nigh here for GME.\n\nI know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. \n\nBut first take Cohen. \n\nBoy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.\n\nAnd then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen’s Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that’s early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you’re right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the “Chewy-fication” of GameStop – efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.\n\nAnd if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn’t like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn’t like Sherman’s focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he’s made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He’s saying: Don’t you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.\n\nAnd the “or else” is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the “or else” is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn’t do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman’s fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it’s done. He’s got the eye of the tiger, he’s still in that young and crushing it phase. He’s got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he’s going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He’s watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30B. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.\n\nThen take Sherman. \n\nDude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company—the moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!) this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \\*him\\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn’t know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.\n\nAnd this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It’s go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call – one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle. So it’s a gimmie on numbers anyway. What self-respecting Master of the Universe hired gun Boomer CEO would just wilt under this pressure and fail to give every possible piece of good news to try to show shareholders his worth? The wolf is at the door and wants you in the unemployment line because you’re out of touch. Do you go quietly into the night?\n\nOr do you give this punk-ass Millennial Start Up Bro a lesson that You Don’t Mess With the Shermanator? It would be an extraordinary act of self-sabotage if Sherman gave some cagy milquetoast guidance along with some middling Q3 numbers. It’s almost unthinkable. If GameStop has something good to talk about tomorrow, I’m guessing we hear all about it loud and clear. All Sherman’s incentives – financial, ego – point to him trying to knock it out of the park with Q4 guidance. If Sherman doesn’t take this golden opportunity to show his worth and start this squeeze, he deserves everything that’s coming to him. But even though I’d jump at the chance to see Cohen at the helm long term, I’m guessing he gives it his all since the possible outcomes aren’t hard see here. We will know soon if Sherman is a dead man walking or the temporary Hero and Savior of Gamestock, first of his name. And all the while, Mr. Moneybags Ecommerce Boy Genius watches and waits.\n\nThis is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.\n\nEDIT:  After that call and the shelf, Sherman clearly deserves none of the credit I gave him here.  The company is solid and will be fine and everyone with shares and April calls should be AOK.  Lots of positive stuff.  But Sherman miscalculated horribly with the shelf.  Cohen is going to rip Sherman's fucking heart out and make him watch, Temple of Doom Style.  This is when things start to get interesting.\n\nEDIT 2:  In light of recent events, I would like to amend my last two paragraphs.  I will leave the first three sentences and then conclude with the amount of credit I should have given this greedy shortsighted, dumbfuck Boomer.\n\n\"And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen’s attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has.  So Sherman decides that instead of carefully considering Cohen's critiques and then bolstering his case to lead this company by buying back shares (as authorized) or giving better guidance on Q4 to possibly raise the share price and even trigger a short squeeze, delighting shareholders far and wide and even making them feel a sense of loyalty to him for it, Sherman goes for the all-too-perfect encapsulation of a Baby Boomer move: he protects himself with a totally needless shelf registration that is a transparent, weak-ass poison pill.  But one that threatens to destroy shareholder value and let the shorts off the hook should an activist investor try to get a little too cute with their operations.  Using us, the shareholders, as pawns in any possible proxy fight.  Because Fuck You, I'm George Fucking Sherman.  You'll get your Q4 numbers and I'll get my bonus and you can fuck right off.\n\nWe should all be outraged at how this was handled.  And I can guarantee you that if Cohen was contemplating a takeover or a total removal of the Board, this couldn't have gone any better for him.  The fear was likely that Sherman crushes it and we all shout the name Sherman! Sherman! from the rafters (not you Georgians probably) in exultation at our good fortune.  A shelf registration and an after hours drop in price of 17%??  Chris Davis, Cohen's attorney, must be shitting himself at his good fortune.  If Cohen moves, he is going to move quickly on this - possibly even tomorrow if the price really gets hammered.  Wishful thinking?  Yeah, possibly.  But if I had the ability to call a vote on replacement of the Board and knew that could likely trigger a massive short squeeze for a stock I own nearly 10% of?  I'd consider doing that.  Very much so.  And if I wanted to replace an inept Board and CEO, would I want him to do something that is transparently selfish and possibly destroys shareholder value?  Yeah, I fucking would.  And I would have a much easier time doing it right after almost every shareholder heard that call and thought: Fuck this Sherman guy.

So that means the board is 100% behind the CEO, and the CEOs strategy and don’t give a fuck about the activist getting bled down. Basically it’s telling the activist, “We read your letter and thought it was cute. But we are going forward with our previous strategy....and oh yeah, you’re gonna pay for it.”\n\nA HUGE problem with OPs thesis was the ownership type of the activist. The activist bought a 10% ‘natural’ position; this tells you that the campaign is going to go on for a long time (not just 90 days) meaning that betting on some massive flip in GMEs strategy was NEVER going to happen today (fucking lol at that). If you see an activist take a synthetic long, then you know the target is shorter term. \n\nI’d basically call this a thesis breaker. We now know that the CEO has full board support.

CEO/boards *absolutely* take activists seriously, but you have to have *earn* it and that takes years and a couple of big wins (see Icahn, Greenlight, Starboard, 3rd Pt, etc) before you have the cred to be taken seriously. \n\nStarboard v Darden like 7yrs ago was a good example. Prior to that campaign, nobody outside the industry had heard of starboard but they were very successful with targeted transactional campaigns. When they approached Darden, they got rebuffed. Starboard then launched a very noisy, long and dedicated public campaign that took like 12-18mo from beginning to end (the public part was a little shorter). Eventually Starboard ‘won’ and Darden semi-capitulated. But the big thing was that starboard was a ‘name’ and the next campaign they went on management listened. \n\nThis thing with GME was a fucking clown show. Some first-time kid whose resume is that they hit the lottery w a .com wants a seat at the big boy table?? They have never run a campaign before and a strongly worded letter will get you there? And they are going to use that seat to tell the business to ditch its business model on the fly to create a 2-way/3-way (it want clear) marketplace for game downloads.....funded by selling shit that has a net zero liquidation value?

To buy the company next week, it’d cost about $1.25B to $1.4B all in. Cohen might just write a check but that appears that would be (more than) all of his money. So he has to finance it. \n\nNow this is an area I know *really* well. In this market and this space, creditors would only loan a small amount (say ~$800m vs $600M of equity) bc this is a dying retailer, in a dying space (mall retail), that isn’t flowing cash (for now), and when it does flow cash it’s not a ton (low margin business and margins are going the wrong way)....I can keep going. You just can’t arrange financing like that right now. If you could, you wouldn’t see all these retailers being pushed into Ch11 and ch7 bc they could just refi way out past coronavirus - but they can’t. \n\nImagine if that was a person (low-paying, shitty job in a bad field, no transferable skills and their employer is publicly saying ‘we are gonna lay off a ton of ppl’) - would you loan that person a *HUGE* sum of money? Of course not, and neither would a person like me (or a bank).\n\nAdd to that, cohens strategy: throwaway all the physical and intangible assets in an effort to go purely online. Well, those assets were gonna be the stuff that secures the debt.....but he wants to throw it away. So I can’t really imagine a leveraged deal structure that works here. Bad strategy for a takeover bid. \n\nIn the end, all these retailers end up getting liquidated and the only ‘value’ in the end (besides inventories and stuff) are the brand names. There been a pretty active market for legacy brand names; Ascena just sold a bunch in Ch7 a few weeks back. I’d bet that ‘Gamestop’ is worth $30M *TOPS* and probably less. \n\nThat name is the core legacy asset, particularly if the strategy is ‘go pure online’. So the question is, why would Cohen spend a huge sum of money ($1.2B to $1.4B depending) to buy an asset worth $30M? Maybe if and only if he’s fucking insane - but that’s not a great long thesis. \n\nAnd lastly to his thesis: Cohen is absolutely right that the future of gaming is strictly digital. He’s also retarded if he thinks a legacy mall-based retailer can develop that platform. Reddit loves to post ‘TIL Blockbuster turned down the oppy to buy NFLX for $50M in 2003 - lolololol they were dumb.’ This is always a dumb take bc *blockbuster would have straight up killed netflix* - probably on accident or via innocent incompetence - but they would have killed it. And they would have killed it bc physical retailers CANNOT run a cutting edge tech platform. I can’t even think of a legacy retailer that’s developed a strong tech platform; not even Walmart and they have more cash than god. It just doesn’t work that way. \n\nIf Cohen wants to find the next big thing, put $1B into developing the platform and buy the ‘gamestop’ name out of bankruptcy.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your thoughts, man.

Each campaign is different and each personality is different but there are general rules. You don’t just blow in like the Kool-Aid man and expect to shake things up. The Cohen guy is likely learning that money alone doesn’t buy your ticket in that game. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the board and management would have *absolutely* NDAed the pg1 holders and brought them into the convo about the stock issuance. Those pg1 holders would have *never* agreed to the issuance if they were *also* going to fire the senior management team and (essentially) replace the whole company. \n\nCohen might try to force the issue bc he’s 1) already in the black, and 2) he’s trying to develop a reputation, and 3 he’s probably more than a little pissed about what happened tonight.

I don't plan to hold for a decade, but I expect to see a profit here after Q4 especially.  \n\nThe Cohen thing just makes this very interesting.  And now the Board and Sherman have made their moves too.  I'm pretty shocked that with a short interest above 100% and some long suffering shareholders (not me, I just got in in late Oct) that they prioritized a shelf offering announcement now over, say, a nominal buyback, when that could have really put the heat on the short sellers and created some upward momentum so if they really needed to issue the shelf, it wouldn't sting as much.  And also: there was a lot of good stuff that was said on that call.  But all the oxygen was sucked out of the air because of the shelf.  And the AH price reflects that.  Just seems like a baffling thing to do right now unless they really care more about saying fuck you to Cohen and others than actually building shareholder value in both the near and short term.

The share's been on a huge runup and the hype exceeds the actual value. Well, in that case, now's a great time to make a seasoned offering. You're giving out shares worth $340 each, but you're getting $650 each for them! That's a great deal. The company's *true* underlying value goes up -- you got more cash than the shares are really worth.\n\nThe incentives for seasoned offerings are such that companies only make them when they think their shares are overvalued. Thus, a seasoned offering is actually a *signal* to the market that the board thinks the shares are actually overvalued.\n\nAnd since the board knows better than the market, the market listens, and the share value is likely to drop.

Good for you. \n\nI am saying that Tesla has never been worth its trading price, but because it was so overvalued at some point it converted from a total failure to something that could fund building a real car. \n\nTesla, or any company you give a pile of money, can indeed to whatever, but it's not efficient capital allocation. In fact, it's probably everything but that, because all the other car companies already had figured out manufacturing, which some people see as \"legacy\". \n\nLet's see what happens if everyone tries to sell Tesla for the current stock price to a *different* set of people. It wouldn't surprise me if it would later turn out that Tesla is the result of a very fine tuned stock manipulation program.\n\nI'd say a battery technology to run an electric car is worth a few hundred million, battery management systems are worth another 40 million, their software is worth another 200 million, charging network is like 3000 USD (tops)/charger. Their solar business was worthless when they bought it in a fraudulent action. \n\nOTA updates are worth another ten million. \n\nTheir website is probably worth a few million. \n\nTheir custom silicon knowhow is worth 150 million (it's really not *that* difficult these days and I don't even know what level they are operating on, but they do depend on Samsung).\n\nThe neural network software is something that might have 30 million value, because the mathematics is all known and knowledge for building optimized implementations is also widely available. I think the neural network software is worth nothing, because it can't lead to full self-driving. I have no idea where people got that idea, because Elon has been screaming it since 2016, but it still doesn't work (because it can't). When the market also figures out that Elon is basically a dumbass, the stock will tank. \n\nThe self-driving data might be worth a few hundred million according to some people, but I think it's worth nothing, because a self-driving car wouldn't have to require massive amounts of data. \n\nTheir factories are worth a few billion. \n\nTheir grid technology is worth perhaps 1-3 billion, because it's not unique and you can buy companies that do the same thing even on public markets. \n\n50,000 employees are worth 250M in hiring and at most 500M in on the job experience. \n\nNow, add those numbers together and you have something approaching a real value. You know what, apply a 10x risk mulitiplier to it (because VCs assume that 9 out of 10 companies will fail in the worst case). \n\nThe number you now end up with is a *lot* less than the market capitalization. When the stock crashes, and it will, the number I described above will be about where the bloodbath will end initially, assuming not too much competition emerges (which is unlikely, because just one competitor is spending 40B to catch up (which I think is more than they should need, but the CEO probably plays safe or he is an idiot)).\n\nSo, can limitless capital build wonders of technology? Yes. Is it going to be possible for everyone to cash out? No, because the ROIC is going to be low on *average*, because not everyone will be able to sell for high prices. \n\nElon is 49 years old. Zuckerberg said that he prefers to hire people in their twenties (blatant age discrimination, and I don't care about Zuck, but you might). So, Elon already is an old duck. In a decade, how many creative ideas do you think his brain is going to generate? Zero. \n\nDo I regret not investing in Tesla? Sure in hindsight, but it has never been a viable investment. Elon has government buddies that bailed him out; that's the secret of Tesla. I don't keep stats on which CEOs are sucking cocks of which people in the administration. It's clear that it is profitable to know about such things, but I didn't. I also don't like to encourage criminal behavior. Elon was not even one of the co-founders of Tesla. Elon is convicted by the SEC, however, but instead of getting jail time, he just got a fine.

The post issue share price would be $91.66 since you’ll have (1000 * $100 + 200 * 50) / 1200. \n\nExisting shareholders are offered a rights issue. To qualify for a new share, you need to own 5 shares which are worth $500 before the new issue since 1000/200 is 5. To cash in the rights issue, you show 5 shares and pay $50 for the new share. Your old shares are now worth 5 * 91,66 = $458.3. However. You bought a share worth 91.66 for $50. In total, your portfolio value for 6 shares is $549.96, which is exactly what you paid. (Mijus 4 cents because of rounding). So there is a net wealth effect of 0. Nothing changes for you. \n\nIf you don’t want to buy a new share, you can sell the rights issue which would be 91.66-50 = 41.66. Per share, it is $8.33. When the post issue price of a share is now 91.65, and your rights issue is worth $8.33, which you can sell. You still have $100. It’s just divided in ~€8 cash and a $92 share. Again, a net wealth effect of 0. Nothing changes. \n\nThe same numbers can be applied to Tesla’s case.

I’ll lay out the situation here quick. \n\nRight now there is limited inventory. Sure, we could see inventory go up as the vaccine gets distributed and people start to feel more comfortable selling again. However, currently banks are being pretty picky about who they qualify for a loan. Some banks won’t even talk to you about less than 20% down. Right now the only people who are in the market to buy are highly qualified. Once banks loosen their lending practices again as we start to feel the bad times are behind us, we could very well see an increase in people looking to buy a home (demand) that outpaces the number of people looking to sell a home (supply).

However, assuming congress bails out tenants and landlords, I don’t foresee us having an influx of cheap real estate in the market, so when rates do go back up I don’t think they will drop prices to below where they are now. I expect to see an increase in prices again over the next year, and likely a slow gain again in 2022, and those gains will be more or less mitigated by a rise in interests rates a couple years down the road. \n\nCould be wrong, but as long as Congress does what they should reasonably be expected to do this storm will pass and real estate will likely continue to appreciate as rates stay low for a couple more years and more people become preapproved and enter the market.

First of all, you can’t assume the rental properties will be underwater because of a fraction of renters behind (see below). Second, the people that are behind skew on the low end, so the properties wouldn’t be at the median 300k value. \n\nOverall, I think the debt will definitely be an issue absent stimulus. But keep in mind rent price is usually much higher than a mortgage payment, and most renters are in large complexes, which allow owners to afford a few tenants missing rent here and there. Hurts the profit margin, but won’t make them go bankrupt. Further, evictions are expensive too, so why evict when the tenant returns to gainful employment (assuming unemployment keeps dropping) and will continue paying rent.
