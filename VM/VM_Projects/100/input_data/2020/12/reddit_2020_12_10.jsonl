{"title": "GME Either Squeezes or Gets Delisted - Who Will Win Short or Squeeze? Predictions here", "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nGME is not a question of a business model in the future, it is a question of right now. I understand the need for numbers and figures, I do. Technical and fundamental research is viable and necessary, but one very over looked method of analysis is philosophical. We have seen DD after DD talking about the numbers and the business model. But I want to share some thoughts with you of my logical thinking and would love to see counter points.\n\n**First Let's Recap**\n\n**Pre-Earnings (Aug-Dec)**\n\nAlready was running up and then r/wallstreetbets massive hype of a short squeeze and Cohen letters leads to a run-up followed by a sell-off due to overbuying.\n\n**During Earnings (12/7):**\n\n[Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n\nThe conversation and presentation actually had good content. Their balance sheet looks fantastic; eliminated debt, reduced costs, making changes towards the digital transformation, e-commerce way up, console sales upcoming, new inventory and other positives they didn't even mention like the [Microsoft deal](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/). But the stock plummets...why?\n\nThere were two pieces of \"bad news\": \"missed revenue\" and \"shelf offering\" which PR blasted in a very negative light taking it completely out of context. Revenue missed was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.\n\nRevenue: Loss was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.\n\nShelf offering: $100M and has two years to be used.\n\nFirst comment was by Jim Bell: \"\"However, as a pragmatic matter initiating this program provides us with the maximum flexibility and optionality to further bolster our balance sheet and liquidity position and increase flexibility gives us the ability to leverage opportunities to accelerate our transformational strategies, such as increasing the speed at which we elevate expand our omni-channel strategy while further ensuring minimal disruption from any potential further pandemic impacts around the world.\"\n\nWhen asked by William Reuter from BoA. \"OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?\"\n\nGeorge Sherman responded: \"No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.\"\n\nMy thought: It's a defense mechanism to attempt to do one of three things:\n\n1. Help combat against a Cohen takeover\n2. Collect profits on their way out because they know a short squeeze is imminent\n3. They truly want to use it as they said\n\nMy issue with 3 and what they said when asked by William Reuter, is that they have significantly improved the balance sheet and COVID-19 vaccinations have begun, not to mention they are intending on shifting focus on e-commerce, so it just struck me as a very odd reasons for a shelf offer.\n\nNonetheless, during this call the share price absolutely plummets, but why? We received a lot of good news and two pieces of \"bad news\". One was expected (revenue loss) and one was addressed during the call (shelf offering). There was no intent on share dilution at least not anytime soon.\n\nMy thoughts: Only thing I can think is PR putting a negative spin, but more-so it was the bears using the negative PR to their advantage to drive the price down. $14 was the floor by the end of AH.\n\n**Post Earnings (12/9):**\n\nA war rages over $14 keeping it nearly level the entire day.\n\nMy thoughts: Bears expected much lower yet the bulls fought hard. On a bleeding red day where bulls clearly had the disadvantaged portfolios, they were able to support and actually start a small uptrend.\n\n\\#WeWantCohen starts trending and Ryan Cohen puts out a [cryptic Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963).\n\nMy thoughts: He is completely dissatisfied with management and their ability to address his concerns outline in the letter. After ER the PR that went out and thoughts on the future of the company could have been beautiful if addressed and pitched correctly. Management did not provide comfort in the eyes of anyone and the stock price reflects that as does the PR.\n\n**What's Next?**\n\nThe moment you've all been waiting for. Let's gather some facts.\n\n1. Individuals own 9.87%\n2. Cohen (RC) owns 9.98%\n3. Michael Burry ( Scion) owns 2.44%\n4. GameStop Market Cap $890.11 Million\n5. Cohen net worth $600 Million\n\nCohen could either purchase enough shares to have majority vote or he can outright make an offer to buy the company. So why hasn't he?\n\nThere are two current possibilities:\n\n1. He conducts a hostile takeover.\n2. He has no plans to conduct a hostile takeover.\n\nReason 1 probable timing and outcome: If you were about to make a large purchase, wouldn't you want to get it at the best price possible? He's waiting until he feels like we are actually at the floor before making a move. Truthfully, all he has to do is speak. If he even mentions an intent of acquisition the shorts will run and the bulls will pile in triggering the squeeze. **Bulls win**\n\nReason 2 is interesting because why would he own 10% of a company where he clearly doesn't believe in current management? So, if a hostile takeover isn't the reason, then what is?\n\nI can think of two possibilities:\n\n1. There is already something happening behind the scenes to peacefully put Cohen into a position of power. **Bulls win**\n2. He thought being 10% owner would give him a large enough voice to be convincing, when he realized the board does not share his vision, he pulls out. **Bears win**\n\nNow, this is interesting.\n\nReason 1 seems highly unlikely to me simply due to his tweet today. If there were plans for a peaceful transition of power, I don't think he would add fuel to the fire of bad PR clearly doubting managements skills.\n\nReason 2 is juicy. Between RC, Scion and Individual investors who all want to see Cohen at the helm, that accounts for 22.29% of the company. If RC pulls out, the rest follow, no bulls left to fight the bears, the institutions pull out and GME becomes a penny stock.\n\nMy overall prediction is the **bulls win.** The reason being, I can chart one path to victory for the bears but many paths to victory for the bulls. Also, I do not think we will need to wait until Q4ER to see the squeeze. From each scenario I could think of, Cohen would act sooner rather than later if he intends on purchasing or accumulating enough shares for proxy in order to get the best price possible.\n\nNotice how nothing I said has to do with the future of the business or the business model as a whole? That's because that doesn't matter. Q4 earnings will boost the price high enough for bulls to profit a little and then get out if they don't believe in the company. The overall longevity of the company is a completely different debate.\n\nFeel free to counter-point in the comments.\n\n**TLDR:** You should read.\n\n**EDIT:** The title says delisted but perhaps should say “drops to $0”", "id": "kaa2qh", "created_utc": 1607580925.0, "score": 472, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 267, "comments": [{"body": "Third possibility.

So there is downside to this play should the vote not go through or should the two entities terminate the agreement.

Gambling is a tricky business and regulated differently than other industries. Many big players have avoided the industry and Paysafe has a great reputation and has become one of the early movers in the industry. The following are some notable customers.\n* &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bhbpnvr0b461.jpg?width=473&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec71dfedd8c6eb1d604282021340fbd8d39025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cno03rvr0b461.jpg?width=285&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4281b8e0db4783b7b4b6cce74f62f0694bdbb008\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* A gentleman u/dancinadventures posted this comment on my last post:\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *I actually know Paysafe and the usage quite well.*\n\n*PayPal has many restrictions in Europe regarding iGaming , so does Square.*\n\n*This is a big play on iGaming for those that aren’t aware.*\n\n*I was a mid- high stakes online poker player through the 2010-2018. Played a variety of sites. : iPoker; PokerStars, Paddy, MicroGaming, 888, Party. Why so many sites? Because I was always on lookout for where the action was, if a big whale sat down at one online casino; you bet your sweet ass I’m there.*\n\n*So let me give you my take as a consumer that’s probably spent over $100,000 in transaction fees personally on Paysafe.*\n\n*This was one of the cheapest and fastest ways to move money around online.*\n\n*Unlike Stripe this which is against risky business such as CBD and gambling, paysafe is actually one of the leading payment providers in both UK/AUS / Ireland for iGaming.*\n\n*Big example is William Hill, Bet365, Bwin.*\n\n*Now why would you want to move money online around as a gambler ?*\n\n*Well, Visa/MC charge close to 50%->75% more, online casinos = the merchant. They don’t wanna pay that, and in fact put limits on this type of payment processor. (Your visa’s credit cards etc). If a punter deposits / withdraws frequently, the online casino could literally be on the hook for like 20-30% of the turnover throughout the gambler’s period. (This assumes the gambler doesn’t lose all his money per deposit.*\n\n*Imagine you’re a professional sportsbettor, you’re not loyal to one site. Different spreads / odds are offered on every site, you want to be able to move your money from one to another quickly and cheaply. Arbitrage opportunities do exist in sports betting as bookmakers hedge their books to minimize risk, diff frequencies of bets occur on each sports book; you get the idea.*\n\n*For recreational punters, it’s simple: some sporting events that are smaller simply don’t exist on one site that exist on another. Eg. Perhaps you using Pinnacle / 10dimes for low spreads on high volume events, but perhaps you want to gamble on live events on bet365 on another day, and bet ponies on Hill.*\n\n*What if you only have $5000 ? Giant pain in ass to deposit money to each site, paysafe lets you move it around easily.*\n\n*Should you use visa, you may get blocked from depositing on various sites; Bodog, WHill, Bet365 just to name a few. Withdrawals and clearing deposits with bank transfers or checks takes days-> weeks and gamblers ain’t gonna wait for that shit.*\n\n*You can also buy prepaid paysafe cards from stores if you don’t wish to use your real credit card; and load that shit up.*\n\n*One of the biggest markets this is prominent in is South east Asia, they are some of the biggest punters and fucking loving gambling. Looking at you pinoys, Indonesians, Malays. Not everyone wants to fly to Macau to get their rocks off.*\n\n*As much as this is a play on FinTech, please understand this company has more or less the best Payment service on online gambling globally.*\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# The Comparable VALUATIONS\n\nFrom this chart you can see that there looks to be some favorable multiples that could improve once a deal closes. Also, I'm very bullish on the great Margins as well as the conservative growth. I think Foley along with the growing Igaming undervalues the potential of this company.

{"title": "GME Tribe: A Story About How Ryan Cohen is About to Kick Down Sherman's Door and Drink His Milkshake 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "*Come gather ‘round GME management wherever you roam.* *And admit that the waters around you have grown and accept it that soon you’ll be drenched to the bone. If your time to you is worth saving, then you better start swimming or you’ll sink like a stone, for the times they are a-changin’.*\n\nStory time for the GME crew. All those who are certain tHis iS bLoCkBusTer or the paper hands that sold yesterday can just keep scrolling. We wish you the best of luck in the best of all possible worlds: this one, dear Pangloss.\n\n\\*\\*I’ve tried to submit this three times now and the moderators keep rejecting it. Maybe because I use too many naughty words? I guess I’ll try to clean that up a bit, which runs counter to all my instincts.\n\nDid we have a good day Wednesday after that Q3 call? No, we did not. Do you know who lost over $20M (at least on paper) yesterday? Mr. Ryan Cohen. How do you think he felt about that CC and that inexplicable shelf registration that is, as one stocktwits commentator put it, a “poor man’s poison pill” and as obvious of a FU to Cohen and shareholders that the Board could have possibly designed? Do you think he was happy to see that?\n\nI think he was thrilled to see it.\n\nAnd now I’m going to tell you why. \n\nThis is a long post, so I’m going to give the TL/DR sum up for you Paste Eating Rocket Kids, and this will serve as a warning that there are, in fact, a lot of words that you may choose to read or not. So if I still see one goddamn comment about this being a lot of words and where’s the rockets maaaaan, I might just transport myself through this internet connection and \\[removed to satisfy the delicate sensibilities of the robot moderators\\]. \n\n**So here’s the TL/DR**: I believe that Cohen is executing a plan to take out the GME Board. And I think that Sherman just walked right into Cohen’s trap because he’s a dumb, selfish Boomer with a huge ego and a Broken Brain. And Cohen is going to be a legend because of it after he executes this plan, triggers the MOASS, and takes control of GME to convert it to a tech-first gaming juggernaut.\n\nNow, if you’re in on this GME shit, you likely know the outlines of the story here. But here’s a good link to refresh your memory about why we’re all here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the\\_real\\_greatest\\_short\\_burn\\_of\\_the\\_century\\_part/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4csaa/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century_part/)\n\nAnd for further background, my recent post about the battle here between George Sherman, out-of-touch Hired Gun B&M Boomer CEO with the Boomer-est of all possible Boomer names, and Ryan Cohen, Boy Genius, Actual Good Guy, and Man With The Chewy-fication Plan: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9apx5/gme\\_q3\\_call\\_thoughts\\_on\\_the\\_clash\\_between\\_cohen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9apx5/gme_q3_call_thoughts_on_the_clash_between_cohen/)\n\nSo: are we ready to start READING and THINKING, children? Good.\n\nNow what were you doing in the summer of 2020? I don’t give a shit what you were doing. But I do give a shit about what Ryan Cohen was doing. And there is a decent amount of evidence that Ryan Cohen spent the summer of 2020 hiring a bad ass lawyer and crafting a pretty solid plan to wrest control of a struggling Mall-based gaming retailer from its out of touch Boomer Board and CEO so he can turn it into an ecommerce juggernaut like his baby Chewy. And I think we are about to enter the next phase of that plan here shortly.\n\nBut before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s first all get acquainted with Christopher P. Davis, Esquire, the attorney listed on each of the 13Ds filed by RC Ventures.\n\n**Chris Davis, Activist Attorney Extraordinaire and His Successful Use of the Consent Solicitation to Remove Dipshit Boards/CEOs**\n\nTo cut to the chase, Chris Davis (who is definitely NOT the same dude playing first base for the Orioles) is a badass NYC attorney recently recognized as one of the nation’s premier shareholder activist lawyers. [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kleinberg-kaplan-partner-chris-davis-recognized-by-chambers-usa-as-leading-shareholder-activist-lawyer-301090571.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kleinberg-kaplan-partner-chris-davis-recognized-by-chambers-usa-as-leading-shareholder-activist-lawyer-301090571.html).\n\nSo what was Chris Davis doing in the summer of 2020? So glad you asked. He was celebrating a major win he helped engineer on behalf of a “**first time activist** Michael Gorzynski” for a wholesale replacement of the sitting Board at HC2 Holdings, Inc (sounds fancy). He helped engineer this takeover via a “high stakes **consent solicitation** rather than the more typical proxy contest.”\n\nLearn more about this here: [https://www.kkwc.com/insights/kleinberg-kaplan-advises-mg-capital-management-in-its-consent-solicitation-and-successful-settlement-with-hc2-holdings/](https://www.kkwc.com/insights/kleinberg-kaplan-advises-mg-capital-management-in-its-consent-solicitation-and-successful-settlement-with-hc2-holdings/)\n\nHere’s a few more links if you care to learn more about that and how it all went down (spoiler alert: the activists settled for two seats on the Board and then the new Board very quickly ousted the dipshit Boomer CEO, Phil Falcone)\n\n[http://www.shareholderforum.com/shfk/Library/20200611\\_II.htm](http://www.shareholderforum.com/shfk/Library/20200611_II.htm)\n\n[http://www.shareholderforum.com/access/Library/20200219\\_Deal.htm](http://www.shareholderforum.com/access/Library/20200219_Deal.htm)\n\nIn sum: if you look into Chris Davis, you can see that this guy is dialed the fuck in and knows how to get activist shareholders a win—even in very challenging circumstances.\n\n**The Summer of ’20 Out-of-the-Blue Boy Genius Media Campaign and Cohen’s 13D Filing in August**\n\nI’m going to return to the “**consent solicitation**” thing at the bottom and why I think it matters here, but I don’t want to lose momentum on the timeline and evidence. And the consent solicitation is Advanced Level Shit that I barely understand anyway. But I think it’s likely to be goddamn important so I’ll get to it.\n\nNow, where were we? Oh yes, the inexplicable media campaign.\n\nRC Ventures files its 13D on August 18th announcing that Ryan Cohen is now the proud owner of 5.8M shares or 9% (later increased to 9.8%) of That Cluttered Video Game Geekery You Used to Pass on Your Way to Jamba Juice or Wherever People Go in Malls. Uh, ok man. But then this is when the SP of this Future Blockbuster™ starts its real run as more catch on that Cohen has taken a huge stake and that is also part of the portfolio of Mr. Big Short himself and a bunch of institutions and they actually have cash and are definitely not going bankrupt and oh have you heard about the insane short percentage of float and the upcoming console cycle that invariably corresponds to a sharp spike in SP? Well have you? But to return to the point: RC was and is the largest shareholder.\n\nBut prior to the date Cohen filed his 13D, there is a renewed media campaign focused on Ryan Cohen, Ecommerce Billionaire Genius who built Chewy, kicked Amazon’s ass, and then sold it for $3.35B way back in the heady mask-free days of ‘17. Why the sudden re-emergence of Mr. Cohen in the summer of 2020 in such a prominent way with this glowing media campaign about a guy who sold a very successful pet supply business over three years ago? Fawning media exposure like that doesn’t just happen (or not usually). It’s engineered. Or, more charitably, helped along by people who know people and can introduce those people to Interesting Topics to Write About. And my guess is that Chris Davis, bad ass activist attorney based in New York City, Knows People and had a little something to do with it.\n\nHere are the links to all of the glowing media pieces starting in the summer of 2020 (all absolutely worth a read to get to know who this guy is and what makes him tick):\n\nJune 5 (Bloomberg) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo)\n\nAugust 4 (CNBC) [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/chewy-co-founder-ryan-cohen-this-is-the-side-hustle-id-start-now.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/chewy-co-founder-ryan-cohen-this-is-the-side-hustle-id-start-now.html)\n\nAugust 16 (Forbes) [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=41e1370e5840)\n\nOctober 15 (Business Insider) [https://www.businessinsider.com/chewy-ryan-cohen-warren-buffett-lessons-apple-investment-2020-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/chewy-ryan-cohen-warren-buffett-lessons-apple-investment-2020-10)\n\nAnd a lot of the speculation I’m wheeling and dealing here was introduced by our man Justin Dopierala at Seeking Alpha way back in a September article not too long after the 13D filings: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4373819-gamestop-chewys-founder-ryan-cohen-finds-whats-next](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4373819-gamestop-chewys-founder-ryan-cohen-finds-whats-next)\n\nBut for now let’s “put a pin” on Mr. Dopierala, as George Sherman or some other Corporate Robot Dipshit might say, as he will be important to the story here again soon.\n\n**The November 16th “F U Old Man” Letter**\n\nIf you haven’t read this ballsy letter Cohen wrote to the Board last month, you really should. We’ll wait for you. [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\\_Ventures\\_Letter\\_to\\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf)\n\nOK, ready again?\n\nI don’t want to question Cohen’s possible writing abilities or give away too many tricks of the lawyer trade here (AI should take care of that in about a decade), but that letter was 100% written by Chris Davis. I’d literally bet my entire portfolio on that fact alone. That’s why you hire gunners like him. The letter has that has deliciously direct and aggressive lawyerly tone—the kind you use when you want to send a very clear message to some asshole without spelling it all out. I fucking love this letter. It was one of the main reasons I put the rest of my chips into the GME basket. I doubt I’m alone there.\n\nAnd what did we learn from this letter? Well: a lot. But I’m going to focus on a few quick things. First, we learned that over the Summer, Cohen had “private conversations” with the Board and Sherman about the need to pivot toward becoming a technology-driven business with a new strategic vision. And he calls out Sherman and the Board directly for lacking this vision, using Mainstreet-Friendly pejoratives like “c-suite” and “boardroom.” He takes a direct shot at Hired Gun Sherman’s Boomer-Ass Business Record (Advanced Auto Parts! Cool!) and his obvious bent towards what he knows: Boring Ass Low Margin B&M Bullshit Companies and straight-up calls him a dumb-ass old man (“twentieth-century focus!”) who Just Doesn’t Fucking Get It. He alleges that he and the Board have presided over “massive value destruction” (almost makes it sound intentional, or at least grossly negligent) and have never taken “full accountability” for all their fuck-ups and intransigence.\n\nSome folks have suggested that, sure, Cohen wants change and yeah he seemed like he had a bit of a bee in his bonnet, but if he doesn’t get some good movement in those areas, he’ll just sell his 6.5M shares to tank the stock and take his ball and go home to play with his dog, who loves him No Matter What. In this interpretation, the letter is just Cohen Asking To Speak To The Manager and then if the response is not to his liking, well then, He Will Just Take His Business Elsewhere, thankyouverymuch.\n\nI do not think that is what is going on here. Not with Ryan Cohen and Chris Davis. This letter is Ryan Cohen Crossing The Fucking Rubicon.\n\nHe did the honorable thing and took his vision to the Board and Sherman. How genuine he was in that effort, I have no idea, as my thesis is that he has had a takeover plan in place since he hired Chris Davis. But whatever the initial motivations, it was the honorable thing to do to discuss his vision with Sherman and the Board before he and Chris Davis eventually rip their fucking hearts out (which, spoiler: I believe he is getting ready to do as we speak).\n\nReasonable minds can disagree here, but I do not think you write a letter like that unless you have a plan to handle all possible responses to it. He just torched his collegial relationship, such as there ever was or could have been, with that CEO and that Board. He flaunts Chewy’s world-class infrastructure and market cap versus their lame ass sub-$1B Dying Mall Store Bullshit. And he makes a very public rejection of a seat on the board (and the reason given: because you fuckheads would just ignore me and drive me nuts while you continue doing Dumb Boomer Shit with my money all goddamn day), which made it 100% clear to me that this is Cohen Serving Goddamn Notice that unless they get serious about the scope of their turnaround and start listening to him and convey this new direction to shareholders asap, that he’s coming for them. He even alludes to his own turnaround plan but then tells them to do their jobs like the Big Capable Adults they are.\n\nAnd then Cohen attaches this letter to an amended 13D to ensure that all shareholders see it and also see that he still holds all of his shares. Within hours, the WSJ had an article on this: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestops-new-billionaire-investor-calls-for-tech-centric-makeover-11605565458?mod=hp\\_lista\\_pos5](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestops-new-billionaire-investor-calls-for-tech-centric-makeover-11605565458?mod=hp_lista_pos5).\n\nAnd guess what’s neat? If you are an interested shareholder or a habitual reader of the Wall Street Journal (I, sir, am not) and you saw that article, you might have wondered what this Cohen guy is all about? You know, Mortimer, the dog guy—made billions. And thanks to the recent out-of-the-blue marketing campaign that was definitely NOT engineered by Chris Davis as part of a takeover plan, your subsequent Google searches, and the recent articles they produced, likely made you think: this guy is a fucking whiz kid and I like the cut of his jib.\n\n**Cohen Quietly Meets With Funds/Investors**\n\nIn the weeks leading up to earnings, sharp observers also notice something: Ryan Cohen is meeting with various large shareholders for some reason. There were several reports of this on stocktwits (links are lost to eternity in that cluttered hellhole unless some astute commentator can find and link in the comments), so some salt is a necessary accompaniment here (I like to cite my evidence), but we have at least **one confirmed meeting** with the head of DOMO Capital: Mr. Justin Dopierala. Now, Justin happens to be a pro-GME writer (and a sharp one at that) at Seeking Alpha. You know, that paywall website where people purporting to know what they’re talking about get paid peanuts to write purposefully inane articles for maximum clicks from other idiots? That one. Well Justin is one of the good ones there, and DOMO Capital is also a large shareholder of GME. (Conflict of interest, you say? Shut yo’ mouth!).\n\nOn November 30, at 9:19 AM (the payin’ for inanity crew can go see this – the comment is still there), Dopierala made the following comment on another SA article:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“I've recently had the pleasure of having a 1 on 1 video meeting with Ryan Cohen that lasted over an hour.\n\nGoing forward, I no longer feel comfortable commenting on the topic (of Ryan Cohen), so please understand when I do not respond to any of your questions on this specific topic.\n\nRyan is a very intelligent man, and I remain as bullish as ever on GameStop's future.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo what can we extrapolate from this? \n\nRyan Cohen likely reached out to DOMO Capital/Dopierala to discuss his strategic vision. I do not know if he announced his plans directly, or what the purpose of the call was (see the very below on how I think this all could relate to a consent solicitation to recall the board) but I’m sure, at the very least, the text, if not the subtext, was heavy as fuck on that Zoom call. And why do I think Cohen contacted him and not the other way around? Because Dopierala, a writer for SA that I’m sure would love to publish even an anodyne Q&A with Ryan Cohen to Get Him All the Clicks, didn’t get an on-the-record interview. Not even some softball about whether his dog prefers his Apple investment decision or his Wells Fargo one. No: he got the concession (assuming he did) to simply acknowledge that a discussion took place (buried in a comment on some other dude’s SA article), but he explicitly says he’s not going to talk about anything related to Cohen going forward. No sir, no how. But if Cohen is just a regular old fellow shareholder (Cue Ryan: “And Justin, please: the pleasure is all mine”), then why the fuck are you making a cagy comment and acting like you Have A Big Fucking Secret and Oh God I Wish I Could Tell You Something But I Just Cant! with that comment, Justin? The Man Doth Protesting and Shit, I say.\n\nHere’s the article link for you Seeking Alpha Super Sleuths: [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4380313-gamestop-likely-already-digital-revenue-sharing-sony-up-to-10](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4380313-gamestop-likely-already-digital-revenue-sharing-sony-up-to-10)\n\nAnd even yesterday, Dopierala can’t help himself. In a discussion about Cohen’s tweet yesterday (you saw the tweet right? What kind of GME-to-da-moon! investor are you anyway? [https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963)), Dopierala gets all Jim Carey As The Riddler on us in a response to “EricinPDX,” (some dude living in the Portland Airport) who writes:\n\nEricInPDX\n\nI take his tweet as a total negative .. the Jim Cramer thing.\n\nI have no position at the moment.\n\nOur man Dopierala then responds “then you are wrong yet right.”\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393394-gamestop-cohen-right-to-downplay-ps5-xbox-series-mistakes-core-digital-problem](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393394-gamestop-cohen-right-to-downplay-ps5-xbox-series-mistakes-core-digital-problem)\n\nSo I think he’s having a little fun talking like a slightly less backwardsy Yoda saying: yeah, that Cohen tweet was obviously negative because he’s highlighting how fucked GME seems after that Q3 call (and also, check out how Chewy’s doin’ in that clip!). But it’s also **not** negative because it means Cohen is about to rip Sherman’s still-beating heart out and Shock And Awe our asses with a vote. And I, Justin Dopierala, head of DOMO Capital, can be a little wink winky about this because, oh I don’t know, on our hour long call Cohen maybe used puppetry to act out “Bryan Flohen’s” plan to call a vote and supplant the Bad Man “Gerald Shorman” while asking “Would You Theoretically Be With Bryan Flohen?” with a few well-timed arch of the eyebrows. Or he got his explicit consent to his plan (see below re consent solicitations). We just do not know.\n\nIn conclusion: We know that Cohen met with shareholders in the period between the day he sent that letter and the date of the Q3 call. We just do not know what was said. But we do know that Dopierella, either out of a sense of journalistic ethics (Stop laughing you guys! Seriously!) or out of concern about possible SEC lookie-loos, decides to be up-front about his inability to even utter the name Ryan Cohen from now on.\n\n**General George “Custard” Sherman’s Lame-Ass Empire Striking Back**\n\nLet’s recall the letter now. I’m guessing a rich, egotistical pampered-ass hired gun Boomer CEO named George goddamn Sherman didn’t like someone who reminds him of his asshole kids talking to him like that.\n\nWe all know what happened next: the Q3 “Say Omnichannel One More Time Motherfucker!” call. As I mentioned in my prior post on this (link above if you care), Sherman pulled the boomer-ist of boomer moves in an act of self-sabotage that is likely to be studied in business courses once this whole story plays out. You see, that letter that Cohen/Davis sent was a trap. And Sherman and the Board and their Big Fucking Corporate Brains clearly lack an inner Admiral Ackbar.\n\nCohen sent that letter three weeks before the earnings call. And demanded that they conduct \\*another\\* strategic review and present a plan to shareholders outlining how they are going to fully pivot into a new technology focused company. Cohen knows they have no intention of doing this. He’s apparently been hectoring them all summer about it. And I’m guessing he talked to Sherman enough to know that the dude is just not on the level (as all of us who listened to that fumbling bland-ass corporate caveat-speak on that call got to experience as well). So he knows, like we all did, that Q3 earnings are likely to be middling at best. But unlike me, who clearly thought that the one way out of this for Sherman and the Board was to give some exciting guidance on Q4, maybe even a share buyback (as they are authorized to do) and some more info on the Microsoft deal, likely revenue, other possible similar deals with Nintendo and Sony. I don’t know, but Something. No, Cohen and Davis are way smarter than me and know Sherman a bit better and probably assumed that Sherman is likely to whiff on a response to his letter. And lo and behold, whiff he does. Nothing. We get no response to the letter and no real plan to transform GME into a tech-driven gaming company (Sherman: “but, but…I said Omnichannel you guys! What do you want from me beyond bland corporate robot speak!?”).\n\nBut what else happens? Sherman and the Board inexplicably authorize a shelf registration for up to $100M worth of ATM shares. This from a company that just bought back shares, is authorized to buy back more, paid down debt early—and now is about to be flush with Sweet, Sweet New Console Cash. What in the everlasting fuck?\n\nAnd in case you were inclined to give Sherman and the Board the benefit of the doubt here, the reason was simple and straightforward and included within the S3 filing itself. And that is: “Hey Cohen: Fuck Off. And if we have to dilute our shareholders to get you to fuck off, by God that’s the kind of shortsighted ME-first move that got George Sherman where he is today! So go find another company to hassle you ungrateful Millennial Start Up Dog Store Bro and let the adults handle this.”\n\nHere is the provision in the S-3 (under the heading: Anti-Takeover Provisions):\n\n*Authorized But Unissued Shares*\n\nThe authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The **existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise**.\n***\n\nSo instead of crushing the call and giving some dope guidance about Q4 and trigger the MOASS so we all revere the name George Sherman for All Eternity, Sherman and the Board make a lame-ass move to try to protect their jobs and--lo and behold!--THIS is the main takeaway of the report and call. And what drives the precipitous dive in SP AH and yesterday. A dive so steep that it removes well over $100M in market cap in value, the kinda-lame amount that you’re trying to stick Cohen with (and dilute all of us) so you can keep your Big Fancy-Man Job and the bonus you’re counting on so you and the misses can jet off to Sandals Jamaica like you always do. George: Whoops? Knew we should have gone with a higher number! A lame ass “poor man’s poison pill” as [u/snowk88](https://www.reddit.com/u/snowk88/) on stocktwits put it (shout out because he also helped me flush out this thesis a bit and clued me in on Chris Davis’s work for MC).\n\nSo back to how I started this missive, back when we were all younger and maybe a bit more naïve, right? Anyway. Yesterday Ryan Cohen lost over $20M on paper because George Sherman thought the best way to handle that Punk-Ass Millennial was to use shareholders as a hostage in any possible fight over control of this company he’s been building his entire—oh, eh, the last 18 months because he’s just a hired gun that goes where the money is and waits for his ka-ching moment before splitting because who gives a fuck he’s George Sherman and You’re Not. But guess what happens when you do that? (Hand down, George: you’ve had your turn). You ENRAGE the shareholders who you want to have your back and vote for you in any possible proxy fight or takeover offer! What strategery! You must have been involved in planning the Iraq war, George.\n\nBut guess who was likely laughing their ass off yesterday at their colossal good fortune at this misstep? Ryan Cohen and Chris Davis. Because now Sherman has opened the door even wider than it was before and made it that much easier for Cohen to get the votes and kick down his fucking door.\n\nAnd yesterday, to no one’s surprise, the SP falls almost 20% and even Jim Fucking Cramer piles on and tells all his braindead Boomer TV watchers that this is The Next Blockbuster like all the other Super Sophisticated Analysts out there.\n\nAnd now we see the #WeWantCohen and #InstallCohen hashtags (which you all should consider using frequently if you dig all this and think Sherman needs to go).\n\nWhat are you thinking if you’re Ryan Cohen? Take your ball and go home time? Or: maybe that it’s time to Show George Sherman that You Do Not Fuck With a Super Nice Guy With Really Good Ideas That Are Usually Respectfully Presented (Unless You Piss Me Off) Like Ryan Goddamn Cohen?\n\nI’m thinking it’s the latter. Taking all of this, I think Cohen and Chris Davis have been planning some kind of takeover, possibly even via consent solicitation like Davis did in his MC matter, since the summer and that George Sherman’s ironic attempt to save his own skin is about to backfire stupendously to help Cohen lock in the votes he needs. And it couldn’t happen to a nicer guy—excuse me—I mean: Smug Asshole.\n\n**Epilogue: The Consent Solicitation**\n\nEd: the consent solicitation is not likely in play here.  But Cohen is definitely still coming for Sherman and Co - we just don't know exactly how yet.\n\nNow, just what in the hell is a **consent solicitation** and why does it matter? I confess that I didn’t know shit about this until I started READING ALL THE WORDS, but our friends at theactivistinvestor.com have some useful information to help those of us with tiny little baby brains understand what it is and why it may be relevant here (relevant excerpts below, but it you really want to geek out on this shit, I would recommend clicking the link, reading the words and THINKING BIG THOUGHTS). And also, hoping that some folks can respond in comments to help flush this out further because it’s late and I’ve already written too many words.\n\nBut, before I drop some k-n-o knowledge from our friends at theactivistinvestor.com, just to remind you: GameStop is a Delaware Corporation.\n\nNow imagine being magically whisked away to…Delaware! (Hi. I’m in Delaware).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom: [http://www.theactivistinvestor.com/The\\_Activist\\_Investor/Consent\\_Solicitations.html](http://www.theactivistinvestor.com/The_Activist_Investor/Consent_Solicitations.html)\n\n[Ed: removed quoted text]\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCPT Hubbard here again. I’ll release you momentarily. But study those steps a bit and ponder where Cohen might be in that process. And also recall that we know that Cohen had an “off the record” meeting with our man Dopierala from DOMO Capital and we have no idea what they talked about. Could Cohen have been getting shareholders consent? No idea. But it certainly seems possible. If that is the case, the 60 day clock is ticking. Which means that, assuming Dopierala was stop #1 (probably doubtful, but it’s the one data point we have), we should know something by at least late January if Cohen is actually initiating a consent solicitation on this incompetent Board and probably a lot closer to mid-January (Sorry Jan call holders) since I assume Cohen started reaching out around the time he sent that letter on Nov 16th.\n\nTo which I say to Cohen: Little old me and my —— shares consent! We consent most emphatically, sir. And no one will ever accuse you, Mr. Cohen, of not seeking consent. You may retain this for your records.\n\nTo conclude, Cohen is Young, Scrappy and Hungry and He’s Not Throwing Away His Shot. And Fuck George Sherman.\n\n[“I’M FINISHED”](https://youtu.be/12Iosf6btzM) \n\n**To be clear: this missive is for information purposes only and I would advise against following my example in any way, shape or form, as this pandemic has quite plainly knocked a screw loose if I'm here writing novelas to a bunch of Paste-Eating Rocket Kids.", "id": "kakxrm", "created_utc": 1607625021.0, "score": 1476, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 516, "comments": [{"body": "The length of this post is ableist", "score": 920, "replies": [{"body": "This is the best comment here.", "score": 221, "replies": [{"body": "High-jacking the top comment to post the following (since it seems I have exceeded the Reddit character count with my Dostoyevsky novel)\n\n**EDIT**: Some sharp and helpful commentators have pointed out the following paragraph in GameStop's CoI, which reads:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSEVENTH: (a) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis could blow my consent solicitation theory out of the water.  I'm no corporate lawyer and so I do not know precisely what tricks that Chris Davis might have up his sleeve here, but it looks like this particular avenue might not be a possibility after all.  But the main thrust of my thesis stands: I think all of the evidence points to Cohen coming for this Board. But that particular avenue (which sounds really bad ass if you can make it work) is likely not happening here.\n\nBut this gives me another opportunity say something really brief  on this (did this long winded fucker just say brief?).  And that is this:\n\n My GME investment thesis, such as it is, is pretty simple: Short sellers are highly overleveraged expecting a bankruptcy that is not coming in the near term, suppressing the true value of the market cap for a company with GME's revenue and debt profile and potential to return to profitability, (or at least dramatically increase revenue) with this console cycle, the pandemic buying and this holiday season--with a likely payoff of a large Q4 number that seems very likely to raise the price above $14 (or at $10 when I first started buying).  And that because of this timeline, April calls have a pretty good chance of printing. That's my target and I think it's a sound one.\n\nThe Cohen situation is just the icing on the cake and it's interesting as fuck to me because it actually seems like my dude is going to go for it here.  Whether he can actually pull it off and whether he actually creates this new Chewified GameStop, I have no idea.  I'll revisit that when the time comes.  But if Cohen does in fact go for it, and I do think that, details aside, it seems like he really does want to do it (YOLO, BRO), then the moment he makes his move, this thing moons.  And then the shorts are well and truly fucked.  What happens next is less of a concern to me and I will cross that bridge when we get there.\n\nTLDR: (see?  I'm getting the hang of this!) The consent solicitation method is likely not in play here.  Cohen is still likely going for this.  GME is positioned to do well here in the months leading to Q4 earnings.  And if Cohen makes a move, regardless of whether he succeeds, then this thing moons.

It is likely, if you are being smart about this, that you would formulate a very detailed strategic plan and vision for the company well ahead of time (summer maybe, this is when market share was captured by other online retailers, why not GameStop?).  This strategic review and vision is fully anchored in detailed financial breakdowns for the corporation.  You then present this to whales such as BlackRock, BofA, etc.  You then present this to the BoD at GameStop, perhaps with less detail because you shouldn't do their job for them.

I’ll give you my 2c on the on the part I read. \n\nChris Davis may/may not be a BSD in proxy law, but I’ve definitely never heard of him. That doesn’t really mean anything, but it is a fact that he’s not at one of the ‘big daddy’ firms like skadden, wachtell or cravath. If I saw one of those firms at the table, I might feel a little different. And besides, any lawyer is gonna take cohens $750/hr even if the case is pretty hopeless. \n\nTo H2C holdings - there’s actually something to learn here. In a proxy battle, who owns the shares is *everything* and the strategy is ‘how do I flip those shares?’\n\nGo to H**C’s 12/31/19 holdings list, and look at its ownership structure (edit - I posted this comment previously w the correct ticker but my comment got rejected. I’m reposting again edited). Focus on the fact that it was only about 30% institutionally held and the rest was either insider or closely-held. This makes it *really* easy to wage a proxy battle bc you have fewer plain vanilla longs to fight (PVLs almost never vote to join proxy fights unless one of the big proxy advisors issues a public judgement). Put differently, you have to herd fewer cats and the shares you have to flip are not encumbered by *massive* institutional bureaucracies. \n\nContrast that with GME, which is about 99% institutional (ignoring the short double). Your top 5 holders, representing about 40% of shares (Fido, blkr, vang, sig, dim adv) are *never* going to vote for a new slate under these circumstances. \n\nThe big longs simply won’t take a unilateral side in a proxy fight. So Fido just won’t do it, and blkr/vang/dim adv are holding into etfs and separately managed accts, meaning they will either ‘no vote’ or straight up vote ‘no’.  SIG is transactional and is probably already out by now. If you keep going down, you can say the same with state street, msam, and norges. They won’t get on board with a fight. \n\nThe only way to get PVLs (and trust/etf managers) to vote for a proxy action is to get a proxy advisory firm to take your side, like a glass-Lewis or ISS (in fact, this is institutional policy at just about all mutual funds). And this is a HUGE undertaking particularly given what Cohen is asking, and the fact that proxy adv firms are insanely conservative in their recommendations. \n\nI just don’t see it happening. \n\nAnd I quit at DOMO advisors being involved. I looked DOMO advisors and according to Bloomberg, they have a *WHOPPING* $13M (not a typo) under management. That’s.....a rounding error. It’s just not enough money to matter by a factor of like 100x. If I took a $13M trade to my CIO, they’d assume I was drunk (again). That’s DOMOs entire book. \n\nWhich begs the question: why the fuck did anyone even bring in DOMO - why not somebody that matters? Why didn’t Cohen pitch this to 3rd Point or Greenlight? They are dying for ideas - they (almost certainly) would have taken the meeting. \n\nTeaming up with a nobody for a proxy war is like a dude at a bar saying, “oh yeah, I regularly bang supermodels in Paris - like all the time. I’ve also got Kendall Jenner on speed dial....Anyway if you need me, I’ll be hanging out in the mall in front of the Hot Topic hitting on 13yr olds.” The words just don’t match the actions by a long shot. \n\nTons of activist firms would have taken the meeting....but I guess they didn’t?

They are extremely common in the debt and structure fin world whenever you need a majority vote to change the terms of an outstanding security. I can’t think of a scenario where that’s been done with a huge public company like GME. It’s almost always reg d securities. If it has been done, it’s probably with tiny troubled companies. So is it technically possible? Sure? Do I think it’s likely? Probably not. But I may well be wrong. \n\nBut think this through: let’s say Cohen is going to flip the board. Let’s say he pushes through a new board that will turn GME into a strictly digital game delivery platform. That means he’s not buying the company - what’s your upside case? If he goes through with getting a new board, nobody can buy GME outright and you can’t take it private bc the cash flow sucks. Like what a realistic earnings power in FY22-FY24? And the thing is, you also need to explain why the pg1 holders won’t dump GME in mass when\n\nThere’s a reason that PE firms do these transactions off public markets. I work these structures all the time - even in a best case scenario, you burn all the equity and rest on contingent debt. This is a fancy way of saying you zero-value the equity (the hypothetical stock would go to zero) and super-sub convert debt provides floor to the cap structure. If you do this as a public company, your stock - by definition - goes to zero/pennies.  Once you have flipped the business and you are again flowing cash, you regenerate your equity position when you IPO and recapitalize. \n\nThere are no hedge funds mutual funds or etf trustees that can bear that type of loss. That’s why PE/VC do 7-10 limited life funds that are fully locked; all of those pg1 holders are marked-to-market. So part of this consent solicitation thesis is that you’re also flipping the entire investment base. The share price isn’t going UP during that process. \n\nTLDR: Cohen cannot do this transformation as a public company and there’s no way he’s taking private in a normal-way levered deal. The *only* way this works is if he is willing to stake up like $600M to $800M. To get a worthwhile return, he’d have to IPO for (I don’t know) like $5B in a few years. Is that possible?

That's my target and I think it's a sound one.\n\nThe Cohen thing is just the icing on the cake here and the most interesting thing going right now in my view in this boring ass world we find ourselves in.  I'm genuinely fascinated at how this is playing out and do not know what to make of that letter other than a pretty direct signal that he and Chris Davis are at least going to try something.  Now, I know fuck-all about how any of that shit would play out.

Throw in two steak sandwiches and bill it to the Underhill account, boys.\n\nSo I don't really know what's going to happen.  But my guess is they're going to try something.  Just seems like something Cohen wants to do.  And whether they can successfully pull it off? It sounds like you have some very reasonable doubts.  And you may very well be right.

But, if I go through the other big holders, you have: Cohen, Donald Foss, Burry, Must, Permit, Hestia, Senvest, Maverick, Paradice, etc... it seems like you're starting to get to substantial numbers.\n\nBut, you're absolutely right.  Why in the world would you start with DOMO?\n\nSo, it seems to me, if Cohen has any plays to make, the only one possible is a hostile tender.  No?  Then the question is, who else could he have lined up for a PE deal?  Because he's not gonna be able to go that alone.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "We don't know he started with DOMO.

Not saying they wouldn’t take a swing at this, but it’s just hard for me to see a no-experience first timer like Cohen being able to build a coalition. I mean maybe he could, I just don’t see it. \n\nAlso remember that *most* (like 80%-90%) of activism is transactional eg, sell that asset, merge w that company, do a special divvy, initiate a buyback - “do a specific and defined thing and I’ll go away.” “Sell your assets and completely reinvent the business from the bottom up in a orthogonal space you have zero experience in” is a flavor of activism that is *really* unusual. Like I’m having a hard time thinking of a comparable example. \n\nOn the surface GME and, say, Steam might *seem* similar, but if you think about it, those are *wildy* different businesses. It would be like telling a coal mining company to sell all their assets and start building solar plants; both activities are *related* to generating electricity but the engineering/expertise/business/human/mechanical/knowledge/etc portions of those two activities are way way way fucking different. Something of that flavor is much more like a PE- takeout and turnaround, which is like a ~5yr play; you’d never even consider doing that as a public company. However, Cohen aside, none of the funds you listed would take a 5yr illiquid bite. \n\nSo, therefore, the biggest issue to a takeout is money; there’s no way this can get financing without a massive equity chunk. That’s hands down the biggest obstacle. GME is a shitty business in a bad space, and the gameplan is to liquidate all the assets that would secure the debt? Hmmmmm.....not so sure about that. And they can’t do a hostile tender - that’s not even really a thing anymore. GME would just bleed him down. \n\nLook - I make mistakes all the time, and I’m not an activist/equity guy by trade, so I could easily be wrong.

Remember that making money isn’t about what’s *possible* - it’s about (probability x return). Again it’s possible that the giants win the super bowl, but you’re not betting that bc you know that (probability x return) is shit. \n\nIs it possible that Cohen gets a seat on the board? Sure. But the next 18-24mo of GME are FAR more likely to be a vanilla old-retail turnaround story (eg stronger aggregate cash flow % on a smaller asset base) as opposed to a wild ‘blow it all up’ story, and if it *does* turn into a ‘blow it up’ story, the stock isn’t going UP in the near term. \n\nOn the surface, I’m unlikely to put in debt anywhere into that cap structure bc it just looks obviously wrong to me. But again, equities aren’t my space. On the credit side, I’ve avoided both NFLX and TSLA - so far I’ve been (happily) wrong on both.

So basically, MRNA has grown by \\~$55 Billion USD purely on their COVID vaccine.\n\n1 year ago, Pfizer was trading at $36.51 USD.  Since then, they've grown to \\~$41.12 USD today.  A modest 12% YoY gain on a company that is getting the first FDA approved COVID19 vaccine (albeit in a shared project with BioNTech).\n\nPfizer was worth about $203B in market cap 1 year ago.  Today they are at roughly $228.63B.  They've added \\~$25.7B in market cap YoY.  Most people would agree that PFE/BNTX vaccine is better positioned than MRNA vaccine.

For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the numbers were lower: Severe side effects included fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2%).*\n\nModerna's vaccine had 3X greater reported side effects.  Pfizer is also a much more established and trusted brand.  If one person had the option to choose between the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine, I think all of them would choose Pfizer.\n\nSo basically, PFE is still the best play here, because they are much more capable and have a better product than MRNA.  Further, their stock has seen much lower appreciation vs. MRNA, despite their clear advantage in the vaccine race.\n\nEventually, when supply shortages no longer exist, people will request the Pfizer vaccine over the Moderna vaccine.
