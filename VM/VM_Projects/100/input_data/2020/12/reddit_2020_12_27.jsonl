{"title": "Weekend IV Report - Tickers with low IV and cheap premiums", "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

Given a long EV runway (3% adoption now, 20% by 2025), and TSLA’s current 25% EV share, investors can forecast 2025 EPS ($24), attach a P/E ratio (50x) to get a 2025 value ($1,200). At a 9.5% disct rt, TSLA worth $830 today.\n\n2/ $TSLA stock rose 669% YTD because Model Y launched globally, Shanghai opened, and Berlin/Austin are doubling capacity. This caused forward EPS ests to soar, which pushed TSLA sharply higher. S&P inclusion and TSLA’s 5:1 stock split served as catalysts to highlight TSLA value.\n\n3/ For $TSLA to move higher, three key metrics - EV adoption, $TSLA EV share, auto gross margins - have to beat expectations.  Biden’s EV plan could signif accelerate EV adoption. Model Y global expansion, mfg capacity doubling, and CyTruck could sharply increase TSLA EV share.\n\n4/ My $TSLA $830 PT in 6-12 mos assumes 2025 global EV adoption of 20%, and TSLA takes 25% EV share. By 2025, I expect TSLA to deliver 4M vehicles, producing $24 EPS. If data comes out that EV adoption is likely to grow to 30% by 2025 (1.5x), my 6-12 mo PT would be $1,245 (1.5x).\n\n5/ Contrary to media reports and analysts who rigidly value $TSLA as an auto stock, $TSLA is not expensive on most valuation metrics. No ptf mgr values growth stocks on current yr earnings. TSLA trades at 69x FY’22 EPS, or 1.2x 5-yr forward EPS growth of 57%.

If they have to pay market prices to SpaceX, then SpaceX gets up-front profits.\nSpaceX(investors) could also keep a controlling stake in Starlink, making the IPO just a way to collect some extra money for extending the network, possibly with the extra advantage of not diluting Elon's (51%?) share in SpaceX.\n\nWith monthly subscriptions, Starlink should have a very steady income stream, making it suitable for public trading. Elon clearly prefers not being publicly traded, but he has some expensive plans for Mars, and old SpaceX investors may want to see a return on their investments at some time. A Starlink IPO could be a way to make future profits available sooner.\n\nIn any case, to get the most out of this, Starlink should have as many subscribed customers as possible before IPO.

Solar and wind are cheapest, but the more prominent they become in the mix, the more there will be a need for battery storage.\n\n3. We are going to be battery constrained for the next decade. Possibly. With battery capacity eaten up by the more profitable use in cars and trucks. Basically, there may not be large scale, citywide battery capacity to accommodate fluctuations in a wind and solar dominated mix. \n\n4.

Fluor is Texas based (Republican support) and Nuscale provides a lot of good jobs, ideal for compromise green deals. \n\n5. Additionally, the Northeast population corridor will require more nuclear as solar is meh there. I assume offshore wind alone can’t power the now-added needs of DC to Boston corridor \n\n6. Nuscale modular, pre-fabricated and shipped in reactors will provide price stability, which will erase the anxiety over massive overruns. Plus, the small reactor design is far safer (and earthquake proof). At 4.2 bucks a watt, always-running, we may see a growing demand for nuclear.\n\n7. Fluor is engineering and construction firm that will benefit from an infrastructure plan, for a company with 8 billion in annual revenue (give or take), and Utah’s first Nuscale reactor costing 1.5 billion, it is easy to see how there may be an opportunity here.\n\n** Central to the thought process is the assumption that electrical demands will go way up, but that we will be battery constrained which will inhibit solar and wind from becoming MAJORITY dominant in the energy mix due to the instability and inconsistency**", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Electricity demand doesn't go way up.

I collected around $240.00 as a result of 3 puts I sold last week.\n\nThe risk of a CSP, and on this particular stock, is assignment. My strike price was $9.00 which I think is over valued on the stock, so I don't actually want to own it at that price. This is because I think BTC is going to retrace back down to sub $9k, and when that happens it will drop the price of MARA back to around $1.00-$2.00 range. Imagine holding the bag at that low price when your cost basis was $9.00 (minus the premium so close to $7 + change, but still).

Thank you for the explanation and yes it made perfect sense.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "In the event that you think the stock price will decline (a lot), you have a couple options (heh) with options. \n\nYou can do a bear put or call spread where you buy & sell OTM puts (or calls) above the current price maybe .30 delta or .20 delta for the additional safety. This strategy caps your upside & downside, but the downside can be pretty nasty still.\n\nYou can sell naked calls above the current strike (and collect premium). This strategy has a capped upside and unlimited downside risk (because the stock price can go to infinity in theory). For additional risk, you can combine this with shorting the stock itself.\n\nIf you think the stock could make big moves in either direction (upside or downside), you could buy a straddle or a strangle. A straddle spread is buying a call & put at the same expiration & same strike price. For example, you buy a call & put at a strike price of $12.00. The underlying will need to move enough in either direction to make this trade profitable, which means it's a volatility play. You want a lot of volatility (lots of price change in the underlying).\n\nA strangle is effectively the same thing, but the strike prices are different. For example, you buy a put at a $10 strike and a call at a $14 strike price. This spread is a little bit cheaper with the premium, but relies on the same principles as a straddle in that you want a lot of price movement, and you want lots of volatility. Ideally you want IV to be increasing (not decreasing) over time, and you want to do this when you think the stock price is going to move quickly in the near future (such as an earnings week, you expect some bad news, bitcoin tanks, etc.)\n\nThere other bear & volatility plays that I'm not covering. \n\nThere's a great book called The Bible of Options Strategies: The Definitive Guide for Practical Trading Strategies by Guy Cohen which lays a lot of these out. \n\nHighly recommend it if you want to get some ideas.

I honestly doubt that their fall had absolutely anything to do with their earnings or actual material financial position so much as the news of their completely fake truck, the fact that the original CEO lied about the genesis of the design, and ultimately the gutting of the deal they had with GM that resulted from those two things. I mean NKLA put out earnings reports with earnings listed in $0.003mn and it all came from installing solar panels on the CEO's ranch but the share price didn't budge.\n\nSecondly, it's more likely that NKLA is/was more susceptible to these trends because people were actually buying stock thinking they were getting in on the TSLA train that they missed the last time around. The real gains aren't driven by this when it comes to options they're driven by delta and gamma hedging from MMs lowering their risk profile by accumulating shares of the underlying for the contracts they sell. Options volume is a \\*significantly\\* better indicator of market direction than almost anything else, especially these days when fundamentals seem to not mean shit anymore.\n\nIf you take RIOT for example, they were (and still honestly are) a pennystock crypto farm whose rise has been ENTIRELY because of Bitcoin. If you overlay the charts it's more or less point for point following the value of Bitcoin. Its action at this point is completely consumed by the motion of Bitcoin and has nothing to do with its underlying fundamentals or earnings.

{"title": "🌹PSTH Warning Shot & Q&A - I've Done Well in This Market - I am Here to Help You - Please Don't Be On Team-FOMO When This Monster Stock ROCKETS", "selftext": "Hello r/wallstreetbets\n\n***First order of business, I assure you I am not here to pump targets. Just levelling with the WSB community, which I have come to love and value.***\n\n***Second order of business, before you dismiss this play, read at least a bit to understand the nature of the Tontine structure. Amazing value and big reason we see some many heavyweights gobbling up this stock. Literally stuffing their faces with PSTH, they are.***\n\nI started posting about Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd ($PTSH) around a month ago.\n\nHere are my DDs in order of appearance. The last one sums up and provides updates. The comments section in the first one is most instructive for people who are at least aware of the SPAC.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\\_dd\\_klarman\\_buffet\\_ackman\\_the\\_unicorn\\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k83mpz/psth\\_and\\_the\\_ever\\_present\\_difficulty\\_in\\_finding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k83mpz/psth_and_the_ever_present_difficulty_in_finding/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kixho7/psth\\_pershing\\_square\\_tontine\\_holdings\\_ltd\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kixho7/psth_pershing_square_tontine_holdings_ltd_the/)\n\n**My DDs have garnered a decent conversation in the comments threads.** I've learned a lot through that process, so thanks. I hope you have learned something too. Ultimately most of us are just trying to learn and lock in enough capital to make life easier and more enjoyable for ourselves and our families. To be part of WSB in that joint endeavor is special.\n\n**This is a perplexing SPAC. It has the dubious distinction of being BOTH THE BIGGEST SPAC EVER BROUGHT TO MARKET AND THE LEAST REPORTED ON IN THE PRESS.**\n\n**Notably, its gotten some attention on reddit and Twitter.**\n\nIn any case, I bring a short message below about how attractive this thing is, in addition to the info above. I have my positions locked in already. I have dramatically, dramatically changed a big portfolio around to dump the majority of my capital into this stock. I am holding it for 12 mo at a minimum (likely at least 40% until retirement) and have made appropriate lifestyle modifications to plan for that outcome, even in this crazy market.\n\nI am just convinced that this stock is not being publicized for some sinister reason. I don't want to go all conspiratorial but I really think its media malpractice for them to not be letting people know about this investment vehicle.\n\n**CNBC HAS CHAMATH ON EVERY FUCKING DAY AND THEY NEVER HAVE PSTH ON. EVEN IF ACKMAN DENIED THE INTERVIEW, THEY STILL DON'T EVEN COVER IT. DID CRAMER LOSE MONEY WITH ACKMAN???? WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE????**\n\nI digress...\n\nIf I dumped everything I have into this now and quit investing, I would retire with the wealth of the last ten generations of my family combined, and I am not from a poor family (sorry).\n\n**Anyways, here it is. Its something, some say, rivals the likes of which we haven't seen.**\n\n**--The PSTH Play--**\n\nPSTH warrants have a strike price of $23 and so every 9 common shares you own now pre-merger allows you to buy 2 additional shares post merger close at a price of $23 per share. AKA TONTINE.\n\nRight now $PSTH is $3.03 above the strike price of $23 at $26.03.\n\n**So for the price of 9 shares today ($234.27) and buying 2 additional shares at the Strike of $23, you will own 11 shares in the future which means your average cost is actually (($234.27+46)/11 = $25.47 (TONTINE).**\n\nTargets really ultimately don't matter for us. **Bloomberg, amazing. In-n-Out, wonderful. Stripe, holy shit. SpaceX, we are in a simulation and Elon Musk is the overlord, what the fuck is happening, omg we are going to mars.**\n\nRegardless of who Ackman picks up, you’re essentially guaranteed to have a low entry price here and be in the money **bigly**.\n\n**TONTINE TRICKS: Oh and it’s possible you can get 3/9 or 4/9 additional warrants for every 9 you own, thus bringing the average price DOWN EVEN FURTHER. The warrants are only given out for shareholders who hold through the merger and there is a set amount of them that go out to someone!**\n\n\\----\n\nOver the weekend a warm calm came over me. I feel I have investigated this play for months and I have learned a lot about investing and life in the process.\n\nUltimately, I have only felt as sure about something as I did with Tesla in March of 2020 when the stock was trading at $385 before it split (equivalent of $77 today, with TSLA trading at $660).\n\n**I am envisioning a 250% gain in the next 4 months.**\n\n**Merry Christmas WSB! And Stay Safe & Lucrative...**\n\n[🌹](https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/rose-emoji/#:~:text=The%20rose%20emoji%20can%20be,signal%20alliance%20with%20democratic%20socialism.)[🌹](https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/rose-emoji/#:~:text=The%20rose%20emoji%20can%20be,signal%20alliance%20with%20democratic%20socialism.)[🌹](https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/rose-emoji/#:~:text=The%20rose%20emoji%20can%20be,signal%20alliance%20with%20democratic%20socialism.)\n\n[PSTH.

The warrants trade on the exchange now. This already happened with the original PSTH units with ticker PSTH.U. In sept, the units spilt into PSTH and 1/9 warrants.\n\nThe same will happen with PSTH ticker on merger, in other words, PSTH splits into the new ticker and 2/9 warrants at price of $23.\n\nI don't know if you will have to call your broker. Just email their customer service now and you'll know everything tmr specific to that broker.\n\nIn terms of the rest of your questions, they are covered in my last DD. But in brief, the meat and potatoes of the story is that the warrants are exercisable either 30 days post merger, or July 2021, whichever is later. Once the exercise period opens you can buy the shares at $23. You would need capital to buy them yes. You are free to buy and sell any amount of stock at any time, its yours. So yes, you could, in theory, wait for the LOI bounce and sell some stock off to cover the future purchase of the $23 warrants if you had no other capital. Most people aren't going to do this if they are intent on trying to stay in though, because the more commons you hold, the more warrants you get...\n\nBased on my understanding and reading, the cash in the vehicle was $20 per share on IPO, its called NAV or net asset value. That's just cash. Right now the stock is trading at $26 and that's what we mean when we are saying the stock is trading at a premium. Technically in buying a share, you are paying $26 for something that has a cash equivalent value of $20, aka the huge premium, found by dividing 6 by 20 and multiplying by 100 (30%). Of course this is a simple way to look at it because it doesn't factor in the value of the vehicle re: investor list, likelihood of success, incentive, etc.\n\nSo that's what you get back in any case, based on my best reading. I think there is technically speak of sub $20 but in reality I think you can just choose to redeem at $20 instead of going through with the merger. \n\n**The $20 per share is just cash in the account, so its always there.** \n\nAll that to say that this worst case scenario thinking is bananas.

I think the news of an acquisition is going to dwarf anything pertaining to wsb/twitter-related movement. The thing to keep in mind is that Ackman is hunting.
