Stocks are volatile investments, they go up and down and the valuations of the underlying companies are constantly in flux. Thinking you can sue someone when values go down is incredibly naive. The market places weight on certain people‚Äôs opinions, which results in prices moving up or down - that‚Äôs simply part of the whole process.

They operate on a system of consent, mostly - violations are resolved peacefully through mutually agreeable settlements rather than through costly and difficult litigation.  This works best for both parties - the company gets to keep its head down and minimize damage via these super light slaps on the wrist, while the SEC gets to maintain an appearance of authority.  That last one is crucial, because the SEC is surprisingly small and corporate litigation is incredibly complicated and difficult.  They don't actually have the resources to even *begin* to police the whole public securities market in depth, so every case is chosen carefully to make an example and losses are major blows to its ability to do anything.\n\nIt's also just notoriously difficult to prosecute white collar crimes at all, since intent and state of mind can matter so much and can be difficult to prove.  \n\nSo the SEC followed the script with Musk.  The original settlement was a complete joke considering the brazen securities manipulation based on what was *at best* a clumsy misrepresentation (funding secured).  All it did was require Musk to do what he should have been doing anyway (get legal to sign off on material statements) and carried basically no personal consequences for Musk or practical costs of any sort whatsoever.  It's the kind of settlement that makes people chuckle at how toothless the SEC is - basically just a promise to play nice and no real consequences for brazen and possibly criminal reg fd violations.  \n\nYet Musk thumbed his nose at even that, which caused the normal SEC/company dynamic to dissolve.  The SEC still really doesn't know what to do with him.  They'd probably like to make an example of him, but if they overreach or bungle it and fail to make that effort stick, it would have serious negative consequences for their own authority.   Of course, Musk is walking his own fine line here by flirting with *federal felonies* that could see him spend serious time in prison.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">\tThe SEC still really doesn't know what to do with him.

They could probably waste some time wringing another meaningless settlement out of him so he can proceed to ignore it, but I feel that they're much more likely to bide their time.\n\nThey also have a different factor that I didn't mention before - they're very hesitant to be seen as harming shareholders.  That means they usually follow the market in meting out destructive punishments, lest they be seen as a bigger harm to shareholders than the original offense.
