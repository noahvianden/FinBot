The tax software will assume you make that rate every paycheck and will tax you that new rate in IRS P15 for $1500 of $116 with standard withholding.

All of this goes along with the philosophy of effective altruism: doing good most efficiently. If you are interested in maximizing your impact, look into \"Effective Altruism\".

I don't know as much about [openphilanthropy.org](https://openphilanthropy.org), but I know they are a name that gets brought up a bit in the Effective Altruism community. They have some overlap with Givewell in that they try to identify effective ways to donate money, and then they donate lots of money themselves (they are funded by a co founder of Facebook and Asana). Also check out [givingmulitplier.org](https://givingmulitplier.org), they will match a percent of your donation.
