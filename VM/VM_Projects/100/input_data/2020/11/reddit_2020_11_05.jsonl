{"title": "Can't make sense of this market, so I'm still doing nothing", "selftext": "I don't know what the f- is going on anymore.  Here's what's running around my head at the moment:\n\n1. Markets sold off before the election on the apparent theory that it was looking to be close/contested and the markets don't like uncertainty.\n2. Markets rebounded in the days leading up to the election as it started looking better for a clear Biden win.\n3. Election is incredibly close and contested, government will likely be split, and yet the markets are rallying super hard.  The prevailing theory is that a Biden win with Republican senate will make it less likely that Biden will attack big tech and increase taxes.\n4. In spite of (3), a split government will also make it more difficult to pass a stimulus package, which increases the likelihood of a double-dip recession.\n5. COVID still spiking but nobody seems to care anymore, which makes it more powerful as a potential risk.  If the numbers keep spiking, eventually that will lead to one of two headlines that people really won't like: hospitals getting overwhelmed and/or increasing lockdowns.  The latter will be much more likely to happen under Biden than Trump.\n6. The rally today seems broader but there were some real breadth concerns yesterday.  Breadth indicators, like the TICK and NYAD, were flat yesterday.  This suggests the rally is being driven primarily by a certain segment of the market (big tech) and not an \"everything is great, pile into the markets\" sentiment.\n7. The ridiculously sharp rally over the past few days has made it extremely difficult to find good entry points on anything.  Stocks have gone from pullback to mega-overbought in 3 days.  Major indices are more extended beyond their 8-day EMAs than since late Nov 2018, shortly before the markets plummeted to major lows.\n8. I've learned several valuable lessons over my years of investing that all seem to be coming into conflict right now: i) Time in the market is better than timing the market; ii) Think long term and focus on weekly charts; iii) Don't make emotional, reactionary decisions; iv) Don't get caught up in FOMO; v) Don't invest based on what you think the market will do, or what you want it to do, but on what it's actually doing.\n\nGiven that I can't make sense of all this right now, I'm sitting on my hands.
