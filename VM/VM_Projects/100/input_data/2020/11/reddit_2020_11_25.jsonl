{"title": "SPCE is far more than Space Tourism, allow me to shed some light", "selftext": "Hello, World!\n\nThe moment is finally upon us for SPCE to start making serious moves and this is pre-revenue, pre-flight, and pre-publicity. So what is all the hype, why are people confident in its future, and why are they right? One this is for certain this is NOT, I repeat NOT, just a space tourism company.\n\nLet me first introduce you to the staff and some key players:\n\nFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\nNoteworthy Investors:  \nVanguard  \nBank of America  \nMorgan Stanley  \nARK  \nBoeing  \nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)\n\nPartners:  \nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nUnder Armour (suits)\n\nTimeline of events:\n\n1. Q4 2020 - Q1 2021: A final round of test flights which were supposed to occur during the window of November 19-23. This was delayed due to the New Mexico lockdown. COVID depending this test flight could still possibly happen before the end of 2020, if not very early 2021. This test flight will mark FAA approval and will be carrying a revenue generating payload, being the first revenue to be generated by the company...well...ever.\n2. Q1 2021: Sir Richard Branson himself will take a flight up marking the start of commercial operations, the start of publicity and marketing, and the re-launch of ticket sales. So far roughly 600+ tickets have been sold and these will be the first clients to go up. Notable clients include: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Russell Brand, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, and Ashton Kutcher. The interior of SpaceShipTwo has 16 cameras which will be engaged during the duration of the flight and will capture these stars, quite literally in the stars as they float around in microgravity for several minutes. This will be recorded and surely uploaded to their social media. I imagine some of these individuals like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga will attempt to shoot a music video using this footage. Ticket sales will also resume again at this point.\n3. 2021: For the rest of 2021 Virgin Galactic will be sending clients to space all the while they will be pushing profits in R&D for future endeavors, such as the hypersonic point-to-point travel which will be discussed later. They will also be building out more Spaceports and ships in order to conduct more flights. According to the last investors meeting, each spaceport is predicted to generate $1B/year.\n4. Around 2025: The hypersonic point-to-point ship will be complete and ready for commercial operation. This will revolutionize human travel. To put it into perspective, the International Space Station circles the globe in 90 minutes, and when this plane is complete, so will we. Preliminary indicators suggest that a trip from NYC to Sydney, Australia would take roughly 30 minutes.\n5. The possibilities are as limited as space and I won't make your eyes bleed as we talk hypotheticals. I do however want to address highly likely revenue streams we could expect.\n\nRevenue Streams:\n\n1. Space Tourism\n2. Hypersonic point-to-point travel\n3. Space Force [https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/](https://spacenews.com/traditional-launch-services-may-not-suit-the-needs-of-the-future-space-force/)\n4. NASA Contracts ( astronaut training, payloads, taxi services, etc)\n5. Booster Services \n   1. Now, there is no news on this, but this is my prediction and what I would attempt to achieve. As hypersonic travel becomes the standard way for humans to traverse the globe there will need to be a way to make it possible and affordable for the general public. Virgin Galactic cannot achieve this on their own and current airlines (Delta, Southwest, etc.) cannot convert to Spaceship companies either. With Virgin Galactics unique approach and design, they could  become a booster service for airlines. Airlines will need to design a space plane that is capable of hypersonic travel and Virgin Galactic will use their mothership to carry these planes to sub-orbit.\n6. While Virgin Galactic is currently operating in the sub-orbital space, I am sure they will begin working on deeper space projects for asteroid mining, moon operations, etc.\n\nCommon Objections and Rebuttals:\n\n1. Who would be able to afford this and even if they could, why would they?\n   1. There are around 42 million people in the world with a net worth of $5 million where $250k is extremely affordable. The price of the ticket is the same price of chartering a yacht for the weekend. Except instead of playing on a boat for two days, you go to space for a few minutes. Yes, the complete trip lasts around 90 minutes, but we are talking about going to Space. Virtually anyone would say that's something they long to do because that is human nature, if you look at people with high net worth they spend their money on much more ridiculous things. Not only is it human desire to want to go, it has the \"Johnson's effect\" as well. The Johnson's effect is an old sales analogy, where someone in your neighborhood would say \"Oh did you see the Johnson's got a new Porsche?\" Inclining you the observer who has the capital to feel the competitive nature and want to also have said clout. So yes, there is very much latent demand on this service. As explained earlier there are already 600+ pre-sold tickets including highly renown individuals and 900+ who have reserved a slot for a future ticket purchase. Note that these ticket sales only stopped because Virgin Galactic stopped them and will resume ticket sales Q1 2021. Virgin Galactic could currently handle 50 flights per year per plane and has recently finished their second plane, meaning they can handle 100 of the 1400 pre-purchased flights over 2021. So, even as Virgin Galactic scales, there is enough customers already to cover operating costs and the development of new planes for several years.\n2. Wow so you get to go to space for all of two minutes?\n   1. People who say this are people who can't afford it. That might sound harsh, but it is that simple. Very few humans would pass up on this opportunity for such a magical thing if they could actually afford it. \n3. It's not really \"space\"\n   1. Who cares? You get to experience microgravity and float around. You get to see the curvature of the Earth. You get to officially be called an astronaut. The media will not be attempting to point out this very minute, arrogant point. Again, only people who can't afford it will be pointing it out purely out of jealously or disbelief in the Space Age that is upon us.\n4. People only invest in this because they can't invest in SpaceX.\n   1. Not true. First off, they are completely different markets. SpaceX is orbital, Virgin Galactic is sub-orbital. A SpaceX tour would take you into deeper space for around a week and costs somewhere around $52 million. Secondly, even if SpaceX is a direct competitor I hardly see how that's a bad thing. Competition drives commerce, and to have Elon Musk being your direct competitor, that would only bolster Virgin Galactic. Thirdly, there is potential for partnership between these two companies in the future. A collaboration of completely different and unique technologies to overcome the challenges of the Space Age. Finally, SpaceX news and Elon Musk hype will mean space news and space hype, also helping Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat I imagine by 2035:\n\nSpaceports all across the globe, connected by the Virgin Hyperloop (for those who don't know it's another Virgin project that allows humans to travel faster than the speed of sound through tunnels). At this point, Virgin Galactic will already be partnered with other major airlines who have created space planes, very much reducing the cost and barrier to entry. Meaning any human who would have normally have flown \"first-class\" will now have the ability to end up anywhere on the planet in under an hour. Virgin Galactic will also partner with shipping companies and if you're impressed with 2 day delivery, how does 2-hour delivery sound? Packages moved via space plane, then into a hyper loop to your distribution center, and finally automatically driven to your home via autonomous AI. All the while Virgin Galactic is innovating new technologies for deeper space missions, working with the Space Force, and continuing space tourism.  \n\n\nThis is not some flashy new technology, this is the revolution of human travel.  \nThis is not sci-fi, it is simply sci.  \nThe future truly is now and we all have an opportunity to be a part of it.

There will be no noise pollution. \n\n2. It is a more green form of travel. As it’s boosters only ignite to get it to sub-orbit.

Look at the digital transformation...20 years ago people were just starting to use the internet. Now every company uses computers and the internet, it’s part of the norm. I don’t think this will be normal travel for 15-20 years and will remain a high price item for the elite for several years before it’s readily available to the masses, just like the internet was.\n\nTo your second point, I disagree because of my example of the internet and many other examples of technological advances that require coordination. This is what we do as humans. We create something new and novel, we integrate it into society, we make it become mainstream. Without that concept we would still be using horse drawn carriages.\n\nFinally, the ticket price range is high, most certainly.

Virgin Galactic has said they are targeting individuals with a net worth of 1-5M, there are roughly 42 million of these individuals worldwide. Imagine only 1% (which surely is low) use the space tourism feature. That is 105B in revenue. That is only if 1% of the target market utilizes only one revenue stream VG will be offering. \n\nBeing available to the masses is a dream, and a far away one at that. Will it happen eventually? Of course. It always does. But who knows how long it will take to get to that point. My point being here, a target market of individuals with a net worth of 1-5M is a large, large market. VG does not even need to become available to the masses to be successful, that achievement would simply bolster the success. \n\nThat’s just one revenue stream too, we are talking gov contracts, shuttle services, research opportunities, education opportunities, sub-orbit commerce, sub-orbit transit, booster contractor, luxury experiences, Space Force, etc.\n\nEven if this was “just a space tourism” company, that market alone is a 2T market with SPCE being a single offered pure play.

The price to do this even in 10 years will be extremely high. The average flight time for travelers in the US is 1.5 hours or roughly 486 miles per trip. The need for hypersonic travel with it's increased risk (due to lack of trials), the high cost, and lack of need makes this seem very impractical.\n\nYou'd have to actually run the numbers on what that fuel consumption is. But I am guessing it is not as low as you think it is. That also doesn't make it green. \n\nNot all human desires are the same. The need to get to australia in 3 hours versus 20 is usefull, but not for flights costing 10-100x as much (they aren't going to be building fleeets of these things off the bat)\n\nCargo shipping is an interesting idea, but there likely is better option than what you're suggesting. \n\nOrgan transplants medical devices etc. Make up a minuscule portion of all shipped goods.

Since they are writing most TSLA options they have no choice but to buy the underlying - they cannot cross-hedge with written options, since they are the source of 80%+ of options writing activity. Note that any delta-hedging they are holding is locked up hard: selling it to indexers would mean holding naked call options, which no-one of that size is crazy to do. They cannot sell these shares at ***any*** price.\n- **Covered calls** by retail and by small and mid-size institutionals. These are often 100% delta-hedged: when you write a call against 100 of your TSLA shares you set aside *all* of them. These shares too are inaccessible to S&P 500 indexing demand, at **any** price: selling them would mean you expose yourself to the risks of super high-risk naked call option ...\n\nSo if you track down the Tesla stakes of Citadel and Susquehanna reported in 2020 and extrapolate their position reports with OCC open interest data you get to some crazy high stakes currently (over 20%) due to the TSLA run-up this year and the steady increase in options open interest, which is 10x the size of comparable high-tech firms (!).\n\nIf you add in covered call inventory, you get a couple more percentage points.\n\nBut even if it's \"just\" 15% of the float, that's enough to close the loop on the \"Infinity Squeeze\". (Which will not be 'infinite' in the literal sense - I'm sure Tesla will issue new shares if the price is right, plus even the highest conviction Tesla shareholders have a price at which they are willing to temporarily part with their shares.

Very few funds **of any type** have this high TSLA allocation currently. This means that there might be a shortage of shares to be tendered to passive indexers on December 21. (!)\n- In Q3, after the S&P snub of TSLA there was a big reduction in institutional ownership: 13F institutionals went from 60% to 50%, a huge divestment cycle. The S&P announcement caught them flat-footed: they now need to increase this to 70% (!) to become equal-weight to the benchmark. Another 15% needs to go to passive index funds.\n- Short interest got lower. TSLA is still the largest short by value, but number of shares went down to 6% of the float, possibly further down to 5% today.\n- I'd mark the demand from 'actively managed funds' into the longer term purchase column. Current TSLA levels at ATHs might already be nosebleed level few fund managers would risk as an entry price. I.e. their TSLA purchases could be phase delayed, in the next 1-3 months. I.e. we could see a correction after the S&P 500 event, quickly absorbed by active funds and followed by another rally.

{"title": "An In Depth Look Into Roblox(RBLX) And Why I Am Buying Come IPO Day", "selftext": "Alright guys, so a couple of days ago I took one too many Adderall and in order to burn through the high, I went through Roblox’s financial statements in depth. And let me tell you, the numbers I found in there, literally makes my bull cock hard. Let me show you why in this post.\n\nFor this analysis I will first start off with a general intro into Roblox; more specifically, I will talk about what it is, what it does, and how it makes its revenue. Then I will examine the micro factors by looking at the company’s financial statements and identify any notable patterns and items of interest that can affect future profitability. Let’s begin.\n\n**What Is Roblox And Where Does Its Money Come From**\n\nRoblox started off in 2004 as a platform for human co-experience which is done in user-generated 3D digital worlds that the company considers to be the “new form of social interaction” (*This part is key, social interaction, it is what sets Roblox apart from a lot of these gaming and social media companies that I will get to later on)*. From there, growth at the company is driven primarily from investment in technology and two mutually reinforcing network effects: content and social. This means that the more high-quality content the users create, the more additional users are attracted to the platform, and the cycle repeats. While this is going on, the company profits off of this through two main revenue streams: the sale of its virtual currency Robux *(Its primary source of revenue)*, and subscription to Roblox Premium. Both of these I will get into later on.\n\nPutting all of this together means the company is **NOT** a gaming company like EA, nor is it purely a social media or user-generated content company like Facebook or YouTube; rather, the company is a mix of all three. I say this because unlike a traditional gaming company like EA who spends millions each year developing a new game that may or may not turn into shit with their fanbase *(every A.C game after Ezio)*, Roblox just sits back, relax, and let their own content creators do the heavy lifting by creating games on their platform which draws in the users, which in turn purchases the microtransactions on Robux and subscribes to Roblox Premium.\n\nNow, the reason why I say Roblox is similar in some sense to Facebook and YouTube is that on Roblox you to can create friends and social groups with people you meet in real life and on their virtual world. There you can exchange ideas, build worlds together, or just play games and chat to each other. Much like a Facebook account, some people log on to Roblox purely to chat with their friends for extended periods of time. Now in terms of YouTube, the biggest similarity Roblox has with the content creating company is that Roblox’s content creators are **PAID** **and paid well.** In 2020, its content creators are estimated to make $250m, that’s more than double the $110m they made in 2019 (*The money Roblox pays to its content creators are called Developer Exchange Fees on their S-1*). The creators earn money whenever a user spends their virtual currency in one of their games **and** how much time premium users spend in their games. For some of their games, Roblox will share as much as 70% of the proceeds with the content creators [(https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/#:\\~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in%2Dgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/(https:/venturebeat.com/2020/07/28/roblox-expects-to-pay-250-million-to-its-mostly-teen-developers-this-year/%23:~:text=As%20mentioned%2C%20Roblox's%20developers%20are,of%20Premium%20subscribers%20in-game)). So unlike YouTube, where they try to penny pinch anyway they can, Roblox actually recognizes that their content creators are the key to their growth strategy and will make sure that they are well compensated in order to sustain their growth engine and judging on the fact that their daily active user (DAU) growth is a whopping **96.86%** YoY based on their Q3 figures, it’s probably a winning strategy (*page 107 of S-1*).\n\nLastly, it is also important to note that a lot of the growth in DAU and bookings is driven by the pandemic lockdowns, but a look into the company’s operating metrics will show that the company has enjoyed significant growth in users, hours engaged, and bookings well before the pandemic, which means that the company should be able to continuously grow at a significant pace even post covid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hq6r394ysf161.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=d58768665b55dcd618de9cffec49bbc8b7c702be\n\n**TL;DR** Any analyst saying Roblox is a ‘gaming’ company is the equivalent of them saying Tesla is just another ‘automobile’ company and giving it a $200PT ([Roblox S-1 IPO filing released - cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/roblox-s-1-ipo-filing-released.html)). They’re retarded and so are you if you’re listening to them. Roblox is a mix of a gaming and social media company with explosive growth in DAU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Financials**\n\n***Balance Sheet***\n\nLooked at the statement and its absolutely fucking solid. Here is a snapshot so you know I’m not pulling this out of my ass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwqw0i74tf161.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcfbd4c78af77777b555a046d08ff922f2979ad4\n\nAs you can see, both current(1,212,259) and total assets(1,489,541) are greater than their current(904,302) and total liabilities(1,436,664). This means this company is both liquid and solvent so it is strong on a balance sheet perspective. One liability I want to focus on however is their deferred revenue, which is by far the largest liability the company has on their balance sheet. For all you non-accountants out there, deferred revenue is unearned revenue, meaning they received payment for a service that they have yet to provide. For Roblox, that service refers to the perks that come from the purchases of Robux or subscription to Roblox Premium. The company also refers to the purchase of Robux as bookings and will accrue these liabilities and the revenue generated from them over the average lifetime of a paying user which is 23 months(*page 23 of S-1*). This means that this liability will not result in future cash outflow, which means the company will be less restricted in investing more into itself or continue to pay its content creators.\n\n**TL;DR**: Company is solid based on balance sheet fundamentals. Their largest liability is their unearned/deferred revenue which isn’t going to create a cash outflow that will impact future investments.\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mphvkz9ctf161.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c416e32fc628b5f29e58091be1e993c7ce0bf13\n\nThe first thing you are going to notice is the explosive revenue growth of 68% (588,675 / 349,888) which shows that the company is doing really well during the pandemic. In addition, the company is able to keep its core operating expenses growth stable to its revenue growth while keeping its other expenses such as G&A and Sales/Marketing to a bare minimum. This shows that the management of Roblox knows how to run a tight ship. In addition, it can be argued that a lot of these expenses are really an investment into the company’s own future, such as paying content creators (Developer exchange fees), investing in infrastructure, and research and development. Honestly, I would prefer the company to run up losses on these expenses early on in order to help scale its growth than to have them do it later on.\n\n**TL;DR:** Revenue growth is high for years and the majority of expenses are attributed to the company investing those proceeds into the business and its operations which in turn will help fuel future growth.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is a truly unique company that combines all the best characteristics of the gaming, social media, and content creation industries. The company has solid fundamentals, strong revenue, and user growth, and will most likely significantly scale their business upwards for the foreseeable future.  Even though this company is most likely going to turn into a WSB meme, the fundamentals themselves support large price appreciation in the stock.\n\nGet in retards.\n\nI plan to buy stocks when they IPO, and switch half my holdings into leap calls when options become available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Stop asking me when is the IPO date or at what price they will IPO yet.

All of the games run on the same engine and have the same basic model and character characteristics, but are vastly diverse in their content and objective. There’s massive RPG’s, hangouts, ship building, hell, there’s even sex games. Anything you can think of, it probably exists in some form on roblox. There’s even an entire economy and there even used to be a currency trade but they removed that.\n\nBasically what I’m trying to say is, if you doubt the longevity or the ability for time to be sank into this game, don’t.

Whatever happened to government banning lootbox business model from EA? It only takes government adding microtransaction to anti-gambling law for Robux to get killed. the fact that Roblox target very young kids as opposed to EA targeting 14-17 year old means Robux will get regulated a lot harder.\n\n3. Competitors. I haven't played roblox but it seems like a cross between Minecraft, Gmod and VRChat, with microtransactions. All those games were created by some indie devs, you don't think Jeff Bezo's can create something like Roblox but targets all age groups when he throws billions of cash at it?\n\nBasically, Roblox need to become superior version of VRChat to survive. would be interesting to see how they pivot from very young kids to being the go to virtual reality hangout place.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 1 month on [**2020-12-25 19:47:43 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-12-25%2019:47:43%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0z2zy/an_in_depth_look_into_robloxrblx_and_why_i_am/gdl2rt7/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fk0z2zy%2Fan_in_depth_look_into_robloxrblx_and_why_i_am%2Fgdl2rt7%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202020-12-25%2019%3A47%3A43%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20k0z2zy)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "how do i get notified when IPO date is announced? is there an app for that?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "When is the IPO date?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Now this is what a DD should look like.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Too much words", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NDg0MDU1MjIyMzIyNzAz/rob-lowe-9542502-1-402.jpg", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "How can non-americans buy the IPO Aus etc", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Will they have options available?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "what do you think is a fair market cap for the company, a few years from now?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I thought this platform was for age 9-12", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Asking for a boomer, how is Roblox different from minecraft?

{"title": "Palantir will crash after lockup period", "selftext": "For Palantir, though, years of venture-capital investments have created more than enough shares to launch public trading: roughly 1.64 billion, though that grows to 2.17 billion in a fully diluted formula that includes vesting options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I write this, about 497 million shares are outstanding. So, my quick math tells me that about 23% of all shares fully diluted are currently outstanding. About 1.7 billion shares could potentially hit the market after the lock-up.\n\nWith all this as background, here's how to put this in perspective:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A flood of new shares can come onto the market if the owners of those shares decide to sell. If the share price has soared since the IPO, then early investors may want to reap the rewards by selling some of their investments, or if the price has tanked, then they may look to reduce their exposure. However, it does not mean they will sell either way as they could look to retain shares in the hope of prices heading even higher, or because they believe shares could recover any value lost in the early days as a public company.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"...if there is a sharp increase in the number of available shares available in a company then this pushes the price of a stock down. It is not unusual to see a stock's share price fall on the first day that the lock-up shares can be traded. In fact, if other investors (not subject to the lock-up period) begin to sell in the days before the lock-up expires, then this is a sign that they expect the share price to fall.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, depending on the exact timing of the reporting of results, traders can start to play with the potential dips and the price stabilization shortly after.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn theory, investors could short PLTR perhaps 7-10 days before the lock-up expiration. Or, traders could use short-term options - especially puts - to play the downside opportunity. It's unclear if there's enough downside potential to make this work. Then again, even a small dip could magnify profits because of option leverage. Please note that I'm talking here about short-term trades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLockup ends Dec 31st", "id": "k1185o", "created_utc": 1606339432.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Look man, I'm mad that I didn't buy into PLTR too but you don't see me writing cope posts about it", "score": 173, "replies": [{"body": "It’s not too late, you can still double your money, PLTR to the moon 🚀", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "If I see a seeming DIP to 27 in the next trading day, I'm in for 5k shares.\n\nAs per OP hysteria, nobody will dump the stock when it's doubling every week.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "THIS is the way", "score": 25, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ban", "score": 125, "replies": [{"body": "Hold the fuck on.

Anyway Palantir did a hybrid direct listing, meaning early investors got access to exactly 20% of their shares on day 1, with the remaining delivered after earnings in mid January. Also not all investors will get their shares delivered instantaneously at the same time. It will take a period of time (maybe a couple of weeks?) for everyone to get their shares, as this is exactly what happened with the initial 20%. Also with the way the stock has mooned, these guys have already made back >70% of principal just on the initial 20%, so there's a good chance many will see the value of the long term play and not sell.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ban", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ah Corona maintains a calendar.
