This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your Bitcoin. don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. \n\nNot your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it from. \n \nI recommend using [Mycelium Bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) for Android.\n\nMake sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase.

The most important lesson I have learned being involved in the market since 1985 (MSFT was my first buy) is the market is the purest supply and demand ruling place on the planet.

The $0 commissions makes it a lot easier to get out of a bad choice. I think the \"changed everything\" is the Internet and access to so much information. It used to take days to research a stock. Wait for the WSJ to get delivered, go to the library, look up companies. Now you can make a stock decision in 15 minutes (if that long) Having broadband in homes allows us to have all the stock trading platforms at home that used to be reserved only for a broker or a very rich guy. The other big thing is SUPPLY and DEMAND. I do not know the number, something like 6000 less companies are publicly traded than just 15 years ago, so many companies have bought back stock shrinking their float. Then you have SOOO much cash chasing looking for a place to grow. The top 5 banks in the USA have over $5Trillion (with a T) sitting in accounts. That is just the top 5. All the big brokerage houses count their cash in customer accounts in the Trillions. It was recently reported Chinese citizens (not the banks) have over $6Trillion in brokerage accounts. The stock market is THE great economic equalizer. Anyone now with just a few bucks (when I bought MSFT in 1985 I had to put $8000 in my Merrill Lynch account to open it) a cellphone, good internet access, now has their own business. No employees to hire, no store front to rent, no advertising, no finding customers. About 90% of small business fail their first time out. Probably about the same for someone getting into stocks. If you fail, lose it all, SOWHAT, You can regroup, get better educated and start over at ANYTIME. My Father in Law bought his first stock at 67 years old. It changed his entire retirement and probably helped him live longer. I started trading accounts for both my children in highschool.

This my friends is typically the exact reason your brain will defeat all your rules, your checks and you might even start lying just because you think its possible to make it back.\n\nI've lost everything, I don't own any property, my parents are poor and not from the US, I'm actually homeless right now but I have a good paying job in a Bay Area company. The morale of the story is that it's all fun and games if you play and stick to a small % of your savings and ABSOLUTELY don't refund your account if you take losses, denial is a stronger force than you think, and addiction to day trades is very real. I repeat, addiction is very real especially with the gamification of most trading apps (webull, robinhood, power etrade). Anyhow, I will carry over my big loss for years while my wife is going to use my savings and buy regular SPY so we can at least offset the possible gains in 10-15 yrs...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't be the next me.\n\n\\[EDIT\\] I can't post the chart atm, besides ETrade app really sucks and Webull might be somewhere still but its really painful to open those apps..\n\n\\[EDIT2\\] I know next weeks will see SPY and QQQ skyrocket with speculation on PLTR and shit exploding. But that was already the reason i kept chasing in September before the drop, the reason I chased this summer and before. There always will be money to be made on the market, but its more of a guarantee when its just shares and you hold them. I know this is straight /r/investing shit. I guess losing my saving account in my 30s made me enough of a loser to reconsider my choices.\n\n\\[EDIT3\\] I'm going to go to therapy, yes.\n\n\\[EDIT4\\] When you lose you might start making excuses like \"if i didn't have to pay my student debt\" or \"if i didn't need to make enough money for a downpayment\" you think you wouldn't have traded that risky. But it's all on you, it's all your responsibility and you stayed because you managed to make those lucky moves that actually printed and you hoped you could do it again.\n\n\\[EDIT5\\]  Missing 25k due to a change of broker last year (charles schwabbs to webull), during the 5 days transfer FSLY lost 15%\n\n[https://ibb.co/kxPKvb6](https://ibb.co/kxPKvb6)\n\n[https://ibb.co/jGBQ6wp](https://ibb.co/jGBQ6wp)", "id": "k30ty7", "created_utc": 1606615520.0, "score": 1802, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 500, "comments": [{"body": "Your loss sucks, it really does.

Would love to hear this.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ahh the decision process is still 'WSB' based in the sense that we are looking for massive growth and trying to capture it cheaply.\n\nI made a bunch in FSLY and other stocks along the way but did not employ this tactic and have regretted it.\n\nYou are at a great age for this approach because you should be all about risk (reasonable not yolo risk) and not about cash preservation. You have time on your side.\n\nSo the goal here is to listen to all these tards, do some of your own research quickly and not fence sit and pull the trigger on these cheap stocks that have potential.\n\nIn the beginning you take risky positions and once you get to a number that you like, 1k 5k 10k 50k, then take 70-100% of the profit on those positions and immediately roll that into either LEAPS 2+ years out or shares if you want a more conservative approach. I go with LEAPS and plan to convert those to shares within 6-9 months. \n\nI go with ITM LEAPS not OTM LEAPS, they cost more but not as much as the shares and try to do this as quick as possible, don't wait until the stock runs up into the 40-50s because at that point you would have too much downside risk.\n\nNotice how each step reduces risk, first 2-4 weeks is high risk ATM or OTM weekly to 60ish days out on the expirations. Then we take profits and move to safer 2+ year leaps then after 6-9 months take the LEAPs and move to shares, reducing risk further. Still at any point things can crash but they are free rolls so you can stay in them unless you need the cash which you should not be needing at all.\n\nSo nothing special, the strat can still fail miserably by striking out on the original attempts but I think it works well.\n\nAt your age you should be taking shot after shot and hustling on the side to fund each shot. The key here is once you hit a winner and convert to leaps then to shares is not to touch those winners and let them run.

Risky positions, ITM LEAPS, and stocks to hold on. I totally get the idea behind it, decreasing the overall risk with each phase and using the risk, in one phase, to gain leverage for the next phase.\n\nHere's the thing: I live in Germany, we don't have student loans or debts (thankfully). I am debt-free, live at my parent's house, and work a good job besides my studies.

I managed to have $6000 in the stock market and $16.000 in savings on accounts. Materialistically, I have everything I could need. I'm not writing this to brag or be a douche, but to give you the reason for my thoughts.\n\nThe question is: Do you think it makes sense to go in risky positions or can/should I skip this phase, use the 6 grand, maybe add something on top, and get ITM LEAPS? You wrote about the numbers (1k, 5k, 10k etc.) that I need to feel comfortable with. In the end, it is up to me and I have to execute the trades. I don't blame anyone for advice whether it was right or wrong.

Something that's never been seen by human eyes, never computed by any type of algorithm, something our wive's boyfriends wouldn't even pay attention to. This is the WallStreetBets sentiment and hype detection.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that WallStreetBets is #1 when it comes to finding trends and finding stocks. It doesn't matter if this is after-the-fact that the stock price shot up 50% in 2 days. It doesn't matter that the stock is something nobody paid attention to until finally the whole world start trading it (PLTR). What it comes down to is the fact that WSB will find literally any stock after it has already mooned. Stock up 10% for the day? WSB knows about it. Stock up 20% in the last week? WSB has already traded it. It's genius.\n\n**Here's the kicker**. \\*Most\\* times after a stock has mooned once and WSB hops on the trend, the stock will go through another 1 or 2 periods of \"mooning\".

Next stop - Wave 2: Comment volume peaking at roughly 5% of all comments after the stock price went from $33 to $43 in one day. Massive spike in chatter around the ticker and the stock price continues it's meteoric climb for a whole month. You can see another 1 or 2 waves where sentiment rises after big moves in stock prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CRSR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0scjg83257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbaca71ea742ea0c1431dde33304aa009c277ba8\n\nNext up is Corsair Gaming. None of you autists even knew the stock existed 2 months ago. We can see wave 1 happened early November with small gains in the stock price. Sentiment was steady as autists everywhere were drooling over consistent gains for the first time, loving every minute of it, kind of like when you kiss your cousin for the first time. Wasn't long after we see wave 2 and 3 of the trend where the stock continues it's mission to Mars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LI** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alxnfwz257261.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9ebd19dec396d22ad8146e8fb1732277cd10e0\n\nNext we'll look at LI. 99% of you, including myself, don't even know what this company does. All we know is that STOCKS ONLY GO UP. The first wave happened 3 weeks ago when comment volume reached 5% of all the comments on the sub-reddit. Stock price shot up 30% in a single day. Sounds insane that the momentum would continue upward, but it has. Not only that, the stock price has gone up another 30% in the last 3 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PLTR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs5zaon357261.png?width=1630&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6c883545d1bf1b550890d7c4ad4518dafdde02\n\nThe PLTR sentiment chart is nothing short of magnificent for a sentiment junkie like myself. Comment volume has been rising at the same rate as the stock price. On Friday roughly 50% of discussion comments mentioned the ticker PLTR. Something that you either loved or found incredibly annoying. The only other tickers to ever break the 50% comment volume barrier are Tesla and NIO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhat's the next meme stock going to be? Is it GME? Do we regress back to PRPL gang? Nobody really knows, but one thing I can agree with is that wave 1 of the trend is almost always the early adopters with gorilla balls willing to risk large amounts of capital on a stock nobody's ever traded before.

What will happen with the 'game' that is stonks, as happened with 'the game' that was poker, is that the optimization process will ruthlessly continue upward. Right now, we're in an inefficiency phase where herds of literal retards are given positive feedback on otherwise inoptimal decisions, allowing them to profit mindlessly, right along with those who understand the rules of the game. The democratization of information that is the internet has finally come into its own and its ability to move markets is now 'a thing'. Gone are the days of pumps and dumps being done by rogue Chinamen in Yahoo chat rooms. Now, they're done here and so far, the ride has been nice.\n\nHere's what comes next\n\nStonks, as with poker, will eventually cull the weak and mediocre. Former stuperstars will be unable to cope with 'new trading' as their old rulebooks no longer apply. Fundamentalists who were early to discover the basic physics of 'the game' will no longer be able to win on that alone as more nuanced, dynamic strategies are applied that are much harder to get ahead of and require a lot more cognitive (and computer processing) horsepower to manage for profit.\n\nThe thing is, this process could take YEARS to unfold, before some particle physicist working at Renaissance is able to figure out the +ev trade, beyond just having an intern scan WSB for clues and watching the velocity of retail orders to frontrun. Its possible the tardfarm that is WSB could continue to produce tendies for us all for quite some time, but the party will eventually come to an end. The fleas believe they're all kings of the world... until the dog begins to scratch. So few of you have ever seen a 1999 or an October 2007, you just don't understand. You saw March of 2020, and you think you know... You don't. One day, stonks don't go up... for a while. They go down. Fast... and all your money goes away with no hope that it comes back any time soon if ever.\n\nThere is another side to this and for many of you it a return to day jobs, to desperate pangs of regret and for a tragic few, dangling from a n00se... Make sure your parents post the reason why in the obit, so it can be posted here as a cautionary tale. \n\nJust wait. You'll see.

Either way wsb hype will lag behind actual stock movement. Usually the shit has peaked by the time autists are name dropping it left and right on here, and by the time your average lurker/normie buys in it's either a dud or you can get one or two more climatic orgasms out of it. \n\n2) Meaning you can either diversify in anticipation of a wsb shout out, which would result in at least some autists throwing away their 401K to buy in and elevate stock price, or develop some great pull out game. \n\nAssuming you get in early enough, you can ride that curve as long as you recognize that the majority of the time *you're probably in a fucking over hyped, over speculated bubble,* and your window of opportunity probably isn't jack. \n\n99% of this shit will never be Tesla. Hell, Tesla might even end up being fuck all with normie companies seriously getting in on the electric vehicle game now. If you play the stock version of Vatican Roulette and have great pull out game, then you can still come out ahead *before* it turns into 80s Argentina. The key with that is to be more humble than greedy, (which......the fuck am I even saying on here? Self control? lol), if you dropped 10k and only came out with 15, don't even trip. You still came out ahead. Wallow in your dopamine hit, cause the realistic chances of getting to 20-30k are dogshit, at best. Assuming wsb isn't talking out their ass and you lose it all. At least that's the mentality you should have imo. Wsb *will* pump some other bullshit up in the near future. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.\n\n3) The democratization of the stock market will get sorted out and stabilized eventually, but will be an utter shitstorm for the world economy in the meantime. Of course, I don't have a crystal ball, but I can tell you that entire countries, if not the majority of the world, have been fucked in the ass repeatedly by *very smart people who actually know what they're doing.* Or at least thought they did. Then turn around and give this power to a bunch of normies who think free money goes brrrrr. That's like putting a dude who's never driven a car in the cockpit of a 747.

{"title": "$PSTH DD - Klarman, Buffet, Ackman - The Unicorn Hunter Goes Live - Pay Attention", "selftext": "🚀🚀🚀 **DD - Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd ($PSTH)** 🚀🚀🚀\n\nIn recent weeks there has been a lot of interesting action in the stock market as it relates to $PSTH. Despite a lot of noise and speculation (if one were to go looking), the major news outlets and press have been quiet. This DD makes the argument (based on the available evidence) that Bill Ackman’s blank cheque company, PSTH, will announce a merger with Stripe, securing a \\~10-20% position in the company and taking it public.\n\nThis can be discredited as conjecture, but most things on WSB can be and are before they are realized. There is simply too much evidence here in favor of this happening to be ignored any longer.\n\n**Required Watching once you finish skimming this DD:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4) **(outlines all relevant info from the man himself)**\n\n**EDIT: The comments section of the thread is as useful as the actual DD itself. A lot of minutia in the comments that serious players should be aware of.**\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Key Information/Timeline of Events:**\n\n\\- In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH – the SPAC raised $4B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B making it the biggest SPAC ever.\n\n\\- The SPAC is designed very differently than others and incentivizes long term holding. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n\\- Ackman has given several interviews since the listing of PSTH arguing that they are very well positioned to target and capture a unicorn (large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company.) Early speculation included AirBnB. While Ackman held talks with the company, they didn’t get to the point where his people got an inside look at the financials and he basically said they had no idea what they were dealing with despite liking how the company looked on the outside.\n\n\\- Ackman in the same videos talked up Stripe as a quality company but one not ready to go public, specifically citing managerial deficits.\n\n\\- Stripe has been talked up by some in the press as the next Google. They control a large percentage of online payments at present.\n\n\\- Ackman has publicly disclosed his biggest misses as companies that make money based on money, giving Visa/Mastercard as the obvious example.\n\n**- In the weeks since those interviews, several key events have taken place as follows:**\n\no Following Ackman comments, Stripe initiates a dramatic position filling hiring spree with focus on positions needed to go public/SPAC\n\no Square executive joins board of PSTH\n\no **Seth Klarman** ($30B hedge fund manager “the next Buffet” and noted value investor, disclosed a $400M position in PSTH).\n\no  **Guuggenheim** buys 22,000,000 $PSTH shares\n\no **Warren Buffet** has slashed his JPM position almost entirely potentially signifying a shift towards other financials? With online sales through the roof (this is just getting press in the last 2-3 days in earnest), he could be making a final gigantic long-term play for $BRK before he passes away). What better choice than a money maker based on money.\n\no Warren Buffet is secretly building a large position and hiding it from the press/pushing filing deadlines as much as possible. $BRK on record saying they want in on energy or tech giant.\n\no There is a large and undisclosed PSTH somewhere in the market that is not Klarman’s.\n\no In recent days the pre-market movement has been very odd. Several million positions. Pre-market on Friday for example, stock was up nearly **9%** for some of the morning. Has consistently hit after-market highs the next day. The data is trending in a very clear direction.\n\no The most cited (and really only) example of why this won't be Stripe is some troll that one of the brothers made on twitter. If they are indeed in negotiations, or getting ready to re-present to PSTH given all their new hiring, and given PSTH work in securing top of the line investors (**Klarman, Guggenheim, Blackstone, Ontario Teacher's Union**), this wouldn't be a bad negotiation tactic. They know the PSTH offer must come with some concessions.\n\n**Relevant Documents/Links:**\n\n\\- Ackman interviews: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4)\n\n\\- Klarman position: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html)\n\n\\- Guggenheim position: [https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu](https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu)\n\n\\- Buffet leaves JPM: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193)\n\n\\- Buffet secret position: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html)\n\n\\- PSTH (Ackman) recent letter to investors, see PSTH section: [https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf)\n\n\\- Yolo Capital Mgmt twitter feed outlining much of the same events: [https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt](https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt)\n\n**RE WARRANT STRUCTURE:**\n\n\"To clarify: if no public shares redeem for cash, then each share gets 2/9 distributable tontine warrants. If half of all public shares redeem for cash, then each remaining share gets 4/9 distributable tontine warrants.\" [https://spacalpha.com/insights/analysis-of-tontine-warrants/](https://spacalpha.com/insights/analysis-of-tontine-warrants/)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the end, we don’t know anything for sure but the evidence here (there is more to dig up) is very compelling. Holding a stake, whether its Stripe or something else, is likely a play with limited downside and insane upside. The warrant structure (“Tontine”) alone is so appealing.\n\nGood luck. This position, if it turns out to be Stripe, or some similar quality company, could be life-changing for those who invest enough and pick up and make the most of the warrant structure. People like Seth Klarman don't play games. You shouldn't either.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Positions:**\n\n3,000 Shares with avg price \\~$23.80\n\nA couple of June 2021 Call Options\n\n...Both are green atm and I believe will become much, much greener as time ticks on....\n\n**And again, watch the Ackman video:** [**https://www.youtube.com/results?search\\_query=bill+ackman**](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bill+ackman)", "id": "k3bf1o", "created_utc": 1606664569.0, "score": 720, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 671, "comments": [{"body": "I got 2.8m riding on this bad boy.

You highlighted many of the important points, but there are a couple more bullish things you didn’t mention:\n\n• Ackman’s fund bought $1B worth of units at $20 a share, so the same price as IPO/NAV, that gives Ackman a huge incentive to make a deal that gives value above NAV. Ackman has made about 50% in his funds the last couple of years, so he likely expects a similar level of appreciation to even take on this big of a risk. \n\n• Ackman’s fund has warrants that are only ITM at share price above $23 a share, so, again, we have a structural incentive that makes it extremely unlikely that they’ll put through a merger where they don’t believe that the shares will be worth more than $23 a share (obviously, the more the better). \n\n• Ackman has staked his reputation on being able to make this deal, so it’s very likely that he’ll keep looking for a deal rather than giving up and redeeming shares for NAV, as that would leave a bad taste in the investing public’s mouth. \n\n• Ackman has made plenty of mistakes, but his overall record of recognizing value and knowing what the market will like is one of the best in recent Wall Street history, and because of all factors above, he’s highly incentivized to take only a deal with significant share price appreciation and to complete the deal at some point.\n\nMy take is: \n1. Buy the dips through calls or shares whenever target hype goes up and then deflates (great buying opportunity after Bloomberg speculation).

Look for a price target of about 365.14. If SPY holds support, the first test will be 364.71 ish if she gets there.

Think of this analysis as entering and exit points.\n\n**11/26 SPY Recap**\n\nSPY must have overeaten during Thanksgiving because it was sluggish on Friday (11/26). SPY fell out of its uptrend channel around 9:30 AM ish MST and dipped to its low point of the day, 362.58, before quickly rebounding. SPY reached a high of 364.18 and closed at 363.67.\n\n[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/e4ge9fwnl7261.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab5da8a655f9f863a015293dfd4a043fcf29111)\n\nSPY has been consolidating since 11/24 midday. It is currently at the top of its consolidation rectangle, as highlighted below. We shall see if SPY can break out on Monday or if it will bounce off resistance and head back down to 361 ish and below. We could have one more day of consolidation, based on past charting.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/k1dct1fyl7261.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=868e9285d8a2b311db1ac386cda29c6b363b9939)\n\nFrom 11/25 Recap: “SPY consolidated from 11/9 - 11/13 before breaking out 1.5%. She consolidated for about 2 days and 9 hours, from 11/13 - 11/17 (over the weekend). However, after consolidating, SPY fell about 1.14%. After the fall, SPY consolidated for about 5 days and 17 hours from 11/18 - 11/24 (over the weekend). Spy jumped about 1.46% before the current consolidation channel.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonday will be the start of SPY’s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.\n\n[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/020y89jnm7261.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d438b4dfe8d9db618a865fea7f284fef6bc5ab3b)\n\nAs stated in an earlier analysis, I'm bullish on SPY if it stays above 358 ish. SPY continues to toy around with a w-shaped recovery as highlighted below. On the daily chart, I'm looking for PSY to break through resistance and find new support. If support looks healthy, you could sell your wife's wedding ring and look at a late Dec. 380c. lotto.\n\n[1d chart](https://preview.redd.it/7epbtq32n7261.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c6775f740717f7413f7a6a515c75bc6b7e45d1)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*EASY MODE ACTIVATED\\*\\*\\*\\* or Merry Christmas You filthy Animal\n\n**11/30 - 12/28 AMD Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa’s Nice List?**\n\n* If AMD punches through 87.18 resistance finds and news support, you could look at a 90c exp. 12/11 and hope that it hits between 90-93.2+ and trim. Maybe even leave a runner for a lotto.\n* If AMD bounces around that price point, you could look at scalping an 87p and trim at that price point, leaving a runner if she breaks to 85-83.\n* If AMD finds support at around 87.18 and bounces, you could look for another 90-92c weekly.

C3 markets itself as an Enterprise AI company founded by Thomas Siebel. For those that don't know, Thomas Siebel created Siebel Systems which revolutionized Consumer Relationship Management and was later bought out by Oracle. Now back to the Enterprise AI bit. Basically traditionally companies go through different vendors for each of their AI and ML needs. C3 aims to fix that problem by offering an entire suite of tools that are inter-compatible with each other causing easier usability and more productivity. They have contracts in essentially every industry with companies such as 3M, Shell, and Raytheon, AsrtraZeneca and received a $95M contract with the Department of Defense for the F35 fighters and the US Air Force for maintenance on older aircraft.\n\n# Why [C3.AI](https://C3.AI)?\n\nI won't bother you with words but I'll let the pictures from their S-1 filing do the job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojd7b196g8261.png?width=2449&format=png&auto=webp&s=94feeb7f9d8e37cccd803983b5a928e613750b05\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpb7nry6g8261.png?width=2449&format=png&auto=webp&s=3651e1b7a1bd403774524bfdfdb88d4b8cb979a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pzly028g8261.png?width=7680&format=png&auto=webp&s=76afb284750b4698c2c57049637600a9a964f71f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvwi9gw8g8261.png?width=7680&format=png&auto=webp&s=22b05a4f6bf3c833982f82666063674e6be99291\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8guycek9g8261.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=1008e2507e9d0afb904fc24a70ca50272dd0cf74\n\n# The TL;DR\n\nSaaS Model-Driven Architecture\n\nGovernment Contracts\n\nIntegration with major cloud players\n\n71% Year on Year Growth\n\n# TL;DR of the TL;DR\n\nPalantir took us to the moon but [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) will make sure we get to the moon.\n\nShares couple days after IPO for the dip then load up on LEAPs when it IPOs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the link to their [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020016443/c3ais-1.htm) where I got most of the information from.\n\n\nEdit: They haven’t announced IPO date or price.

They probably have an actual short position too (don't have to file that in an 13F) they're also underwater on. No one else has a put position this big in the 13F's.\n\nWhat are the chances they're responsible for half the short interest? It'd make sense on why we're not seeing significant covering on GME yet. They're a bunch of stubborn boomers that have collateral in the billions. It wouldn't be crazy if they made a $200 million bet on Gamestop becoming the next Blockbuster when it was under $6. They've made similar bets in the past like their $400 million short on Nintendo back in 2018.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7ttqxuym8261.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b39a443a7d7cdc8d62ede4680a5b540af920f1d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course that $200 million bet would have turned to a $500 million (and growing) that they owe. They might not get a margin call, but surely there's a point where their risk management and exit strategy tells them they have to cut losses instead of paying $100K daily in interests (\\~7% APR fee) on a losing position that's getting bigger and bigger.\n\n**Note:** the short squeeze is just a bonus so don't be a paperhand retard. There's more to the GME play than just hoping the short sellers pay for your lambo. GME is unusually undervalued compared to its peers (0.13x revenues if you're basing it on TTM revenues), it can go up without a short squeeze.

I’ve seen many hedge funds fall for much less than this to be honest. It’s shocking to me how this position and the rest of their shorts were enough to bring down their portfolio. Their risk management really is fucked up and I’m disappointed in them really. There’s a reason you’re never supposed to short stubcos (low equity value that’s borderline underwater/basically an option on highly levered cap structures) because they’re prone to big upswings. GME is unique in that it’s probably the biggest upswing that’s ever happened in these sorts of companies.\n\nI’m not sure they deserve to survive relatively unscathed given their fatal mistakes. They really should have known better. Fucking professionals that get paid 7 8 9 figures die this. I guess Gabe had to sell a good portion of his fund, but it’s a small price to pay for still keeping a multi billion dollar fund. In the grand scheme it’s still going to be a large fund after this so he’s really really lucky.\n\nWhat I’ve learned from this, and it’s not surprising if you really think about it, but what’s surprising is the fact this actually, really successfully happened and the power that WSB exhibited in actually getting together and uniting in their love for a common stock etc. that fish meme that’s been going on is very appropriate. Alone we die, together we are stronger than anyone ever expected. The top 1% own 38% of the stocks. That still means the bottom 99% own the majority, and if they unite they can wield some real influence. This whole battle taking place is sort of like that proxy (even tho I’m sure there are plenty 1%era in WSB).\n\nJust think, there’s over 6 million people on WSb now. If each one has an average of say $25k invested in stocks to invest (which could be aggressive or conservative I really don’t fucking know) in some form of cohesion unity and teamwork like that of a hedge fund making investment decisions - that’s a $150 BILLION AUM HEDGE FUND. That’s the largest HF in the world aside from maybe Bridgewater. Together WSb can systematically invest and dismantle any long/short equity fund (aside from the MM pod shops like P72 Citadel Millenium which you can’t really get a sense of their positions) they wanted if we wanted to be mean and vengeful.
