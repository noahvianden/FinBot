A Home Depot spokesperson declined to share specifics on how much the company‚Äôs average hourly wage will increase after the investment.\n\n‚ÄúIt varies market by market. Our compensation, at all levels, is based on skills, responsibilities, performance and market rates,‚Äù the spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. [According to Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/The-Home-Depot-Hourly-Pay-E655.htm), the average hourly wage for a Home Depot cashier is $11 an hour. A sales associate earns $12 an hour, per Glassdoor.\n\nThe spokesperson said the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of Home Depot‚Äôs 400,000 total employees will receive a pay bump from the new investment.\n\nOther big box chains ‚Äî sitting on big profits as consumers have stocked up on food and cleaning products amidst the pandemic ‚Äî have also opened their wallets.\n\nIn July, [Target raised its starting wage for its store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-raises-minimum-wage-for-store-distribution-and-headquarter-employees-114504219.html), distribution and headquarter employees to $15 an hour. The move impacted 275,000 employees who work at the company‚Äôs stores and distribution centers. Target raised its starting minimum wage to $13 an hour in June as part of a commitment unveiled in 2017 to reach $15 an hour by 2020.\n\nWalmart in September lifted its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 an hour for some 165,000 workers.\n\nThe world‚Äôs largest retailer‚Äôs pay hike comes as the company calls for lawmakers to enact a new stimulus plan for those unemployed because of the pandemic.\n\n‚ÄúI think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it‚Äôs important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience. If you have been let go and don‚Äôt have income, you really need help.

{"title": "If you ain't getting into PLTR, you're missing out - here's why:", "selftext": "Listen up, retards, half of y'all laughed me out the room the [last time I posted DD about Palantir](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j2u1cs/why_palantir_is_not_a_dud/), well fuck all y'all haters because I'm back with more:\n\n**TL;DR - PLTR 150 12/31/21**\n\n--------------\n\nNow let's get started:\n\nSo, Palantir is up 105% from its average low of about 9 bucks. For the autists who bought in at the low, congrats and fuck you. For the retards who fomo'd in yesterday at ATH - I still love you, but [711k? That's ballsy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jw7zed/i_heard_were_doing_pltr_now_my_whole_account_aka/).\n\nNow I'm sure you're wondering: where the fuck is PLTR's ceiling? \n\n#PLTR's advantages, now with some data\n\nI'll admit, most of my previous DD was equal parts BS and equal parts cocaine fueled shitposting that had a semblance of logic and formatting. But this time, I have **facts** in addition to my cocaine fueled shitposting. \n\nRealistically, Palantir's biggest advantage is that it helps large companies streamline their own disparate datasets without needing the companies do anything *to* that data. \n\n**This means:** Palantir clients don't have to change the way they operate to gain additional insights.\n\nEssentially, a client would use Palantir's suite of tools like Gotham to parse through all of their data so that they can make better use of said data. This part from [their IR report](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) gets quoted a lot, but it's worth looking at:\n\n> An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and **generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks** of starting to use our platform.\n>\n> The energy company **identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities** using our software, and the company‚Äôs management is currently **targeting $1 billion in total savings** in the coming year through the use of our platform. \n\nAgain, keep in mind that all of this is happening without the client changing their data - i.e. no need to hire a dedicated team to handle data migration (along with all the risks associated with that), and no need to train their existing team to learn a new method for data entry.\n\nEssentially: with minimal disruption to operations, this client is suddenly able to identify pathways for savings by using Palantir. \n\nThe best part? \n\nThis client can't *leave* Palantir because Palantir didn't *change* anything on the client's end. All Palantir did was give the client a tool that connects some dots between dataset A and dataset B that were previously unconnected. \n\nGet rid of Palantir, and that connection is lost: this is because dataset A and dataset B used to never talk to each other, and they'll probably still never talk to each other. All Palantir did was help the *humans* behind the wheel see the connection.\n\nThis means Palantir's non-government contracts are likely to be very sticky. Moreover, in instances of mergers and acquisitions, the marrying of data is usually a huge headache. If that headache can be reduced, then it smooths out potential friction in operations and allows new acquisitions to more quickly start performing and generating ROI for their new parent company.\n\n--------------\n\n#Palantir's Future\n\nPalantir has a very bright future ahead of it for the following reasons:\n\n- Large total addressable market\n- Clean balance sheet\n- Closer integration with the military\n\nPalantir's total addressable market is estimated at 119 billion dollars. For you retards who don't know what TAM means, I'll spell it out for you:\n\n> Total Addressable Market is a term that is typically used to reference the revenue opportunity available for a product or service. \n\nBut keep in mind that just because TAM is high doesn't necessarily mean that will all translate into income. As competitors emerge, they will eat into that market. But until a competitor can find the 21st century Osama bin-Laden, or help the US military fight an informationized war (more on that later), I don't think they'll be able to hold a candle to Palantir's capabilities. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point: Palantir's balance sheet is sexy as fuck.\n\nDuring their most recent earning call, they revised their revenue guidance upward to 1.07 to 1.072 *billion* in 2020. Let that number sink in. This is a 2500-person company bringing in over a BILLION dollars per year in revenue in what will most likely be incredibly *sticky* revenue. \n\nBut retard, I can hear you say, you didn't see how much they lost. \n\nI did, you asshole. And I'm getting to it: \n\nPalantir's main losses came from employee stock compensation. Namely:\n\n> The company reported a third-quarter net loss of $853.3 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with a loss of $144.1 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Its adjusted loss was $73 million, adjusted for $847 million in stock-based compensation. \n\nPersonally, I don't see this as a loss, because retaining strong human talents in this space will be crucial for Palantir's continued dominance in this particular space. The stock-based compensation accounts for 99.26% of its entire third quarter net loss. \n\nAgain, let that shit sink in. \n\nMeanwhile, Palantir *grew* its revenue: \n\n> Palantir brought in revenue of $289 million, a 52% increase from revenue of $191 million in the third quarter last year.\n\nSo long as Palantir can keep its stock-based compensation at a steady value--and I have no reason to believe that they won't--then, their continued increase in revenue will eventually outpace any such loss in the future. \n\nBut most importantly, they have 1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30th. Sitting on a pile of cash gives them operational flexibility and can help pad any unexpected issues that might arise. \n\nWhich brings us to the final big point:\n\n--------------\n\n#Palantir and the Military\n\n[I'll just link the Q3 earnings presentation for you](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf) because it's got pretty pictures that you retards love. But here are the main points:\n\n- Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense\n- 2-year, $91M contract with US army research lab for AI and ML development\n- Enabling Mission Command for NORAD & USNORTHCOM Joint All-Domain Command & Control (N/NC JADC2)\n\n**Palantir software is becoming the de facto operating system of US and Allied Defense**\n\nWe're moving towards an era of even greater integration and interoperability in the military--not just between different branches but between different nation's militaries as well. One of the key factors that allowed the Allies to kick the shit out of Nazi Germany was a unified command structure. \n\nPalantir is building just that for the US and her allies. \n\nThink of how inefficient the military is, especially a military alliance that spans multiple nations, multiple languages, and multiple different command structures. \n\nThink of how *dumb* your average crayon-eating grunt is. You think Lance Corporal Fuckface is going to learn French or German or Polish so he can coordinate effectively with his counterpart in NATO and call in an airstrike? Or you think he'll just go through a simplified process of calling it in to the US chain of command, and that data gets relayed via Palantir's services to the appropriate French jet on station to deliver some ordnance? \n\n**US Army Research Lab Implication**\n\n[This is the kind of shit](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-help-hunt-down-missile-sites-in-china/) that the US army uses AI and ML for:\n\n- Identifying Chinese and Russian airbases, missile sites, and radars\n- Significantly cut down on the amount of time a human has to sift through satellite images\n\nThis forms the informational logistical backbone in the era of informational warfare. Here is the example image from the slideshow where Palantir is used to [identify an airbase in the Russian Far East](https://i.imgur.com/X2irHFV.png), identifying crucial equipment and logistical nodes that can be prioritized in a war. \n\n**N/NC JADC2 Implications**\n\nPalantir outright states that they're using AI to help provide course of action development to NORAD. It means we're one step closer to Skynet, baby! But more importantly, Palantir placed what looks to be an image of a [SIGINT/ELINT op](https://i.imgur.com/tiqwNu6.png) off the coast of Kamchatka. \n\nBut that's not what you should focus on. You should focus on the fact that Palantir is now a crucial part of mission command in NORAD operations. Y'all remember Desert Storm? How the US Air Force basically clowned on Saddam's army for a month straight? That shit didn't emerge in a vacuum. It took 9 months of non-stop mission planning and 24/7 command and control during the op. \n\nPalantir's mission is to make the planning and command process of a similar op in the future *far more streamlined*.

CPCE is now being fielded across the force, providing commanders with better visualization tools, common applications and new server infrastructure. The prototype will work at the intersection of intelligence, mission planning and execution, providing a single, integrated solution to give commanders a global operational picture to make better data-driven decisions.\n\nFuck all y'all haters", "id": "jwirsb", "created_utc": 1605716569.0, "score": 960, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 362, "comments": [{"body": "You had me at cocaine fueled shitposting.", "score": 290, "replies": [{"body": "Same, im all in", "score": 37, "replies": []}, {"body": "Cocaine?
