Also with that, less risk = less reward. The higher the probability of success, the lower max profit you will have.   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nGood luck everyone!\n\nEdit: TY for the hugs award! Also, I have ZERO problem helping you all out with replying to messages and comments. It's the whole reason I started my YT channel (in my profile)and created this account. So by all means, keep the questions and stock talk coming!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the silver! I truly appreciate it!", "id": "jvub23", "created_utc": 1605624843.0, "score": 365, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 190, "comments": [{"body": "For anyone that's lost on what I just said, since I had a few people message me and I typed this up for them. \n\nSo, the MMM is the Market Maker Move. It's the dollar move that the market makers are expecting the stock price to move in either the up or down direction.\n\nNow why does that matter? The MMM is what is already \"priced in\" to the options that are expiring during the week of the earnings report. So if for a example, the stock price of NIO is $40, and the MMM is +/- $5, then all of the options with a strike price that fall within the $35-45 range will lose money after earnings is reported because the price of the options have that move \"priced in\".  So essentially, in order for you to make money on options held through earnings, you either need to be deep ITM or the stock price needs to move more than the MMM.\n\nThe IV is the implied volatility of the stock. Or how high or low the movement of the stock price is expected to move. So in this case NIO. This is because there's a highly anticipated event this week (earnings). So why does this matter? Another factor that influences the price of options is the IV. For every 1% that IV increases or decreases, the price of the option increases or decreases by the amount that's listed as the Greek known as Vega. So if we know the IV of options expiring this week (the week of NIO's earnings) as opposed to next week's options then we can get a good idea of how much IV is \"priced in\" or how much money we can expect to lose due to \"IV crush\", which is where the option loses value because the IV decreases, which brings down the value of options even if the stock price is moving in our desired direction.\n\nThe next thing is the standard deviations. They're basically a probability equation that I really don't know off the top of my head or enough to explain without looking up, BUT all you need to know in terms of the stock price is that for every one standard deviation increase, the range at which the stock price can increase or decrease from its current price increases in size. So essentially, there's a higher probability that it'll stay between that given range. Now why does this matter? Playing spreads with options, especially for earnings is much, much safer, cheaper, and in some cases gets you paid as opposed to you having to pay for the options. If we know the price range and the probability at which the stock price may stay inside that range, then we can plan appropriately and increase our odds of making money while decreasing our odds of losing money.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, about 80% of options expire worthless. So if we know the information I gave then we can gauge what those options that fall under that 80% are and we can use spreads to increase our chances of success as opposed to buying straight up calls and puts.\n\nCan you make money with straight up calls and puts? Definitely! However, that brings with it lots of risk. With the market in general, especially with options, the higher the risk the higher the reward. But, many would rather risk $100 to make $50 68-96% of the time than risk $100 to make $1,000 at a much much lower success rate. \n\nHopefully that helped.

I doubt that Amazon would fail any time soon, but if they decide to collapse for whatever reason (e.g. failed ventures, class-action lawsuits, government intervention, etc.), we'd be in a recession for years to come when the market struggles to fill what Amazon has been building over the years\n2. If Amazon doesn't fail and the government doesn't break it up, **theoretically speaking**, they will eventually take over every other sector of the economy and everyone suffers because there isn't any competition. There would be no economic growth, no innovation, no new IPOs and ventures that investors can take advantage of, etc. since there's no money left to be made.

Maybe Amazon is talking to them about being a warehouse provider to them eventually (ie if there is one loser here it is McKesson). Pharmacies companies shedding capital etc invested in warehouse sector, similar to how all cell companies in areas rent from companies that solely put up towers.\n\nThe next phase is the one that will be very interesting and where the meat is: insurance companies and their massive customer base. Amazon will have to offer an insurance model of some kind, either an enhanced prime membership etc. With the integration in other pharmacy groups with both insurers and carriers, Amazon will not be getting those customers..., but their insurance prime might begin attracting companies to move their health plans over. \n\nIn my opinion there won‚Äôt be many players left: amazon, walmart, and cvs/caremark.

Those funds essentially need to copy the S&P500 exactly and based on the total value in said funds they will collectively need to add 116M shares of Tesla. The only thing I don't know is if they have to add them on Dec. 21 or can do it a bit before and a bit after. No idea what the leeway is here. One has to assume that if you're an investor and buy an index fund that said they will mirror S&P500 and all of a sudden you find that they are holding Tesla (which isn't yet in the index) you have good reason to be pissed that they are gambling with your cash. You likely have grounds for some legal challenge too. So when do they need to buy?\n\nSecond, there is benchmark funds. These use the S&P500 as a benchmark for their own performance and have some wiggle room to buy more or less of certain shares or even stuff not in the SP&500, right? The managers need to decide how much of Tesla to buy, as I'm sure they will want their own fund to somewhat track the index even if it's not exact. They don't want to be wildly out if Tesla surges or tanks. If all of these funds purchased the shares they need to be equal weight to the index, they collectively need 167M shares. I'm sure they won't do that, but maybe half?

Their overall goal though is to be as close as possible to S&P. This pool is estimated to be around $50b or 15% of the floated shares.\n\nBenchmarks funds goal is to exceed S&P as a benchmark. They could be under/over/same weight as S&P and they may already be bought in.

The cost of vaccine and a booster costs billions, whereas a shut down month costs trillions. By way of recent history, the original Shingles vaccine (Zostavax) in 2006 only prevented 51% of shingles cases, but people took it, until a few years later a better one, Shingrix, came out that prevented around 97% of shingles. Ditto for the concerns of duration of protection with Shingrix, nobody knows how long it's good for since not been around long enough, but when the data comes out, that is the guideline for when to do a repeat booster.\n\nThe supercooling distribution for Pfizer/Moderna is a hassle, and governments are terrible at getting things done, so there will be a shortage of freezers and likely a scrabble to get dry ice (shutting down the rock concerts wont be enough to supply the dry ice).

Because the population spreading/most likely to get the disease thinks its a hoax; and the population most likely to sign up for an experimental vaccine trial is more likely to practice social distancing/quarantine protocols, it is unlikely we are seeing these results in a representative population and this pre selection bias might have introduced some kind of confounding variable that inflates the efficacy. Specifically in their trial design they are basically making a ratio of transmission rates and calling efficacy. If both populations are practicing social distance/mask/quarantine then transmission rates would be massively reduced and as we know small n = big error (in this case it would be the effective n of people challenged with the disease that we can't really measure but are guessing at). So the underlying assumption of a homogenous endemic distribution of the disease in the population is broken.

It was closer to 90/10. \n\nThis is the correct data table: \n\n |Vaccinated|Control|Totals\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nCorona|43|51|94\nNo Corona|38912|4532|43444\nEnrolled|38955|4583|43538\nRates|0.11%|1.11%|\n\n***\n\nWe know Pfizer's trial was not 50/50 because the press release literally tells you \"38,955 [...] have received a second dose of the vaccine.\" How do you take that statement and then reconcile it with a belief that 19,000 people received the vaccine? \n\nEven ignoring that, the enrollment size makes no sense. If you expect a 0.5% incidence in the control population and want to enroll enough patients to statistically demonstrate a 50% efficacy intervention (the FDA minimum to consider vaccine approval) you can get away with fewer than 25,000 people combined across both arms if your split is 50/50. At that number you could lose 20% of the study population to follow-up and still be adequately powered for the study. Pharma companies are not one of us, they do not make a habit of wasting money. \n\nYou are correct that most trials are done with even splits - this is because that is how you get the most power to detect effect size. However, if you need to acquire a large amount of safety data from your intervention group, then an imbalanced design is more efficient. This is the justification for the large study enrollment - Pfizer even stated in October they were keeping some study locations open for the express purpose of getting safety data from specific populations. \n\nIf you need 40,000 intervention patients to ensure the vaccine is safe, you can demonstrate 50% relative risk reduction with way fewer than 40,000 people in the control arm. If you calculate the sample size needed you will come up with an enrollment ratio very close to the 8.5 that Pfizer actually ended up recruiting. \n\nBut Miley, you say, the incidence in your control group is 1.11%, not 0.5%! The trial design was done after the first wave and prevalence estimates reflected lockdown conditions. However, the actual study began to enroll participants in mid-Summer through the end of October, and the incidence is higher than was expected because of the second wave. The first early look was supposed to have been done at 32 cases, but this number was revised upwards when it became clear that the baseline incidence rate was going to be much higher. In fact, by the time the decision was made to change the early look from 32 to 64 cases, we were already at 94. That's how we got this data. \n\n***\n\nSo what impact does this have on the rest of the analysis? \n\nNothing, because the rest of the analysis is also wrong. \n\nAbsolute risk reduction is directly related to the baseline incidence of the disease. If you have a 1% chance of getting corona during a given time frame, a 90% efficacy vaccine will reduce that chance to 0.1%. This is an absolute risk reduction of 0.9% - pretty small, and results in an unreasonably high number needed to treat, as OP points out. However, if the plague is in full swing and you actually have a 10% chance of getting corona during that same time frame, a 90% efficacy vaccine will reduce your chance to 1%. This is an absolute risk reduction of 9%! That's fucking huge - the number needed to treat is just 11! \n\nOkay, but Miley, again, the incidence *from the trial* is 1.11%. Shouldn't that be the number we use? We can use the absolute risk reduction of 1%, right? Number needed to treat is 100, this vaccine is garbage! \n\nYes, the incidence measured from the trial is 1.11%. This is the incidence rate with masking, social distancing, no sporting events, no concerts, online classes, all of the mitigation measures we are currently adopting. Without those measures, what's the incidence rate? It's a lot fucking higher than 1.11% - with uncontrolled community spread, you *will* get coronavirus if you take no precautions. The goal of the vaccine is to get us back to normal so your wife can resume hooking up with guys she meets on Tinder. In that kind of environment, the number needed to treat for a 90-95% efficacy vaccine is *one*. \n\n***\nThis brings us to the last point where the primary endpoint was achieved at 7 days, so OP thinks the vaccine might only last for 7 days. That's the dumbest thing I've read all day and I read OP's entire post. I guarantee you the executive leadership at Pfizer is not greenlighting a Phase III fucking clinical trial for a vaccine that only gives 7 days of protection. \n\nOP seems to think that in this trial, they give you two doses of the vaccine, check to see if you get corona in the next 7 days, and then they just ghost you. That's not how this works. \n\nIn a vaccine trial, people get enrolled as they are recruited and everyone is monitored for disease events until the study ends. Enrollment continues until the target sample size is reached, and then the study closes. Data collection continues until some predetermined number of disease cases are recorded, and that's when the trial is concluded. This trial hit the case target for a primary endpoint 7 days after enrollment ended - this means that the minimum length of followup for someone in the trial is 7 days - the last person to join the trial. There are people in this study who got the vaccine five months ago, Pfizer has been keeping track of them the whole time. \n\nJust look at the numbers. If the overall study length is really just 7 days, then that means the baseline chance of getting corona with current mitigation procedures is 1% every week. That translates into a 40% chance of getting corona over the course of one year. That's very obviously not accurate. In reality, the study length is much longer than 7 days, and that 1% incidence is indicated in relation to that study length, whatever it may be. \n***\nTL:DR The vaccine is fine, buy $PLTR calls", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Imagine betting against pharma companies in a pandemic.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "While I agree that the vaccine is not going to bring back the economy overnight this post is very innacurate.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> But let‚Äôs dive a little deeper.
