MSFT was an absolute game changer more than 30 years ago, and used its unique position to evolve into a very central platform for businesses and government.

For the exact same price, I just bought an 8 month old 530d with 6000 miles on the clock.\n\nTesla's seem very expensive second-hand because they maintain value so well. EVs have thousands of moving parts fewer than ICE vehicles, and Tesla's maintain value (and battery capacity) much better than a lot of the competitors. They're expensive, but for a reason. On top of that, if you bought FSD a few year ago, your car would now have gained $6,000 of value purely from the updated software, which largely off-sets price depreciation.\n\n> People just cannot afford them, and companies would rather spend three quarters of that on a diesel 3-series.\n\nI agree they're too expensive for a lot of people. I'd have a Tesla today if they were half the price, which is why they are aiming to have a $25,000 car out in about 3 years' time.\n\nAlso something to keep in mind is that they're aiming to have autonomous cars on the road very soon. As soon as this happens, people are going to stop buying cars and just using ride hailing. The expectations are that car sales will decline by 80% as soon as this happens, at which point high prices don't really matter as much anymore since it will be companies buying those cars.\n\nThat said, companies who spend three quarters of the Tesla price on a diesel are just shortsighted. Tesla's are much cheaper to operate and maintain, less likely to break down and maintain value much better. Over a 3-5 year ownership, especially with high usage, Tesla's are much cheaper. You can already see this in the taxi market for example, where (at least in my country) practically every large taxi company uses exclusively Tesla's.\n\n> I'm assuming in China, these EV's are cheap as fuck, which is why their market is doing so well?\n\nYes, which is why it's an unfair comparison. For example, the best sold EV in China is the Wuling Mini EV, but Wuling only sold 28% more Mini EVs than Tesla did Model 3s, even though the Model 3 is almost 9 times as expensive.

They have an amazing website and cool product line, but when it comes to the battery tech, the moment Tesla is set up for the Asian market, I see it going extinct. To be the new Tesla you’d have to have to own the power line from the raw material to the finish product and everywhere in between. Tesla is selling from point A to Z, and able to make POS transactions on every stage in between. \n\nNIO is like selling from P to Z - it’s got a cool integration system with smart homes and cars and will do well while backed by the Chinese government’s EV incentives. Long term. Tesla will have his factories set up, hold a large market share for the cars, and then everyone will be buying their power and batteries from Tesla. As they are poised to be the best supplier/manufacturer of batteries in the world.\n\nThen this doesn’t even get into big data. Where Tesla has the Dojo supercomputer system - as more cars enter the fleet, the more exponential the data becomes - enhancing the service faster and faster with every car on the road.\n\nTesla’s also already proven itself. It is no longer ‘breaking in’ to the industry, it has proven its concept, and successfully started to scale. Now it’s literally just a moment of waiting as the factories are being built. Even the Fremont factory in California hasn’t reached full capacity, the moment this investment is payed off - the factories are at full capacity - it will be near impossible for a competitor to come into the market, as you’d have to have the same few decade race as Tesla did to even break in to an industry that is growing as fast as AI. \n\nIT’s not like if you started now you’d be 5-10 years behind Tesla. All the data you’d need to catch up, you may as well be a century behind\n\nNIO was a fun idea, it has great market retention, most Chinese citizens who have a nio reccomend it to their friends. It has that status. Short term, like 5 years out even, probably great stock.
