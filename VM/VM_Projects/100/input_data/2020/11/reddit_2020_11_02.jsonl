Because you can only exercise the long leg, you have no control over the short leg. Under certain circumstances, like both legs of the spread expire ITM, but you fell into a coma and couldn't do anything about the position voluntarily, then maybe your broker will automatically exercise the long to cover the very likely assigned short for you.

It's much more useful to consider time and moneyness (delta). Those, assuming little or no change in volatility, are the primary influences on distribution of outcomes.\n\nFor example, if you have around 30 days to expiration on a 30 delta call, you can estimate a roughly 30% chance to expire ITM (delta is approximately equal to the probability of ITM for a short). The accuracy of that estimate falls off as you approach expiration, for example, a 30 delta call on expiration day has less than a 30% chance to expire ITM. IV also influences the accuracy that estimate. Rising IV increases the probability of expiring ITM.\n\nVolume and OI have more to do with how cost effective your entry and exit trades are. The lower the volume, the \"fuzzier\" the market is about the true value of the contract, because there aren't enough completed trades to \"discover\" the price. The fuzzier the value, the less credit you may collect at open (vs a higher volume contract), and the more you may have to pay to close.

If they had to, they could easily fall back to do commodity traffic as a contingency, but they're not there yet.\n* FSLY just shored up their gap in perceived security feature with a acquisition that's already accretive to profits.  \n* FSLY is giving turned-down, conservative guidance which can sometimes create a nice coiled spring reaction if they beat.  \n* Some of their recent Q's disappointment was due to \"timing issues\" which is code for customers who didn't get their programming done on time.  Presumably those customers will come on line soon.\n* Fastly's technology is hands down the most superior.  It's actually overkill for many customers, but you'd rather have tech that's best of breed than the other way around.\n* Fastly is just launching something nobody else has, which is seamless computing at the edge.

A/R too high so $TSLA must be overstating volumes.\n\n4. Model Y will never sell. It’s an oversized M3.\n\n3. Weak EU volumes reflect absence of demand. \n\n2. Excluding reg credits, TSLA doesn’t make money. \n\n1. As new EVs launch, TSLA EV share will fall.\n\n___\n5/ $TSLA A/R too high. 20-25% of TSLA volume comes in final week of qtr, and 70-75% of that is financed. Until TSLA gets the check back from bank, which takes 3-7 bus days, sale goes to A/R. This qtr-end delivery wave is easily confirmed by registration data. DSO 14 appx. right.\n\n4/ $TSLA Model Y will never sell.  $TSLAQ argued Y was just a big M3. Anyone who has ever driven a Y can tell it’s a small SUV, new TAM for $TSLA with 40% of the market. In 3Q, Y became TSLA’s best selling U.S. model, a feat likely to be repeated as Y expands globally.\n\n3/ $TSLA doesn’t make money ex-reg credits. First, it’s not true. 3Q Reg Credits after-tax of $264M were way below GAAP NI $331M. Second, TSLA’s pricing strategy is to reduce prices as costs fall while still making money. Absent reg credits, TSLA would have kept ASPs higher.\n\n2/ $TSLA EU demand is getting crushed. In 2Q, TSLA’s Fremont plant was closed for 7 wks. When it reopened, it directed significant resources to make Ys, which were only sold in US. Net result: Only 13K TSLAs shipped to EU inn 2Q. This doubled to 27K in 3Q, and will be 31K in 4Q.\n\n1/ $TSLA share will fall as new EVs launch. TSLA’s EV share continues to increase every quarter (3Q 26% vs FY’19 19%), despite new EV launches from Audi, MB, Porsche, and VW. Reasons incl lower battery range, higher cost, poor software/FSD, and ICE brand taint.
