{"title": "Citron’s NIO short report is fake news", "selftext": "This entire selloff was pretty much fueled by a few sensationalist headlines such as \"Citron Pulls Plug on NIO\" along with a price target pulled out of the ass of a non-analyst with a history of making false and misleading statements intended to manipulate the market to his benefit. If you're unfamiliar with Andrew Left, the name Citron Research probably sounds like something along the lines of a legitimate investment firm when you see it in a headline. It’s really just one guy with a blog and a lengthy track record of lawsuits for baselessly attacking stocks in an attempt to profit off their downfall. He [sold NIO at $10 in 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/citrons-andrew-left-sells-out-of-chinas-tesla-rival-nio-2019-02-26) and has clearly been fuming over the profits he’s missed in the past months. Keep in mind, this guy has [shorted Tesla](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/andrew-left-shorting-tesla-stock-again-reasons-citron-betting-against-2020-2-1028876660) over and over without any luck, calling its meteoric rise artificial and insustainable, purely driven by hype. Now he’s shorting NIO on the same premise. Calling out its lack of short interest (aka optimism) also fails to corroborate his rationale for the stock falling to $25 - why even include that? \n\nOn to his main point, which is that Tesla’s Model Y is expected to move to a starting price of ¥275k (~41k USD), spelling trouble for NIO’s competing ES6 and EC6 (currently starting at ~54k USD each). This ¥275k price projection is based on one Chinese analyst’s report and can essentially be taken with a grain of salt until Tesla says something confirmatory. Additionally, Left is either being incredibly naïve or incredibly disingenuous to assume NIO would roll over and allow itself to be outcompeted by a cheaper car model. This is a Chinese company we’re talking about. Left conveniently failed to make any mention of NIO’s upcoming economy models such as the ES3 and ET5 (the former being less than a year away with an expected price point of ~30k USD), nor did he write at all about NIO’s uniquely lucrative BaaS program or its ventures into fashion, entertainment, formula racing and more. Taking this into account, I don’t think the competition is as steep as Left claims. Tesla’s market share in China has rapidly declined in recent months as native EV companies push it out, going from [21% in August](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Electric-cars-in-China/Tesla-conquers-China-s-EV-market-with-taste-of-affordable-luxury#:~:text=Tesla%20doubled%20its%20China%20sales,to%2021%25%20from%206%25) to [10% as of 3 days ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/11/10/teslas-market-share-is-sliding-in-china-and-has-cratered-in-europe/?sh=31e2e2a36d7d). Left cites NIO’s 3% market share in China as a weakness, omitting the fact that only a year or so ago, this figure was very close to zero. NIO is years behind Tesla in terms of production capacity; he’s comparing apples to oranges and he knows it.\n\nIn conclusion, Andrew Left’s $25 price target is clearly not based on numbers and calculations - it’s based on how much he wanted to profit off this squeeze, which was probably millions. Guy is a scumbag short seller abusing his power to manipulate the market and I hope the SEC takes a close look at him.", "id": "jtug83", "created_utc": 1605322610.0, "score": 276, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 204, "comments": [{"body": "We went over this like 8 hours ago.

I've seen anti-masker arguments that masks don't keep out 100.00000... percent of the viruses (true), and they assume that if you take in even one virus then you're sure to get a diagnosable case of COVID-19 (not true) so they say why even bother with masks. The most recent estimate I've seen is that the dose to be \"likely\" to get COVID-19 is in the hundreds to thousands (not every virus will successfully attach to a cell and reproduce), and masks can reduce the number of viruses transferred, thus benefiting both the mask wearers and the people around them.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the people who would like to work harder to reduce COVID-19 infections think that if a test can detect even a single fragment of the virus genetic material (which PCR can do if you run it enough times), then \"you've got COVID-19\" with a whole list of assumptions about what that means. Detection of a \"teeeeeeny weeeeeny little bit\" of COVID-19 genetic material could mean that you were exposed to a small number of viruses but fortunately all the viruses \"died\" (became nonfunctional) before encountering a suitable cell, and now they're just floating around harmlessly, or it could mean the start of an active infection (which will get worse later), or it could mean the tail end of an active infection (still able to spread the virus to others but fewer viruses in the body and much less infectious than previously), or it could be a long period (typically 6-8 weeks?) when there are no longer \"live\" viruses but there are still \"dead\" viruses or virus fragments present.\n\nSee the short video at [https://twitter.com/PPathole/status/1327309694805835777](https://twitter.com/PPathole/status/1327309694805835777), an explanation by Kary Mullins, founder of the PCR test, that PCR tests can be misinterpreted especially with large number of cycles: \"...there's just very few molecules that you don't have at least one single one of them in your body...\"\n\n> for now...\n\nGood point.

For buyers who are price conscious, there are many options in China whereby they can easily save $16k - 30k. But the reality is people are lining up to buy NIO, paying significantly more for NIO EVs, and that should tell you the price is but one factor, and insignificant factor when it comes to choosing NIO over others. NIO has built up its own EV ecosystems inside China, starting with the best EV (design, quality, technologies), comprehensive range extension mechanisms - swappable, upgradable, fast charging and mobile charging, and life enhancing / social fabric forming NIO Houses/Spaces, along with NIO Life. The pioneering BAAS remediates the anxiety over battery and affords NIO owner base cutting edge technology and advancement in battery and others. \n\nThe proper way to look at why people choose NIO while paying more and why NIO is growing over 100% - 200% YOY is that NIO brings about a value proposition that is far and above any of its competitors, a value proposition that its competitor is unable to match unless they change their business model, and a value proposition that has been and is being recognized by more people. \n\nAndrew Left is in it all for a quick buck, and he is the one that got convicted by HK SEC for spreading false information and stock manipulation, and got his fund confiscated and himself kicked out HK market. Andrew Left, a guy with no moral or conscience, became concerned all of sudden that NIO price is too high. He got trapped as NIO price continued to zoom up after he opened his short / put positions, and the ER next Tuesday will easily lift NIO to above $70, judging from over close to 50% rise of EXPEV and LI after ER this week. Therefore he has to do something quick and dirty by releasing this hit job that really has nothing to try to get himself out of this bind. It is comforting to see NIO closes at $44.50, $3 higher over the close of last Friday. I bought more today with this kind of discount, and I hope and believe more traders  will jump in Monday and Tuesday to pick up more calls leading to the Q3 ER. We know NIO delivered 12205 EVs in Q3, and I am seeing NIO to guide fore 16500-17000 for Q4, and that will be another doubling YOY. By Wednesday, Andrew Left and Citron will all become a blip in the rise of NIO, as he should. Let's hope he will add more to the $3 billion shorties have contributed to the rise of NIO.", "id": "jtvol0", "created_utc": 1605327669.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "Good thing everyone has already gone all in", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone except people who haven’t heard about NIO until today cuz of the short report.", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "I went all in at 52 lmao, but I know that Nio isn't just some meme stock, I've done about 2 weeks of research on this company and its founders and I'm very bullish.

That model has already failed before (See: Fisker--despite their resurgence) and it will fail again.

{"title": "[TSLA vs. Other EVs] Why Do Happy TSLA Investors Cheat on Lord Musk with Other Shitty EV Stocks in their unrelenting search for more tendies?", "selftext": "Listen up you retards. \n\nSome of you have been enjoying a fling or two with the exotic foreigners like NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, SOLO, etc. Sure, you are a tall retard. You are just attracted to small, cute EV cars (or in the case of SOLO, retarded looking small Canadian EV with 3 wheels). They happen to be Asian but no, you don’t have a yellow fever or some kind of Asian fetish.\n\nYou retards often underestimate the emotional and financial ramifications of your actions. Papa Musk has been good to you. TSLA has made you lots of tendies in the past. But today, we are going to look into why happily invested retards like you cheat on TSLA and why that’s a mistake.\n\n**NIO’s been making me shit load of money. I am never going back to Papa Musk**\n\nI know it’s difficult to learn your lessons when you are retarded, but haven’t we gone through this before? You don’t bet against Papa Musk. You tried with NKLA and thought that talent-less hack Trevor Milton was some kind of second coming of messiah until you saw that fake ass video of their truck “rolling down the hill”.\n\nNow I am seeing that you moved onto William Li. Sure, the guy is no Trevor Milton. He seems to have the right background (i.e. education, past track record as an entrepreneur, etc). He also has right investors in NIO, such as Tencent, Temasek, Baidu, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. But Musk already has his trump card called Model Y and I will explain to you what will happen over the next 12 months or so.\n\n**Chinese EV Demand**\n\nAccording to Barrons, China started to crack down on gasoline cars few years back. Due to congestions and pollution in the major cities, Chinese government started limiting the issuance of license plates in China. Not only is it difficult to obtain license plates for gasoline cars (i.e. it’s almost like a lottery system), the cost to obtain one is more expensive. Then let’s say somehow you were able to obtain a license plate and was able to afford one, there is another layer of complication: you can only drive gasoline cars on certain days of the week.\n\nBut with EVs, the government makes it much easier to get an EV plate than gas plate. There is better parking, less tolls, and no restriction on driving days. This is shifting the demand to EVs because the process is much easier to obtain a plate for EVs and overall cost of ownership is lower. \n\n**Model Y’s Importance**\n\nSome of you ungrateful retards may have been disappointed by the announcements from the last Battery Day. But Papa Musk, did give you updates on the future of the battery technology (which will be covered on a separate rant), but more importantly on Model Y.\n\nPer Bloomberg, Tesla’s Chinese version of the Model Y, which will be locally made in China, will be a single biggest threat to NIO’s growing dominance in the electric SUV segment of the Chinese EV market over the next 12 months.\n\nNIO was doing superbly lately but on Friday, Citron Research released a bearish report on NIO that increased competition from TSLA will become more intense with the launch of Model Y in China.\n\nThe biggest advantage will be the price point. When Model Y is released in China (manufacturing will begin in 2021 and delivery also expected in 2021), Papa Musk said he will lower the price to $41,000 (vs. $49,900 in US). Papa Musk also said that monthly Model Y sales will reach 30k units. \n\nIn comparison, NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at $54,000. When it comes to economy of scale, NIO is unable to match TSLA (yet) and as result, TSLA will be able to sell their Model Y at a lower price point, which will force NIO (and others) to accept a wave of price cuts to their premium electric vehicle lineup. That means while TSLA keeps printing profit and increase their revenue, the rest will have to eat the loss until they can scale up as well. (But by then, Musk will be on another money making innovation, the Battery).\n\n**So what does this mean over the next 12 months?**\n\nJust a week ago, Tesla registered its Model Y with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This indicates the start of production in China (upon issuance of final production permit for Model Y from the government). Yes. Papa Musk said production will begin in early 2021 but it looks like he’s ahead of schedule.\n\nAdditionally, there are reported sightings of Tesla doing road tests of its Model Y in China. \n\nNIO, which competes in the luxury segment of the EV market in China, recently reported a new monthly sales record earlier this year, delivering 3,740 vehicles in a month. \n\nThat’s right retards. For anyone who wants to argue that NIO will catch up to Tesla soon and match its scale, that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Tesla can deliver 3,740 vehicles in its sleep. From the get-go, Papa Musk is shooting for 30,000 vehicles of monthly Model Y sales in China and that’s only Model Y volume. \n\nIf that’s not the nail in the coffin, then consider the risky strategy that NIO is taking on its battery strategy. While Papa Musk is developing an entirely new battery technology that will last longer, and hold the charge longer, NIO chose “Battery as a Service” strategy. What is that, you ask? \n\nWell, one of the key battlegrounds for the success of EV market will be the ability to build and maintain a more extensive EV charging infrastructure. China and US are looking to expand its charging network (i.e. number of charging stations) and both countries are investing into this infrastructure. \n\nHowever, NIO has taken a different approach to charging, focusing on battery swaps rather than charging stations. Rather than leveraging EV charging stations (that all other EVs will use in China, including Tesla), NIO is building its own network of “battery-swap stations”. What this means is that NIO customers can only use NIO’s “battery-swap stations” where they have to buy vehicles without the battery, and instead sign up for a monthly subscription service that gives them access to battery packs depending on their needs. \n\nNow ask yourself. Would you rather own EV with its own battery that you can just charge wherever, or would you rather buy one without a battery, and sign up for a subscription service where you have to swap the battery at one of its swap stations?\n\n**Conclusion: Here are the key takeaways for you retards who failed to read my rant above**\n\n1. NIO can’t compete on scale with Tesla. They recently achieved a record monthly delivery of 3,740 vehicles while TSLA can do that in its sleep. Papa Musk is expecting monthly delivery of 30,000 units for Model Y alone.\n\n2. Because they can’t compete on scale, Tesla can produce and sell Model Y at a lower price point. This will force Chinese EV competitors to a wave of price cuts, which will result losses for them but not TSLA.\n\n3. Model Y is about to start production and already conducting road-tests. It is on track to launch in 2021 at $41,000 (vs. NIO which starts at $54,000)\n\n4. NIO’s “battery as a service” subscription program is retarded.\n\n5. Tesla will moon again in 2021 once you assholes come back to senses.\n\n\n**This is Article #3 of my rant series**\n\n[Article 1 - CRSR - Corsair $40c May 21, 2021 Exp](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtbqwt/crsr_corsair_40c_may_21_2021_exp/)\n\n[Article 2 - SOLO - EV Play for Special Kind of Retards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jthfu2/solo_ev_play_for_special_kind_of_retards/)", "id": "ju4nji", "created_utc": 1605371512.0, "score": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 186, "comments": [{"body": "Bro.

The firm engages in the provision of online gaming services. It currently has platforms like Garena (gaming platform), Shopee (e-commerce), and SeaMoney (digital currency). Furthermore, this company is based in Singapore and has seen tremendous growth throughout the year. ADR/OTC products seems to have a bit of lag (for example, look at $TSLA and $NIO relationship) behind its industry counterparties. $SE may see growth like $AMZN and other tech companies, but in Singapore.\n\n$SE is due to report earnings this Tuesday. The implied move of $SE is 15%, meaning people are expecting the stock to move from $180 to either $155 or $205. Historically, this has never happened before in an earnings. Current revenue/EPS projections do not justify such a movement, either.\n\n$SE also has the most popular game in the world right now -  Free Fire. Want to know an interesting fact about fire?

(disclaimer, I'm about 90% tsla)\n\nWe had the run up for q2 s&p inclusion, wolf was cried.  Didn't happen.  People will say/think ah, just another time that it won't happen.  If that's what happens then we have a play for that.  If the stock actually runs up, we sell the news.\n\nIV is extremely low right now so options are cheap\n\nVolume 3 days prior will be a big indicator too for if inclusion is happening, just have to subtract the fomo volume to see if it's real index funds purchasing permanently\n\n12/4 is the magic date that's 2 weeks before inclusion\n\n1.  Get into tsla in whatever form you want.  Shares, calls dated 12/11 or later, leaps, etc.\n\n2a. Stock runs up, IV spikes, sell ALL prior to 12/4.  Take profit\n\n3a. Stock tanks on no inclusion, pile back in on the massive drop.  Do what you will after that\n\n3b. Inclusion happens but you sold everything, FOMO back in ASAP.  The run up should continue at least past the first 5 minutes of Monday.  It'll probably gap up 20-30%, doesn't matter.  Get in.  Do what you will after\n\n2b.

Then if it plummets you buy the dip and ride the bounce for some profit. Should it get included it will rocket so you will lose out on the put but the shares and calls you got should greatly outweigh that loss - obviously you gotta close losing positions at the first second the market opens to limit losses.\n\nIf you don't own anything I'd just buy some calls around 4/12 with a 2-3w expiry.

SP should continue to go up past the first 5 minutes of Monday so you'll lose the gap up but still get gains.\n\nIf there is no run up and no IV spike, convert a couple shares or calls into a ton of deep otm weeklies.
