That was a very painful lesson to learn for a lot of things not to do.\n\nYour USO contracts are now the adjusted USO1 contracts, correct?

Or even the best-case winning condition -- you might bite off more of a capital outlay than you can swallow and your broker will be merciless in terms of covering their own ass.\n\n* Once a split or other corporate action is announced, get out of the trade as fast as possible, ideally before the effective date of the contract adjustment.

Narrow spreads help those goals, wide spreads work against those goals.\n\nBid/ask sizes just give you an idea of how much demand/supply there is at the moment.\n\nFor your example, it's hard to decide anything without context. What is the spread ATM? What is the spread of nearby strikes? A $1.80 spread might be excellent or terrible, depending.\n\nTrading volume is more useful than bid/ask size, IMO. If there was zero volume at that strike, chances are the spread is terrible. If there was over 1000 trades at that strike and it's near ATM, chances are the spread is as good as it can get.\n\nMore bids than asks can be a clue that there is upward pressure on price. But that is a very iffy indicator. If 90% of the bids are for ridiculous prices, the indicator is weak at best.\n\n> I get the feeling folks don't typically just take the bid or ask - they open a contract for a value they think is reasonable. Am I right about that?\n\nYes. If you take the bid as the seller or the ask as a buyer, it's the other guy that is laughing all the way to the bank. However, when the spread is narrow, like 1.00/1.03, there really isn't much room for anyone to be gouging you on price. It would be fine to take the bid or the ask in that situation.

Example: The \"true\" market value of a contract is $1.05. If the bid/ask is $1.04/$1.06, even if you take the bid or the ask, you are within $0.01 of the optimal value, which is about as good as it can get. But say the spread is $0.24/$1.86.  It is much more likely that the fill you get will be further from the $1.05 ideal than you would like, since the askers will stubbornly demand more money and the bidders will stubbornly refuse to offer more. It's an auction, after all, so they can set whatever price they want. If somebody bids $0.20 and there is no competition to pressure them to a higher number, $0.20 is the best you are going to get if you are selling.\n\n> What I don't get: What the ATM option has to do with it. If the ATM option is seeing lots of volume, but the strike I've chosen is seeing none, why is that any better/worse than if the ATM option is seeing little action?\n\nUsually the ATM strike has the most volume, and so the most active auction with the most active competition to drive price discovery. The point is, find the strike with the most active current trading going on and you'll find the bid/ask with the most accurate price discovery. The more volume, the better.\n\nOnce you have found the \"best\" auction, you can use that as a benchmark for evaluating the bid/ask at the strike you desire. You can't tell if a $3 spread is good or bad unless you have something better to compare against, right?\n\n> If there's little supply & demand for any option, it seems that would mean it's price may not be optimal, regardless of other options in the chain.\n\nTrue. It would depend on total volume for the whole chain. An entire call chain with less than 100 volume total will have terrible spreads for most strikes, so you are right, in that scenario, being slightly less terrible ATM doesn't help much. But, you shouldn't be trading that chain in the first place, right? If liquidity is bad across the board, steer clear at all costs.\n\nMy guideline really only works for chains with average or better liquidity, where volume is spread out across the chain, albeit with gaps and skips, as the market moves throughout the day.

Before expiration, it's more complicated, which is why you need something like the OPC.\n\n> If I buy a call with strike price of $20 on a company with current share price of $40. Does that mean I will 100% make money if the price stays above $20 while I'm holding it? (just smaller profit as it goes down?)\n\nProbably not, but again, not enough info, you didn't say how much you paid for the contract. If you paid $22 for the $20 strike, you already have a -$2 loss vs. your expiration value. If the stock stays at $40, you'll still have a -$2 loss, even at expiration.\n\nBut even if you paid $19, if the contract expires more than $1 below $40, you will have a loss. Before expiration, you may have a loss *even if the stock goes up to $40.50*, higher than when you started. Because the IV of the contract may have fallen and/or theta decay may have reduced premium.

Eventually, every stock stops rising, and also falls again.   \n\n- Sell to close the entire position.

The last column is for when the contract is expired. If Friday is expiration day, the contract has a whole trading day to go through before it expires and all extrinsic value is driven to zero. That's the difference between those two columns. You should read explainers on [gamma](https://theoptionprophet.com/blog/the-complete-guide-on-option-gamma) and [extrinsic value vs. theta decay](https://theoptionprophet.com/blog/the-complete-guide-on-option-theta) for explanations as to why one day can make such a big difference.\n\n> In bull call spreads, once ATM gets closer to my short leg rather than long leg, I make more profit holding it longer even when the price doesn't change at all due to faster premium decay on my short leg, right?\n\nYes, but that's true for any ITM price. If both legs are ITM, the short leg will be closer to the money and therefore have a higher theta.\n\nBut that is not a sufficient reason to hold an ITM spread longer, if it has already met your profit target. You are much more likely to lose money than gain money by holding longer. You **should not plan to hold any option position to expiration**. Don't get hung up on the max profit number of a spread, that is not your profit target and it is impossible to achieve 100% of the time in any case.\n\n* [Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hg8ce9/risk_to_reward_ratio_changes_over_the_life_of_an/)\n\n> Should I just close the spread once the stock price hits above short leg?\n\nYou should stick to your exit strategy.

Then I come on here and people are investing thousands and basing their DD off nothing but conferences and tweets. Again I am happy to see actual proof that they are going through with some of these plans. Like I said to me it is a car company that sells 4 models (and albeit very good cars apart from quality control issues), but everything else people kept telling me they were invested in the company for were either lies, possibly not even realisticly doable, or constantly delayed. Like isn't the model y the only vehicle they ever made and delivered on schedule? Ignoring shit like roof panels, tunnels, cubertruck that isn't road legal, semi trucks and roadsters that were promised to be on the road by now, 1 million self driving taxis, charging 10k for a feature that doesn't exist and may not exist in our lifetime, a truck version of the semi that would be legal for regular drivers license to operate, plaid model s, battery swap stations, building their own batteries (this week i saw something about them signing a new contract with lg), solid state batteries, and im sure more tweets or announcements that I am forgetting about. Now some of this could be seen as them trying and being ambitious but sometimes companies just don't succeed... except they took reservations for some of this shit when they didn't have the factories built. So now tesla gets an interest free loan from people and gets to go to the bank for all these \"orders\" they need to fill (sometimes its 100 bucks which is a forget it amount of money for people and not likely to go towards the vehicle) and he gets to build some factories just to roll out unfinished products like a tech company that they can try and iterate later which results on nothing but bad earlier cars and confusion/complexity when it comes time to find replacement parts for your constantly changing model", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Remindme! 365 days", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Half if not all of that shit was promised in 2020 or earlier.

{"title": "The Tesla Bull Case in Brief", "selftext": "**Disclaimer**\n\nI have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Introduction\n\nThere seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Overvalued?\n\nTesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).\n\nIn fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.\n\nThis really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.\n\nOn a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Growth\n\nThe above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2008|15|\\-|\n|2009|112|646.67|\n|2010|117|4.46|\n|2011|204|74.36%|\n|2012|413|102.45|\n|2013|2,013|387.41|\n|2014|3,198|58.87|\n|2015|4,046|26.52|\n|2016|7,000|73.01|\n|2017|11,759|67.99|\n|2018|21,461|82.51|\n|2019|24,578|14.52|\n\n[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:\n\n|Time span|CAGR (%)|\n|:-|:-|\n|5 years|50.36%|\n|7 years|79.27%|\n|10 years|71.45%|\n\nOver the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).\n\nThe first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.\n\nLooking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;\n\n||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|\n|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|\n|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|\n|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|\n|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|\n|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|\n\n[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Going Forward**\n\nWall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:\n\n|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020|30,626|24.61|\n|2021|44,937|46.73|\n|2022|55,963|24.54|\n|2023|79,620|42.27|\n|2024|102,526|28.77|\n\n[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.\n\nThis may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.\n\nDespite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Expansion**\n\nTesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.\n\nAn inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).\n\n[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.\n\nTesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.\n\nAs an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Access to Capital**\n\nTo fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.\n\n* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.\n   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.\n* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.\n* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.\n   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.\n* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:\n   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.\n   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Margins\n\nAnother component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).\n\n[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAutomotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:\n\n* Manufacturing Efficiencies\n* Network Services\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manufacturing Efficiencies**\n\nAs Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.\n\n[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).\n\n[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).\n\n[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).\n\n[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.\n\nFurthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.\n\nAside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).\n\nWhile Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Network Services**\n\nTesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).\n\nTesla's existing products:\n\n* Software\n   * Full Self Driving: $10,000\n   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000\n      * This isn't currently available was previously an option\n   * Acceleration Boosts\n      * Model 3: $2,000\n      * Model Y: $2,000\n* Subscriptions\n   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month\n   * Full Self Driving: ???\n      * Reportedly coming soon\n* Miscellaneous\n   * Supercharging\n\nTesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as \"the internet of cars\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues\n\nIt's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.\n\nI'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:\n\n* The aforementioned Network Services\n* Energy\n* Ridesharing\n* Insurance\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Energy**\n\nTesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).\n\n[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).\n\nA refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:\n\n* Solar\n   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)\n   * Solar Roof\n* Battery Storage\n   * Power Wall (residential)\n   * Power Pack (commercial)\n   * Mega Pack (utility scale)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ridesharing**\n\nIf Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.\n\nThe bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insurance**\n\nTesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.\n\nTesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Expectations\n\nFor public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:\n\n* Vehicle deliveries\n* Total revenue\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||25%|75%|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020 Deliveries|480,000|520,000|\n|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|\n|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|\n|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|\n|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|\n|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.\n\nI have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).\n\nI simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Closing Remarks\n\nMany are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Disclosure**\n\nWhile I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).", "id": "jziuqd", "created_utc": 1606142740.0, "score": 928, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 420, "comments": [{"body": "There is also the P/E argument, which TSLA bulls typically hate.

Think they won't come up with something equal or better?  With their massive defense budgets?

Tesla only gets more range because of packing and how many batteries they use.  As I said, usually with panasonic 18650 cells.  This is well known.  kwhr/kg is all that matters and the independent tests show tesla batteries are right there with everyone else.  They got a bump with their larger battery but that's (literally) geometry of a cylinder - not a competitive advantage.  Easy to copy.  Porsche chose a certain range, they could easily match tesla.  They can buy the same panasonic 18650 and pack the same number just as tight.

I'm also okay with losing that entire 7% in options, I consider an expense already made.\n\nBut it also opens me up to the possibility of an absurd spike. My issue with calling $1,000 impossible, is that we are in uncharted waters and to think we understand with certainty where it will go is absurd, so the goal is to create upside optionality while limiting downside risk.\n\n1 year ago I said $1,000 (pre-split) was possible and hit >100x on options. I did not think it was likely, but I did believe it was higher than the 1% chance it was priced at in the market.\n\nI do not think $1,000 is likely here, but possible on a spike. If it's a 5% chance, then I'm placing the right gamble and we'll have to see how the dice land.\n\nBasically I think too many people are confident they know what the upper limit is, when in reality they don't, and I believe extreme upside on a spike is too outrageous sounding to be taken seriously enough, that the options are underpriced.

Here's an excerpt from Jared Diamond's book that I think naked call sellers might find useful:\n\n>*“Consider a narrow deep river valley below a high dam, such that if the dam burst, the resulting flood of water would drown people for a long distance downstream. When attitude pollsters ask people downstream of the dam how concerned they are about the dam’s bursting, it’s not surprising that fear of a dam burst is lowest far downstream, and increases among residents increasingly close to the dam.Surprisingly, though, when one gets within a few miles of the dam, where fear of the dam’s breaking is highest, as you then get closer to the dam the concern falls off to zero! That is, the people living immediately under the dam who are certain to be drowned in a dam burst profess unconcern. That is because of psychological denial: the only way of preserving one’s sanity while living immediately under the high dam is to deny the finite possibility that it could burst.”*\n\nOr a nice Douglas Adam's quote :) \n\n>*The major* *difference between* *a thing that* *might go wrong* *and a thing that cannot possibly* *go wrong is* *that when a thing that cannot possibly* *go wrong goes wrong* *it usually turns out to* *be* *impossible to* *get* *at and repair.*", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I'm familiar enough with \"AdVaNcEd\" strategies.

Funds that wait and don't buy prior to inclusion date though will risk underperforming the S&P which they don't want to do.  \n\nI think the best bet is to proceed thinking that the vast majority of the shares will be bought by the funds prior to inclusion but close to it, depending on if they do 1 or 2 tranches.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVwesHcxQFo", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, exactly the answer I was looking for!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Do you happen to have that link?

Here’s a short version why:\n\nMorgan Stanley just upgraded Tesla to $540 after extensive analysis with several teams (the technology, SaaS, energy and insurance teams).  MS previously assigned zero value to all those segments because it was outside of their auto analyst’s wheelhouse.  Once MS accounts for all those segments, they take Tesla’s value in 2030 for all those segments, and discount back to today for a PT of $540. \n\nHere’s the thing:  they are ultraconservative in the assumptions.  Everything flows from 2030 projected vehicle deliveries.  To be conservative (and not sound crazy) they project Tesla only delivering 3.8 million cars in 2030.\n\nHow many does Tesla/Elon project in 2030?  Elon has stated he projects 20 Million in 2030.  It then becomes a question of who you think is more accurate - my money is on Elon as he obviously has more internal forecasting data and  is not intentionally being ultra conservative.  Say Tesla falls short and only delivers 12M in 2030; that still roughly implies TODAY’S VALUE should be 3x MS’s price target.  In other words, TODAY’s VALUE would be around $1500.

I had a crazy idea of a model that predicts share price at inclusion date.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nI have absolutely no education on financial stuff, so this is OBVIOUSLY *blatantly wrong*. **DO NOT USE THIS FOR FINANCIAL DECISIONS!!** **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE** Its just for fun! Because I love these types of prediction games.\n\nWith this warning out of the way, lets get to the model, *but first.. If you live in the us and love free stock..* just kidding. I will update the model on a daily basis with the numbers after market close.\n\n**Assumptions:**\nThere are some basic assumptions about the market and share price development that are totally wrong and have nothing to do with reality.\n\n1. I assume all the index funds have an agreement with a 3rd party to purchase all required TSLA shares before inclusion and trade to the index funds at inclusion date. This means, the model will not see an infinity spike but a steady ramp up until inclusion date.\n2. I assume that 10% if any given day trading volume is actually going to the index funds. The daily volume is taken from the NASDAQ web page. If someone has a better source, just tell me. Anyhow, I blatantly assume that 10% of that goes to the funds, starting last Monday, November 23rd. I have no way of knowing this is true. In fact, its probably very wrong and the model is very sensitive to this number.\n3. I assume that the daily stock price in % will be linear with number of filled shares. Currently, we have a stock price increase of 1.3% per 1M shares filled. This is obviously not realistic, but what the hell? Its what this model is all about. This simply models the contraction of free float as index funds and others buy and hold shares.\n4. I have no idea how the number of shares to be purchased by the index funds is computed. So I made a guess that it increases by 1M each day since the share price increases each day in the model. If someone has the equation, please give it to me.\n5. Tesla will not issue new shares. Elon wasnt really thrilled talking about index funds. I assume he will not help out to soften the squeeze.\n\n**Models and history:**\n\n24.11.2020: https://imgur.com/a/Kc65igY\n\n25.11.2020: https://imgur.com/a/WbKwn8A\nI had to update the volumes of the first two days, which pushed the predicted final share price from 2800 to 2600. Including the results from today dropped the final predicted share price to 2100.\n\n25.11.2020: https://imgur.com/a/FaWKg2c\nA second version of November the 25th with fixed number of shares to be purchased as suggested by Rob Maurer from Tesla Daily.\n\n27.11.2020: https://imgur.com/a/5qHKQx9\nUpdated for trading of 27th. Predicted share price ticked down to 1430 with a relatively calm day.\n\n30.11.2020: https://imgur.com/a/iJIt43P\nUpdated for trading of 30th. That one cost us $400 on the projected price.. uufff.\n\n01.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/INuXNab\nLower share price than projected for today, but higher projected share price for inclusion due to low volume.\n\n02.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/mjcrQgk\nWhat a bloody day that was.. bah!\n\n03.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/gTCJHYY\nDidnt quite break 600 today.

Nibbling on 1000 projected share price again.\n\n08.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/64cg1eN\nToday, Tesla issued $5B in new shares at market value. Assuming the market value is $630, this are about 8M shares. The model has no way to understand the new shares issued, so I chose to increase the todays filled number of shares by 8M. That is visible in column F.\n\n09.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/36obKzZ\nThe offering shares and a huge market drop dragged TSLA into the red. Measly $750 projected share price now.\n\n10.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/AkrwVUS\nCould have been worse. A day, pretty much in line with the model!\n\n11.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/qjEHkbo\nTypical Friday games.. obviously fell short of the model as it doesnt understand anything about Fridays.\n\n14.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/m3KWWB8\nFirst day of inclusion week. With 420 awards for the daily thread, we launched the week with a firework. The stock did well too, trading up almost 5% on medicore volume of just 48M. We have havnt seen anything just yet.\nDecided to upgread shares to be indexed to 130 as Gary made that calculation on more up to date data than Rob.\n\n15.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/jcxBl0s\nToday was a surprise. Low volume, no moon and the model slowly starts to squzee the volume. But without a price raise, the model projects only a modest increase in share price by inclusion date.\n\n16.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/1TNfCw6\nNot a fun day. Ended less worse than it started.. but really, the projected share price is not even crazy any more.. so whats the point?\n\n17.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/7Nz4u0o\nAfter days of stagnation, finally some movement! Whoooo!!! :)\n\n18.12.2020: https://imgur.com/a/GGT2iNu\nThe End.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe light yellow data is actual numbers from the last trading days. The orange fields are numbers where I feed the model back to it self.

A question you have not asked is how these funds buy huge chunks of shares. I’m not a block trader, but I’m sure there are a lot of additional considerations for large blocks of trades, with a primary concern being not to execute a buy so large that it spikes the price to something unreasonable. \n\nLet’s think of their ideal situation. In the ideal situation, they put in a good-sized trade, and share price moves very minimally. They may dump some shares to trigger some stop losses and loosen up shares to purchase, but at the end of the day, they would love to be able to have purchased a bunch of shares without raising the share price because of their trade.\n\nI think what we’ve seen to date has been a steady stream of buying that has been limited largely by the lack of available shares (as evidenced by the price increases). Theses funds may not have been able to execute their full trade at the price they wanted, so they’ve held off. \n\nI can see benchmark funds holding off from just buying anyways because 1) they are just used to being able to eventually get the price they want, and 2) they may understand that shareholders are also waiting until inclusion time to sell. The volume isn’t there now, but it will probably be there later. \n\nSo I guess I’m expecting that these funds will continue to acquire shares, constantly testing to see if they can make larger and larger purchases without spiking the price.

When this was not announced after all, the same investors left, creating a sharp fall followed by downward pressure / self-reinforcing slow bleed - as the money found new places to go. Additionally, the bleed itself motivated even more investors leave the stock.\n\nThis time we might be witnessing the total opposite. The SP500 inclusion came as a surprise to most (or maybe more precisely, the timing was sooner than consensus expectation). We saw a clear spike followed by a slow but very steady rise lasting until today.\n\nDoes this potential model give any clues to future stock movements? Maybe not, but at least this give some support to the idea that it is not impossible that we will see increase in stock value until SP500 inclusion, and maybe, maybe, a really big spike as the index fund auto-buy process starts for real.\n\nWould this imply that it might be a good idea to place a 2000 dollar sell order around inclusion date to try capture some of the nectar from the mother of all squeezes (remembering the 900 pre-split price early this year, that crashed pretty hard soon afterwards)?

It's not like when VW spiked from short covering because a single owner held so much that the short volume exceeded the float. In this case there are many owners and everyone has their price. Investors (like you and me) all realize once you get over $1,000 you are well into spike territory and there is opportunity to capture gains by selling and rebuying post-collapse. S&P funds and benchmarked funds is a massive amount of money, but combined are still only ~5 days volume. So once it gets into looney-tunes territory of >$800 there will be heavy selling from multiple holders into that strength. \n\nNote I'm not saying $800 is a bad valuation for Tesla, just that a valuation like that is predicated on FSD and excellent manufacturing execution, which the market has not fundamentally woken up to yet.

Tesla's Q3 revenue number was 8.7 bil with them selling 139.5k cars. \n\nAssuming they make the same amount of money per car sold in Q4, they'd need to sell 227k cars in Q4 just to meet the low range number of 14.2 bil.

{"title": "MEGA DD: BANGBUS EV going public - Everything you need to know (price targets to speculative Apple acquisition) and my $347K => $1.5mm bet 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "NFA! This is my **$347K bet** on the next EV company to blow up. In fact, its the only American EV company (besides TSLA) that's worth investing in. \\*\\*Flame suit on\\*\\* These are the reasons why this [Bangbus EV](https://i.imgur.com/2kzVCux.jpg) will absolutely dominate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$18/$25/$30** **price targets for management to get paid** \\- From the [recent SEC filings](https://imgur.com/gallery/OY7LYMl), management will unlock their shares at those price targets. Management has every motive to **PAHMP IT!** Commons are under $11 (as of now) and warrants are around $1.90. With the common's $30 price target, warrants would be worth $18.50 (**10-baggers with no theta burn**). With my combination of commons and warrants (positions below), at $30, this play would be worth **$1.5mm**. If you sat out on the other EV plays, don't miss out on this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis company **made more money this year than FSR, WKHS, RIDE and NKLA, combined**. Unlike any other EV SPAC, this company is already making money as they have engineering contracts with Hyundai and [earning $34mm this year, and $120mm next year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_051.jpg) (+258%). This revenue both validates their product, and is a solid revenue stream prior to releasing their vehicles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Miles ahead of all EV competition** \\- This company has built 13 driving prototypes and **completed 50+ crash tests**. [Fisker and Lordstown have built one prototype each](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_064.jpg), and have completed zero crash tests. This is the only company that's on-track to deliver vehicles on-time (2022). They've also engineered their own [skateboard platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jxk3rm/canoo_unseen_video/) completely in-house (unlike others who are relying on their manufacturing partners). In fact, they've built their platform in a record breaking 19 months, and the platform alone is worth over a billion dollars (cost for someone else to develop it). You can see the skateboard being thrown around like how your wife's boyfriend does to her in this [inspiring video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m3fRujSlW0&ab_channel=Canoo). They're **engineers first (like Tesla)**, not dreamer designers coming up with a sketch and wanting someone else to build it \\*\\*cough\\*\\* Nikola/Fisker \\*\\*cough\\*\\*. The amazing thing with the modular skateboard is that any type of body can be quickly and cheaply adapted to it (e.g. bus/van, SUV, car, truck, parcel delivery van and etc) like [these](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_020.jpg) and [these](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_059.jpg).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ridiculously low bar** \\- Other companies have created unrealistic projections which will become their ultimate demise. Fisker ($17) plans to sell 250K units in 2025, when his last company sold a measly 2500 units before shuttering in a year.  **Yes he plans to sell 100x his last failed company,** *because it's different this time*. This company set a low bar of projecting a paltry 10K units on it's first year to hit its price targets. **They've already hit 10K members on the waitlist in California alone.** This company **under-promises and over-delivers**. I'd much rather invest in a company with management I can trust, rather than another Trevor Milton-like hype man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Synthetic QS play ($20)** \\- For those who couldn't get into QuantumScape/KCAC in time, the [Director of Battery Systems of QuantumScape](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-weicker-p-e-a9998a2/) (you know, what the company is known for), **left to co-found this company**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Synthetic ARVL play ($17)** \\- For those who couldn't get into Arrival/CIIC, Hyundai invested in **both** Arrival and this company. Hyundai first announced it's investment in Arrival in January, yet, it still invested in this company just a month later in February. Why else would Hyundai invest in this company so soon after already investing in Arrival, unless it believes this company will be a winner? 🤔\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Workhorse killer ($25)** \\- From last week's Barclay's presentation, this company will officially unveil the parcel delivery vehicle next month. [This company's EV](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_032.jpg) has the wheelbase/footprint and nimbleness of a Class 1 vehicle (e.g. Ford Transit Connect), but the cargo capacity of a Class 2 vehicle (e.g. Mercedes Sprinter). This company's EV would be the best solution for a parcel delivery vehicle in cities where it's difficult to navigate/park and you'd want a compact vehicle, but also need large volume to haul a lot of packages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Turo/Hertz/U-Haul alternative** \\- In this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7tXveBvnt4&ab_channel=fullychargedshow) (5:00 mark), the Chief Product Officer indicated that the app would determine when the vehicle is not being used and **would allow (with your permission) sub-leasing/sub-subscription of the vehicle. This is HUGE.** Imagine having a money printer on your driveway. The vehicle is built around sharing/subscription (e.g. [Phone as Key](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005663/en/Kudelski-IoT-Enables-Secure-%E2%80%9CPhone-as-Key%E2%80%9D-Solution-for-Management-of-Shared-Vehicle-Access)) and it would be extremely difficult for other manufacturers to implement this in their current line-up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I'M rEtArDeD aNd DoN't uNdErStAnD sUbScRiPtIoNs** \\- This company plans to offer these vehicles as a subscription only. The **subscription is simply the evolution of a lease**. A subscription includes the lease, insurance, maintenance, DMV bullshit and etc all in one monthly flat-fee. The new vehicle lease market is huge, considering there are **4 million new vehicle leases a year**. The subscription is ingenious because similar to any other asset-backed security, this company can easily securitize the recurring subscription cash flow and essentially *sell* the vehicles to investors, clearing up capital from their balance sheet. Rather than a one-time vehicle sale, the subscription model earns [4x the revenue as opposed to just selling it](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_045.jpg). Furthermore, the subscription model generates consistent cash flow and more resilient than one-time vehicle sales. Imagine if the market saw this company as a subscription company like Netflix and it got their 78x P/E, it would have a $26B market cap in 2022, $65B market cap in 2023, $111B market cap in 2024, $182B market cap in 2025 and **$321B market cap in 2026**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Subscriptions make sense for Uber/Lyft drivers** \\- In my area, [leasing an Uber vehicle](https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/vehicle-solutions/) is $150/week (standard) or [$229/week (premium, like this EV)](https://imgur.com/gallery/hQbo72a). $229 x 52 weeks / 12 months = $992/month. At $600/month including the insurance, maintenance, charging credits and so on, this is a NO BRAINER for Uber/Lyft drivers and will be wildly popular. Furthermore, the $229/week vehicle only has 5-seatbelts, whereas this has 7-seatbelts, so one could fetch the UberXL fares (+37% more over UberX) while paying the same amount per month *or less* for a better vehicle. I'm confident there will be a partnership announcement with either Uber or Lyft soon, especially since [Uber pledged to transition to 100% by 2030](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030). I'm betting on the side of Uber, since there's deep connections to them like [this person](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-ross-863306bb/) and [this person](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-evans-69383b98/). This was even featured in the [Lido music video as a robotaxi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6m4kDMfNqg).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ThIs CaR iS uGlY** \\- Yeah, tell that to [SOLO](https://i2.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/solo-header2.jpg?w=2000&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1) investors and their single-seater death traps. New EV SUVs are in an overcrowded market. Why would you wait years for the Fisker Ocean, when you can already get a Tesla Model Y today? Every legacy manufacturer will be releasing an EV SUV soon, along with NIO's ES8 and Xpeng's G3. **The bangbus carves a niche in the market, where no-one has yet to go.** They're also making dope wraps to go with the car like [this collab with JGOLDCROWN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VvvIbVU00&ab_channel=Canoo) as well as the [design company Off-White^(TM)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jxr338/canoo_x_off_white_confirmed/). Jay Leno, a car guy who can sniff out bullshit, [met with the folks from this company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM&ab_channel=JayLeno%27sGarage). It's what made me invest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Steer-by-wire** \\- This is the first company to use steer-by-wire. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m3fRujSlW0&ab_channel=Canoo) (0:23 mark) where they have the steering column in different locations. This means that it would be easy to adapt this vehicle to both left-hand-drive and right-hand-drive and opening to a global market. Most vehicles (especially ICE) it's difficult to convert because the steering rack needs to move over, which could interfere with other components under the hood. The HVAC in the vehicle would also need to be re-engineered. However, the HVAC in this EV is built right into the skateboard that's shared among all the platforms, making it very easy to adapt to new body styles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speculative Apple acquisition** \\- Everyone knows about Apple's Project Titan EV car. This vehicle centers the driver around their phone, ***commence*** ***the Apple salivation***. Rather than one-time hardware purchases, Apple has been pushing recurring subscription cash flow like Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple News+ and etc, and this company's revenue model is exactly what Apple wants. This company is also located in California, and logistically the best company to acquire. It also doesn't have a retarded egotistical CEO. In fact, the CEO, Dr. Kranz, led BMW's EV division to [build gorgeous cars like this.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nargessbanks/2018/08/20/bmw-i8-roadster/?sh=27768ba31932) He also looks like [Doc Brown from Back to the Future](https://imgur.com/gallery/9X7k6av), so that's hella meme worthy.

{"title": "Palantir Valuation - Opening the Black Box", "selftext": "I asked you guys what company you wanted me to do a valuation on and PLTR was the favorite. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Palantir Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients\n* PLTR has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government, particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military\n* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients\n* With  \\~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future  opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a  binary outcome to us. Will they or won’t they bring more customers on to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company’s outlook, and  as a result, valuation, significantly\n\n**Company Background and Summary:** Palantir’s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its “full stack” approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**  controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a  partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,  existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a  one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which  will be key in its growth as a company.\n\nPLTR’s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.\n\n**Gotham:** Palantir’s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute responses.\n\n**Foundry:** This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily targeted to commercial customers.\n\nDespite having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC) has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019. The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR’s ability to  prove and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR  platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,  integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,  enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \\~AI\\~ among others.\n\n[Source: Q3 company presentation](https://preview.redd.it/55nkfn7os2161.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d5692fe41f3b8f9b83d97d8d9d5b99e7ecf6e88)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Company data](https://preview.redd.it/hngcefohs2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=35eb4e3ea21cc060dca0a7bc65556c40e1647ca6)\n\nThe revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year 2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this  revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**  – mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131  at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and  operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual  for a company in high growth mode.\n\n**Palantir’s Business Model:** PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long, with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running. Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the project. PLTR’s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and Scale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Company Q3 presentation](https://preview.redd.it/ircmb18ts2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=323cabade8b9de9f729a53bfa1fd12db81813be2)\n\nAcquire – PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in  revenue in a calendar year.\n\nExpand – This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having negative contribution margin throughout the same period.\n\nScale – With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company’s ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy. Palantir’s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.\n\n**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:** Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and government sectors.\n\nCompany management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9zd99daws2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b543896f77f55f1cc3e3c82be6f3beca58dbbcbc)\n\nFor government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates, company estimates](https://preview.redd.it/dxbndfxys2161.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=bce1a47f32cda8adb9a74854f7c9b32dadf98af1)\n\nSell-side estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down  methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to  Palantir’s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM  levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% – 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.\n\n**Government services:** Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the results of a recent lawsuit –  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In 1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme for future  cross-selling opportunities.\n\nGovernment contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent potential upside to our estimates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9i0a4a1t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f07f9fb6ee9224b06f32347b8c5545038ef3896e\n\n**Commercial services:** In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform – a centralized data OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.\n\nWith ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR’s  complexity, but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater  than 20% of total commercial revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8jlnnc3t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3275a383450ac8822c322fe5d00da3369b94ddfe\n\nWhile the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in growth software – 131 (including government entities). Today,  product market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a few contracts per quarter and year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5h7ycrw4t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=35cf55a824c910ae8ffb748559926c05697d09ff\n\n**Quarterly Earnings recap:** Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019. Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter.\n\nThe company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market  fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these  solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers  in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a  not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a  customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be  crucial in diversifying the customer base.\n\nAdjusted operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force and account management teams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2adbam6t2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7157552fda8339bf2da1aa7fa05ab76e027119fd\n\n**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:** Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates. Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a premium.\n\n[This was post-IPO and no longer relevant](https://preview.redd.it/zvcvqy7at2161.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=17814d0426eff732ccde8e905a09c87a58ccfc5f)\n\nFor core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake). Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV / Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the total of both trading multiples.\n\nHowever, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR’s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Bloomberg consensus estimates](https://preview.redd.it/bj7ymy0dt2161.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=112c1731a3ca94897cbc4a396eb939cecbb0d0fa)\n\nThese two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue  visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does  the stock deserve its premium?\n\n**Valuation:** We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in 2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.\n\nWe lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:\n\n* Number of **net** customer adds – 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025\n* Avg.  Revenue per Customer growth – 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.  From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e\n* Gross Margin % – a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter\n* Opex Margin % – a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter\n* Capital Expenditures – continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex\n* Free  Cash Flow Multiple – 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth  software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS  multiples\n\n[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/qslg362gt2161.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=6db3e44a12e60e36a8daf4a9f279a6f97286cfa1)\n\nFor purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from  customers has a very large effect on the calculation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/1nk201fjt2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=74bbdca6264611efa69c1a89eac19d975ba6331e)\n\nThen, depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on  different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range  of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \\~$3 to the stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin similarly adds  \\~$3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/jvkide9lt2161.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=02aaa64d9da5a2970c1f61ce812ac0c279a57900)\n\n**Key Risks:** Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this company’s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter’s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.**\n\nCustomer concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.\n\nCompetition is significant. PLTR’s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools from other software companies outside of PLTR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdhx3qjnt2161.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=383eb28700926383110bb0a76edc3f9d021dbced\n\nRecent and near-term expected hiring doesn’t inspire confidence in  significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20  and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing  this decline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t95bqxxot2161.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1bc01dd969fd556d3413d69c3934a76592f62d\n\nPalantir is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now hitting it’s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical  quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more  information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of  the business appropriately.\n\n**Key catalysts:**\n\nIncreased commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In  addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability  than we have currently modeled.\n\nThe company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by Apollo and more ‘productized’ offering have  resulted a lowered average implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.\n\n**TLDR;** Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play. Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.
