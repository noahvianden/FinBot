Other titles they run are Words with Friends, Word Streak with Friends, and CSR Racing.  Beyond those.... Most of their games are slot machine titles. \n\nSkimming the top grossing titles on Android the only two make this top 100: CSR Racing 2 at number 82 and one of their slots games (I think it was Wizard of Oz) on the list.  While their games are generally evergreen, they don't appear to be pulling in as much money as they could be, and many of their titles hit EOL relatively quickly (see Cityville, Frontierville).  They are expected to release Farmville 3 early next year; however, I'm concerned about oversaturation in the Farmville franchise.  Imo, Zynga doesn't have the diversified portfolio that some other mobile developers have.\n\nIf you're trying to bank on stay-at-home play, I'd look at Activision, who manages King.  King has at least 4 games in the top grossing 100, and the Saga franchise has consistently remained popular near the top for the past several years.  Since King is owned by Activision you're also looking at profits from 30+ million WoW subscribers (and the new expansion launching later this month), annual Call of Duty titles, and their F2P options as well.  They're also working to diversify their mobile portfolio through partnerships with established third party developers to develop games based on their major properties (CoD, Diablo, Crash, etc.).  Between all their operations, they have a more diversified gaming portfolio overall.\n\nIf you're looking long, I'd throw weight behind Microsoft for next gen as well.  While I'd predict Sony will again be the victor in the console war, I see Microsoft better positioning itself through their focus on subscription models that incorporate cloud computing (game streaming and Azure servers) and games as a service (game rentals/on-demand). Their recent partnership with EA and studio acquisitions further solidify their position in the future of cloud gaming. Amazon's recent testing of Luna indicates there is strong potential in Cloud gaming.  Microsoft appears stable for the moment since they're one of the few big tech that democrats and Republicans don't seem to be targeting with anti-trust accusations (compared to Apple, Google, and Facebook) - though I'd be prepared to jump ship if MS comes under fire.\n\nI currently own shares in $MSFT (Microsoft) and $ATVI (Activision).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "yea but the future is very uncertain, zynga is a game developer and they acquired two big companies.

First, tequila is my drink. I buy a lot of it, read a lot about it, and am part of several communities that discuss the industry extensively. All tequila brands have to state the distillery where they're made, indicated by a four-digit number, the \"NOM.\" This tequila is made at NOM 1438, which is a massive contract distillery. There are quite a few contract distilleries in Mexico. Their whole business model is to supply tequila they're already making to brand companies that want to slap a label on it. It's the same thing that was (and to some extent still is) happening with the rye industry and MGP in Indiana, except it's been going on far longer with Tequila.\n\nTequila Matchmaker is a great resource. Here is their page for this NOM: https://www.tequilamatchmaker.com/distilleries/186-destiladora-del-valle-de-tequila-s-a-de-c-v . They have 117 brands currently in production. There are a couple brands on the list that get pushed by liquor stores, like Total Wine constantly running deals on El Padrino and Siempre, but not a single brand on that list is considered quality tequila by people 'in the know.' The main reason is that these big contract distilleries all take full advantage of Mexican law on additives. Aged tequilas can have up to 1% additives by volume. The rule was ostensibly conceived to allow distilleries a bit of wiggle room to keep their products tasting the same from batch to batch, but it's gotten way out of hand. They now use an array of high-quality flavor concentrates to make their tequila taste like whatever they want, add agave syrup to make it sweeter, and add glycerin to give it a \"smooth\" mouthfeel. So what you get isn't high quality tequila--it's a carefully constructed chemistry recipe.\n\nSo, long story short, it's technically possible that the people running this Tesla tequila brand went out of their way to buy a surprisingly good batch of aged tequila that this distillery had lying around, but I doubt it. That's just not how the business works. More likely this is a mediocre tequila at best, to which they've added a blend of flavors that they know US drinkers will find appealing.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "This is surprisingly solid tequila DD.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "This is what we do over at r/tequila every day.", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "Puts on Mexican tequila factory NOM 1438", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is great info and quite frankly a pleasant surprise.
