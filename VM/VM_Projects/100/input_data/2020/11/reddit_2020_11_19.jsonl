I mean, sure, the stock fell sharply as all the gamblers got out, but the gamblers were in in the first place because of the negligance in the first place. So it sort of was too late at that point, but after the stock went down and TSLA issued new shares, there was a period where gamblers were not an issue.

This only gives gamblers the opportunity to front run the index funds and squeeze them.

However if Tesla actually grew at that pace there is no way they would be valued on a P/E of 8.59 in 2025 because the future growth from 2025-2035 will be higher than Toyotas growth from 2020-2030.

This is why I say it makes sense to focus more on just absolute earnings than the P/E ratio equivalence.\n\nEven if we stick with the 40x multiple, Tesla could still achieve this level of earnings increase without needing to increase revenue by the same 40x amount if they instead can increase gross margins.

SVM/??? here with another fuckin banger. LET'S GOOOO!!!!!\n\n# Introduction:\n\nThe market is going to tank. Let me just give a bit of background so you know why my opinion is better than yours...\n\nI am not a bear. I am not a bull. I go where the market tells me to go, I bet where it tells me to bet. And right now, the indicators are telling me to take a strong bearish position. So that's what I have been doing.\n\nI've been trading more than 20 years. I was trading the great financial crash while most of you were watching fucking Spongebob or whatever the fuck you kids jerked it to. This is not my primary job, but I make a good deal of cash on the side every month, timing the market and swing trading broad market ETFs. I do my research, I know my shit, and I rarely touch your shitty meme stocks. I'm doing you all a favor of once again sharing my insights into this market, so you too can share in my profits and maybe learn a thing or two.\n\nI will lay this out as cleanly as I can, offering multiple premises for my bearish bet and explaining them in detail. I've covered some of this in the past, but wanted to consolidate everything and more in one place. **This post will be long. If you want to cry about that rather than thank me for my service, you will go broke soon and deserve it cuz you are a lazy fuck.** PRESSING FORWARD!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Primary Bearish Premises:**\n\n**Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued (Macro)**\n\n**Premise 2: SPY is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes (TA)**\n\n**Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money You Retards (Facts)**\n\n**Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary (Theory)**\n\n**Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting (Data)**\n\n**Premise 6: Banks are Loading Up on Safe Bonds While Retail Loads Up on Stocks (Data)**\n\n**Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High (Data)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Premise 1: The Market is Massively Overvalued\n\nThere are plenty of small, detail arguments for a bearish position. Covid cases rising, election uncertainty, stimulus failing, and so on. Plenty of others have made this case, so I won't focus on the small scale issues such as these.\n\nWhat I want to give you is a larger, macro picture. Because the market is simply overvalued, period. The market has become divorced from the overall economy. I understand tech, and why they have a bullish case for growth in the face of Covid lockdowns... My point here is that you need some REAL WORLD measures to tie \"future earnings\" down to reality, to prevent irrational euphoria from taking over your mind.\n\nThere are plenty of indicators out there showing that stocks are overvalued. We could talk about insane P/E ratios, about euphoric meme stock flops like NKLA, and so on. The metric I'm going to present here is not new by any stretch. It isn't unique or original. But it is undeniably useful, and carries strong weight, whether modern traders wish to shun it and its originator or not. I'm talking about the Buffet Indicator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oem2uhz714061.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1f7e97544eba52859b986af68b4b80556660e43\n\nFor those of you new to this concept, it is simply the total stock market valuation divided by GDP. The point is to compare total market valuations with some hard, trailing, real-world metric, in this case GDP. When market valuations uncouple strongly from actual market conditions, it is a strong signal of irrational stock valuations. And that presents opportunity for those paying attention.\n\nNote that **this chart has already been detrended down to account for historically rising P/E ratios**, and it still shows a strongly overvalued market, equal to what was seen during the DotCom bubble. That's bad news, folks.\n\nThis is the REAL issue in the present market, and why buyers are becoming exhausted. Covid, instability, elections, stimulus... These are all just catalysts to give that equity bubble a little prick. Only the dumbest of the dumb are still \"buying the dip\" under current market conditions, which means mostly clueless retail gamblers on WSB. All these perma-bulls are doing is offering liquidity to the institutional investors to help get them out of their positions. In the end, we all know who is left holding the bag.\n\n# Premise 2: The Market is Topping Off and Running on Vaccine Fumes\n\nI'm not a big believer in technical analysis. Most of it is bullshit, astrological voodoo if you ask me. But some of it works, and when technical analysis works, it is simply being used as a proxy for assessing market sentiment and emotions. Let's take a closer look at the teaser SPY chart I posted above.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0ndq2a914061.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe30a5ad23952719c69c6634debe7fe8c0832af\n\nAs you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. **In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations.** As they should be, if you were following the point above. We are running on vaccine news fumes, and those will not last long. If you develop an instinct for these things, you can almost feel it in your gut: The market WANTS to head down.\n\nIf this isn't the top, it is close to it. $366.77 will very likely be the high for SPY for the year, and will soon unwind downwards.\n\n# Premise 3: The Fed CANNOT Print Money\n\nI know this will come as a shock to most of you idiots but the fucking money printer does NOT GO BRRRRR.\n\nThe Fed has to follow the laws that govern it's actions. The Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print cash and hand it out. Go ahead and read the Federal Reserve Act, and take a look at the Fed's actions, for proof of this. It doesn't even have the authority to print cash to buy corporate bonds or anything else.\n\nWhat the Fed \"prints\" is called \"reserves.\"\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/8ibo0kud14061.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=626a1464cd76296ee9d435a5c69f182e4286f9d6)\n\nSo what, you say? So everything. The key point about reserves is that they cannot be spent like cash can. When a bank gets reserve funds in its reserve account at the Fed, it CANNOT SPEND that money. All the bank can do is use that account as collateral to lend against. Which means **if the banks are not lending, those QE funds are NOT entering the economy.** They might as well not exist. And banks are not lending, as we will see below.\n\nThis is the counter argument to all the ignorant retail traders who will argue that the Fed is \"backstopping\" stocks, or that the Fed will not \"allow\" the market to crash. The Fed has no power to print money, and therefore no power to buy stocks, and therefore no power to prevent a crash. The Fed's power is illusory, but enough people buy the illusion to make it effective. That won't last forever.\n\nJust think about it. If Fed actions and QE really made stocks rally the way people claim it does, why isn't the Japan Nikkei constantly breaking new all time highs???\n\n# Premise 4: Quantitative Easing is Deflationary\n\nQuantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.\n\nHere is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.\n\nIn fact, it's worse than that. Because the Fed is removing assets from the open market, and not paying cash for them. It is purchasing liquid assets with illiquid reserves. Despite all the Fed's talk about \"creating liquidity,\" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system!\n\nWhy would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself!\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained ](https://preview.redd.it/bzl5jfpf14061.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c96c8e3b741867281f43b5472c634c85cba5bf)\n\nSee, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through **credit expansion.** So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.\n\nOnly when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in \"forward guidance.\" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.\n\nThe Fed is trying to contract credit markets in order to lower interest rates in order to eventually spur lending in order to eventually create inflation. But in the meantime, QE is deflationary. As stated above, if reserve funds are not being lent out by the banks, they do not enter the economy, and thus QE serves a deflationary role. Let's take a look at the next premise, that banks are contracting the credit markets.\n\n# Premise 5: Credit Markets are Contracting\n\nThe question of whether banks are lending or not with their QE reserves is simply a matter of looking at the data. Practically every data source we can point to suggests contracting credit conditions. This means QE reserves are not entering the economy, and therefore are not producing inflation nor holding up stocks.\n\n**The SLOOS data from the Fed, Oct. 2020:**\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/sloos\\/sloos-202010-table-1.htm](https://preview.redd.it/pt6xz8wg14061.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=4de834db13e36878f58154dbe44010b2777743b0)\n\nReal Estate lending is booming, you say?

A continuing trend in that data, month after month after month, is that major banks in the US have been loading up on bonds with no end in sight. They are piling more and more cash into safe assets, now up to a whopping $4.6 TRILLION in securities.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/releases\\/h8\\/current\\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/tn38ss3p14061.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc1c06695685a883599315abc9e36047128e687)\n\nMeanwhile, retail traders (that means you) keep piling into stocks at all time highs. A record amount of cash was dumped into the market after the vaccine news breaks. I'm just gonna go ahead and call it now. This is the top.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.bloomberg.com\\/news\\/articles\\/2020-11-13\\/stock-funds-get-record-44-5-billion-inflows-on-vaccine-optimism](https://preview.redd.it/xogj0z2q14061.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=c466b29277d6f047781fd9156bd476b3b1c011f1)\n\n# Premise 7: Unemployment is Still Sky High\n\nI bring this up just to reiterate another real-world metric that is gloomy as fuck and yet completely ignored from market valuations. Why are stocks breaking all-time highs when we still have MILLIONS more unemployed than we did this time last year? Hello McFly?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jda435zq14061.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=3929064c0e9d6ae120201ad4295e02cca2bdcf45\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n**Shit's fucked up son.** Real world economy is still in shambles. Market is more overvalued than it was during the DotCom boom. Still millions unemployed. The market is topping off and rejecting highs again and again. The Fed is not printing money and not backstopping assets, despite claims to the contrary. We are heading down, folks!\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**SPY 350p 12/18**\n\n**VXX 22c 12/18**\n\nAlso anything else that strikes your fancy. IWM, GLD, SLV puts are all fine (dollar is going to rise). Longer dated TLT calls will print as well due to QE reducing bond yields, eventually. Go longer or shorted dated depending on personal risk tolerance.\n\n**Timing can be difficult. My strategy is to periodically enter bearish positions when short-term indicators look good, and hope to eventually time the major dump. If things begin to stabilize short-term I exit the position quickly with a small gain or, rarely, a small loss.**\n\nSee: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the\\_bears\\_arent\\_done\\_folks\\_these\\_diamond\\_hands/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jkm5jq/the_bears_arent_done_folks_these_diamond_hands/)", "id": "jx2zez", "created_utc": 1605793727.0, "score": 7346, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 1849, "comments": [{"body": "Hey, bro, I peeped that LinkedIn and while you seem like an intelligent guy you have a yeeyee ass haircut with no bitches on your dick and for those reasons I'm out.", "score": 12199, "replies": [{"body": "The real DD is always in the comments, im sorry OP but thjs is a chad‚Äôs market", "score": 3293, "replies": [{"body": "A good example as to how overvalued things are is the restaurant industry.

Stocks will EVENTUALLY return back to where they are now, but many stocks still haven't gotten back to pre-lockdown levels. With all the market indicators AND the news AND this DD, I think it is worth it to pull back for a couple weeks until at least after Thanksgiving/Christmas. TBH, I am hoping for airlines and TSLA to take a nosedive so I can score some cheapies with (nearly) guaranteed long-term returns. \n\nFinal point: Steven is worth listening to BECAUSE he doesn't day-trade. Day traders get too caught up in the ebbs and flows of the weekly shit; he does macro. I don't listen to him to know which specific stocks are going up or down, I listen to him to know general market trends (his Sunday night market charts are fuckin' choice, my dudes). \n\nTo Steven: This place is a meme-zone. I can guarantee that the people who are taking your advice aren't posting, and the rest are still giving you shit because that's the meme (perma-bull).

See this:\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654)\n\nSo commercial banks create money in the modern economy when the bank creates a loan on its books. Commercial banks literally create money out of thin air. The money is ‚Äòextinguished‚Äò when the loan is repaid to the bank. The only role of the central bank (read the Fed in US) in the modern economy is to control the ambient interest rates. Controlling the interest rates controls the rate at which commercial banks issue new loans. High interest rates tend to decrease the issuing of new loans by the commercial banks whereas low interest rates tend to encourage the issuing of new loans. ie the money supply. If the rate at which commercial banks issue new loans matches the rate at which the economy is expanding, then all is well. Interest rates can remain relatively low and everyone feels relatively prosperous. If this process overheats, interest rates are too low, the economy is not expanding to match, then the result is inflation.\n\nWhat however happens if the central bank has already reduced interest rates to near zero in an unsuccessful attempt to get commercial banks to write new loans and thereby ‚Äòstimulate‚Äô the economy?\n\nThis is how we now get to QE. See:\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing)\n\n(BTW this explanation of QE has been significantly altered by the BoE recently. It used to describe QE as ‚Äòasset purchasing‚Äô by the central bank)\n\nQuote:\n\n‚ÄòIn addition, QE can stimulate the economy by boosting a wide range of financial asset prices.\n\nSuppose we buy ¬£1 million of government bonds from a pension fund. In place of the bonds, the pension fund now has ¬£1 million in money. Rather than hold on to this money, it might invest it in financial assets, such as shares, that give it a higher return. And when demand for financial assets is high, with more people wanting to buy them, the value of these assets increases. This makes businesses and households holding shares wealthier ‚Äì making them more likely to spend more, boosting economic activity.‚Äô\n\nFor ‚Äògovernment bonds‚Äô read US Treasuries. The pension fund reference is very telling: by far the largest pool of ‚Äòdumb‚Äô money anywhere. In the US the Fed has not just been buying Treasuries but corporate bonds. Corporate debt. Mortgage backed securities- MBS. Who knows what else in secret through the plunge protection team.\n\nMoney has entered the real economy in the shape of unemployment protection payments and direct stimulus checks. This has not been matched by any GDP activity - or grossly reduced activity. It has been ‚Äòpaid for‚Äô by increasing the total national debt. It‚Äôs a miracle it has not been inflationary, but people are wary of spending. They are buying durables like washing machines, microwaves and cars. Where ever they can they are paying down unsecured debt. Those with an excess are banking it or - buying stocks!\n\nNot sure if M2 money supply has gone up or down, but velocity is way down. M2 velocity really matters.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)\n\nTLDR: You‚Äôre wrong. \\[Edit: short term you are right, long term wrong\\] .

And just like we don‚Äôt want to keep a lot of money in cash, neither do banks. \n\nSo I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúwhen will reserves terminate‚Äù is the right question. Just like we don‚Äôt ask ourselves when our checking accounts will terminate. Interestingly, there have been many recent situations where banks haven‚Äôt had enough reserves to meet their business needs‚Äîlook up repo madness from September 2019. Often banks have needed more reserves to fit their business needs, and when other banks can‚Äôt supply those reserves through the overnight lending market, the fed will step in to buy up treasuries to create enough reserves to meet banks‚Äô business needs.\n\nAlso remember that bank reserves are liabilities of the US gov just like the number in your bank account is a liability of that particular bank. When people say the fed‚Äôs balance sheet is expanding, they mean they are adding to the assets side of their balance sheet by purchasing treasuries, for example, and adding a corresponding amount to the liabilities side, which is the actual reserves. \n\nSo maybe the question youre asking is whether the current fed balance sheet expansion is sustainable, and that‚Äôs the question everyone is wondering about too.\n\nBack in Great Recession and QE, the assumption that this type of balance sheet expansion wasn‚Äôt sustainable‚Äîit would lead to massive inflation by giving banks too much ammo to put into the economy.

The short term pressures are related to the velocity of money which comes down to bank lending. As you mentioned when the Fed buys securities it increases bank reserves and inflationary pressure would only occur if the banks lend that money out so the velocity of money is limited by banks lending abilities and risk tolerance. Right now banks are drowning in deposits and aren‚Äôt able to earn much by lending out money ‚Äî plus they have to be very careful in this environment not to make bad loans with such a small net interest margin and unemployment still elevated at historical levels. Needless to say there are many factors that make it seem like the velocity of money is low. But if these vaccines succeed and nothing else gets all fucked up it seems there could be a scenario (not sure of probability) where things get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fairly quickly after that.. and if that happens we could be shifting from a pandemic-lockdown-deflationary-contracting-environment to a more-inflationary-expansionary-environment. \n\nAnd now let‚Äôs just take a second to recognize how no one knows fucking shit... :):)", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "These VXX calls not doing so hot bro ü•¥", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I want to believe  but this hasnt aged well", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow thanks OP for the sweet DD, if only I could read. \nStOnKS oNlY gO uP!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think this is intelligent and thoughtfully written.

A lot of stupid comments. According to your premise 1 you would‚Äôve missed out of the run up of stocks in the last decade. Also, ever consider that the long-term low interest rate environment (with signaling that it will continue to be like this) fundamentally causes valuation multiples to re-rate? That‚Äôs the problem with historical analysis, the world is fundamentally different now. So why are multiples expanding? Because interest rates are low and investors need to reach for riskier and risked investments to maintain rates of return. Essentially chasing yield. Investors go for treasury to IG to HY to blue chip and beyond. By your logic, you would‚Äôve gotten out of the market in 2015 waiting for the dip, which didn‚Äôt come until the pandemic five years later and you still would‚Äôve been worse off lol. I‚Äôve seen so many people try to time markets and it‚Äôs hilarious to watch. Take another page out of Buffett/Graham‚Äôs handbook and think about mr market. Do you need to sell now? Think about it as owning a business instead of a stock and you make much better decisions. FYI, you think Buffett is out of the market now? Haha\n\nWhile the ‚Äòmarket‚Äô has become over valued, look at why. The breadth of the recent run up from covid has been extremely narrow. Almost all of the run up has been in only a handful of stocks- FAANGM. Take a look at the market valuation excluding these stocks and you will see a great opportunity. As vaccine optimism works its way into the rest of the market, you will see a rotation to value and cyclical stocks and likely out of tech. What does that do to overall valuation of the market? Who is to say.It will probably keep it flattish, but bigger names will have less influence on the overall market as the capital will be dispersed to the rest of the market. \n\nRunning on vaccine fumes is a joke, where do you think the market will be in March when the vaccine is in the process of rolling out?\n\nWhen people say the fed is printing money it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs effectively true. They are increasing the money supply by purchasing newly issued treasuries from banks. It credits the banks, which is treated like cash even though it doesn‚Äôt print cash. The cash is considered bank reserves, but banks only are required to hold a specific amount of reserves so all extra is used to maximize profit through lending/purchasing of long duration assets. You highlighted increasing amounts in high quality securities. Go down to line 9 oh they are increasing loans and leases as well. Oh and that number is 2x the size of treasury and agency securities lmao. Premise 5: feds funds are entering the market that is why you are seeing the markets stabilize (that downward tick). Banks don‚Äôt just hold the reserves in hand. They lose out on yield. Even if they are buying bonds, lending, etc. that money enters the economy. Sure they may be holding more reserves than before, but that is natural in a pandemic! Premise 7: the market is forward looking and most of the unemployment is viewed as temporary. As the pandemic drags on, more and more losses will become permanent, but they will be nowhere near as high as ‚Äò08.

In a way this environment was inevitable after that and I think when we do finally crash and come out of this period that time will be viewed as the precursor to this absurd market completely divorced from reality or earnings.\n\nOne additional point about valuations- yes P/Es are historically insane, sentiment is at an extreme level across the board- even bears have largely capitulated now- speculation is extremely high in the dumb money crowd. But there‚Äôs another indicator that is also a tell on this and that is the number of secondary offerings which is very elevated. This can be interpreted as a bearish contrarian indicator because it‚Äôs another sign of a high amount of speculative activity. Companies that need to raise capital find a public more than willing to give it to them.\n\nAlso there‚Äôs a very popular narrative about seasonality being bullish and even if a selloff happens it won‚Äôt be until well into the new year so a contrarian argument could be made that we get a large selloff before EOY.\n\nFinally, price wise, the most bearish factor is that the stocks that led this bull market- mainly the fangs- have completely topped out and to use your term seem to be running on fumes.

Your chart is pretty zoomed, and I think you might be reading too much into the 1% difference between the first and second rejection annotation, especially given the circumstances of the time.

The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against.\n\nQE does not remove liquidity. The banks hold loans, reserves, and treasury bills from in their assets. the banks sell their loans to the Fed, the Fed gives them reserves in exchange. the bank t-sheet nets out the same. The reserves from the Fed are equivalent assets to the loans that the bank made. \n\nOn the fed's t-sheet, there is an increase on both sides. they increase the reserves(assets) and they also increase their t-bills(deposits)- this is where the printer comes in, JPow just adds more with his spreadsheet.\n\nBanks don't lend out reserves, they don't lend out deposits.

When the fed buys bonds, it credits the reserve account of the relevant bank (this is what is actually happening when the fed is ‚Äòprinting money‚Äô).

Now, by regulation, banks have to keep a certain percentage of their deposit liabilities in this checking account to make sure they can meet withdrawal requests by their customers. This requirement is currently ZERO‚ÄîI.e., banks do not need to keep any funds in this reserve account. They still will because unlike what OP stated, fed reserves are not just used as collateral. They are used to settle transactions between banks and bank customers for example. \n\nNow, since banks don‚Äôt need to have ANY reserves at the moment, they can do whatever they want with that freed up cash.

If they don't create new loans against these bank reserves, these reserves do not under the system. The fed can't create broad money, only base money.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Happy to engage with this further! \n\nFirst I said banks will still keep reserve balances, not that every single reserve dollar makes its way into your checking account. \n\nBank reserves are not dead money and can be used for reasons other than collateral to lend against‚Äîprimarily for transaction settlement in the economy, I.e., transactions between market participants. When I transfer money to you, what‚Äôs actually happening is my bank sends reserves to your bank, and my account is debited and yours is credited to reflect this transfer. The same is true when you earn a paycheck. \n\nWhat happens when firm A has bonds but needs cash? It sells them to someone who has cash. That transaction is facilitated via bank reserves. What has happened in the housing market over the past ten years, especially since the Covid crisis? The fed‚Äôs QE has further suppressed interest rates, which goes downstream to suppressing mortgage rates and, paired with Covid flight from the cities, has caused housing prices to rise! Now what else happens when interest rates on savings accounts, CDs, and other safe money instruments are low? People seek return in financial assets, I.e., the stock market, which again, drives prices up. Pension funds specifically have contractual requirements to earn returns that they can‚Äôt get with treasuries anymore.\n\nMoving overseas, this same thing happens on a global level. The strong demand for the dollar and US citizens being net spenders means that the US gov has run a current account deficit for quite some time‚Äîbasically meaning we import more than we export, causing other counties to need dollars to buy out assets. But you know what we do export? Treasuries. Other counties but treasuries because they need access to the dollar to buy dollar denominated assets. You know why Japan, despite spearheading QE and yield control, isn‚Äôt in a similar position? Because they are net savers (obviously there are other factors lol). And in a low interest rate environment, where do they put that saved money? US assets, again driving prices up. \n\nThis was a long winded, and admittedly tangental, explanation to say that OP‚Äôs write up is misleading, as it makes it seem like quantitative easing does not promote liquidity and has not made its way downstream to affect businesses and individuals. Banks can ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù all of these excess reserves (again, reserve requirement is zero) to buy assets, settle transactions, pay companies‚Äô payrolls, and yes, lend. Of course banks don‚Äôt withdraw cash from the federal reserve. That was never the point, and I apologize if anything I wrote blurred that line. The point is that QE, and bank reserves, aren‚Äôt just dead collateral waiting to be lent. \n\nIf you‚Äôre further interested in bank reserves, I recommend reading some about the 2019 repo crisis, which essentially was a sudden upward shock in the reserve rate when banks couldn‚Äôt get access to as many reserves as they needed.

The Fed purchases a liquid asset (treasuries) with an illiquid asset (bank reserves).  \n\n\\>  Banks can ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù all of these excess reserves (again, reserve requirement is zero) to buy assets, settle transactions, pay companies‚Äô payrolls, and yes, lend.  \n\nNo, they cannot use it to buy assets. And no, they cannot use it to lend directly.  They can simply lend against the reserve balances, but they're still risking their own capital.

The main one being a deflationary period for QE. Typically when interests rates are low there is an inflationary period where lending is more prominent and an increase in the overall money supply. When fed interests rates are high, it indicates a deflationary period with decreasing the principal amount of the money supply. \n\nThe situation: federal interests rates are low which would typically increase the money supply for investment banks. Investment banks are lending somewhat. \nA stimulus package was released which would increase the money supply. A second stimulus package is being discussed which would increase the money supply. \nTalks of increasing the debt ceiling and managing the fiscal budget which if increased will also increase the money supply. \nI'm having a hard time seeing a deflationary period unless the banks suddenly call on debts to be paid. Even a few weeks ago, there were talks of averaging inflation at 2 percent but letting that 2 percent be a guide. That is to say that inflation could very well go past 2 percent intentionally.\n\nPurchasing securities is one thing. If they are using other tools like low interest rates, raising the debt ceiling, QE, and economic sanctions, then I see inflationary tools exceeding deflationary tools.    Explain to me why I am wrong. Please.\n\nAlso, spy speculation must factor inclusion and exclusion from entering and exiting business. For example, tesla is now being included into the spy.

{"title": "Hotels & Resorts stocks are overpriced as fuck and the market hasn't realized it yet - $MGM 58k YOLO", "selftext": "In fact, most of the boomer stocks are overpriced right now due to the recent PFE and MRNA's vaccine news, but hotels & resorts stocks ($MGM, $MAR, $HLT) are the most inflated out of them all and will soon be given a reality check.\n\nThis is just my speculation but I believe the public is overly optimistic about vaccines and how the subsequent distribution and logistics will pan out. I'll keep my DD short and sweet.\n\n# The Race between the 4 Biotechs:\n\n**Pfizer (PFE)**:\n\n* 95% efficacy\n* 2 dose\n* 50 mill doses to be produced by the end of 2020\n* Must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit)\n* Submitted to FDA for Emergency Use Approval (optimistic timeline for approval = end of 2020)\n* People with special licenses can administer the vaccine shots\n\n**Moderna (MRNA):**\n\n* 94% efficacy\n* 1 dose\n* 20 mill doses to be produced by the end of 2020\n* Must be kept at -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit)\n* Hasn't been submitted to FDA for EUA yet, but getting documentation prepared\n* People with special licenses can administer the vaccine shots\n\n**AstraZenenca (AZN):**\n\n* Currently in Phase 3\n* Expected to release data by the end of 2020\n\n**Johnson&Johnson (JNJ):**\n\n* Currently in Phase 3\n* Expected to release data in February 2021\n\n# Relative Pricing and Comparison\n\n**MGM Resort International (MGM):**\n\n* \\-14% pps of pre-covid levels\n* Occupancy rate 44%\n* Revenue: -68% vs last LYQ3\n* Negative EPS\n* 25% employees terminated\n\n**Other Industry Leading Boomer Stocks**\n\n* CCL (cruise) = -57% pps of pre-covid levels\n* AAL (airlines) = -54% pps of pre-covid levels\n* SPG (mall) = -42% pps of pre-covid levels\n* JWN (retail) = -48% pps of pre-covid levels\n* LVS (casino) = -18% pps of pre-covid levels\n\n**MGM is inflated compared to the other boomer stocks as it's very much near pre-covid levels.**\n\n# Macro factors\n\nA sub-premise of this post is that whatever brough MGM's stock price to what it is today was artificial and it isn't reflective of a healthy incline. The volume popped off per vaccine news, but now the volume has significantly dropped at the current levels. Buyer power is at its tipping point and a single bad news can easily trigger a large sell-off as the good news have now all been priced-in. But what will trigger the sell-off?\n\n# The Sell-off Triggers\n\n* **The relief bill's benefits is all set to end on Dec 31 (this includes** **government bailouts).** We were expected to make stimulus negotiations post-election, but both sides aren't looking to work with one another. Other analysts predict that productive negotiations will only resume once Biden is in office which is in January.\n* **Rising COVID cases.** US COVID cases hasn't yet peaked as we continue to set new hospitalization and case records every day.\n* **Thanksgiving is cancelled, but maybe even Christmas and New Years celebrations, too.** Hotels&Resorts are one of the greatest attractions during Christmas, but it seems like we're going to stay in lockdown.\n* **Vaccine Distribution&Logistics issue.** As mentioned, countries and states will continue to face big challenges in vaccine delivery. One logistic issue in the headlines can induce great amounts of fear triggering sell-offs.\n\n**Conclusion:** In the short to medium term, there are no news that awaits for hotel&resort stocks that points bullish. The buyer power has peaked and now, they are headed for a big correction.\n\n**Position: $MGM 26.5p 12/31**\n\n**Proof:**\n\n[$MGM 26.5p 12\\/31](https://preview.redd.it/xgs0r6y57a061.png?width=1535&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fb68260641e1c756e3f1ba981e6cfa415b7381a)", "id": "jxdvp9", "created_utc": 1605828584.0, "score": 350, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "Just Bc it makes sense doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll work.", "score": 430, "replies": [{"body": "yep. almost all of these tickers have 85%+ institutional ownership. you really wanna yolo on puts with that info?", "score": 111, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is truthfully the only thing ive learned in this market.
