If you look at their S-1 and other information they have about this portion of their business things are much more insidious than they appear on the surface. Namely FDE engineers often end up staying at companies well beyond the initial implementation phase (i.e they are selling bodies) and FDE contracts account for much more of their revenue then their software licensing.\nIf you believe their books (which I don't see a reason not to) then the margin on these FDEs is minimal if non-existent. All of their margin is on their software licensing (about 80% margin vs R&D which is just OK, not fantastic for a software company).\n\nSo valuation. It comes down to whether you believe this business model can and will change. If it doesn't change then the currently $35B market cap is completely unjustified.\n\nHowever if you believe they can turn their product into something that can be a) used off the shelf or b) implemented more quickly and scaled using system integrators then maybe it could justify it's current valuation assuming a constant growth factor of 40-50% YoY.\nI think this is the most likely avenue to increased growth but I also don't believe they have the culture or expertise necessary (I don't have a high opinion of their engineering talent).\n\nThere does exist a world where they can offer their platform as SaaS and have it plug into GCP/AWS/Azure integrating with existing data-lake and data warehousing solutions with no consultants needed and then uses heuristics and models to suggest how to bring the data to gether. This would be the most scalable play and the only one that can justify their valuation as it would expand their market to the entire market of companies that have or should have data engineering teams.\n\nThe truth is I have very little confidence they can pull through on the last one, it just runs so counter to everything they have done so far and my understanding of their company culture and future goals.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "As an aside I am not saying their stock price won't go up, hype suggests it almost certainly will so if you are a hype trader cashing in on this is a good idea.\n\nPersonally though this isn't my cup of tea.

You have available to you a number of primitives that can get the job done and you can drop in some other vendors or OSS software to fill the gaps.\nFor storage you have BigQuery which is columnar data warehouse, you have PubSub for streaming. Dataflow for streaming and batch data cleaning and loading into BigQuery. You have Google AI Platform to run your models and you can plug in whatever visualisation tool you want, Google provides Data Studio but you could also go for something a bit more shiny like Metabase or Looker.\nYou would stream your transaction events into PubSub, have a PubSub consumer that takes each transaction and forwards it a model running on AI Platform to score it for fraud. Concurrently you would also stream all the transactions into BigQuery for later model training and model performance analysis. \n\nThis would give you effectively the same set of capabilities to solve the problem as PLTR's Gotham with products mostly from a single vendor (which is ideal for corps) but you would have to do the glue yourself or pay someone to do it. PLTR software is built like this internally too just wayyyyy less efficient and powerful but traded off for higher integration.\n\nThe big difference is PLTR service offering.

The big advantage of H2 for energy storage is that it's lightweight, not because the gas itself is light, but because the vehicle only has to carry a part of the energy storage cycle:\n\n* You can store the energy by creating H2 in a giant industrial facility, and then compress and chill it to make it dense enough to be  useful\n* You don't need to carry the O2 around with you for the energy release part of the cycle, and you can dump the water too\n\nWith a rechargeable battery the lithium ions are roughly equivalent to the H2 atoms, and they're also very lightweight, but have the advantage of not needing to be compressed/chilled to be dense enough to be useful. But all those other steps are part of the battery and so you have to carry them around all the time:\n\n* The energy is stored by pushing electrons in to the anode, which forces the lithium out (oversimplifying a ~~bit~~ lot), but you still need to carry the anode around with you, you can't leave it behind like a hydrogen electrolysis plant\n* After the energy is used the electrons have moved over the cathode where they're stable now, and not holding anymore energy (kind of like the H2O byproduct) but you can't just dump that overboard, you have to hold on to it\n\nWith cars all this extra \"machinery\" isn't too much of a problem, a well engineered battery and vehicle can easily carry around all the \"extra\" weight and still be perfectly useful. But for a plane or ship the extra weight starts to matter, at least at current energy densities. So even though hydrogen isn't as efficient it can be useful where weight is important.\n\nFor grid storage, you'd have everything just in one spot, a huge hydrolysis plant,  storage tanks, fuel cells, etc. It's not really useful to be physically moving the hydrogen all over the place, and keep putting it in to different forms to inefficiently store electricity for a bit.

It was suggested that any fee the index funds pay for the swap contract will be become a tracking error, with in turn impacts each individual portfolio managers performance appraisal when compared against the index performance. It was suggested significant tracking error would lead portfolio managers losing their jobs.\n\nI’m not actually convinced that the index tracker portfolio managers will care whether the price of Tesla spikes or not. If it does spike and come back down their fund performance will just mirror the S&P index so they can defend their management as objectively good. If alternatively they take out a swap contract then they know this will introduce some tracking error due to the fee’s from the 3rd party.\n\nIf Tesla price does spike then this will lead to lower S&P index performance post inclusion but index fund managers could say that fault lays with the S&P committee that added Tesla in a way that led to a price spike. Provided their tracking error is low they can defend the management of their portfolio.\n\nGod knows what will happen, will be interesting to see.
