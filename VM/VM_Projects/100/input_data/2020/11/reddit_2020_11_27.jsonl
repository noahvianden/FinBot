I don’t necessarily feel the same, because IMO, it depends on the stock. For example, PLTR—at $9-$11—was trading below where it was sometimes privately valued in past years. That was rather absurd, and IMO it was valued more like a consulting / defense company (in a way) rather than the market fully realizing its potential w/ software valuation. I had a lot more DD obviously, but that made it very attractive at $10 to me. Some other IPOs / direct listings (see: Snowflake) are not as attractive to me, regardless of whether I’m right or wrong in the short term (for example, w/ SNOW I was “right” for a little bit, then “wrong” now that’s it at ATH, but really that’s just how it happened not b/c my research was good or bad). \n\nBut I think you are totally reasonable in wanting to wait out some of the volatility. Sometimes like w/ FB, that’s a great idea. But if it shoots up 3x-5x (e.g. PLTR), you gotta know when to pull the trigger and hop in, rather than hoping for a dip back to where it listed, or even 2x where it listed, as I highly doubt PLTR corrects back to even $20, though it might drop 10-15% more.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes you are absolutely correct.

That said, for those who are interested in TRADING, this post may not apply as much to you.\n\nHowever, for those who are thinking about INVESTING.  Please tread carefully.  Ask yourself these questions\n\n1. Do you know what the company does / is hoping to achieve?\n2. How does that sit with you?  Do you agree with the company's goals?\n3. What, if anything, would change your decision?  What are factors that you believe will prevent the company from doing what it intends to do?\n4. Given that you have a sense of the company's achievements, goals, and plans for the future, are you okay with paying what it's currently worth?\n\nAt least take some time to answer some of these questions before moving forward.  Similarly come up with a plan for investing your money.  Establish how much you intend to put in the company (i.e. 300 dollars).  If you are concerned that you are buying, for example, PLTR at its all time highs and that it will dip next week, start a position 1/3th position today and come up with a plan to invest the other 2/3 over the next two weeks.  That way if it does dip, you catch some of the dip, but if it does continue to go up for two more weeks, you at least caught some of the initial price/gain.  Either way, at least, by starting a 1/3rd position you can satisfy your FOMO and adjust your plan accordingly from there.\n\nAt the end of the day, tread carefully.  Take as much emotion out of the equation as possible.  If your decision to invest is completely based on speculation, then acknowledge that and make sure even that is part of your plan.  I generally encourage every investor to leave some room for spec. plays, but only to the extent that every dollar you invest is all accounted for.  Remember the fundamental fact that by buying a company's stocks you are buying into that company.  Trust me, there will always be more opportunities to make money in the markets.  Right now it's PLTR.  A few days ago it was everything EV, few months ago it was all BioTech, a few months before that it was chip stocks.\n\nBest of luck and may we all come out as winners in one way or another.", "id": "k21qbk", "created_utc": 1606486144.0, "score": 1322, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 377, "comments": [{"body": "I stopped trading on fundamentals after I got burned several times this year and missed out on some big opportunities.

In the event of link failure, the driver can still maintain control of the vehicle but the tire may contact the wheel arch liner.\"\n\n> NHTSA said 32 complaints involve failures that occurred during low-speed parking maneuvers, while 11 occurred while driving. Another eight complaints may also involve the same issue, NHTSA added.\nThe agency said \"the complaints appear to indicate an increasing trend, with... three of the incidents at highway speeds reported within the last three months.\"\n\n> On Nov. 20, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in the U.S. District Court in California over suspension issues in Model S and X vehicles claiming vehicles have defects that can result in the front and rear suspension control arm assembly components prematurely failing.\nIn a blog post in June 2016 Tesla denied any safety defect in Model X or Model S suspensions, but acknowledged NHTSA had asked the company to informally provide information about suspensions without opening a formal investigation.\n\n> Last week, NHTSA said it was expanding a separate probe into nearly 159,000 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, upgrading it to an engineering analysis, a step required before it can seek to compel recalls.\n\n\n> NHTSA had opened a preliminary evaluation in June over touchscreen failures. The agency said the failure can result in the loss of rear-camera image display when in reverse and reduced rear visibility when backing up, and can impact defogging ability, and audible chimes relating to Autopilot and turn signals.\n\n> That probe now covers 2012-2018 model year Tesla Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles.

The post-closing entity will be listed on NASDAQ under new ticker AVPT and maintain the AvePoint name. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n[Company's Footprint](https://preview.redd.it/hc09mm676r161.png?width=2336&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcd7d11a2681c0cc6d44c7a0f79996caf32b8a1)\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company’s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company “Bridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires”\n\n[Blue-Chip Client Base](https://preview.redd.it/0uk448a96r161.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=b61eb238ce37f141bdce97e697dfeb83d3c65384)\n\n* Compared to other recent SPAC deals and business combinations we just saw, AvePoint has indeed a great track record. Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\n[Strong Financials](https://preview.redd.it/5bvco38b6r161.png?width=2676&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b300e2cab1456089b024f5cfd61c6f598d80d7f)\n\n* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\n[Current and Future Potential](https://preview.redd.it/jwg00s6d6r161.png?width=2704&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e3dcfdd8f3fea45a494e49e9bb81d55857287a)\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\n**// About APXT**\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn’t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex’s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners. Implied enterprise value of 9.0x 2021E revenue with very attractive valuation multiples compared to peers\n\n[Transaction Details](https://preview.redd.it/0ldackve6r161.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e9ec5264c32e5db6076833fbea655a4b2dfe47b)\n\n**// Advisors**\n\nEvercore Group L.L.C., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co.

{"title": "APXT: Merger with AvePoint", "selftext": "\nAPXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022.\n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.\n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.\n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,\n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $13.90 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.", "id": "k23o04", "created_utc": 1606492570.0, "score": 482, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "The CEO has a very unfortunate name", "score": 203, "replies": [{"body": "This could mean more meme potential.

{"title": "Options Explained - A Quick Beginners Guide", "selftext": "Fellow Bettors, if you understand options, move on.\n\nFirst, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.\n\nI've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.\n\nAs much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.\n\nDepending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.\n\n* What are options?\n   * The Basics/Buying vs. Selling Options\n   * The Money\n   * Calls Explained\n      * Buying Calls\n      * Selling Naked Calls\n   * Puts Explained\n      * Buying Puts\n      * Selling Naked Puts\n* Options Pricing\n   * Intrinsic Value\n   * Extrinsic Value\n* Do I Have to Hold to Expiration?\n* The Details\n* The Greeks\n* Helpful Links\n\n**Options Explained**\n\n***The Basics***\n\nBuying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).\n\n* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.\n* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.\n\nSelling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.\n\n* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.\n* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.\n\n***The Money***\n\nFor Calls:\n\n* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised\n* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.\n\nFor Puts:\n\n* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price\n* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price, can immediately be exercised\n* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised\n\n***Calls Explained***\n\nBuying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.\n\n[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)\n\nThis is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.\n\n* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised\n* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money\n* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even\n* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent\n* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars\n* Price - Price of the option\n\nIn the above example:\n\n* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss\n* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.\n\nThe Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.\n\n***Buying Calls***\n\nOk, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.\n\nAs the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:\n\n* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)\n\nOn 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:\n\n* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.\n* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**\n* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.\n\n***Selling Naked Calls***\n\nIf you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.\n\n[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)\n\nNotice \"To Break Even\" turns into \"Chance of Profit.\"  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.\n\n**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.\n\n***Puts Explained***\n\nBuying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.\n\n[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)\n\nNone of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.\n\n* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss\n* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised\n\n***Buying Puts***\n\nThe 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.\n\nAs the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:\n\n* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time\n* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time\n* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing\n\nOn 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:\n\n* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.\n* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.\n* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.\n\n***Selling Naked Puts***\n\nIf you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.\n\n**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS \"CAPPED\" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**\n\n***Options Pricing***\n\nThe price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.\n\n* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|\n   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value\n   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price.\n   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play\n* Extrinsic Value\n   * Effected by theta and implied volatility\n   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value\n   * Theta\n      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.\n      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d\n\n* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time\n   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV.\n   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.\n   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.\n   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.\n\n***Do I Have to Hold to Expiration?***\n\nLets say we buy the $MSFT 12/31 $230.0C.  Do we have to wait until December 31? No.  If the underlying increases to lets say $225.0 by next Friday, 12/4, we could sell the option for likely a pretty good profit.  We payed $1.67 for the contract, but the price of the Call may increase to $3.67, so we could Sell to Close for a $200 profit, allowing us to move on to another trade.  But as we approach the strike delta increases and therefore may be worth holding.  The break even information is only if you intend to hold the call to expiration and profit from exercising and then immediately selling the shares back into the market.  Due to time and market craziness, I recommend taking profit from the option itself rather than exercising and using the shares.\n\n***The Details***\n\nGoing back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774\n\nThis explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.\n\n* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price\n* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price\n* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree\n* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold\n* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option\n* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option\n* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day\n* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled\n\nBid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.\n\nOpen Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.\n\nThe lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.\n\n***The Greeks***\n\nYou can see the Greeks listed above for this call.\n\n* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.\n* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.\n* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.\n* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.\n* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.\n\n***Helpful Links***\n\nHere are some awesome links that will help everyone get better at trading options.\n\n[Options Strategies | Learn To Trade Options - The Options Playbook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/)\n\n[Investing with Options (robinhood.com)](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/trading/investing-with-options/)\n\n[Options Trading Strategy & Education (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/options-trading-strategy-and-education-4689661)\n\nI hope you find this helpful.

When you sell the option, you don't need any cash, and so you won't need the cash that you would otherwise need to exercise that option. Google \"Buy to open\" and \"Sell to close\" if you want further reading on this.\n\nFor an example, take a look at the historical prices for this PLTR DEC 18 2020 $30c option and switch to the \"6M\" graph view: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR201218C00030000?p=PLTR201218C00030000.

That's a profit of $3.9 * 100 without ever having to exercise the option. That's a 400%+ gain in two days even without exercising the option. To execute both tbe buy and sell parts of this trade, all you needed was just the original $0.90 * 100 to buy the option for, plus whatever your broker charges for each trade (zero if you're on Robinhood).\n\nThe value of the option, and the price which you sell it depends on the intrinsic value and extrinsic value of the option. Getting a good understanding of these values and what cause them to move up or down could allow you to make lots of profit without ever having to exercise an option, and without the price of the underlying stock having to necessarily move up or down. \n\nI recommend opening a play money account so you can get a feel for how option prices move without risking real money.

They are receiving the *option*.\n\nSellers of puts and calls are writing the contract, so they have *obligations*. \n\n- Buy call - the option to purchase at strike\n- Sell call - the obligation to sell (to the buyer) at strike\n- Buy put - the option to sell at strike\n- Sell put - the obligation to buy (from the buyer) at strike\n\nAnd if you're bullish enough to sell a put, you might as well buy a call.

Let's say PLTR is trading at $20 and you want to open a position expiring in 3 months.\n\nYou have 3 put write strategies. All 3 are bullish, as selling puts only makes money by selling options which move further OTM and/or theta decay.\n\n- sell an OTM $15 strike, make $100 premium, $1500 collateral tied up\n- sell an ATM $20 strike, make $300 premium, $2000 collateral tied up\n- sell an ITM $25 strike, make $500 premium, $2500 collateral tied up\n\nNow if PLTR drops in any scenario, those puts get further ITM, so what you sold gains in value and you've lost. Maybe the OTM $15 strike still expires worthless because you're lucky. In any case you were wrong about the price movement and you may end up bagholding at a price higher than what the stock trades at. And you're trying up a lot of cash here.\n\nBut let's say you're right, and PLTR goes up to $30, making all 3 options above further OTM. \n\nThe $15 strike can be bought back for maybe nothing as it's really far OTM. You made $1 on a $10 move. Better to have owned shares.\n\nThe $20 strike, maybe you can buy back for less than half what you sold, depending on how much time is left. So a $2 profit on a $10 increase.\n\nThe ITM put is the best here, as it's now OTM, but still within range if PLTR drops. So you might be able to buy it back for $1 and profit $4 on a $10 move. In all cases you're selling ITM and buying to close OTM when things are cheaper. But your max profit is always the credit. So you've capped any black swan gains, which is the weakness of writing puts. Gains are capped, and your max loss is unlimited down to zero. If PLTR hits $40, you miss most of the gains. If PLTR tanks to $10, you're now sitting with a $1500 loss because you bought shares at $25/share.\n\nNow let's say when PLTR was trading at $20, you bought an OTM $30 call instead. Since it's OTM, it's cheap. Let's say you paid $100. When PLTR hits $30, that option is ATM. Probably worth around $1000 on a $10 move like that. If PLTR goes higher, it gets deeper ITM and you start seeing dollar for dollar increases with the stock. You get enormous returns.\n\nIf you're wrong, you lose $100. That's all you've tied up as far as capital. No matter how far the stock drops.\n\nPut writing is good for low IV stocks which are trading in a predictable range. But generally put writing is only worth it when IV is high, otherwise you won't make hardly anything. I used to do a lot of this and the risk/reward wasn't there.

You will need the price of the underlying to increase for you to make money on the trade.  If ITM, the price movement may only be 1 or 2%, if OTM the price of the option will be cheaper because there is no intrinsic value but to be exercised the price will need to move above the strike, meaning a larger move.  If you buy an OTM call you can sell before expiration for a profit even if the call is OTM, the underlying just needs to rise in price enough to offset loss from Theta and possibly IV.  If you buy a 12/31 $MSFT $230.0 call and the price increases next week to from $215.0 to $225.0, you could exit the trade for a nice profit even though the underlying is till OTM.

One section that I think may be confusing for new traders is your explanation of the greeks, as you gave more abstract details for these. I would add the following to each explanation:\n\nDelta - One options contract = 100 shares, so each 0.01 delta can be thought of as being equivalent to owning or shorting (call or put, respectively) one share of the underlying stock. A call/put with a strike that is slightly below/above the current stock price will have a delta of \\~0.50 (probably not necessary to explain why it's not 0.50 when strike = stock price, but can give that if you don't know and want the info). An option's delta at any given time is also proportional to the probability of the option being ITM at expiration. This makes sense when you think about it a little bit because delta = \\~0.5 when the option is ATM, which gives us \\~50% chance of being ITM at expiration. This is intuitively sensible since the strike = stock price and the stock price could go either way, so we have about a 50/50 shot of success.\n\nWhat you said about delta approaching 1 as the stock moves through the strike price is somewhat misleading, as only deep ITM stocks will actually have a delta near one. For instance, for the Dec 24th option expiry you listed, a call at strike of $180 has a delta of 0.93. So, it would be more accurate to say that delta will approach 0.50 as stock price approaches strike price, and will approach 1.00 if the strike price becomes deep ITM. \n\nGamma - It may be helpful to mention that Delta is analogous to velocity and gamma is analogous to acceleration, as it makes these concepts a bit more concrete. May be worth explicitly saying that gamma will be highest for near the money stocks and will decrease as you move OTM in either direction. Can spell out why this if if it's helpful.\n\nTheta - pretty much spot-on, but may be worthwhile to mention (as your figure explained) that theta values are not static and that they rise rapidly as you approach expiration.\n\nVega - I understand what you're saying, but your explanation is technically incorrect. A \"drop in vega\" would mean that the vega greek is dropping, so that the option would become less sensitive to changes in IV. I think you meant to say that a drop in IV will cause a drop in the value of the option proportional to vega. So, if vega = 0.05 then the contract will lose $5 in value for every 1% decrease in IV (and will increase  proportionally for the same move upwards). This is not that important for low IV stocks, but if a stock has a high IV (take PLTR as an example at 170% IV currently), this can cause a dramatic drop in option price value when IV drops. The best way to think of IV (imo) is in terms of IV rank, which is the percentile rank of IV compared to the last year of IV data. When IV rank is high, IV (on average) will tend to decrease because of reversion to the mean. Obviously, this is a tricky concept, because it's completely context dependent and IV can easily exceed it's previous highs if there is a lot of uncertainty, but reversion to the mean helps you to anticipate what IV the stock will likely approach when earnings or other events (like battery day) end. You can take advantage of this tendency by selling credit spreads or naked options, which can both benefit from drops in IV.\n\nRho - You got it, pretty much irrelevant for the average trader in normal times, but almost meaningless in a time of \\~0% interest rates from central banks...\n\nGlad you're preaching to the masses and hope this helps in some way.

This is a cool question because I learned things trying to figure it out. \n\n\nThat said:\n\n1. Movement in the underlying, including very importantly the second derivative of that movement (the rate at which the price change is slowing or accelerating, the concavity/convexity of the price curve, whatever you want to call it) is probably a major determinant of IV (that is, it is obviously 1/3rd of B-S). Since the underlying stabilizes (its direction stabilizes, not necessarily its price) after earnings, IV should decrease.\n\n2. Whether most places use B-S or whatever I don't remotely know enough about to be correct on. My best guess would be something a lot like it with a good helping of empirical fudge (that is, an empirically determined correction factor for, for instance, distance from ATM - in total probably a series of factors). My guess is again that most correction factors probably use market metrics as a proxy for human behavior and human behavior as the proxy for implied volatility when adding any adjustments, and since everybody calms their proverbial tits after earnings, additional markers of volatility do to. This is mostly deduced from the fact that IV movements seem to care little about the causative factor behind the volatility, and securities that are by design volatile but in which little interest exists seem to have understated IV.\n\n3. At least from what I can see, the existence of a bid-ask spread implies that ultimately all pricing is a guide, and the option itself still needs to be traded. I am least sure about this, but then I am not very sure about any of this. \n\nYou shouldn't take any of this to the bank though, this is not my day job and I'm not trying to change careers. This is just pieced together from a habit of analyzing formulas and uh... looking what buttons exist on my broker.\n\nEdit: Another reason why I sort-of believe most of the above is that the dogma of modern financial analysis seems to be that modeling the most common patterns out-performs (or draws even with less labor-hours) any sort of manual adjustment and is far less prone to catastrophic blindspots.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for putting the response together.

If there’s some low/volume liquidity stock and for some dumb reason a bunch of retards decide to start overpaying for the options, then it doesn’t really matter what IV and theta says.

Don't be scared about options, they are a great way to bet on a stock with a higher reward than simply buying the underlying.  The max loss when buying options is just the amount of money you pay for the premium. If you do good DD and are comfortable with losing the premium payed fucking do it.\n2. Ok, break even formula is Strike Price + Premium Payed = Break Even.  Think about it, you pay $1.67 for the 12/31 $230.0 on $MSFT.  If you think about it for each individual stock, you will lose some money if the stock closes between $230.0 and $231.67 because you PAYED $1.67 for each stock.  This is if you are going to exercise.  If you bought the option right before close today and $MSFT goes up to $225.0 by next Friday, next Friday you could sell for a profit because the underlying is closer to the strike and there is still quite a bit of time before expiring.  If you wanted, you could sell for a profit and move on to the next trade.  The break even is specific for if you are going to hold to expiration and exercise.  IF you sell early and the option price increases from $1.67 to say $3.67, you could sell for a profit of $2.00, or a total of $200.\n3. If you sell a call and the price goes up, you can keep that open to expiration.  Don't worry about what the other guy is doing, in high volume trades if you close it is VERY unlikely it is with the original \"partner\".  Some things may happen:\n\n\\- Stock goes up but remains below the strike, you have balls of steel, you just hang out and you let the option expire worthless, Theta Gang.  The $1.67 is yours.\n\n\\- Stock goes up to $225.0 and you get scared, you Buy to Close for lets say $3.67 and lose $2.00, or $200.  If there is news that propels the stock up (i,e. MSFT develops a way to cure cancer, the best bet would be to close as early as possible.)  This type of news is rare though, having a stomach can greatly pay off if you are selling.  Selling options on high IV stocks like $NIO or $PLTR is not smart, these are the buyers home turf.\n\n\\- Stock goes up and goes past strike, you hold until expiration.  You are now responsible for buying the 100 shares of the stock at the current market price and selling them at the strike if it was as naked call.  If the stock is $240.0, you would lose $833.0 on the trade.  \\[($250.0 - $240.0) x 100\\] - $1.67 = $833.\n\n**I HIGHLY ADVISE AGAINST SELLING NAKED CALLS AND PUTS.**  The risk/reward is not worth it.

Because of the greeks, option prices move much more dramatically than underlying stocks do.\n\nLets say you have $1000.  And there is company X, Y and Z.  Each one selling around the $25 dollar mark.  You could diversify by spreading out and buying stocks in each one, or diversify by buying (2) months to expiry $30.0 call for each for we'll say $330.0.  Stock X goes down to $20, you lose that $330.0  Stock Y goes to $35, you make a little around $200, but stock Z.  Stock Z goes up to $100 dollars. You'd make around $700 on this trade.  Options allow higher leverage for lower capital but are overall a gamble, possibly a very good gamble, on an underlying stock.  Stocks are way safer, options are way more fun and are gambling.  Worst case if you buy stocks is all three go down and you sell for a loss on all three.

Let's say my goal is to make a 30k profit, but I'm also willing to accept a 30k loss. I buy 100k of the stock and if it goes up 30%, I make 30k. If it goes down 30%, I lose 30k and close the position. If it doesn't move in either direction, I had no gain or loss. So my max gain is 30k and my max loss is 30k, and it's possible for me to wind up with no gain or loss at all. \n\nIf I had the exact same outlook on PLTR but wanted to do it with options, how would I be better off?
