{"title": "AMD is a steal at $75", "selftext": "\\[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link\\]\n\nI have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Q3 Earnings Report**](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a33e72ea85fe760bd81d3f9e8b71721/amd/news/2020-10-27_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_976.pdf)\n\nFirst of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**35B Xilinx Takeover**\n\nThen there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:\n\n[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)\n\n[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)\n\nSince this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New GPU Reveal**\n\nThen there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**\n\nThis has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO\n\n**RISK**\n\nOf course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\nAMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.", "id": "jn7ej3", "created_utc": 1604395807.0, "score": 276, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 196, "comments": [{"body": "Valid points.

People pay that much for this company because they expect it will grow fast. (another comment here mentioned price-earnings-growth-ratio, another metric; and you might wanna compare AMD to more mature business that grow at 3-4% yoy, and their PE value)\n\nLet's assume AMD continues with +50% earnings next year. There are 2 extreme options:\n\n\\- P/E of 60 holds or gets even higher, which means stock price will grow +50% or more\n\n\\- P/E of 60 \"normalizes\", maybe to 20-30, which means stock will basically stay flat or worse\n\nThe truth is somewhere in between. However, the higher a company's current valuation - and P/E is a basic metric for that - , the less margin for error is there. So basically, the second AMD won't make 50% yoy but \"only\" 30% (which is still a lot), there's a high risk that the stock will take a hit.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Ah, ok.

Amazon can continue to grow revenue at their outstanding rates, but at a certain point how much more of the pie can you reasonably expect them to take?

Either that pie is going to have to grow massively or Amazon is going to be jockeying for 10% of the total US stock market’s market share.
