I personally couldn’t justify the value, so I’m letting the rest, the “profits” ride for free. I still believe in their future and with ev etfs, I also got those before they blew up big so I’m not to worried on those. I do think they shot up massively. \n\nTesla’s the only one I’m still not to worried about. Although I’m planning on holding what I have currently, that’s been one of the one stock I’ve been selling and buying back into skimming the profits. Long term I think they’re still good and it’s not out of line. \n\nWhat I think is wild is I see a lot of comparisons to Tesla’s market cap. Which makes these companies blowing up, selling only 10s of thousands of cars in a year who are strictly automotive compared to Tesla which isn’t just an automotive company, even crazier. \n\nThey’re priced to perfection. I’ve made the comments in the nio sub trying to point it out. Again, it’s not like I’m saying they’re not a great company or that it’s bad long term, but with a run like this without much change in fundamentals is crazy. Buying 3 months ago or before is completely different than buying now. If anything were to not be above expectations enough, seeing a 10-20 percent drop or more wouldn’t be out of line, and that will hurt those buying it at a 50+ billion cap. \n\nAnd I can’t stand legacy brands, they’re crap and I see people point to their market cap and it’s justification, and there’s a reason it’s been sliding for years. They’ve got so many problems, and so little global market. But even still, they do sell multitudes more, and even if they go down and finally die, it’s going to be a slow ride there. Really both sectors are valued too much in my opinion, but one will prevail. \n\nProtecting some profits is crucial though. Atleast until things simmer down. It can be the downside to getting in earlier, missing some growth, but the easier growth is done with these companies. But you’ve got to preserve your wealth, when you get greedy, you’re letting your emotions dictate your thinking and that’s when you start to lose. I don’t believe there’s a simple line as to what is right or wrong on the timing or percent of preserving, but you do have to reevaluate the risk and seize opportunities. But everyone just thinks everyday should be going to the moon and don’t realize the implications of that. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone going long on everything I have. That’s why I’m holding what I am. But I didn’t anticipate that run. Part of me hates that I pulled some of it early as I anticipated it all going long, but I had this sort of thinking.

TBH, I really can't speculate, this is out of my wheelhouse at this point.\n\nIMO I think there are a few of things to breakdown here.\n\n1. I do think Waymo is ahead in self-driving. The people saying HD maps are a problem is TSLA,  the ones choosing not to use it. Obviously they will say it's inferior since they aren't using it. This IMO was a cost-cutting measure for their cars, not really a performance issue or difficulty with HD maps themselves.\n2. TSLA clearly is ahead in creating a \"fleet\". Waymo doesn't make cars, they are building a driver. They have to partner with car companies to create their \"fleet\".\n3. I think Waymo has a real chance in \\~2 years of being DaaS - Driver as a Service. They will need to focus on creating a functional ecosystem for this to work though - which will include HD maps. They then need to sell packages to all other car manufacturers of their HD maps, Driver Software, and possibly a lightweight lidar system.\n4. I'm not worried about TSLA because it's clear they are fully vertically integrated. IMO, this is TSLAs greatest strength - they have identified a huge market around batteries & electricity and they were the first mover. This includes EV  vehicles, battery technology, in home batteries, & solar roofing. FSD is just a bonus on top IMO. I think eventually TSLA will switch to a hybrid Camera/Lidar system, too.\n\n**tldr;** I don't know enough about HD maps and FSD in itself to really provide evidence, but I don't think TSLA/Musk has provided evidence that HD maps are actually difficult either.

No? Well, let me give you a rundown:\n\n* Autist reads about a million pages of subprime housing loan structures.\n* Determines that they are unsustainable and eventually they will go into default.\n* Goes to a big bank and purchases CDS, or credit default swap to short the housing market.\n* Doesn't buy puts because he isn't a  gaybear, or something.\n* Housing market collapses, he makes billions.\n\nSo that's basically it. Lazy, poorly explained rundown? Yep. And fuck you, just go watch the movie.\n\nSome of his other notable trades this year are:\n\n* GME,  which he bought back in Q1 2020, and we all know how that shit worked out.\n* PDS, which he purchased 4 million shares of at around $0.75 in Q2,  currently trading at $17.85.\n* BBBY, 1 million shares bought around  $10.60, currently trading at $20.24\n* CPA, flipped 155k shares, bought for around $50.56, currently trading at $75.78.\n\n[13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm)\n\n**Overview**\n\nI  could go on, but my point here is Christian Bale is extremely autistic,  and if you want to be autistic too, go long on one of his recent additions per his latest 13F: LUMN Technologies. Mr. Bale added a  whopping 800k shares in Q3, his 4th largest addition to his portfolio this past quarter.\n\nWhat is LUMN,  you ask? Well, they are formally Centurylink. And yes, we all know how much of a shit company that was. Hear me out though.\n\nA  lot of companies are going through a bit of a renaissance these days.  COVID is forcing public companies to be smarter, more efficient, and adaptable.\n\nOut are the boring days of boomer telephone lines. Centurylink has transformed themselves into  Lumen Technologies, switching their focus to helping companies enter the  \"4IR\", or Fourth Industrial Revolution. The term makes me gag.\n\nSome of their business exposure includes:\n\n* Adaptive  Network Systems\n* Advanced Collaboration Platforms\n* AI-Driven Adaptive  Threat Intelligence\n* Edge Computing \\*Hybrid Cloud Networks\n\nNow I'm no network engineer, but that shit sounds pretty fancy right?\n\n[LUMN](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html)\n\n**Financials:**\n\n* Recently beat their Q3 earnings, with non GAAP EPS at .40, the consensus estimate was .34.\n* EBITDA was $2.19B, and the company grew net income to $366M from a year-ago $302M.\n* Adjusted net income rose to $430M from $328M last year.\n* Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $1.794 billion for the third quarter 2020.\n* Revenues fell 3.4% overall to $5.17B, compared to $5.350 billion for the third quarter 2019.\n\nBut revenue being down is bad right? Shut the fuck up, LUMN has almost fully recovered their revenue stream from last year, showing solid management in an era of COVID.\n\n[Q3 ER](https://ir.lumen.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Lumen-Technologies-Inc-Q3-2020-Earnings/default.aspx)\n\nI  think this is a positive growth stock moving forward. Additionally,  with further lockdowns on the horizon, we should start to see this equity continue to pick up traction, think NFLX, ZM, etc.\n\n[In ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)[fact, this report from Mordor Intelligence estimates that the CAGR of  Fiber Optics and IT solutions will grow at a 15% rate by 2025. ](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/fiber-optic-cable-market)\n\nPositions: 1/21 10c, 4/21 12c, 7/21 15c, and 11/21 15c\n\nThese contracts are dirt cheap folks, all under a buck as it stands right now.

Fucking P/E, P/B and P/S ratios, graphs, and everything for you degenerates.\n\nEDIT 4 11/23 20:47: Alright let's try this one again. Below is some additional information to the Bears in the comments who brought up some really great points. Thanks, guys. I'm still right though, and here's why:\n\nFirst I'm gonna get this out of the way: Everyone who's saying \"bUrRy sUcKs uR cHeRrY pIcKiNg\", ur momma's a hoe.\n\nOk, I would have thought this goes without saying, but yeah, Burry loses trades. He's not out there batting 100%, or whatever the bullshit way y'all score batting averages in that boring ass sport.\n\nThen again, he definitely is some flavor of Autistic. You ever hang around one? These are the same people who will repeatedly punch themselves in the face because they don't like their new fleece-lined jacket, then play piano sonata no. 14 after hearing Beethoven once. This boy is major leagues, y'all still playing T-Ball.\n\nAnyways let's look at some price ratios:\n\n* PE Ratio: 8.40 compared to industry average 16.46.\n* PB Ratio: .80 compared to industry average 2.64.\n* PS Ratio: .52 compared to industry average of 2.48.\n\nDon't know what these mean? Well fucking google it. Or youtube it if you have trouble reading. Point here is you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. This is a company that did $21bn in revenue (TTM) and is trading around $10 bucks a share. LUMN is rapidly reducing their debt, recently offering a $750m Private Debt deal to Qwest. Further, they are soon going ex-dividend, which I have seen as a drag on their growth and value. The current dividend yield is about 10%, and getting rid of this will help reduce liability. You got 3 days folks, if you don't own shares by 11/27, no mas dividends. So you know, buy some of this shit.\n\n[Finch](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-lumen-technologies-centurylink-inc-senior-unsecured-notes-bb-rr4-23-11-2020)\n\nSubsidiaries & Partnerships:\n\nIn a nod to my previous point, I think LUMN was a dying telecom giant who has shifted their focus to all the fancy tech shit people like these days. LUMN owns a lot of companies and has partnered with some household names. They are casting a very wide net, people:\n\n* Level 3 Communications, subsidy.\n* Qwest, subsidy.\n* Prism TV, subsidy.\n* Savvis, subsidy.\n* Expanded their partnership with Zoom to integrate video calling capabilities into their platform.\n* Increased edge computing exposure by partnering with VMware.\n* Gained exposure to virtual learning in public schools by partnering with Sunberry.\n* [More](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/partner/strategic-alliance.html)\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nNew Market Enterprises:\n\nThe estimated CAGR for the demand for low-latency, modular fiber networks in the Asian market is expected to grow at about 9% over the next 5 years. Guess who has the largest fiber network in the world and is strategically positioned to provide the network backbone to the next generation of internet customers in Asia? Verizon! I'm kidding its LUMN. The Asian market demand is only second to the expected growth in North America.\n\nThe aggressive shift to accommodating the rapidly growing tech sector is again the right move by Lumen. Every aspect of their new generation of products is performing well. You might not know it yet, but we are living through a bit of a paradigm shift in the way we communicate and behave. The rapid  growth of the tech industry is a testament to that. I believe that LUMN will act as one of the major suppliers of the growing technological central nervous system. Trust me.

{"title": "Just like $MCD is a real estate co., who happens to sell burgers; RKT is a tech company who happens to sell mortgages.", "selftext": "Good Afternoon,\n\nHow are my beaten-down RKT retards feeling after the ass pounding this past week? I am fairing fine because mentally I knew this was going to happen, which is why I've carried a giant bottle of lube around in preparation for this recent \"packing of thy fudge\" if you will.\n\nBut if you disappointed RKT retards want to feel better about your torn-apart assholes, then I encourage you to click the link below:\n\n[https://www.nexsystech.com/](https://www.nexsystech.com/)\n\nNexsys is in the Rocket FOC (family of companies); they offer two revolutionary products:\n\nClear Sign - this is a digital platform that is on par with Docusign's product - you know Docusign, the over $40B dollar company whose sole purpose is to digitally sign documents THE SAME way that the Clear Sign platform allows lenders to engage in Eclosings. Clear Sign is tailored for the mortgage industry - it’s not a one-size-fits-all digital signing package from a company who doesn’t know mortgage closings from mini marts. Eclosings, outside of RKT are very rare but will soon be the industry standard providing immense growth for this product which is already certified for legal use in 25 states (will soon be all 50 states).\n\nThe next product is:\n\nNexsys clear HOI- This technology platform makes it easier to connect insurers and mortgage lenders (yes they are selling this to their competitors). It is a one-stop homeowners insurance verification site that streamlines and automates the process.\n\nNexsys is also going to launch another product for lenders (again, their competitors) which will pull insurance information from a direct API into your LOS or use Nexsys' online portal. It’s connected to any insurer in the network, and real-time updates can be made in seconds rather than days. The product will allow for users to initiate policy updates such as mortgagee changes and effective date changes with their APIs or portal.\n\nNexsys is offering another product, aimed at insurers, which will enable insurers to do the following:\n\n* Free up agents’ time, call center inquiries and B2B, portal maintenance by automating third-party requests; Kick the processes and expenses that don’t generate business to the curb.\n* Communicate to your lenders with consistency. Insurers message and your policy information are sent using the same format every time, eliminating potential data input errors and other delays.\n\nWhy is this important you ask? Well if you are retarded enough to buy RKT at $30, then you are probably retarded enough to not understand why this is eye opening.\n\nRKT is selling their products TO THEIR COMPETITORS - which tells you where RKT's true focus lies: technology, NOT mortgages and if you don't think they will continue to invent and sell more industry-disrupting products like this, then you are highly mistaken.... and retarded. Also there is a big focus on helping insurers with these products - what company does BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY own in insurance?  GEICO - this is a platform not only for mortgages but will also be used for auto. Hmm I wonder who ROCKETS big partnership will be with, which they are waiting until early 2021 to unveil... I also wonder the secret company Warren Buffett is investing in and chose not to disclose in the filing of last quarter's 13F.....\n\nJay Farner said it himself in an interview with CitiBank: we are a technology and marketing company that happens to also sell mortgages (I will do another write up on their digital marketing tech which they also sell B2B).\n\nThe fact that RKT is willing to sell their tech to competitors is eye opening - and if you notice none of the Wall Street analysts talk about this. They think RKT is just a mortgage company.\n\nThere is an information edge here that the market does not realize. For example, those of you who invested in RKT, did you know they were selling disrupting tech to their competitors? Probably not... and neither does the majority of the market.\n\nTheir tech provides simple, fast and trusted digital solutions for COMPLEX personal transactions. Millennials, who will soon make up the majority of the market, do not like anything complex. And this is why they constantly innovate, to satisfy the needs of their customers (dumb ass millenials). They've been leveraging decades of technology investment and innovation to drive industry disruption and deliver an unmatched customer experience in the largest consumer asset class in the us, supported by 3 percent annual home price appreciation \\*knocks on wood\\*\n\nAlso if you haven't listened to Farner's confrence with Citi, check it out, it is worth a listen. Enjoy your weekend fellow bag holders - and know your bag will only get lighter. Eh who knows maybe we are all fucked and should have just invested in EV instead.\n\n[https://kvgo.com/citifintech/rocket-companies-november-2020](https://kvgo.com/citifintech/rocket-companies-november-2020)\n\nTLDR: suck my balls if you can't read what I took time out of my day to write.\n\nEDIT: r/ \n\nlevel 1[UBCStudent9929](https://www.reddit.com/user/UBCStudent9929/) fucks his sister \n\nAlso I have 8,000 shares at $19.53  \n ", "id": "jyeyu8", "created_utc": 1605980681.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Just like Instagram is a tech companies that happens to sell soft-core pornography and hooker services", "score": 166, "replies": [{"body": "WeWork?
