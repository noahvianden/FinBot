PLTR was to buy for fun.. I just wanted to see what would happen if it hits 40 by next week. Within the same day, it dropped from 3.22 to 0.8 and I knew I messed up.\n2. WORK was a speculative play. I know there's some acquisition coming and I thought that will boost the price up..\n3. FCEL was also another speculation.

It reminded me of \"Richest Man In Babylon\" story of investing in something you actually understand. Obviously I had no idea since Friday was my first time trying out options.

I would like to know specifically what happens or what Robinhood does if the stock ends at let's say $37. And what (if any) mistakes I can make to lose more than my theoretical max loss of $60 (or the debit I paid to open this butterfly)\n\nI have some questions about what happens in a specific situation if I do nothing and let Robinhood (or any broker) exercise my options. I bought a butterfly spread but I believe that this situation can be simplified to a call credit spread, and what happens if the price of the stock is between the two strikes of the spread at expiry.\n\nFor background, I have <$1000 in the account and no other stocks, so that is also why I'm asking, because I don't know if I need enough money in my account to cover the situation where I may need to buy back the shares manually.\n\n\n$PLTR 12/24\n\n1 x $30 call buy  at $4.60\n\n2 x $35 call sold at $3.23\n\n1 x $40 call buy  at $2.46\n\nnets me **$0.60** debit\n\nSo I spent $60 to make a total of $440.\n\n\nMy understanding is that if I just let this ride all the way to expiration, and say Robinhood does not close my position for some reason.\n\n* At $29, everything is worthless and I lose ($60)\n\n* At $33, the two middle and top are worthless and I make $3x100 - $60 so I profit $240\n\n* At $35, I assume the two middle and top are still worthless and I max profit $5x100 - ($60) = $440\n\n* At $42, everything is in the money Robinhood will exercise everything and I don't have to manually do anything, it will exercise my two buys and give them to my two sells and I lose ($60).\n\n\nThe part that confuses me is if the price is say $37, then bottom and middles are in the money. I assume Robinhood will exercise my lower call and I then have 100 shares at $30, and it will sell those shares to one of my sold calls at $35 so I net $500. But now I'm on the hook for another 100 shares that i need to sell at $35, with only $500 from that first trade. Do I then have to *manually* go buy 100 shares at $37 ($3700) really quickly and sell to them at $35 and then lose $200?

No broker does. You should control your own trades and close before expiration.\n\nThe question of what RH will or won't do can be totally avoided, if you just close the position before expiration. Much simpler and much less risky. Don't get hung up on max profit, nobody gets that every time. Shoot for a lower amount with less risk. The Exit Guide above doesn't have an entry for long call flies, but you can interpolate from the bull and bear debit vertical spreads, which all say 50% or more of the max profit. So you should be shooting for a gain of $220.\n\nIn the disaster scenario you are imagining, if say you fell into a coma and couldn't close the position before expiration, RH will either close the entire fly for a loss, or will close the short calls for a loss and maybe close the lower long call, if you are lucky. The higher long call is worthless so RH won't do anything with it. RH can see that you are broke, so it they probably won't allow you to get into an assignment/exercise situation. Again, **you can avoid all of this worry by closing the fly yourself before expiration**.\n\nIt's worth noting that PLTR is a volatile stock with no predictable trading range and butterflies prefer stocks that stay in a predictable trading range.

If you're selling a put or call you want the options to become as close to worthless as possible so you collect the max of the premium. So for a cash secured put you'd want the stock to move up away from your strike price and you want to get to your expiry date. You would also want the volume of trading for your options to lower.  This all effects the options value. You don't get the full value of the premium until the option expires OTM, but plenty of people will buy to close a put or call if they will make 30-50% of the premium, and move on to the next option to sell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example: You sell a CSP at a strike of $20with 30 DTE and the underlying is $30.

At that point you may want to either: 1) wait to the expiration date.

{"title": "Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox", "selftext": "December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.\n\nThey're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.\n\nHere are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Affirm\n\nSymbol: AFRM  \nFiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  \nRevenue growth: 93%  \nGross margin: n/a  \nNet loss: $113 million\n\n[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)\n\nFounded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.\n\n**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).\n\n**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.\n\n## Wish (ContextLogic)\n\nSymbol: WISH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  \nRevenue growth: 32%  \nGross margin: 65%  \nNet loss: $176 million\n\n[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)\n\nOvershadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.\n\n**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\n**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.\n\n[Source](https://fortune.com/2020/11/25/2020-ipos-airbnb-roblox-affirm-wish-doordash-predictions-going-public/)", "id": "k3okkw", "created_utc": 1606709769.0, "score": 1811, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 381, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah kids aren't gonna \"put their screens down and play outside more\" even when the pandemic ends lmao.", "score": 1308, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I thought the same thing.

He doesn't know who is on the other side buying or selling that call after he has created that option contract. Maybe confusing but you would be selling a \"call option to buy 100 shares\" to Bob. \n\nFor example, Tesla is $580/share and John wants to cash out at $600/share. He writes 1 covered call contract on his 100 shares for $20. $20x100 shares = $2000. John sells the covered call and you buy it. John gets your $2000 whether or not Tesla hits $600/share.\n\nScenario 1: You paid $2000 and now you have the option to buy John's 100 shares. If Tesla doesn't hit $600, the option expires worthless and you're out $2000. John is up $2000 and still has his 100 shares.\n\nScenario 2: You paid $2000 for the call option and Tesla hits $650/share. You have the option to buy John's shares at $600/share. You make $50x1000 = $5000 - $2000 = $3000 profit. \n\nScenario 3: Tesla hits $650/share and you decide to sell your \"call option to buy\" to Bob. Bob is willing to pay you $4900 for your call option. You profit $4900-$2000= $2900 profit. Bob exercises the option and buys the shares from John then sells them for a quick profit of $100. \n\nYou lose a little bit of profit by not exercising the option yourself and selling it to Bob.

{"title": "Why DOCU will be the best YOLO candidate this week, BETTER THAN PLTR (lots of research)", "selftext": "When news of the Pfizer vaccine broke out, and subsequently broke markets (temporarily), I thought that the news-reported \"rotation\" out of stay-at-home and tech stocks into value stocks provided an immense opportunity to trade some of the popular tickers. In fact, I suspected that the FOMO people felt from missing out on the run following the election was replaced with a skeptical, contrarian viewpoint that life may return to pre-COVID times and stocks return to pre-COVID valuation levels.\n\nI believe the skepticism around the rise of tech is an honest mistake. The effects of COVID on financial markets are not the result of temporary government measures, but likely of permanent regime changes. Let me roll with this as an assumption; you are already probably familiar with the concepts of MP3, rising anti-capitalist populism, a rotation out of cities, large stimulus measures, and a strengthening challenge from China against the dollar as a reserve currency. For those who recognize that 2020 is a regime change and not a temporary boost (or decline, depending on industry), there are plenty of plays worth discussing. I am intentionally going to ignore the discussion around hype stocks, like those in the EV and cannabis craze. Instead, I'm going to focus on a lesser talked about stock, that is still \"big tech\" related, in a high growth phase, and not as speculative as far as valuation is concerned. A stock like that, which does not get a lot of attention, has its moments. This week could be one of those moments, where being in it before a new wave of investors rush in might pay off nicely. Let me share the analysis I have done so far on Docusign ($DOCU).\n\n**Notable Company Features**\n\nDOCU's self-declared TAM is $25 billion just for the eSignature space, in which they are obviously the top player, and they also have efforts underway for a whole Suite solution, expansion (importantly, into international markets), and vertical integration. They're projected to bring in under $2 billion of that this year, so they are very much still in high growth phases, spending a lot of sales/marketing and R&D. It's not hard to see DOCU making tens of billions of dollars of revenue down the road, and this week could cement people's belief that a higher valuation is due to come sooner.\n\nEmployees also really like working at the California-based company. It ranks as one of the best companies on Glassdoor, with over 95% of people recommending the company and giving CEO approval. This piece of metadata is often very useful; great companies attract great talent.\n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\n\nBased on my analysis and my limited experience with financial statements, I think that the most important metric to look out for when DOCU reports earnings is going to be revenue, and how that feeds into year-over-year gross profit growth. I looked at different revenue and expense scenarios, and there wasn't much sensitivity around the consensus net loss per share estimate, of minus 32 cents. However, the year-over-year Q3 growth is estimated to be between 40 - 50% (reverse-engineering their guidance and consensus estimates gets me 42%), and my calculations show it's likely to beat the 50% mark, which I assume to be psychologically significant because growth has stayed at around 40% for over the past year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6i9hnfdib261.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffcd6b3566d4bf27567864e40d48c41c328bb2b5\n\nIn the past two years, DOCU has experienced revenue growth of around 10% quarter-over-quarter. It's maintained an incredibly stable gross profit margin (everything is presented on a GAAP basis) of about 75%. The company's guidance for this quarter shows only a 5.5% growth in revenue against prior quarter, which looks to me like it's extremely conservative, just like the consensus estimate for Zoom in their earnings this week. Notably, both companies have beaten every quarter's revenue estimates in the past two years.\n\nMy \"base case\" for revenue growth is 13%; that's a little less than the 15% from last quarter, and keeping gross profit % flat as well, nets a gross profit growth of 52% year-over-year. I think it's probably likely that we will see gross profit growth of around 50%. Cost of revenue grew 22% last quarter; that was unusual, and I suspect it's related to the free trials. If true, then we should expect cost of revenue to go back to trend, growing in line with actual revenue and keeping gross profit margins neutral.\n\nMy \"bad case\" and \"good case\" call for gross profit growths of 38% and 61%, respectively. They use lower/higher growth rates for revenue, keeping gross profit margins flat as well. I also tweaked some operating expense assumptions in the second half of the table (see Appendix), in which I calculated a net loss per share. The consensus estimate on net loss per share looks a bit more optimistic. It is 32 cents, and my base, bad, and good case call for 34, 47, and 30 cents respectively.\n\nOverall, I expect DOCU to comfortably beat revenue earnings by several percentage points, but the downstream impact into the final net loss per share value is unlikely to surprise.\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pgw9tcjib261.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f7ac48dcc1e8e7f0891d9c9d649e261e26c5cf\n\nWith only about 1% of shares trading hands on an average day, DOCU looks like a stock primed to win. It's been in a very tight trading range for almost the past 5 months, which followed a big rally. Looking at the volume by price indicator, it has done a lot of mean-reverting to the $215 level. More recently, it has tried to escape, getting bought up at $195 and sold at $235 more than once. That's $20 in either direction. Notably, the straddle on next week when it reports earnings shows a $22 move. DOCU's earnings is after-hours on Thursday, which follows just three days after Zoom reports its earnings. This means that we will have a good sense ahead of time of whether DOCU, which is a direct beneficiary of the COVID-era like Zoom, can maintain their explosive growth.\n\nLooking at the broader market, the dollar is sitting at a multi-year low, and it is currently on a downward trend, which just needs a reasonable catalyst to start a lower leg down. That would presumably raise equity valuation levels. In addition, the Nasdaq is \"only\" around 25% higher than its high from February; some names gained far more than others. If you believe in the regime change from physical to virtual, all the new monetary/fiscal mechanisms to support financial markets, the democratization of investing through commission-free trades drawing in new investors (a majority of which buy and hold, raising demand), existing mania around the markets, a changing administration that will be less likely to provoke markets with tweets, and the general desensitization of the average investor, then you probably have an optimistic view like me.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDocusign reports earnings this week. Zoom reports a few days earlier, giving us an early read. Because DOCU has relatively stable finances, I think Zoom will provide key insights into what to expect. Technical indicators are strong. Revenue is likely to beat, and gross profit margin growth could impress. DOCU is an underdog in terms of hype stocks, but has all the characteristics needed to get a lot of attention. And the product that they sell is extremely well received, and they clearly have attracted a lot of talent.

{"title": "Atleryx (AYX) this weird name company is going to the 🌝🌕", "selftext": "supp guys, hope you are ready for another busy week of loss porn and short selling reports that gonna destroy your accounts.\n\nFor all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon🚀\n\n**So what is Alteryx?**\n\nglad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.\n\n**Who are the customers?**\n\nSo the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand.\n\n**Tell me more, please.**\n\nNo problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at.\n\nAlteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.\n\n**Let's dig in for some numbers**\n\nAnnual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.\n\nQ3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.\n\nThe company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nCash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1.5:1 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even stuff like covid. Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though.\n\nCash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%.                                      FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M).\n\nSo the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.\n\n**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)\n\nWell as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied.\n\nSo the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.\n\n**Now we compare this company with other companies**\n\n* SNOW: ‘21 EV / Rev = \\~100x\n* DDOG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \\~ 40x\n* MongoDB: ‘21 EV / Rev = \\~ 25x\n* **Alteryx: ‘21 EV / Rev = \\~ 15x**\n* JFROG: ‘21 EV / Rev = \\~ 30x\n* PLTR ‘21 EV / Rev = \\~ 50x\n\n(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)\n\nAs you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.\n\nGross Margin:\n\n**AYX- 92%**\n\nDDOG- 78%\n\nSNOW - 55%\n\nMongoDB- 69%\n\nP/S Ratio:\n\n**AYX-  16.95**\n\nDDOG- 51.71\n\nSNOW - 150.15\n\nMONGODB-  30.88\n\nPLTR - 47.76\n\nAYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers.

Their website: Their pipeline doesn't seem healthy given that most of their trials are nowhere near phase 2 or phase 3 which means they're not anywhere close to FDA or EMA approval.

Additionally, they also have to work very closely with Pfizer to ensure the drug meets the mfg specifications and pass quality control. This is extremely difficult to do with just one company letting two pharma companies hashing it out. I think from a logistical perspective, **BNTX** and Pfizer would have a hard time orchestrating the delivery of the vaccines vs. Moderna who is just one company. \n\n**MRNA** also had 30,000 participants in their study: [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427?recrs=ad&lead=ModernaTX%2C+Inc.&draw=2&rank=2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427?recrs=ad&lead=ModernaTX%2C+Inc.&draw=2&rank=2)\n\nAs much as I'd like to think I am wrong and root for the small company **BNTX**, I think **MRNA** is going to win this vaccines war or at least be the big winner of the stock market.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "BNTX/PFE had 44,000 in their Covid study, which is complete.

Chinese Americans are doing not enough, which is equivalent to doing the opposite, They haven’t said how Chinese all over the world killed all Americans. \r\nSo truly rely on open system and Western people that is our principles, we need to do armed struggles. The premise of armed struggle is \"the people know the true crime of China.\"  We can only rely on Western people, not Asians and people of color.\r\nEven if the white people only tell each other privately!\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump's lawsuit failed in Pennsylvania\r\nThis shows that there is no judge this profession in the US, the entire United States has been fully controlled by brain control!

Even the Chinese do not know why the Chinese democracy activists have become good people? Because they intend to abandon exaggerating Biden, his crazy fraud is easily exposed!

All strong people will be negatived, and be killed. All things immediately.\r\nBecause China and the US Democratic Party want a Brain-control world, they only need to do one thing----to kill all good people!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election is completely controlled by the Brain-control\r\nAlthough some good people are Brain-control player.\r\nBrain-control player:” In order to find and kill the good people, China deliberately made Trump win in 2016.” In a sentence, I understood all things! The names of the states and the results of the votes show that the brain control completely controls the election results. So we got all the correct explanations: Why did Trump announce victory, stoping counting, to sue? Why did U.S. Chinese support Trump? In recent years, all the world things were inorder to lure good people, find and kill them. So Trump has tried to do the biggest effort in limited power, he can't say brain control, can't launch the war, can't tell people the truth ...... Trump is the only good person.\r\nSo China made shootings and wanted to prevent people from uprising by banning guns. China doesn’t want the Systems, economy, politics, only needs to dominate brain-controls. All brain controllers are low essence. Just kill all good people, China can rule the world! The people don't know this knowledge.\r\nOnly Chinese and Obama do not let me eat, Bidden is not that. So the American people should go to civil war, only need to kill all U.S. Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law theory of Sue in the election\r\nDon't require evidence for Brain-control, The judges should strongly agree with Trump’s prosecution. System'Americans have to fully support Sichuan from justice and all areas. People's uprising, system support, judicial in-depth intervention are right way for Brain-control, Brain-control is no evidences, no in the laws, no public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat’s all of this world\r\nIt's brain control. All political, economic, cultural, scientific, social life is directed by brain control, no open systems, only brain-control system.\r\nEvery thing in dark is sinful. Changing body properties by particle beam irradiation, then use different waves to activate various pre-made body, then Get the needed flesh, parts or whole. You are easily “possessed\" by others with Ubiquitous waves this world. Others can know your thoughts, control your thoughts and behaviors.\r\nHumans only divide into good and bad, the controlled people are good, the controller are bad. No border, no systems, so some questions had answer, China rules the world because it controlled brain controllers all of world.\r\nIt is interesting that the West surrendered China, because politicians are just for a little benefit. The western people are extremely miserable, China's hereditary \"anthropophagy\" system was transplanted to the West, Western flesh, skills, knowledge, ideas, temperament, social status, willpower…… are all “eaten”, brain control technology can get everything of human by waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause this world is a slaughter of the weak people to the strong people\r\nBecause of being led by China, the world’s contradiction is between brain control and non-brain control, that’s a contradiction between the weak people and the strong people too.

{"title": "An In Depth Look Into Carnival Cruise Corp. (CCL) And Why This Stock Is A Ticking Time Bomb For Gains Come 2021", "selftext": "Alright guys, it’s your favorite Adderall munching retard back again with another stock DD (here is link to my last one [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0z2zy/an_in_depth_look_into_robloxrblx_and_why_i_am/). This time I’m going to look at another potential meme stock that is being COMPLETELY overlooked by WSB and why it has the extremely high probability of just exploding in value like Palantir come 2021.\n\nNow my analysis of CCL is broken down into 5 parts: Covid Vaccine, credit market sentiment, insider trades, pent-up demand, and the balance sheet. Since this post is pretty long, a TL;DR will be provided at the top of each section.\n\n**Covid Vaccine**\n\n**TL;DR:** High probability of vaccine rollout in the US starting early to mid-2021. Once this news hit the market, investors will start pricing in a post covid world for travel companies and the stock could go back to ATHs as things go “back to normal.”\n\nWith the recent announcement of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines having a 95% efficacy rate, we are starting to see a massive shift into cyclical stocks and some capital outflow away from WFH stocks like Zoom. Although I am still long-term bullish on these tech stocks, I still believe that this flow into cyclicals still have a LONG WAY to go before it is exhausted. The reason why I am saying this is because travel stocks like CCL, AAL, etc are still trading more closely to their March lows than their ATHs pre pandemic. This is our opportunity because I believe the reason why travel stocks haven’t yet recovered to their ATHs like tech is that even though a vaccine is priced in, the rollout of it has yet to be. Right now there is no solid set date but I think that a 2021 rollout of vaccines in the U.S has a very high probability. The reason why I say this is because the US will be the first country to rollout its vaccine ([vaccine date](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine)) and in Canada where I live, our government already said that the Pfizer vaccine will receive the green light this year and we can start receiving the first shipments of it early next year ([Rollout Timeline](https://globalnews.ca/news/7489967/coronavirus-vaccine-available-canada/)). Once these dates become more set in stone, I believe the market will start pricing in a world post covid and this could be the catalyst to boost travel and tourism back to their ATHs and maybe even higher. Right now, I think one of the main reason why a lot of investors are hesitant to invest in CCL is because of the winter months and they want to see how it all rolls out, but remember, stocks are forward-looking and once vaccines are being rolled out, don’t be surprised if this final barrier of price resistance is broken and investors start rushing in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Credit Market Sentiment**\n\n**TL;DR:** Bond traders are extremely bullish on this company meaning that the fundamentals are still rock solid despite the no sail order. Because of this stock is extremely oversold and is trading well below what its justified based on core fundamentals.\n\nSince most of you probably don’t know this, CCL did two major debt offerings during the pandemic, and boy oh boy did the investors gobble up every dollar.\n\nCCL did their first debt offering back in April 1 by issuing out $4bil in debt that paid 11.5% coupon. Demand was so great for the bond that of the $4bil offered, $17bil was used to bid up the price. It was so frenzied that Carnival decided to issue out an extra billion AND cut its coupon rate, something that was unheard of in an investment grade company ([Debt Issuance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/record-752-billion-of-bond-sales-shows-rush-for-cash-buffers)).\n\nYeah you read that right. When the stock of the company is cratering down into the 9 levels of hell, bond investors remain extremely bullish on the company. This might seem confusing to some of you but keep in mind that credit investors look at different factors than equity investors. In the credit market, transactions are still done dealer to dealer and investors are mostly concerned with whether or not a company is able to pay back its debt with its future earnings buy focusing on the fundamentals. Because of this, credit markets are often a good indication on a company’s fundamental value and where the economy is likely to head in the near future. Judging by the high demand for the company’s debt it would appear that despite having a no sail order, the fundamentals of the company remain relatively intact and the stock is most likely extremely oversold back in March.\n\nCCL’s second offering was a couple of weeks ago in November and guess what, investors gobbled up that shit to. This time the company issued $2bil worth of debt and unlike last time, the company won’t pledge collateral. The demand for CCL’s bonds are so high right now that the debt they issued in April at just under 12% is now trading at a significant premium and yielding only 5%. This means whoever bought their debt back in April can now turn around and sell those bonds back to market at a massive gain because with bonds, the interest rate goes down, price go up.\n\nTo sum this part up, it would appear that the credit market is extremely bullish on the long-term prospects of this company. Since the credit market is more focused on the fundamentals, it would appear that the sell off back in March was extremely over done for the company and the stocks are most likely trading at a heavy discount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insider Trades**\n\n**TL;DR:** Company insiders are eating up shares like a fat kid does cookies. I have never seen such rampant insider buying before. Get in retards.\n\n📷Paying attention to what the company’s executives and BoD are doing are a pretty good way of seeing where the company is likely to go in the near future. So I went on Quiver Quantitative and gentlemen, what I found was truly shocking. Here is a snapshot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imb2fskxte261.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=9356324fcb6128da8ba67e6e9528c27358e71370\n\nWhat you are seeing there is a ratio of almost 21:1 for shares bought to sold. This is probably the highest ratio I have ever seen for any stock, ever. What this means is that company insiders are extremely bullish on this company and if they are willing to put this much money where their mouth is, you should probably to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Society’s View On Cruises**\n\n**TL;DR:** People that go on cruises could not give two shits about the coronavirus. There is an extremely high pent-up demand for cruises to resume as shown by the 100,000 volunteers that showed up for a trial cruise by Royal Caribbean.\n\nI’m going to keep this part simple. People don’t care about the virus as much as the media likes to put them out to be. Right now there is SERIOUS pent-up demand for cruises to be back at full steam again. A good example of this is that recently Royal Caribbean wanted to arrange trial cruises in order to convince regulators that it can run successful Covid-free trips. Guess how many volunteers the company could find? 100? 1,000? Well, if you guessed 100,000 you are correct ([Link](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/royal-caribbean-cdc-trial-cruises-covid/index.html)).\n\nThe company is completely blown away by this and it really shows how much pent up demand there is for cruises.\n\nAs an icing on the cake, here is a link for a Joe Rogan clip in which he discusses cruises with guest Tim Dillon: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmSpQq60-Ls&ab_channel=JREClips)\n\nThis clip essentially explains what cruise people are really like and whether or not the industry is simply going to “go away.” Spoilers, it’s not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**TL;DR:** Financial statements are rock solid. Total assets outweigh total liabilities by a long margin meaning company is extremely solvent. Current cash outflow suggests that the company has more than enough to outlast most of 2021 without having to raise capital. Lastly, company can also easily raise debt to handle any short term liquidity needs.\n\nThe balance sheet is fucking solid. Total assets out-weigh total liabilities by 19.5bil which should put to rest any fears of solvency. Current assets are about 900million short of current liabilities but judging by the ease in which the company can raise cash, liquidity shouldn’t be an issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s21qncpbue261.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=616caf3b2be1088492d14fe650214bae6f5c3be9\n\nIn addition I also looked at their operating cash flow and with 0 cruises, they have -4.6bil operating CF for 9 months ended. But considering their current cash balance of 8.1bil, they easily have enough cash to cover most of 2021 and that’s not even considering raising capital.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srkqasbfue261.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=9563579ab2ba5054962186c6d06ef14ac4bb9498\n\n**The Play**\n\nPlay stocks or long term ITM or ATM calls. The idea is to profit off of the potential pop in price come 2021 when things most likely get back to normal when the vaccine rolls out. Do not buy far OTM or FDs for this play as anything can happen to the rollout causing a dip in price. If you are buying options go for options that expire preferably near year-end 2021. That way theta gang won’t eat you alive if vaccine rollout gets delayed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf any of you are reading this, I would like you all to know that as of February 24, I have officially closed all my positions in CCL.
