{"title": "My SPX Weekly Premium Selling That Dominates the Market", "selftext": "\\-----------------------\n\nEDIT - May 23, 2022\n\nIt has been a LONG time since I first posted this, but I still have people who pop in on occasion, read it, ask questions, etc. I have changed my strategy/parameters quite a bit since posting this. Namely, moved from spreads to naked, added calls, and added profit targets for a pure mechanical play. I'm going to leave everything below in its original state so that it lines up with any comments/discussion. For the current parameters that I'm running, you can reference my website.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been trading stocks for \\~15 years and options for \\~10. I have a full-time job and just do this on the side, but I've seen and tried a lot of stuff.\n\nOne of my favorite trading strategies involves selling SPX put credit spreads around 9-10 delta (2-5% OTM), 2 days to expiration. Crazy, right? Yeah, sounds like it. But bear with me while I lay out the nitty-gritty. I like the strategy so much that I've decided to (finally) lay it out in full detail for others to learn.\n\nMy inspiration for this started after reading and following Karsten's \"Passive income through option writing\" from [EarlyRetirementNow.com](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/09/28/passive-income-through-option-writing-part1/). He lays out his reasoning and thought process way better than I ever could, so if you like what you see here, go check out his stuff as well for more research and a twist on what I'm doing.\n\n**What I Do**\n\nEvery Monday, Wednesday, & Friday, I sell (open) new put credit spreads on SPX that expire at the closest expiration. So, Monday, I sell SPX spreads that expire Wednesday. Wednesday, I sell spreads that expire Friday. Friday, I sell spreads that expire Monday. I hold these all the way to expiration and then open a new position with the next expiration. 95% of the time, these expire worthless and I collect full premium. The other 5% of the time, I suffer a small or large loss. Over the long run, the expected return blows the market out of the water....which leads me to:\n\n**Expected Return**\n\nI've been running this since May 2019 and am averaging something around **150% APY** based on max risk for the spread. It's absurd. Don't believe me? My full trade log is published [here](https://wealthyoption.com/trades), and I update it in real-time. (Yes, that's my website. No, I'm not selling any kind of product/service there. More on that later)\n\n**Risk & Drawdown**\n\nThis massive positive return doesn't come without a cost, of course. And if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. And the cost here is that, yeah, while annual return is a ridiculous 150%, max drawdown can be 100% or more. ***Whaaaaat?!*** Yeah, that's right. While these spreads expire worthless 95% of the time, the other 5% can result in huge losses. These losses can accumulate up to 100% or more depending on the environment.\n\nSo this is a guaranteed way to blow up your account, right? Well, it is if you allocate too much capital to it. But if you keep your allocation small (which I do), then a 100%+ drawdown for this one strategy will be a small fraction of your overall portfolio. I personally only allocate about 10% of my total portfolio to this. What that means is that if/when this trading plan suffers a 100% loss, that only represents 10% drawdown for my portfolio, and I can tap into my other investments to \"replenish\" this trading plan.\n\nThese massive losses do happen, but they don't last long. I ran this very strategy through COVID-19 when VIX moved from 13 to 85 in a month, and my max drawdown was \"only\" about 125%. I reloaded from my other investments, and this put selling strategy recovered and turned green in 2020 before the market itself did...after I went down 125%.\n\n**Pennies, Meet Steamroller, Right?**\n\nYeah, this is pretty close to the definition of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. There's nothing inherently wrong with that IF:\n\n1. The pennies that you collect add up to more than what the steamroller takes away\n2. You limit allocation so that when the steamroller hits you, it doesn't destroy you\n\n\\#1 - I collect around 2.3% premium per position compared to max risk (spread width). 95% of the time, they expire worthless, so I keep the full 2.3%. The other 5% of the time, I suffer what is usually a large loss, averaging around 20%. Do the math here: 95 \\* 2.3 is 220% gain on the wins. 5 \\* 20% is 100% loss on the losers. 220% - 100% makes for a very positive expected return...So that takes care of #1. The pennies I collect far outweigh the steamroller when it hits me.\n\n\\#2 - I only allocate 10% of my overall portfolio to this. When the steamroller hits me and results in a 100% loss for the strategy, I'm not wiped out. That's only 10% drawdown on my account, which is easy to recover from. This is what so many people miss when talking about the ole steamroller. If you just keep allocation in check, it's *okay* to get hit by a steamroller every now and then.\n\n**Trade Process - Timing & Strike Selection**\n\nThe process here is simple. Every M/W/F afternoon, open a new set of put spreads expiring at the next expiration. Monday's position expires Wednesday. Wednesday's position expires Friday. Friday's position expires Monday. My short strike is around 9-10 delta. My long strike is 100-150 points below that. This results in a short strike around 2% OTM in low IV environments and 5% OTM in high IV environments. The long strike will be 5-10% OTM, again depending on IV. It'll be farther out as VIX rises.\n\nYou only suffer max loss if the S&P500 drops 5% in a day or two out of absolutely nowhere (VIX < 15), or if S&P500 drops 10% in a day or two ***after*** freefall has already started. In 18 months, and with VIX rocketing to 85 during that timeframe, not once has one of my spreads even seen max loss....I'm sure it'll happen at some point, but if didn't happen in 2020, I'm curious to see when it would happen.\n\n**Why SPX**\n\n* 3 expirations available every week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday)\n* Highly liquid\n* Cash-settled. No underlying given to me on assignment.\n* Low trading fees (for me personally - your mileage may vary)\n* Beneficial tax treatment (60/40% long-term based on IRS 1256 contract straddles)\n* Less \"paperwork\" to file for taxes. Futures and index options aggregate together on IRS tax forms, eliminating 200 line items from this trading strategy in a year\n\nSPX is awesome.\n\n**Alternatives to SPX**\n\nSome of you may not have access to SPX options. Or your account isn't large enough to be handle SPX options. They are huge. A single contract represents $300k notional. The cash-settlement and risk-defined trades help diminish the impact of size, but it's still a lot of underlying to carry around. /ES (futures) are half the size and should work as well (just be sure you understand fees, assignment, and liquidity first). SPY can also work and is even smaller than /ES. Again, understand assignment of shares and fees. You also lose the tax benefit with SPY. But on smaller accounts, this may be the only viable option.\n\n**More Reading + Full Trade Log and Performance History**\n\nI set up a website dedicated to just this one strategy. It's not an interactive website or anything. I'm not selling anything or pushing a service/newsletter. It's just a place where I can define the strategy in way more detail than I've done here, and also a place where I can maintain a current and updated log of all of my trades and performance history. To learn more about the strategy and see actual trades/performance, check out the website:\n\n[https://wealthyoption.com](https://wealthyoption.com/)\n\nI am ***not*** selling or advertising anything on that site, whether my own stuff or somebody else's. Yes, there's a donate page up there, but that's not why I created the site and not why I posted this. But if you find this, love it, and want to return the favor, there's at least that option.\n\n**Questions / Suggestions**\n\nIf you're interested in this but have questions/concerns, fire away. I like to teach people, and I'm here to help.\n\nOr, if you're a pro or tried something like this before and see or know something that I'm missing, let me know that as well. Try to blast holes in my trading plan! I feel good enough about it now to finally share with the masses....but if there are any glaring holes or flaws, I want to know what those are.\n\n**Hope you enjoyed reading!!**", "id": "jm2tgy", "created_utc": 1604239809.0, "score": 707, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 572, "comments": [{"body": "Hi! I'm Karsten, aka Big Ern, mentioned as one of the pioneers of this strategy, running this since 2011. Congrats on the successful implementation of this strategy. This is a bit different from my own strategy, where I sell naked puts but far OTM, usually with a 3-5 Delta instead of your 10-Delta strikes.\n\nAlso, in case people wonder how and why your strategy has such impressive return estimates, much higher than mine: You calculate your returns as a % of your Value-at-Risk. I calculate my returns as % of the total portfolio.

Thank you!\n\nI do have a question for you:\n\nAnything below the credit strike price reached @ expiration will register a loss.\n\nLooking at your At Risk column versus the Credit Received on your log.  It appears as though you are collecting around $3k per expiration with around $100k risk.

POP is 99%.\n\nBut if I look at Wednesday coming up you can use 14 contracts and risk $42k by selling a -10 deltas (strike @ 3,3380) and pulling a $2.520 credit @ -7 deltas (strike @ $3,350).

Have you tried using a stop loss to help keep the long term odds in your favor?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": ">It seems management has a lot to do with your chance at success.\n\nI'd say that \"trusting the process\" is why something like this works for me but not others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Have you experimented with selling a higher delta for more credit, and how it would cushion the losers?\n\nI have tried a higher delta, yes. The impact is simple, really. Higher delta = higher volatility and higher returns.\n\nThe impact should just result in a lower win % with larger winners and larger losers. The expected return should go up, in theory. The increase in volatility and large losses isn't worth it to me, but if you like higher volatility and higher returns, by all means, go for it.\n\nWhen you run this strategy and the market drops hard after you enter, your losses will pile up FAST. At 9-10 delta that I use, if the market is fairly stable when I open a new position and then we have a -2% day, my $3k credit can turn into -$20k pretty quickly. I've seen it happen enough times that it doesn't bother me, but it's terrifying if you're not used to it. And if that's you, your response can leave to emotional trades and self-sabotage. Whether you end up exiting early to stop the bleeding or double-down in a revenge trade, you're at risk of digging a deep hole if you expose yourself to extreme volatility and aren't prepared to handle it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Have you tried using a stop loss to help keep the long term odds in your favor?\n\nI don't use stop-losses. A stop loss just guarantees and locks in a loser. If you leave the position open instead, you leave yourself open to turning that loser into a winner, which happens often.\n\nI generally shy away from them when selling premium, but that's largely my personal style. When selling premium, I tend to favor closing early at a target profit % but just letting losses run their course. I've seen enough short premium losers turn around that I prefer to give them that opportunity.\n\nThis strategy in particular is just a numbers game. It's a ton of short-term trades. There are blips all over the place, but they always smooth out over the long run. If I were to close out a loss early - when do I enter a new trade? Immediately, farther out? Or do I wait and try to time things? I'm getting too close to territory of timing the market by doing that, which isn't what I want to do.\n\nStop-losses may work. I haven't tried them with this strategy, so I can't say definitively that they don't work or help. My gut says that it'll do more harm than good. But if you, or somebody else, wants to try it and report back, I'd love to hear about the results :)", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's SPX and /ES, there is no shares.

I also do occasionally close a position early for pennies and re-open a new one to collect more premium. I do not recommend doing this, but it is possible and has generally treated me well. You can see a history of me doing this by looking at the entry/exit times in my trade log.

I only do this when my current position is way OTM (usually like 1 delta with expiration same day). \n\nEven if the market sells off 3% before close, my current position is probably going to expire OTM. If it expires ITM, it's not going to go too deep, and the loss will be small. The market would have to sell off something like 10% intraday for my current (expiring) position to go to max loss. That just doesn't happen out of nowhere. If it does happen, I'm okay with the consequences.

The $4.80 put spread (10d-2d) uses $15k BPR. The 10 delta put is $50k BPR.\n\nAt the $4130 strike it's $413,000 notional value, at 5x leverage you'd need to carry $82k. A 10k loss of the spread breaching both strikes would only be a 12% drawdown on the $82k 5x leveraged account.\n\nThe spread variation could be really interesting to implement in smaller accounts - an algorithm could get started as low as $10k for instance, and it could possibly allow going past 5x leverage if you want to accomplish this:\n\n> Why not target 10% risk and 40% annual (excess) returns? Retire after maybe 2-3 years of accumulation and then run this strategy with a 30% safe withdrawal rate?!

When you sell puts you voluntarily subject yourself to the most undesirable and unattractive payoff profile possible: limited upside and unlimited downside potential. The exact opposite of what everybody wants. The efficient market compensates you for taking losses when they hurt the most.\n\nWhy is there not more supply of downside insurance? Nobody has the stomach anymore. Big institutional investors, like pension plans, are actually net buyers of downside protection. If you work for a pension fund or endowment you have a great aversion to downside risk because one big drawdown is all it takes for you to lose your job.

That's no easy task at this point...lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What trade price / slippage do you give yourself in the backtest? (ie, do sells occur at Bid/Ask/Mid? what about buys?)\n\nMy backtest fills at the mid for both buys and sells. In my experience trading these myself, it feels like my average fill would be halfway between the mid and the ask. So I think you can expect slightly better fills in real life compared to my backtest. Actual fills are probably $0.05 better in real life vs my backtest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What commissions are you including in your backtest (and paying live?). For index options there are additional fees charged by CBOE - so you have the broker fee (say 0.65) AND the CBOE fee (0.58 or 0.49, depending on premium size)\n\nI'm not including ***any*** commissions in my backtest. Personally, my commissions are way smaller than what you described. I pay $0.30 per contract and about $0.015 in reg fees. I'd guesstimate this would translate to about $550 in commissions on [this backtest](https://wealthyoption.com/backtests/run/9b83aad3-e235-4889-b292-cafe438ea5b3/public) that returned $59,814 over 4 years. \n\nThat's < 1% in commissions on 110% total return. So...that's why I don't include it. My commissions are likely lower than most. If you do trade this kind of volume, and your commissions are much higher, I encourage you to reach out to your broker to ask for a reduction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why not extend your backtest earlier than the 2016 start date of the M/W/F options? You could still trade whatever options DO exist (weeklies, monthlies, whatever) just with your shorter DTE. This would at least give us more data/regimes.\n\nI actually did do this initially. I have data back to 2004, but it's sparse. I did run 1-4 DTE back to 2004. Obviously had very few trades \"trigger\" over that timeframe. The performance was fine but it was difficult to draw much from it given the frequency of trades. \n\nI will say that over the 2008 period, peak drawdown was only 11% (compared to 60% in the SPX). I didn't \"zoom in\" and look to see when those occurred, because maybe I was out of the trade completely during the market's worst days, I'm not sure. I can't run it again now because I since deleted that historical data from my database, and I have little interest in loading it back in considering how time-consuming it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why do you say the MaxRisk is 20% of the notional? If you are basing this on the 20% circuit breaker, then isn't it technically 20% each day that the trade is on for? (ie, since we are typically entering w/ 2 DTE, it'd actually be 3 20% drops that we could face)\n\nThis is the most common question I get after my latest updates. I'll expand on this more when I eventually update the site, but I'll go over it in detail here for a donor :) \n\nThe short of it is that 20% below short strike is still **too conservative** in my opinion.\n\nThe 20% level is below my short strike. The short strike itself is below the market. My short strike is 2-3% below during low IV environments, and it's 15-20% below market during high IV environments. Back in March, there were days where the 6 delta short strike was 18% below market. \n\nTo reach my assumed max loss, the market either needs to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFall 22% in a couple days, starting from all-time-highs. This never happens. Even the infamous \"Black Monday\" came after a few days of heavy selling - which my trade would have adjusted to.\n\nOR \n\nFall 30-40% in a couple days *after* what was already a large selloff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith how short my trades are (1-3 days), I respond quickly to changing IV. Scroll through the trades on the [backtest](https://wealthyoption.com/backtests/run/9b83aad3-e235-4889-b292-cafe438ea5b3/public?page=8#trades) I linked earlier and look at page 8. There wasn't a single losing trade in March 2020. Then go look to see what SPX was doing in March. It was puking its guts out. Not only did I not have a max loss in March, but I didn't even have a single losing trade (*of any size*) in March. This is because of the short duration and far OTM strike.\n\nBacktesting this strategy for 4 years, my largest single loss was **5%** of my assumed max risk. This isn't 5% below my short strike. It's 5% of my calculated max risk. So - if you're asking if I'm being conservative enough with my max risk assumption, I'd say, if anything, I'm being ***too*** conservative.\n\nHopefully I can cover this more succinctly when I update my website, because it is a very frequently asked question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Any easy way to add an export to .csv or similar for the trade histories from the backtests?\n\nI'm not gonna lie: this doesn't really interest me :)\n\nThe backtest data is mostly there for my consumption, and export to CSV doesn't benefit me....if there's a data point or calculation you'd like to see on the site, let me know. \n\nIf it's a chart you'd like to see (which I'd love to see myself) ... I'm just not sure that I'm quite ready to bite that off yet. Although I do know charts would be awesome to see. A chart that lets you put multiple backtests and a benchmark on it would be awesome. \n\nI recognize this stuff would be really useful and cool to look at, but at the end of the day, that requires a lot of work on my end, and the cost doesn't justify the benefit with it being a personal project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why do you think this strategy works? Your ERN inspiration post talks about being compensated for taking on the undesirable pnl profile of selling insurance, but I'm not so sure that's true. Do we really think there are that many people buying these 1-2 day OTM insurance contracts from us? Most likely our actual counterparty is simply the Market Maker, and in that case, I don't see why they don't simply move their market or widen their spreads to capture this phenomenon.

Always 9-10 delta. As you may have seen me comment elsewhere here, there's nothing magic about 9-10 delta, other than me being comfortable with how the P/L moves at that strike.\n\nSo the short side is decided. When it comes to the long side, I've constrained myself to 100-150 wide. \n\nWhy? \n\n**Too Narrow:**\n\nWhen you got too narrow (<100), your premium starts to go down. The number of contracts goes up to collect more premium, and you can carry more contracts on a more narrow spread while still maintaining the same max loss.\n\nFor argument's sake, let's say I want $50,000 for my max loss. \n\nIf I open a 100 wide spread, then I can open 5 contracts.\n\nLet's compare that to a 50 wide spread. \n\nIf I want to stop at $50,000 max loss and have a spread that is 50 wide, then I can open 10 contracts.\n\nBoth have a $50,000 max loss, and we'll just assume they collect the same premium. The problem (for me) with the 50 wide spread is the price movement when you go ITM. Let's say the trade finishes $10 ITM. With the 100 wide spread and 5 contracts, that's -$5,000. With the 50 wide spread and 5 contracts, it's -$10,000. \n\nLosses accumulate much faster with narrow spreads and more contracts. I've found something around 100 wide SPX is about as narrow as I want to go, otherwise losses accelerate too fast ITM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Too Wide:**\n\nWhen you start to go really wide on the long side, the additional risk that you expose yourself to for the miniscule savings you get on a cheaper long put just isn't worth it. \n\nIn VIX \\~20 environments, the short strike might be around $3.50. 150 points down, and the long strike is probably around $0.50. But you might have to go 10 points out to go down to $0.45. Do you really want to expose yourself to $1,000 more in risk to collect $5 more in premium? It's just not worth it. You avoid this by not opening crazy wide spreads to save a few bucks.\n\nLow IV environments result in 100 wide spreads. High IV environments, 150 wide. And obviously I go in between.

Never hit max loss.\n\nMax loss gets farther away as the market starts to fall (VIX rises).\n\nWhen VIX is low and the market is bullish, max loss is probably \\~5% below current price level. So to hit max loss when VIX is low and market is bullish, the market would need to sell off \\~5% in 24-48 hours. This hasn't happened once in the last 18 months. If it has, I got lucky and my timing avoided the peak/trough.\n\nWe've obviously had a ton of 5% selloff sover the last year, but they don't just come out of nowhere. There's always a little bit of bubbling/warming up before that happens. You have something like a 2% selloff day first. Maybe 3% over a couple days. When you get those 2% selloffs, VIX pops, and with how frequently I'm cycling through new positions (every 2 days), I readjust quickly to elevated IV. After that 2% selloff happens, my new max loss isn't 5% below current price....it's now 6%. or 7%. And that that 6-7% happens to be after already being down 2% and bulls are looking for somewhere to start buying.\n\nAs IV continues to go up, my max loss level gets farther and farther away. Friday (with VIX high 30s), my max loss was 9% below current SPX. Going back and looking to my position that I entered when VIX was 80+ in March, my long put for max loss was 18% below the market. That was after the market had already sold off 35% from all time highs. \n\nDuring peak panic/capitulation, max loss will require a 15-20% selloff in 24-48 hours.\n\nSo, yeah, the spreads that I put on are pretty wide, and that's what make max losses so rare for me.

{"title": "Bloomberg: The US stock market could be headed for a lost decade", "selftext": "\"When the history of the modern financial era is written, there’s one comment that’s almost certain to merit inclusion: “Stocks only go up!”\n\nSports-blogger turned day-trader Dave Portnoy’s pithy observation this summer was designed to both amuse and provoke. But if you’ve put money into U.S. stocks since the market bottomed out in 2009, the chances are you think Portnoy is basically correct. Plenty of professional asset managers would concur. \n\nPerhaps the most important question for those considering investing savings today, when stocks are by some metrics among the most expensive they’ve ever been, is whether Portnoy’s philosophy is about to be turned on its head. In other words: “what if stocks don’t always go up?”\n\nThere are reasons to think this fantastic period for the U.S. stock market might soon be followed by a prolonged hangover, possibly lasting a decade or more. Such a stretch of disappointing equity returns would have profound implications for millennials and generation Z. The standard advice around financial planning and retirement saving that’s worked so well lately — put your money in an index fund that tracks the market and forget about it — might no longer work so well.\n\nIn the past decade, investors who bought an index fund that mirrors the S&P 500 Index and reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 13% average annual return, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nEven a deadly global pandemic that’s triggered a deep recession and widespread unemployment only briefly interrupted the ascendancy of U.S. stocks. The Federal Reserve rode to the rescue once more, and the S&P 500 hit fresh record highs (though lately investors have since grown cautious again).\nYoung investors may conclude that bumper returns are all but guaranteed in the years ahead. If only steadily rising stock prices were always the case.\nConsider the FTSE 100, an index of some of Britain’s preeminent pharmaceutical, energy, mining and consumer goods companies. In price terms (ignoring the impact of reinvesting dividends for a second), the U.K. benchmark is lower now than it was two decades ago. It’s not alone.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark also remains beneath its dot-com-era peak while the MSCI emerging markets index topped out in 2007 and has yet to recover. The market that really refutes Portnoy’s assertion though is Japan: The Nikkei 225 index remains about 40% below its 1989 peak, when a massive financial bubble burst.\n\n\"Stocks Only Go Up\"?\n\nFollowing a financial bubble Japanese investors suffered years of poor returns\n\nCould the U.S. market face a similar fate? There’ve been bleak periods before, most famously in the two decades that followed the 1929 Wall Street crash.\n\nLong Hangover\n\nU.S. stocks took a long time to recover from the 1929 Wall Street crash\n\nAs recently as 2012 the S&P 500 was below its 2000 peak. Value-orientated asset managers like GMO’s Jeremy Grantham think something similar could happen again, but it’s not just well-known Cassandras who worry. Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates and Blackstone’s vice chairman Tony James have both warned about a “lost decade” for equity investors. \n\nIf you’d followed GMO’s advice in 2013 to steer clear of American large-cap stocks and load up on emerging market shares, you’d have missed out on seven years of stellar returns. So what’s different now?\n1. Extreme valuations\nEquity valuations have grown even more extreme. During the pandemic, they have become completely divorced from economic fundamentals thanks to the Federal Reserve’s largess. A stock market bubble pulls forward expected returns from the future, setting investors up for probable disappointment later on. “It’s exactly when past returns are most glorious that future prospects are most dismal,” investor John Hussman, another famously bearish investment manager wrote recently. He’s described today’s menu of choices for passive, long-term investors as “the worst in history.”\n\nExpensive Stocks\n\nU.S stock valuations aren't at dotcom era levels, but they're certainly not cheap\n\nThe CAPE ratio uses a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings to smooth out short-term noise\n\n2. Ultra-low interest rates\nLow interest rates are often portrayed as bullish for stocks because they boost the value of future corporate cash flows in today’s money and reduce the cost of servicing debt. But with U.S. short-term rates now at zero, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to juice the stock market. Ultra-low rates also reflect pessimism about future economic prospects. “When real rates are low, future returns on equities and bonds tend to be lower rather than higher,” Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton wrote in Credit Suisse’s 2020 compendium of past market returns. “Investors should assume a sober view of the likely excess returns equities can generate from here.”\n3. Profit margin reversion\nA key determinant of equity returns, profit margins have been unusually high over the past couple of decades. But corporate profits have now suffered a massive hit due to the pandemic. Even without the virus, those oversize earnings should eventually dwindle as competitors spy an opportunity. Monopoly power may hinder this, but dominant tech companies are starting to face more competition and stricter antitrust enforcement. Globalization is also in retreat and workers are demanding are a fairer split of the rewards of capitalism.\n4. An aging population\nThis is often considered a key reason for Japan’s prolonged stock market slump. Although the U.S. is aging less rapidly, the demographic changes underway are bound to have an impact on future equity returns. An aging population may be less productive, lowering potential economic growth. Furthermore, by 2030 the large and asset-rich U.S. baby boomer generation will all be over the age of 65, and they may need to cut their exposure to risky stocks or sell financial assets to fund their retirement, weighing on prices.\n\nWhile this all sounds bleak, it’s some comfort that over the very long term stocks have tended to go up. In nominal terms, one dollar invested in the U.S. market in 1900 was worth $58,000 by 2019, according to the Credit Suisse market returns study, or an annualized 6.5% return when adjusted for inflation. In the meantime, there are a few things young investors can do to avoid being caught out by a duff decade for U.S. stocks.\nFor starters, if returns are lower I’m afraid you’ll also need to save more to build wealth. Consider adding some exposure to non-U.S. equities, which may at last be due a period of outperformance relative to the U.S. And by reinvesting dividends you can still obtain decent returns even if stock prices go nowhere. (The FTSE 100 has fallen 19% since the turn of the millennium, but investors who reinvested dividends received a 63% return in that period.)\nHopefully, the gloomy scenario I’ve painted won’t materialize and U.S. companies will develop new technologies that power the economy and the stock market to new heights in the next decade. But if that doesn’t happen, you’ll be prepared.\"\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-31/personal-finance-what-if-stocks-don-t-always-go-up-advice-for-young-investors\n\n ", "id": "jm5gzw", "created_utc": 1604249498.0, "score": 557, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 261, "comments": [{"body": "I like the silver lining at the end, “$1 invested in 1900 is worth $58000 now.” Wow if only I had invested back then...", "score": 297, "replies": [{"body": "I would’ve just had to start investing 96 years before I was born, sad that I didn’t have that kind of foresight", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Or you could've invested when you were 4 and lived life like a king in 2120", "score": 45, "replies": []}, {"body": "Or you can think in terms of what kind of legacy you could leave to your descendants with a tiny bit of personal sacrifice", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Impossible, that would require me to think more than 5 seconds into the future", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "exactly! the furthest into the future i've ever thought about is the beginning of next earnings season.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Honestly, this is why I heavily invest, I often tell my wife it isn’t us that will benefit, it will be our grand children and great grandchildren.

If they had to, they could easily fall back to do commodity traffic as a contingency, but they're not there yet.\n* FSLY just shored up their gap in perceived security feature with a acquisition that's already accretive to profits.  \n* FSLY is giving turned-down, conservative guidance which can sometimes create a nice coiled spring reaction if they beat.  \n* Some of their recent Q's disappointment was due to \"timing issues\" which is code for customers who didn't get their programming done on time.  Presumably those customers will come on line soon.\n* Fastly's technology is hands down the most superior.  It's actually overkill for many customers, but you'd rather have tech that's best of breed than the other way around.\n* Fastly is just launching something nobody else has, which is seamless computing at the edge.

Giving people access broadens out what you can trade.”\n\nThe tokens will behave much like a depositary receipt or ETF, Bankman-Fried said. Investors can trade the tokens on FTX but will need to cash them out for the underlying security via CM Equity, which holds the actual securities, he said.\n\nThere are trading fees for the service but no other management fees for holding the tokens, a spokeswoman with FTX said.

2004-2016, there has been an interesting pattern. Not to sound like a political hack, but in the past 4 election cycles, the market rallies after a Republican victory and dips after a Democratic victory. But /u/SyanWilmont, what about the 2000 election? [Remember retards, the 2000 election was very controversial because Floridaman both sucks at voting and sucks at counting.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore) After the 2000 election, Florida reported a margin of victory of less than 0.5% for Bush. Due to the uncertainty of who won in 2000, the market decides to dip. This is an important lesson to learn since this election will be very controversial. If there is no clear winner reported by Tuesday, expect the election to be contested in the same way as the 2000 election and therefore a blood red Tuesday. \n\nCircling back to what happens to the market if a Democrat/Republican wins, if Trump wins the election, expect a small rally on Wednesday since 1) the market likes a Republican victory and 2) we will have more of the same, something that the market likes: stability. However, if Biden wins, expect the market to dip. Like I said, I’m not trying to be a political hack here, but based on the recent election cycles, a market dip always following a Democratic victory. To add more fuel to the fire, we all KNOW that Trump will NOT take the news of his defeat well at all. In my opinion, Biden barely winning the election is the worse case scenario for everyone in the short term. Republicans will absolutely contest the results of the election and Trump will not go down without a massive fight. In this scenario, stocks WILL go way down until after inauguration day, and even then I believe we will have civil unrest for a good while (Civil War 2 anybody?) However if Biden wins in a landslide, we will still experience a dip according to past market data. Of course, Trump and co will be angry but it’ll definitely be not catastrophic as the “Biden barely winning” scenario. \n\nRegardless of who wins, I still expect the market to dip as the week continues. US COVID cases are rising and the Europoors are locking down. Play this week very carefully guys.\n\nTLDR: SELL EOD MONDAY, Cashgang/Beargang rest of the week.
