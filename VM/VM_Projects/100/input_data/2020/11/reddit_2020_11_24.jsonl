With all the attention that has been drawn to the EV market targeting $NIO and $XPEV I wouldn’t be surprised if its share price increased heavily over the following months. \n\n$SOLO jumped last week and has been dipping since. Q3 results were quite good and even though I don’t see as much potential in its product I do think it is going to keep growing. I’ve read in quite a few places that a fair valuation would be 1B which seems reasonable.

It can also reduce risk in a way that the most you can lose is the premium x 100, but that’s if you’re OTM. Example: \n\nYou buy one call option of a company(current price $100), $110c @ $10 for 12/31. The premium that you pay in total is $10 x 100 = $1000. Now let’s say the share price jumps to $150, you’re now ITM. The premium of buying a call option at $110 will also increase with it, which you can later sell. \nNow if the price dips from $100 to $50, now you are OTM. On expiration date, if you are still OTM, you basically lose the premium ($1000) that you paid by not exercising the option. \n\nHowever, if you owned those 100 of shares at $100, you’d have $10,000. If the share price jumps up to $150, you now have $15,000. But, if the share price drops to $50, you only have $5000. In cases where a company most likely will not recover from the drop, you’re out $5000, whereas being OTM on a call option will make you lose $1000\n\n\nIf there’s anything that I’m wrong about, please correct me.

Why wouldn't they just buy it now for $100 and sit on it for month?  They'd lose whatever it costs to borrow $100/share for a month, which in a low interest world would be peanuts.\n\nSo wouldn't the option you describe be priced at nearly zero? \nAnd wouldn't a call option at a *lower* price than current be a lot more attractive?  Like the opportunity to buy it for $90 next month instead of $100 today is (obviously) a $10 saving, or maybe even a little better or worse than that.  So how much would I pay to save $10?  Not sure, but I know it would be an amount less than $10.   Call it $5.  That way I know I'll have saved $5 for my time and trouble.

{"title": "Palantir Valuation - Opening the Black Box", "selftext": "This is a crosspost from r/wallstreetbets but thought you guys might like it too. This admittedly took me longer than I thought it  would because this company is so weird and shady and honestly, next to impossible to predict. I try anyway. Feel free to jump around the text, I **bolded** main themes so they are easier to find.\n\nI can't post images here so you can go to the wsb post or the link at the bottom to see images. Disclosure, am long $PLTR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Palantir  Technologies was founded in 2003 and the company offers  a unique and  powerful operating system (OS) to government and  commercial clients\n* PLTR  has found its stride in providing  solutions to the US government,  particularly in aiding intelligence,  counter-terrorism, and military\n* PLTR provides anti-money laundering and flight operations solutions to commercial clients\n* With   \\~131 customers today on lumpy deals and limited visibility into future   opportunities, let alone conversion rates, PLTR seems a company with a   binary outcome to us. Will they or won’t they bring more customers on  to  the platform? A single customer add changes the company’s outlook,  and  as a result, valuation, significantly\n\n**Company Background and Summary:**  Palantir’s data /  analytics platform is differentiated with its “full  stack” approach. For  businesses providing a product or service, **a full stack approach means addressing the complete value chain from end-to-end,**   controlling the entire customer experience instead of providing a   partial solution that relies on licensing to, or integrating with,   existing businesses serving the target market. Palantir technology is a   one-stop shop, for now, but they have shown signs of flexibility which   will be key in its growth as a company.\n\nPLTR’s two core platforms include **Gotham** and **Foundry**.\n\n**Gotham:**  Palantir’s first platform, Gotham was built  for government operatives  in defense and intelligence. Gotham enables  end user to identify  patterns within large datasets and enables users to  create and execute  responses.\n\n**Foundry:**  This platform enables organizations to  create a central OS for their  data. Users can integrate with other core  systems and analyze large  datasets in a singular, consolidated platform.  Foundry is primarily  targeted to commercial customers.\n\nDespite  having a low number of customers, once PLTR penetrates the  customer  and becomes a core data platform, thanks to this full-stack  approach  they are able to expand rapidly. Average revenue per customer  (ARPC)  has been growing at a 30% CAGR since 2009, reaching $5.8mm as of  2019.  The top 20 customers have a spend even greater at $23.6mm. This  sort of  revenue per customer growth is indicative of PLTR’s ability to  prove  and expand into new use cases once a customer is onboard. The PLTR   platform addresses a variety of workflows including data management,   integration, app development, security, analytics, supply chain,   enterprise resource planning (ERP,) and the mythical \\~AI\\~ among others.\n\nThe  revenue growth is impressive, with Q3 growth at 52% y/y and full  year  2020 revenue expected to be 44% year-over-year. However, is this   revenue growth sustainable? **There are signs of lower confidence in growth**   – mainly customer count going down from 133 at the end of 2019 to 131   at the end of Q3, weak headcount increase of +2-3% y/y in FY21, and   operating expense decreasing 28% y/y which is a huge number and unusual   for a company in high growth mode.\n\n**Palantir’s Business Model:**  PLTR goes to market with a  direct sales force, with heavy involvement  from senior management in  the early stages. Sales cycles can be long,  with heavy implementation  services required to get customers running.  Sale engineering and pricing  vary on the scope and scale of the  project. PLTR’s business model has  three phases: Acquire, Expand, and  Scale.\n\nAcquire  – PLTR offers short-term pilot deployments of their software  at little  to no cost to attract new customers and further monetize  existing  ones. These pilots lead to initial losses. Customers in the  Acquire  phase are defined as customers who contribute less than $100k in   revenue in a calendar year.\n\nExpand  – This is the phase where PLTR would begin to see an  inflection in  revenue and margin. Customers in this phase are defined as  those  generating more than $100k in revenue in a calendar year, while  having  negative contribution margin throughout the same period.\n\nScale  – With 95% of revenue coming from existing customers, the  company’s  ability to scale within its base is crucial for its growth  strategy.  Palantir’s system is very sticky, once the software is  installed and  configured, the customer can develop further apps and  software to use  on top of the platform, contributing to further usage.\n\n**Total Addressable Market** (**TAM) opportunity:**  Palantir  estimates their TAM to be $120bn based on their bottoms-up  analysis on  customer spending levels across the commercial and  government sectors.\n\nCompany  management believes the core product is applicable to  commercial  customers with more than $500mm in revenue, roughly 6,000  commercial  companies. The management estimated commercial TAM of $56bn,  implying  $9mm per commercial customer. This sort of TAM calculation  signifies  PLTR has penetrated less than 1% of their potential commercial market.\n\nFor  government customers, management estimated a $63bn TAM based on  their  assumptions around software and consulting services penetration of  US  and US allied governments. We estimate spend based on Gartner FY24  IT  spend estimates. This sort of TAM calculation signifies PLTR has  penetrated once again less than 1% of their potential government market.\n\nSell-side  estimates vary from $55bn at Citi, who utilized a top-down   methodology, and $105bn at Goldman based on similar methodology to   Palantir’s estimates. Regardless of methodology, these sort of TAM   levels imply **PLTR has penetrated less than 0.8% – 1.8% of their total market opportunity.** Clearly, there is room to run if management is able to execute effectively and grab more market share.\n\n**Government services:**  Recent strength in the  government segment was primarily due to the  results of a recent lawsuit –  specifically a lawsuit in 2016 against  the US Army that allowed the  army to consider commercially available  products instead of using  strictly custom built software solutions. In  1H20, the US Army  represented 31% of total government revenue vs 16% in  FY 2019. While  PLTR has worked with other government agencies such as  the Dept of  Defense, US FDA, CDC, and NIH, there is still a large  customer  concentration within the US Army. While PLTR has signaled its  attempts  to broaden into other western-allied governments, it is  unclear how much  traction, if any, the company has outside the US  government. Some  government customers have begun to expand into  commercially focused  product such as Foundry, which is a positive theme  for future  cross-selling opportunities.\n\nGovernment  contract backlog provides some visibility into future  revenue, at  least more visibility when compared to the commercial  segment. PLTR has  indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)  government contracts  totaling $2.6bn as of 2Q 2020. These are awarded  contracts, but the  funding has yet to be determined and is not  guaranteed. With little  certainty surrounding funding and timing, these  contracts represent  potential upside to our estimates.\n\n**Commercial services:**  In 2016, Palantir launched its  Foundry platform – a centralized data  OS for commercial customers.  Customers can leverage the platform to  manage, filter, and visualize  large datasets. Sustainable growth in the  commercial segment will hinge  on efforts to broaden use cases and  leveraging sales reps to drive top  line growth.\n\nWith  ARPC at $5.8mn as of the last 9 months of 2020, PLTR has a  meaningful  opportunity to expand via new use workflows and growth in  users. Sales  cycles and implementation times can be long given PLTR’s  complexity,  but once commercial orgs see and realize the value, spending  growth can  grow at a rapid rate. It is critical that PLTR reduce sales  times and  becomes more efficient in implementation in order to diversify  its  customer base as its largest commercial customer represents greater   than 20% of total commercial revenue.\n\nWhile  the company has expanded into various industries and use cases  over  the last several years, its customer count remains among the lowest  in  growth software – 131 (including government entities). Today,  product  market fit remains narrow and tailored to specific scenarios or  one-off  situations (table below). The use cases also tend to be  concentrated  around a few industries such as energy, transportation,  financial  services, and healthcare. Near-term visibility in the  commercial  segment remains low and hinges entirely on the execution and  size of a  few contracts per quarter and year.\n\n**Quarterly Earnings recap:**  Palantir put up a strong  3rd quarter in its first quarter as a public  company. There was ongoing  momentum for the government business, as  revenue growth accelerated from  56% last quarter to 68%. Most  impressive, the commercial business grew  35% y/y, up from 17% in 2019.  Total revenue growth accelerated to 52%  y/y, up from 43% last quarter.\n\nThe  company also announced efforts to modularize (flexibility around  the  full-stack solution) its Foundry product and to accelerate the pace  of  app development, efforts which will help drive broader product market   fit in the commercial segment and drive more sales. We like these   solutions as it shows Palantir is adapting to the needs of its customers   in order to gain more customers. The full-stack or perhaps a   not-so-full-but-fuller-stack solution capability can be expanded once a   customer is up and running on Foundry. These sorts of efforts will be   crucial in diversifying the customer base.\n\nAdjusted  operating margins improved and were a positive 25%, up from  -49% a  year ago. This healthy margin expansion was primarily due to  greater  efficiencies in acquiring and scaling customers. We expect PLTR  to  generate further operating leverage with a more experienced sales  force  and account management teams.\n\n**PLTR Comparables Trading Multiples:**  Shares are  currently trading 28x/21.3x CY20/CY21 sales estimates.  Post-IPO PLTR was  trading at a discount to peers, now it is trading at a  premium.\n\nThis was post-IPO and no longer relevant\n\nFor  core comparable companies, we use software companies with high  growth  estimates. For the broader comparable companies, we use a wider  range  of software companies. High growth software companies are  currently  trading at an average of 18.5x 2021 sales and the broader  comparables  market is trading at 18.8x 2021 sales (largely due to  Snowflake).  Palantir is currently trading at 21.3x 2021 sales. Across  every EV /  Sales metric for the next 3 years, PLTR is trading at a  significant  premium over the core comparables, the wider broad  comparables, and the  total of both trading multiples.\n\nHowever, this premium can be justified, because as we can see **PLTR’s forecasted revenue growth is higher than the comparables estimates**. However, **PLTR also has higher customer concentration and lower revenue visibility** than most of the comparable companies, so this premium is especially risky at current valuation levels.\n\nThese  two factors combined: customer concentration + lack of  revenue   visibility (negative) and higher forecasted revenues (positive), does   the stock deserve its premium?\n\n**Valuation:**  We use an Enterprise Value / Free Cash  Flow valuation for this  company. We get a $20 target price which is  based on 37.5x EV/FCF  multiple on 2025E Free Cash Flow of $1.165bn. We  also get $4.44 bn in  2025e revenues. For reference, MS uses a 40x 2025e  FCF, Citi 35x 2026e  FCF, and GS uses a combined DCF and 13.0x revenue  model.\n\nWe lay out a range of Bear/Base/Bull cases with the main drivers of the valuation and our Base Case assumptions being:\n\n* Number of **net** customer adds – 5 per year from current 131 customers to 234 customers in 2025\n* Avg.   Revenue per Customer growth – 18.8% CAGR in avg. revenue per customer.   From estimated $8mm/cust in 2020 to $19mm/cust in 2025e\n* Gross Margin % – a hefty 82% vs 81% last quarter\n* Opex Margin % – a hefty 45% vs 44% last quarter\n* Capital Expenditures – continuation of historical very low levels, tech cos usually have low capex\n* Free   Cash Flow Multiple – 37.5x which is consistent with other high growth   software data / analytics companies and between the Citi and MS   multiples\n\nFor  purposes of establishing a trading range for the stock, here is a  grid  of 2025e revenue scenarios given total customer count and ARPC CAGR. As  you can see, the amount of revenue PLTR is able to squeeze from   customers has a very large effect on the calculation.\n\nThen,  depending on each of these future revenue scenarios, based on   different free cash flow margins and valuation multiples, we get a range   of stock prices. As you can see, for purposes of our Base Case, the  FCF  margin is 26.2%. The multiple and the cash flow margin have an  equally  large effect, with every 1.5x in the multiple adding \\~$3 to the  stock  price in the middle range, and every 2.5% in FCF margin  similarly adds  \\~$3.\n\n**Key Risks:**  Simply put, there are a lot of unknowns  with this company. This is one  of the most binary companies I have come  across, it will either be a  massive hit or a dud and I attempt to value  it accordingly. This binary  opportunity is primarily because of limited  visibility into this  company’s sales. Palantir targets large-scale  opportunities within  large governments and commercial entities. These  projects have high  costs, long sales cycles, and are incredibly complex.  **A quarter’s earnings hit or miss and yearly growth can depend on a few contracts.**\n\nCustomer  concentration and a small base is another risk. Although  PLTR has made  some progress and decreased their total revenue  attributable to the  largest 20 customers from 68% the first 9 months of  2019, to 61% the  first 9 months of 2020, **PLTR has the highest customer concentration among public growth software providers.** A significant decrease in revenue from a top customer can have an adversely large impact on the company.\n\nCompetition  is significant. PLTR’s full-stack approach may be  abrasive and put it  at odds with other tech vendors in the data /  analytics space. Some  organizations may see a relationship with PLTR as  too limiting and  would prefer more flexibility to use some of the best  of breed tools  from other software companies outside of PLTR.\n\nRecent  and near-term expected hiring doesn’t inspire confidence in   significant growth. Palantir expects to only grow headcount 4% in FY20   and operating expenses have notably declined, with guidance continuing   this decline.\n\nPalantir  is not a young company, it was founded in 2003. Although PLTR  is now  hitting it’s stride and making significant progress and growth,  the  company has historically generated operating losses and negative  cash  flow. This also ties in with the lack of detailed disclosures from  the  company. In its S-1 (IPO filing) the company provided 6 historical   quarters, but only included the income statement. Without more   information, it is difficult to understand or predict the seasonality of   the business appropriately.\n\n**Key catalysts:**\n\nIncreased  commercial adoption is a massive catalyst for PLTR. If the  company is  able to improve adoption by introducing more flexible  workflow  solutions that meet a larger segment of the commercial market,  the  addressable market opportunity is incredible and can be swift. In   addition, improving sales efficiency could drive higher profitability   than we have currently modeled.\n\nThe  company is currently profitable with 25% adjusted operating  margins in Q3 2020. Management highlights the release of Apollo, the  continuous  delivery software that powers the Foundry and Gotham  platforms, as the  main driver in these efficiency gains. The  efficiencies generated by  Apollo and more ‘productized’ offering have  resulted a lowered average  implementation time and decrease in the days  it takes to ERP integration going.\n\n**TLDR;**  Company is impossible to predict and is a completely binary play.  Currently offers full-stack solution and I believe the future growth of  company in the commercial sector will depend on being more flexible with  its core products and meeting more use cases. Government is a hard read  and any contract momentum outside of US aren't clear.\n\nIf you want to play with the model, I tried to keep it as simple as possible you can download it here at the bottom of the page for free: \n\n[https://millennialmkts.com/2020/11/22/palantir-valuation-opening-the-black-box/](https://millennialmkts.com/2020/11/22/palantir-valuation-opening-the-black-box/)", "id": "k08f2v", "created_utc": 1606235920.0, "score": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "Reading their products page it seems more like a services company than a software company..

{"title": "Why WSB is now running the entire equity market - Investment Professional here", "selftext": "I am someone who has spent over a decade in finance, first in a hedge fund and then in private equity\n\nIf you want to understand what it is going on. You have to understand that the largest driving force in the background in which you are operating in is the shift from active managers to passive managers. The vanguard crowd has been winning for more than a decade and now we are at a point where nearly all new money entering the market comes in the form of passive ETFs and index funds.\n\nAnd here is where the fun begins. millennials and new investors have a extreme preference for passive management while baby boomers largely invested in active managers. So in the past few years, all new money entering the market is passive and all old money leaving the market is active. Hedge fund and mutual fund managers are shedding AUM while the likes of vanguard and ETFs have been gaining AUM.\n\nSo why does this matter?\n\nWell, the old operating model of securities analysis was predicated on value judgements. If a stock falls 20%, your money manager tasks a analyst to runs a DCF/comps analysis, and tells you it is undervalued by 10% based on the latest assessment, and that the fund should buy some shares. The old buy low sell high with a dash of analysis added in. That was how things use to run anyways. But in the world of passive investing, price becomes the only judgement as to whether it should be added or subtracted, there is no analysis of valuation metrics, fundamentals of the business or even if it is a fraud or not. There are no analysts digging into the company, calling up suppliers, doing channel checks. It is just pure automation, stock goes up, it gets reweighted high, buy. Stock goes down, it gets reweighted down, sell. The market has become dumber over time. And the people who do the work do not get paid for it, because more and more of the market is passive. So undervalued things remain undervalued, and overvalued things get more overvalued.\n\nThere are essentially three players left in this market, of which only two are active investors. You have the passive money, which now drives 90%+ of the market. You have the small remaining active investor base, who have been shedding AUM and are desperate to hold on to their jobs and are forced to actually follow indexes to avoid getting fired, and what their doing which is arbitraging value, no longer pays off. Then you have people like WSB and stocktwits, where people chase momentum in everything from large tech to chinese frauds. What you are seeing today is the two remaining active groups fighting to control the flows of the passive money (who simply follows whichever side has more momentum).\n\nThis is why we are in a world where TESLA can go up valuation by 10x despite revenue only increase by 15%. We are in a world where large cap gets larger. We are in a world where a bunch of degenerates gambling on FDs, which then drives gamma covering by market makers will create an escalating feedback loop in which passive money piles in, making it into a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSo thank the Bogleheads, you have the keys to the Asylum. You are now running the trillion dollar global equity markets. The memes are now real and you are now the captain of Wall Street.\n\nEdit: to all the morons who keep saying I am wrong because passive is not 90% of the market. Yes it’s more like 60-65(Active) 35-40 (Passive) right now. But what drives price action is the marginal buyer and seller. The total market doesn’t matter worth shit. Grandma with her 20 shares of Ford she plans to gift to Timmy 10 years down the line doesn’t move market price today. 90%+ of the marginal Flow of money today is passive and that sets the price.", "id": "k0ctkd", "created_utc": 1606248913.0, "score": 3982, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 820, "comments": [{"body": "Ok so it's an infinite loop with WSB buying meme stocks and bots thinking that means the stock is good so they also buy, which in turn drives the price up and retards buy more for an eternal feedback loop. \n\nSo it's basically a bunch of retards and bots jerking themselves off.\n\nWell, I'm buying a fuckload more.", "score": 1918, "replies": [{"body": "The bigger idiot theory.
