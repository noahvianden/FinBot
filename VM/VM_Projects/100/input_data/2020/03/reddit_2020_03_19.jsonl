Panic is why people hoard toilet paper they won't need, whereas caution would say a shopping trip is inadvisable.\n\nNow, let's examine the \"orders of magnitude\" thing another user replied with. By definition, the impact and timescale of climate denial is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger. 1 or 2 years vs 100+ year timescales, numbers impacted some percentage of the world's population vs. 100%, likely economic devastation harsh but temporary vs. cataclysmic and prolonged. \n\nIn fact, it only compares at all by the recency bias: things more recent and more acute feel worse **close to the time they are first felt**. In other words, in a decade or two this will look closer to SARS than to total environmental collapse, and the comparison will be (as it should be now) laughable.\n\nAs for \"the climate is not growing exponential\": not all crises follow the same curves. If we stopped emitting CO2 now, the climate crisis would not be solved. It is, in fact, a worse case. **If our actions are not exponentially better over time, this disaster will come to pass**.

Plus, SIRI hasn’t seen nearly the drop other advertisers have so far (SIRI at -30% over the last 30 days while other media companies are -60%+)\n\n\n$OUT Outfront Media \n\nPosition: 4/17 $7.50 Put for $1.15/$115 per contract \n\nRationale: Already down -70%, but when marketers have to cut budget, they’re likely to cut out of home ads first before digital alternatives. \n\n\n$WHR Whirlpool \n\nPosition: 4/17 $75 Put at $4.05/$405 per contact\n \nRationale: No ones going to be willingly upgrading their appliances anytime soon. They’re going to get pinched hard with declining sales. While Home Depot is open, many of their other retail partners are closing. Stocks down -38% over last 3 months, but there’s more room to drop. \n\n\n$TXRH Texas Roadhouse \n\nPosition: 4/17 $25 Put for $3.30/$330 per contract \n\nRationale: Faired much better than most other food service thanks to great financials (no debt, lots of real estate) but they’ve moved to takeout only.

{"title": "Treatment options coming ASAP for Covid-19. Please read.", "selftext": "There has recently been an uptick in promising drug treatments for Covid-19. The most recent research is narrowing in on the fact that treatment must take place in two phases. First is to give antivirals to patients in the early stages of the disease. Then once the patient develops ARDS, to give anti-inflammatories. The drugs used in each stage that have shown promise can be found below. \n\n**Antivirals**\n\nRemdesivir: main issue is cost (~$1K per day - Gilead)\n\nFavipiravir: Japan based drug. Has a huge supply, prob. enough to export \n\nLopinavir/Ritonavir: Used already vs HIV/AIDS (AbbVie)\n\n**Anti-Inflammatories**\n\nHydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine: Cytokine inhibitor (Sanofi/Bayer)\n\nActemra (tocilizumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Roche)\n\nKevzara (sarilumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Regeneron and Sanofi)\n\nTrump knows this but faces two hurdles. \n\n1. Cost of drug produced. \n\n2. Treatment approval from the FDA.\n\nTrump cleared the first hurdle by enacting the Defense Production Act of 1950 which allows him to give orders to the private sector to start production and control drug prices to prevent profiteering. (Ex. Gilead)\n\nIn regards to the second hurdle, Trump hinted earlier today in the press conference that he had some exciting news to share about the FDA tomorrow. Some leaked rumors are saying that he has secured conditional approval by the FDA to allow the use of the drugs above. If so, Trump has paved the way for the immediate scaling and treatment of Covid-19 in the US. This is huge and will have a large psychological impact on sentiment along with the recent stimulus passed.\n\nSPY calls at bottom tomorrow before the presser.
