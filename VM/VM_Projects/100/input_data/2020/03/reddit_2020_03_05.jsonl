Not sure how directly tradable this is as everyone seems to be wondering here but there's a few interesting dynamics I see just quickly looking through. \n\n1. Curve is inverted but that's not saying a whole lot, so I think everyone should look at the usual term structure. The bottom graph (F2-F1, F4-F3, etc) is useful for this. If you look, the curve was in contango at the beginning of the year up until Jan 22th when it started to dramatically flatten. It didn't actually go into backwardation but it flattened significantly. If you look at the SP500 chart for around that date, you can see the flattening preceeded some short-term turmoil in an otherwise smooth move up and to the right. Then the same thing happened again on Feb 21st, which preceeded the last week of down days. Hard to say if vol traders are predictive of underlying market sentiment beginning to shift or part of the cause, but it's interesting all the same. \n\n2. Something weird is going on with the long end of the curve since Feb 18th (F8-F7). For some reason traders are pricing vol 8 months out much higher than 7 months out, which is also weird in that they've typically been fairly close to equally priced.\n\nEdit: Nvm on the second point.

Open the r/all r/investing r/normie floodgates.\n\nThousands of morons downloaded Robinhood and deposited their 1k life savings or student loans. In front of them was a dream. Make thousands, beat the market, easy money. Be a \"trader\". Be a bigshot.\n\nWSB does not take kindly to all the noobs, the influx disrupting the sub. Talks of going private emerge. Mainstream news articles on WSB continue to surface. \n\nRight as the noobs were flooding WSB, the SPCE posts were flowing. People cashing in big time. TSLA, SPCE.... Everything the sub touched turned to gold. They had finally found the secret society.\n\n\"stonks only go up\" \"infinite bull market\". The noobs throw all their money into calls. It's just that easy! \n\nThen, disaster strikes. The fastest drop in history. \n\nThe beer flu news finally decides to influence the market, despite the market ignoring it for weeks. Within one day, all the newcomers are down 90%. What's going on? How could this happen? Many 'buy the dip' on Friday. Little do they know, the dip has only begun. \n\nAccounts hemorrhaging, some bail for good, some revenge trade - giving even more of their parents' hard earned money to Robinhood.\n\nThe ones that were not completely wiped out - FOMO some puts. Others continue to helplessly buy dip after dip. All hope seems lost. \n\nIf life wasn't going terribly enough, the Gods continue to deal their cruel blows. Monday morning, after many noobs are forced to hold over the weekend due to a late surge during an expected mass sell off - an unprecedented yet predictable catastrophe arises. \n\nRobinhood goes down. Unbelievable. Every helpless noob sinks deeper into the red, unable to exit their positions. The market takes to one of the largest surges ever. \n\nWSB again fills with wild gain posts. All while the noobs cry in despair from the sidelines. Surely we can make it back when RH comes back? Guess what. Down a second day. Another day of massive surge. \n\nRH comes back, thousands more noob orders fill, and thousands of noobs are still holding last week's puts. Now down 99% percent. Boom. Rate cut. How could it all go so wrong? \n\nSurely nothing else could possibly go against us. We'll win eventually right? The beer virus is on a killing spree. Surely my puts will print? \n\nSPY bouncing like an EKG, record volatility. How about the second largest one day market gain ever? Right at close? Sound good? \n\nHave no fear, WSB. The purge has occurred. Your sub is saved. Never in history has a group of people been so mercilessly eradicated - as the Feb2020 WSB noobs. The fascination is over. The damage will be far reaching, long lasting. Egos and bank accounts destroyed forever.\n\nI don't know if you all believe in a higher power, but it is hard to believe the God of WSB did not deal out these plagues. To save our land from conquest. There is no other explanation for this string of unbelievable events. \n\nAnd now, to add salt to the wounds, the noobs that come to see if everyone is losing as bad as they are - see hundreds of you donating your winnings to charity. \n\nThis is a wild place.

{"title": "VIX Play Roadmap/Update", "selftext": "TL;DR VIX Calls in the 40's gonna print monday next week and all week after.\n\nHello autists,\n\nThe difficulty with my VIX play (this time) is that I only have one road map to reference (08' pop) vs all the other times i played the vix where it has popped the same way each time (8 to be exact) which made it easy to profit on (pop to 47, with a one day massive spike from 36 to atleast 47). You can look at my previous posts regarding that play.\n\nSo i tried to best compare the timelines and it is actually quite interesting. The resemblance is quite striking from my perspective but fair warning, predicting timing to the day (vs if we break this level we rocket) is the hardest thing in my opinion, if not damn near impossible. But this should give everyone a rough estimate if we end up following the 08' roadmap. This is not an in depth look at technicals (refer to my previous posts). This only compares timing, volume, and price to provide perspective.\n\nHere is the market now. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/mgpj6wqw/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/mgpj6wqw/)\n\nThings to note: we are getting squeezed between this arbitrary trending support line on the daily and the tenken/kijun sen line as the resistance (the big lines are the pennant from 2018/2019 which also add to the resistance in that zone). Pay special attention to the volume pattern.\n\nHere is the market in 08' [https://www.tradingview.com/x/wbOPmZ4f/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/wbOPmZ4f/)\n\nThings to note: Notice how we are similarly denying the tenken/kijun sen line and just hovering. See how the volume mimicks us EXACTLY. Even the timing matches up to the DAY. The line i put a strike through is a monday. \n\nSo if this pans out i dont think we are dropping big until monday. The crash today was just due to low gamma which allows for these big swings. We didnt have enough volume to actually mean we are crashing. This leads up to the fact that we are probably going up again tomorrow to 3125 (at the max) as we continue this squeeze. You'll know when we break out cause volume will show it and im betting that will happen on monday.\n\nOk next up is vix. Here is the Vix now. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/IU4wk6Vz/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IU4wk6Vz/)\n\nFor any ballsy retards willing to play the \"widow maker\" AKA NG, chances are you have seen this pattern in November of 2018. Big gap spike, slow drop, consolidates and squeezes up, POP. This looks trademark like what is happening now and compares to what happened in 08'. You can note my target lines way above. Looks like our price to close above with a strong push is 39.5\n\nHere is VIX in 08': [https://www.tradingview.com/x/nAlqlbrU/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nAlqlbrU/) \n\nYou can see how after the pop to 47 it drops and starts to consolidate just as we are now (always respecting the Kijun-sen and Tenken-sen). The number to beat here was 36.5. The vertical lines as well are the mondays. The horizontal lines above are my targets a couple bucks below the previous peaks to ensure i get out earlier.\n\nThis would suggest we go up tomorrow. Crash on monday, consolidate again all week, and crash (and continue to crash every day) the week after (im talking about the market, the vix would do the opposite). If we follow this map, ill be exiting my position by the 20th of march.\n\n[https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix)\n\nOur trusty DPI and Gamma readings show that gamma still low and dipped a little. Worrisome is DPI bought this drop up (although slightly). \n\nId like to reiterate that we only have ONE scenario where this happened so i have no idea if this timetable will work, but it has thus far so why the fuck not atleast keep it handy. \n\nI am not your financial advisor and cannot/will not advise you on your plays.
