{"title": "Trump Administration is Massively Manipulating the Market", "selftext": "I found an article on WSJ earlier today that claimed that we are now officially in a bull market. Meanwhile, the entire country is sheltered indoors and COVID-19 is still exponentially growing, with US cases now surpassing China, with joblessness at a new record high. Furthermore, commercial real estate lenders that I have spoken with have never before seen the number of requests for loan remodification and payment deferral, and gross scheduled rent across all commercial assets is highly expected to declined come April 1st (with the exception of Single-Tenant Net Lease retail). With an impending mortgage crisis on the horizon and no end in sight to our shelter-in-place health-care strategy, how can the Trump Administration blatantly claim a market reversal? Are we dealing with complete incompetence at the WH or something more sinister? Is this a pump-and-dump on a global scale or are we really headed for greener pastures?

That will likely happen in the near term but the simple math of the matter is that everything has been oriented toward increasing that capacity and so it will, in the future, be more like a seasonal flu once capacity catches up. That means the worst is yet to come because we **will not** be able to have sufficient ventilators, staff, ICU beds, and similar in time for the peak in mid-April.\n\nHowever, after that point everything should largely begin to return to normal. It won't matter terribly if there's another surge in the fall because we should have masks, beds, and ventilators available. At that point we may even have a therapy (chloroquine is actually very promising, here's a simple explanation by a VERY bright guy [https://dominicanfriars.org/a-dominican-microbiologist-on-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment/](https://dominicanfriars.org/a-dominican-microbiologist-on-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment/), even if the buffoon in the Oval Office has badly mischaracterized its current application and utility but so are other possible therapies; only one has to work to basically erase this threat overnight). Many of the world's brightest minds are focused on a cure, a therapy, and ways to increase our capacity quickly (i.e. ventilators that can support multiple patients and other innovations). In addition, you have something like 9 months of unemployment support that should be written into law by tomorrow.\n\nYou were right to bet on a market downturn but now you're resisting the shift in the trend. There's a much higher likelihood at this point of this being mitigated by June, if not sooner. There remains the question of how Americans will react to a 9/11 every day for two weeks in April but that's the only unknown of sorts at this point and the fact that we're going to see that has been publicized pretty heavily now without startling the market (implying that it's priced in). \n\nYou're now betting against the united central banks of the world willing to do anything it takes, a motivated government (with all the power it wields) buying supplies hand over fist, and the world's greatest minds with enormous budgets all focused like a laser on solving this problem.

IF there's another dip, I'd exit short positions pretty quickly.\n\nWith ALL that being said - VIX refuses to dip below 60, which is remarkably high under normal circumstances AND net inflows to money markets this week were almost $260 billion, which is a lot of money headed for cash (following a lot of money that headed for cash in the last few weeks too).

We saw undeservedly high decline of TSLA when the hedge funds were unwinding their leverage and stocks that brought lots of money had to be sold.

Granted, the percent of selling by shorts number has been above 60% for much of the past week, but today you actually see the usual manipulation patterns: a pre-market dip on steroids as the macros did a smaller dip around 8:30am, lots of icicles as shorts push TSLA down and it bounces back, a push down to the red/green line before 11am for no good reason and then a game of whack-the-mole, and finally another dip on steroids going into 2pm with insufficient justification.  \n\n\nMy guess is that the hedge funds that sold calls are really trying to minimize TSLA's price before Friday close, due to the quantity of 480, 490, and 500 calls sold that expire tomorrow.  \n\n\nFor perspective, I suggest watching [Dave T's latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kTnkXnq66Y) about the Shanghai GF influence on 2020 numbers and profitability, but take into account Dave's readjusted delivery numbers mentioned a few posts ahead of this one.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Everything is always a conspiracy with Tesla stock lol", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Please ignore the increase from $350 to $550.
