Leading to shocks in the CLO and CDO market with a lot of packaged debt instruments going bad. Corporate debt is at all time highs.  \n \nOkay so this is one part I am very ignorant on. If the companies are at record profits for the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, and other large tech giants, why not just pay off some debts? It was explained to me that there are times where the companies see paying off debts as less profitable than to spend more to expand elsewhere. But doesn't that mean they can liquidate assets easily to cover their debts? In addition, aren't the sectors that have the most dangerous level of debt belonging to fossil fuels since they're propped up by bailouts and subsidies and not the tech companies?  \n \n> Personal debt is at all time highs, people working multiple partime jobs that can’t handle financial strain of an illness especially since they don’t get healthcare benefits from part time work. Leading to subprime auto loads going bad and cars repossessed. Which lead to a glut of used cars and a demand drop for new cars. Not to mention derivatives of that debt also going bad.   \n \nThis is the most interesting part for me. In Toronto, Canada where I live, surveys have shown some absurdities that I'm starting to question the validity of research methods such that almost 40-50% of households are living paycheck to paycheck, but to my fucking surprise, rents and home prices are hitting the damn skies. WTF?! This doesn't make any sense to me. There are those that speculate but I think they're in the 1% and I am not too sure of how much the 1% speculation is driving such insane prices. Something does not add up there. However, to your point of household debt, how much personal debt is there in the first place? How much of debt has to accumulate such that it will have an effect on the economy? Surely, the unemployment at all time lows and decreases in part times are buoying the economies above the waters. Will this panic virus really start the fuse in the powder to ignite a bomb? In 2007, the housing bubble was the cause, but can debt suddenly cause the upcoming one?

{"title": "Gambler's ruin, kelly criterion, optimal bet sizing, and how to avoid losing all your tendies", "selftext": "What up autists, I know we all respect the YOLOs from the people who wave their giant smooth gorgeous bowling balls around and put 100% of their bankroll into huge trades, but my wife's boyfriend was telling me that this isn't always the smartest thing to do. According to some nerd math shit called Gambler's Ruin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s\\_ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin), apparently even if you are bigly expected to win in any bet, if you bet too much or don't size down when you start losing, you'll eventually lose all your tendies. And since you need tendies to make tendies, no one wants that.\n\nSo what is the optimal betting size then? Fortunately some other nerds have figured out this math thing called Kelly's Criterion that tells you how much you should bet. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) I know what you're thinking: \"Math shit??!!?? I can barely read, much less do fucking math! Just tell me what to do!!!\" Well fortunately, even if you can't do math, you can just go [https://dqydj.com/optimizing-bet-sizes-with-the-kelly-criterion/](https://dqydj.com/optimizing-bet-sizes-with-the-kelly-criterion/) and input some numbers and it'll tell you what to do.\n\nFor example, if you think that your 6/9 420 Tesla puts have a 50% chance to hit, and if you hit it pays off 2:1 (win 200 on a 100 dollar bet for 300 total dollars) and you have a bankroll of say 1000 bux, you can input those numbers into that website and it tells you you should bet 25% of your bankroll on each trade. The key thing here is that on the rare chance that you lose, **YOU NEED TO SIZE DOWN YOUR NEXT BET TO 25% OF YOUR NEW BANKROLL**. So, if you lose, you have to bet 25% \\* 750 (remaining money) and only bet 187.5 dollars for your next bet. If you don't size down when you lose, you *will* go broke, regardless of how good you are at picking options. And nobody wants to be out money to no longer be able to trade.\n\nTLDR: SPY 1 month 5% OTM puts with 10-20% of your bankroll (depending on how confident you are), size up or down repeat weekly with new bankroll size until you get all the tendies.", "id": "fgh551", "created_utc": 1583860026.0, "score": 374, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "So many words, may take me a day to read", "score": 170, "replies": [{"body": "You should've thrown an image at least", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "meme would be better", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Of your mom's ass hole?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ive come back to this post 3x just to reread the same first paragraph again.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can read?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well, he’s learning", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I had to stop after the 37rd whurd.

{"title": "Why GM is Fucked", "selftext": "GM is absolutely FUCKED, here's why:  \n\n\n**Reason #1: Loss of market share to foreign competition**  \nChina is the world's largest auto market, and GM is one of it's larger auto producers. Sales in China for Ford and GM are already being lost to domestic Chinese companies. Check this article from Jan:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html)   \n\n\n**Reason #2: Coronavirus in China and the US**  \nCoronavirus has TANKED auto sales in China (over 80%). People aren't going out, people aren't buying cars. Unless you're getting a car from a Carvana machine, you're probably at a dealership shaking hands, which no one wants to do right now. China sales drop, which we can expect to see mirrored in the US as the virus spreads.   \n [https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/)   \n\n\nManufacturing facilities are also slowed in China, and likely to be slowed in the US. This is not a job that can be done working from home, and the manufacturing process will suffer if people cannot go out to work in factories.  \n\n\n**Reason #3: Looming Recession**  \nWith the possibility off a recession on the horizon, this is especially important to consider. Auto Manufacturing gets absolutely pummeled in recessions. Cars are simply not a luxury people can afford in troubling financial times. Also, GM has recently invested a TON of money trying to prove that it can compete in the EV market. If a downturn happens now, this could obliterate its chances of competing anytime in the near future.  \n\n\nTake a look at the charts here from McKinsey on how auto manufacturing is susceptible and was hit in 2008:  [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics)   \n\n\nPositions:  [https://imgur.com/a/VRGj38e](https://imgur.com/a/VRGj38e) but I'm definitely buying more puts  \n\n\nTL:DR - Puts on GM and probably Ford too", "id": "fghbf1", "created_utc": 1583860659.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Not before Trump goes on national TV and says he prefers European cars anyway and Ford/GM should do something for US if they want a dime.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Ha you got it backwards buddy we treat poor people like that, not corporations.

That debt increases because GM Financial writes more loans, and each of those loans makes GM money, like any loan does when people pay interest. \n\nThe other 20% of the debt is automotive, and the majority of that is related to pensions, which are actually pretty close to fully funded at this point.  They have something like ... 5B in \"real\" debt + like 6B in pension shortfalls.  Of course, they make 10B a year in profit on average, so that debt is actually ... not a lot, and could be paid off tomorrow if GM wanted to.\n\n\nNote on #2 :  GM makes the majority of their money in NA.

{"title": "This isn't over, not by a long shot... this is the calm before the storm frens", "selftext": "So a few of you retards got your first experience watching level 1 circuit breakers get hit, congrats... guess that makes me old...\n\nI previously posted this DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffdrz0/covid\\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffdrz0/covid_dd/)\n\nIt had some good stuff in it, and was well received, but sadly by the time anybody got around to making a trade, the sToNk market took the biggest beating since '08, and IV spiked so you can't even get in at an affordable price right now.\n\nWe all know (or you should fucking know) that in the trading game the rule is \"buy the rumor, sell the news\". I mean that's bloody obvious, this is why people insider trade FFS... So anyways, the game becomes \"predict the future\". Literally.\n\nAnyways, as it stands our goal is to predict the headlines on CNN, MSNPC, FOX, BBC, etc. We know the reason for the crash on Monday was partially because of the quarantine in Italy and partially due to the oil war. I mean honestly, the oil war is not that big of a factor compared to the quarantine but you got a glimpse of the absolute state of panic that people go through when they realize \"holy shit this is real\". That's what bear gang thrives on, pure human emotion, and in particular the most powerful emotion there is -- fear.\n\nSo let's talk about what the headlines will be in 2 weeks from now. As it stands right now we're playing a game of denial and acceptance. I seen a chart on here, somebody link it below (was a top post I think like 2 weeks ago-ish) and it showed the 4 stages of the market under the beer virus. It was something to the effect of: Stage 1 small fears, media says it's all going to be okay stage 2 media starts talking about beer virus and something bad stage 3, media explodes people freak out, market crashes, stage 4 people accept and start to forget.\n\nAnyways, so what will the headlines be in a few weeks? Well thank god we can do some maths... if you go to this website [\\[1\\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) it lists the beer virus by day. But in particular you can choose countries by day which.. is very helpful.\n\nBut first and foremost, Wuhan was quarantined around January 23rd [\\[2\\]](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/23/798789671/chinese-authorities-begin-quarantine-of-wuhan-city-as-coronavirus-cases-multiply) when approximately 830 were sick with the virus. The quarantine was extended to 50m people on January 28th [\\[3\\]](https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-officials-quarantine-entire-city-2020-1) when \\~5,974 were sick.\n\nItaly pulled the quarantine measure on 15m people on the 8th when 7,375 were sick [\\[4\\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51787238), this was extended to the entire country the next day [\\[5\\]](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/09/813791575/italy-expands-quarantine-measures-nationwide-to-stem-spread-of-coronavirus) when 9,172 were sick.\n\nSo we can see that the panic starts to set in once a country manages to get shy of 10,000 infected. So what country is next? Now this is predicated on similar steps being taken... and it's a hard play for western countries to borderline shutdown their economies, but the precedent is set.\n\nSo how does this puppy evolve through time? Well, we can take a look at the natural log growth of it daily and we get this in Italy [\\[6\\]](https://imgur.com/a/OiPeQnL) (the only country with high numbers that I trust to give accurate data aside from second best Korea). So I decided well... how can you model exponential growth? Well there's a few models we can use... basic exponential growth N^((1+g)) or Ne^(rt) however those models don't fit so well to Italian infection rate growth [\\[7\\]](https://imgur.com/a/Byy9ZIJ). However, the ert model fits a bit nicer... however what if r could evolve through time? Well that's easy to do with a CIR process [\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross_model). All you need to do is match the historical growth rate of the disease and set a steady state. Now... the problem is picking a steady state which I'll expand on more later on. Anyways I minimized the variance of the Model to the actual data and got this [\\[9\\]](https://imgur.com/a/BSwtx6L).\n\nIt's really not complex. Basically the growth of the virus can be expressed as \\~Ne^(rt) where r is the growth rate and t is the days and N is the cumulative number of sick persons. To really get autistic you could remove those who recover and all that but I'm lazy and my math fits somewhat nicely and the CIR kind of accounts for that so fuck off. Anyways we get this [\\[10\\]](https://imgur.com/a/fJlu10o). Which basically means we've got a model that can somewhat predict the future growth of this in other countries like France, Germany and the United States (you know, the places that actually affect the stock market).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*Again I know half you retards skipped to here...*\n\n**TLDR:** If you're from r/all buy calls on $WYNN March 13th $165 strike, cannot go tits up.\n\nHere's what we're looking at for **Italy** over the next month for beer virus cases: [\\[11\\]](https://imgur.com/a/LnKn2aW)\n\n**France** I back-tested the Italy growth and we got a pretty damn close fit [\\[12\\]](https://imgur.com/a/geMbupB). So I extrapolated the Italian numbers and super-imposed it onto France then forecasted using the model and got this [\\[13\\]](https://imgur.com/a/8DtzolY). You'll notice the range is massive, this is because France is basically a week and a bit before Italy in its outbreak. the long-run growth of the virus depends on a lot of factors, if France acts quickly then it'll be a lower theta value and it'll slow the spread. Regardless if it spreads fast (0.2, 0.15 and 0.1 theta) we'll see the number surpass 10,000 by March 18th. Else March 19th 0.05 theta or March 20th 0 theta. I would expect quarantines to ensue around those times if they correlate whatsoever with the actions of Italy and China, but we'll see...\n\n**Spain and Germany** should behave the same-ish with a few days of lag...\n\nLastly, the USA I start the model from the starting data from n=\\~70 like with France and Italy and build the model out, I get this interpolating the data over which matches pretty closely but I have to lagg it slightly (makes sense because other countries start to take precautions) [\\[14\\]](https://imgur.com/a/MovjIB3).\n\nThe forecast for **USA** looks like this [\\[15\\]](https://imgur.com/a/ukYbE2E). So I'd be willing to bet this thing stays more around the 0.2 theta spread but we'll see... quarantine measures will crank this down. Anyways, if this continues on track in the USA under current conditions with 0.2theta we'll surpass 10,000 cases by March 21st, if it has a lower theta drift of 0.15 then well see 10,000 cases by the 24th if 0.1 theta drift then \\~march 28th/29th else with 0.05 we'll see \\~April 5th for the 10,000th case.\n\n**In closing,** I would bet on there being more quarantines of cities around the corner. Expect schools to shut down and don't forget puts on old folks homes/care taking facilities. Personally my bet. The markets will probably trade in circles until next week and then expect another big drop after the next country announces a quarantine of some major city. This is all predicated on whether or not the other G8 countries start following suit. If they do, bear gang wins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** A few of you wanted a tickers and strikes, here's my thoughts:\n\n$WELL looks well factored in... IV is stupid so you know what that means... down 30.6% from 52wk high\n\n$VTR is the same.... well factored in; down 41.7% from 52wk high\n\n$OHI looks somewhat factored in... -22.5% from 52 week high but IV on the long dated ATM puts are like .49 so yeah fuck that...\n\n*In Canada I found these piles of shit which are not factored in IMO:*\n\n$CSH.UN \\[Canada\\] (Chartwell Retirement Residence); it's only down 15% from 52 week high and **all it takes is ONE person in one of their residence to get sick with bat soup fever and once it hits the media the fucking stock will CRATER**.

{"title": "Was the circuit breaker on Monday an engineered drop? How MM have been setting Wednesday 3/11/20 for the next leg down.", "selftext": "**1 - e4**\n\n2/19/20. The S&P hit all time highs at 339. Everyone was making tendies. Finally, after having diamond hands, our 3/20 200c MSFT start to print. All was good.\n\n2/20/20. Massive selling happened midday. Autists were confused. We rallied back later in the afternoon. BTFD. SPY closed from 337.74 to 336.95.\n\n2/21/20. SPY opened 335.47. SPY closed 333.48. It's Friday. Didn't you know autist? Friday's for the past 3 weeks have sold off before rallying. Monday is going to bounce, then power up through the week to new highs. BTFD.\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM already have made their first move.***\n\n**2 - Bc4**\n\nIn my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffh9cd/why_volatility_is_here_to_stay_the_market_will/), I described the fastest correction since the 2008 financial crisis, why volatility is here to stay. I also describe exactly why we started to be **range bound between 313.84 and 284.82** after the selling climax and the Fed's emergency 50 bps point cut.\n\n[SPY 1 Yr\\/1 D](https://preview.redd.it/385fc7sraxl41.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc95310e0f63605c114dc428da8c17e2df0f68f6)\n\n2/28/20 Friday. After dropping for almost an entire week straight, we reach near the 2019 October low, shorts cover heavily, and we pump back up to the 250% retracement at 293.15. All is good, just a beer virus. JPow is going to save us!\n\n[SPY 10 D\\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/50gm1e7gexl41.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c97bfe05ac03c7384eebac0b4599ed0236bec7)\n\n3/2/20 Monday. After making some solid gains, the Fed announced emergency cuts. We rally for 30 min. We're still staying in this uptrend channel. Seems like we made some new resistance at 285.\n\n[SPY 5 D\\/15 min + overlaid with SPY 1 Yr\\/1 D, volume indicator, and RSI](https://preview.redd.it/cgrccro6gxl41.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f89a65a6b63ea92c549ec4204def51a68e3f2d1)\n\n3/6/20 Friday. All indications suggested that we were nearing the bottom of the channel at 285 to retest the lows and start forming the bottom or base. RSI was below <40 consistently, volume was slowing on the selling side. On this day, we entered extremely oversold territory.\n\nLike clockwork, at 3:30 pm EST, shorts start covering heavily as indicated by that large number of white candles in the bottom right corner. It's going to be alright, we are going to get our YUGE rally on Monday like last time. Wait. Like last time? Like on Friday 2/28/20?\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM have already made their second move.***\n\n**3 - Qh5**\n\n[SPY 10 D\\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/rz5srd0uhxl41.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=097544b835ba4b59b2641d64836b6fad956d2d55)\n\n3/9/20 Monday. Futures in during the night limit down. No matter what, everyone with calls at open is absolutely screwed over. The 7% circuit breaker quickly follows 4 min in trading.\n\nAs I previously stated on 3/5/20, Sunday, when I made my first post:\n\n>Due to this uncertainty and with additional bad news expected over the weekend, I believe we are going to still face more downside as we close near the 285, before having another large rally to the upside.\n\nPeople are panicking, people are buying puts, puts, and more puts. Surely it will hit the 20% circuit breaker today, if not sometime this week? We end the day at a lower low.\n\n>Retest of the -5% at the previous 285 was rejected. Ended lower than -7% circuit breaker and even below the August 2019 low at 273.09, creating a sign of weakness. Larger sell volume present in the final hours of trading. Most likely going to continue to the downside, but still expecting a bounce which will be used to shake out people holding their puts.\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM already have made their third move.***\n\n[3\\/9\\/20 Options sales on SPX](https://preview.redd.it/9fix47h5jxl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8571ae5356e1b666b2cd4001b602456970bcba0)\n\nClosely after the 7% circuit breaker, MM were buying tens of thousands of SPX calls. Look at some of them and their price. What about treasury bonds at an all time high? Note that many of these were bought around 2 or 3 pm.\n\n[3\\/9\\/20 Options sales on TLT](https://preview.redd.it/09jtvhfzjxl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a2d889a81636eb6be80aef630c0cd8c858578ca)\n\n>Another contrarian indicator given the price on Friday action. Even though we have hit -5% in /ES and passed 2850, there's actually tens of thousands of puts OTM purchased on TLT during Friday. Now that begets the question, if treasuries are the safe haven asset as more people are selling \\[equities, which should drive up TLT prices\\], then who is buying these puts?\n\n**4 - Qxf7**\n\n[SPY 5 D\\/5 min](https://preview.redd.it/n04az9b7lxl41.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d10013cba8c3f160fa37e1c676ec053852229d)\n\n3/10/20 Tuesday. Futures during the night limit up. Anyone who bought puts yesterday are screwed. Calls, autists, buy more calls! Bear r fuk!\n\nWe start plummeting to retest our new low of 270.27, stopping just short of the June 2019 low at 273.09. Bull r fuk! Suddenly, we start rallying. It's the Fed. Pump JPow, pump it harder! And just like that, we are back into our 285-315 bounded trading range.\n\nHang on autists. Aren't a lot of drops on Monday? I keep hearing black Monday. We got a nice rally on Tuesday. Well, we are back in our trading range, things should be okay. 285 should be our lower resistance. Lot of people watching these charts seem to agree. Has this happened before?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f62bup1llxl41.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a21446d89e7a2d638825bcdb8fc01935dd539119\n\nWhat's going to happen tomorrow on Wednesday? Well...\n\n***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM already have made their fourth move.***\n\n[3\\/10\\/20 SPX options sales](https://preview.redd.it/mcog9fz9nxl41.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df2ce64d818f79814f73e023c23db9a6cea9386)\n\nNotice the large amounts of calls early in the morning. This was right before the low at 11:30 am this Tuesday.\n\nNow look at the insane amounts of **0DTE FD puts for March 11 tomorrow.** Just for reference, 5000 SPX FD puts for tomorrow at a premium of 22.70 is $11,350,000. There are more than >60,000 of these puts.\n\nWhat about treasuries? Notice those massive amounts of puts purchased right before 11 today morning before the rally back to 285. Now notice how many calls were bought right before close today.\n\n[3\\/10\\/20 TLT](https://preview.redd.it/6qoj7tzwnxl41.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bc90ff9c0274baae08feaedd9370fdad9af4494)\n\n**tl;dr Tomorrow is going to be a blood bath which has been set up for almost 2 weeks now by MM. Checkmate autists.**\n\n**3/10/20 Update 1** \\- Futures down already -1.5% at 8pm est.\n\nI'll update more on why tomorrow was chosen. MM were already planning contingency plans or splitting up trading teams in different areas last week. Also, the college aged children of these MM most likely got notifications that universities were closing this week. People at Morgan Stanley and Barclays also have gotten sick from coronavirus. National guard deployed in NY. It hit close to home.\n\nJust a quick edit. Every single firm has done their own internal calculation of number of cases in the USA already and how quickly it will spread. Most MM agree  the market will go down significantly more. They are taking advantage of the vol to take as much money from people as they can.\n\n**3/11/20 Update 2 7:55 am EST** \\- Think we open near 277, the August 2019. Sets us up for 273, the June 2019 low and the 269 low from Monday. This lines up with those 275/276/280 put strikes bought yesterday, locking instant gains.\n\nI'll post my positions and plays here during my updates around 11 and 3:50 before close. If you do not have the capital to day trade, be very careful of your positionings, intraday is brutal these days. The most important setups are for the next day, and also 4/17 April puts. Don't buy the puts on a down day, wait for a bounce if you aren't in already.\n\nGoing to sell my SPY puts, TLT calls at open. Probably keep holding my VXX calls and GLD shorts. Don't have too much time to do intraday trading today.\n\n[3\\/11\\/20 SPY updated chart before open.](https://preview.redd.it/150odcsci1m41.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&s=869c72f7b4027c3cc5ccf6a1675d01b888c3f5d5)\n\nHere's what's going on. 285-315 was our initial trading range. We rallied back to 285, but significantly fell below. 285 is the new resistance now. We are in between 269-285. We need to test 269 to see if that is our base.  If we fall below 269,  we are in a new trading range. And yes, I think we will go down to 269.\n\nSelling all SPY puts, buy volume super strong. VXX going down, TLT going down.\n\n9:50 Almost 10,000 SPX puts just purchased. Strikes between 269/280. Downtrend selling will continue. We are going to test 269 today. All 0 DTE.\n\n11:40 More trades on puts and looks like straddles for SPX.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bg22aqg2d2m41.png?width=2840&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d7b1660b3d352d77836eb7b4a95f2a7f0b925f1\n\nTLT decreasing, might possibly be a bounce mid day.\n\nBe careful!\n\n2:10 - Probably going to be shorts closing their position and a squeeze soon. If you made some profits I'd lock them in, unless you have longer dated puts.\n\n2:55 - Bought some call options. Haven't seen big blocks yet. But I'll post the data if I see them. Usually they buy within the last 30 min.\n\nTLT going down. Looks like they are starting to liquidate some cash to get ready for some buying.\n\n3:10 - Insane. They really are going to bring it down to 269 to be in the money.\n\n3:30 - Shorts starting to cover. TLT down 1%!\n\n3:40 - Still not seeing any call big blocks. I hate these guys honestly lol. We might have more downside tomorrow if theres no big blocks. Might need to sell these calls soon or tomorrow at open\n\n3:50.- I see some doubling down on puts. Keeping their positions.\n\nThinking red day tomorrow. The games man. The games.\n\nShort cover is a bull trap. More doubling down of puts.\n\n4:00 - Im peaked. I'll write a short update with a chart explaining their moves today.\n\n=================================================================================\n\n[3\\/11\\/20 SPY](https://preview.redd.it/ykh3xedea5m41.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=f98f1e05f68d3b66ca1de45fdb717cae84950c9f)\n\nQuick update, seems like it's pretty clear what's going to happen tomorrow. So how did they do it? Previously they broke back into the 285 channel, which I mentioned was a fake out. People were selling their puts due to being caught by the sudden rally to the upside. Since we broke back into the 285-315 trading range, people thought the next day would be green as well. Calls, calls, calls.\n\nLike I mentioned before, most of the price action happens before the open. To position, you need to buy the puts/calls before on the cheap, that gets you a nice 20-30% if you time the entry well. Overnight, futures tank and break below into the 281 and 276 channel. Futures instantly lock you now 60-80% gains. I previously mentioned how a lot of this was setup to position the drop to 269, which was the strike of most of the 0 DTE puts. About 30 min before the cash open, we pump like crazy to near the 281 channel. Hint: this was done to buy even more 0 DTE puts.\n\n[3\\/11\\/20 Options and Sales](https://preview.redd.it/a3n79ss7c5m41.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f67b2d0f014602fd9f9c7813de50457c9ee7fb9)\n\nSPX put after put was purchased within 9:50 to 11. Notice those 0 DTE puts. Look at how many there are. Close to 15,000. Let's just take the transaction at 9:48. for the 2805 put 2154 x 100 x $36.06 = >7,000,000. Once they loaded up, price action brought it down to 276. I noticed TLT was bleeding off, this is a good leading indicator to show that liquidity is being drawn and going to be placed somewhere. I said to be careful at 11:40. We bounce hard at 11:55. Why?\n\nLook at who bought more puts at 11:30-11:55. These were combined with calls to form a straddle. But more puts were collected from people who sold and capitulated. But we didn't have enough momentum and sell volume. Oh wait, let's declare the pandemic now. How convenient. We start selling furiously, break 276, smash through 273, and are within striking range of 269 at 270.\n\nThis is where it gets really annoying. Shorts cover. There's a huge bounce. What did they do? 14:39, more straddles. They knew volatility will increase. Stay delta neutral. Now it's near close, around 3:40. I don't see the big blocks. What are the next moves? TLT was decreasing. There's more liquidity, when are they going to buy calls?\n\n[3\\/11\\/20 SPX options and sales](https://preview.redd.it/wpgs8pybe5m41.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=01553a638c0c0d2fcc59f0971b67e746b7360c16)\n\nLook closely at the times. For example, 14:11, massive put buying. But broken into two parts. They started hiding their blocks by breaking them apart so they don't appear as high when people scan. This was right in the middle of that short covering. 15:02, 15:03, 15:17 massive put buying.\n\nThey sold TLT to look like they were putting money back into SPX when it was simply shorts covering. People using that indicator got duped into buying calls. Meanwhile these guys were doubling or even tripling down on more puts and accumulating losses on the move up.\n\nSo how low do we go? Simply, I don't know. We smashed through 269. We might easily hit another circuit breaker. I think the next price target is 250.8, the next fib retracement. We have a few more supports.\n\nAnyways, guys, take care of yourselves. These days are rough. And people will be hurting and losing on retirement or jobs. Protect yourselves, and help others. Have a good night.\n\n=================================================================================\n\n3/12/20 Update 3 - will post updates here.\n\nPlease set limit orders when we hit a circuit breaker, the bid and ask will intentionally be set wide to front run and give you a bad fill if you place a market order.\n\n9:37 - High possibility of possibly hitting the second circuit breaker today.\n\n10:02 - more buying of puts. Gold drawing down. Don't see too much in treasuries. All the pieces have been set.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26iqjz1859m41.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=56222fe9303ad868c519e5ceba55f26971ac0f16\n\nSee the put buying especially after 10:00. The calls are equally matched by puts, forming straddles. Ignore the super OTM puts. Look at the ones closer to the money. Mostly puts.\n\nClosed gold puts.\n\n11:00 - bought VXX calls and more SPY puts. **Follow these with caution.**\n\nI think some firm got duped and got stuck with tens of millions of dollars worth of calls. They're going to start liquidating gold and TLT and try to prop up SPX to stop the bleeding.\n\nHUGE block 6000 puts, 2300 strike. Ruthless. Simply ruthless.\n\n12:15 - sold all my SPY puts. Hit my 251 target. Sold VXX calls.\n\nJust have GLD puts. Waiting for near close today.\n\n1:25 - Fed just announced QE, full nuclear option. Just for reference 500 billion is all of Q1 2019 QE. Fed is pumping more than 1.5 trillion into the markets. Waiting to see who blinks first.\n\n2:25 - Getting a few calls. Expecting a run up, and most likely a respositioning to puts near close end of day.\n\nJust for reference, tons of calls on SPX but even more on SPY in comparison to balance out. These indices shouldn't have such a large dichotomy. Whoever blinks first...\n\n3:00 pm - closed SPY calls. I saw huge orders of VXX calls. The SPX calls most likely just sold to bagholders. The real accumulation is in SPY puts. Be careful.\n\n3:05 - Bought SPY puts and VXX calls.\n\n3:15 - This is what's going to happen. We are going to have a nice run up near end of day, as shorts cover, and TLT draws down. What's happening behind the scenes is that SPX OTM calls were sold to confuse people. What's really happening is they're buying near OTM puts around 230-253.\n\nTons of VXX calls bought. This is the key. There are tons of SPX calls far OTM sold, and tons of near ITM SPY puts accumulated the past few hours. Who is right? SPX or SPY?\n\n3:30 - 12,000 SPX puts just purchased.\n\n3:40 - I have SPY puts, VXX calls, GLD puts. Tomorrow is going to be the storm.\n\n=================================================================================\n\n4/12/20 Update 4 - Sorry, I know this post is getting kind of long. I just want to keep adding to here because I have no idea how long the next post will take to get approved. Want to get this information out as soon as possible. I'll make a post this weekend describing today's price action. I think it revealed a lot of information and why tomorrow is designed for a big drop as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gsfcyjfmcm41.png?width=2122&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a4cfbd6b5d8c8504d9245cdfc208c92eb4f39b\n\n233.8 is the December 2018 low. I think that is the lower end of tomorrow's trading range. A few days a go I said we would hit 269 and we did. Then 250 or 247.8, depending on if you're looking at /ES or SPY. Look at the red spikes of the last trading day. The sell volume is strong. There is still panic.\n\nI have a meeting unfortunately from 3-4pm. So most likely I will just sell as we close near that December 2018 support, and go full cash into the weekend. I probably won't enter trading until Monday around 3:50 pm as per usual.\n\n3/13/20 4:15 am - I keep getting pinged about the futures. I'm just gonna leave this here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI)\n\n\"What's important when you're in the hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction.\"\n\n\"You don't want to raise in May and cut in January, you look like Mexico for heaven's sake. I mean this is like a distinguished group of people who went to really good schools. They don't want to look like dopes.\"\n\nBased on the price action yesterday, based on the buying of those SPY puts, the selling of those SPX calls, the fact that constantly every single time there is some game in this week of trading, I believe that there is more going on. Sure, I may be wrong about the market today. But my position sizing will not blow up my account. Regardless, Wall Street wants 0% rates. The only way to do that is to scare the Fed. Who is really in control of the rate cuts? Who throws a fit when things don't go their way? Who is willing to take anyone down on their way when they got caught with their pants down?\n\nI just want to say, be careful about the smoke and mirrors. Lot of things are going on underneath the surface.\n\n8 am - Yesterday, the fed offered more than 500 billion in repo. Only 78.4 billion was taken. Today, the Fed just offered more than 1.1 trillion in repo for today. What are the signals? Why is Wall Street not taking the money for liquidity? Check this out: [https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/](https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/)\n\nThis could possibly be way worse than 2008.\n\n8:30 - 24.1 billion in repo taken.

If a loss exceeds your threshold it will be sold at market price. This also helps set good limits to your trading.\n\n10:15 - Tons of SPY puts purchased around 9:45. Tons of SPX puts. Both SPX and SPY order flow is the same.\n\n[3\\/13\\/20 SPY Order Flow](https://preview.redd.it/7uh9gtl88gm41.png?width=2806&format=png&auto=webp&s=571b013f3840482cdeffdbd6e21538f792f31d6c)\n\n10:20 - Buying more SPY puts and VXX calls.\n\n10:30 - My reddit notifications are not working. If you want to ping me, just message me directly.\n\n10:50 - Straddles opened on SPX.

Holding SPY puts, but watching TLT puts and seeing if there are tranches of calls for SPX or SPY.\n\nUnloading puts slowly. I'm seeing these smaller 1-2000 spx calls peppered in. I think the mass selling of puts is just to collect premium and they sneak the smaller spx call orders. This lines up with TLT puts, and also lines up with VXX puts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11:20 - Trump to declare national emergency.\n\n11:25 - Sold puts.\n\n11:27 - Call orders starting to come in.

Seeing more VXX calls. Lot of uncertainty.\n\n13:15 - Going with calls on GLD. The price is pretty close to my target of 1500.\n\n13:45 - Sold SPY calls. Need to prepare for meeting.

I believe that they have more insight than is available to the retail investor. \n\nTo make an analogy, commercial grade de-greaser is a hell of a lot \nstronger than the stuff we buy at Home Depot.  \n\nThe overall logic is to follow the money. OP appears to have identified several securities that institutions are actively trading which gives us on the retail side some foresight. \n\nShoot me a message if you want to talk through it some more. I'm happy to discuss it! \n\nGood luck out there. May you live in interesting times.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "But they know it's public and that we can see it.

He understands that there is a relationship between more stable long-term bonds and the markets. \n\nSo for all of the people who don’t want to use their brains, here’s what SV is laying out:\n\nBonds are the life blood of our economy and what happens there trickles into equities. TLT, being an ETF of long term bonds is a great indicator that money is moving in or out of stable bonds. As money is being taken out, TLT will decrease in price (demand stays the same but supply goes up). That money from the sale of those bonds is typically put into the markets, whether in options premiums or getting ready to move a market. Typically, hedge funds will buy their options and then draw out cash from bonds or other investments. This cash is now considered liquidity, or the assets available to invest. That liquidity is then used to buy assets, which in this case is SPX.  That liquidity doesn’t always go into this Index but the sentiment there controls the rest of the market sentiment. SV is monitoring the options transactions for large bets usually in shorter term expirations. That’s the first signal. If he notices that a large options bet is placed he will then monitor the draw of TLT for liquidity. If TLT starts dropping, a large sum of shares are being sold, liquidated, to produce assets to move into the index. NOTE: these can happen in both directions. Liquidity can be drawn first and options placed second. If he gets both signals, it’s fairly apparent that someone is going to be moving the market and adjust his portfolio to whatever he is seeing. \n\nToday was a dud as there was not much movement after 11. The press conference by Trump was an unknown as it wasn’t leaked to the public. He couldn’t update us because there weren’t any signals or he was busy.
