{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**\n*****\n> Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.\n*****\n> In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday’s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.\n*****\n> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.\n*****\n> “You could say we’re pricing a garden variety recession,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “We come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.” She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.\n*****\n> “If [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,” said Calvasina.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.\n*****\n> “I think we needed to get through this week, in particular — the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close” to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.\n*****\n> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.\n*****\n> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.\n*****\n> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.\n*****\n> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.\n*****\n> “If it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,” said Knapp. “In 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.”\n*****\n> “We see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,” said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. “I think something else we’ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.”\n*****\n> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed’s policy response that could drive the market.\n*****\n> “In light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,” Goldman economists wrote.\n*****\n> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.\n*****\n> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a “patient” stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.\n*****\n> Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.\n*****\n> “We’ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&P companies’ balance sheets are in really good shape,” Calvasina said. “I don’t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7ENVB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4gwPTzC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/h9DkOZJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4m2QVZH.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/akOOH97.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/slVwGv2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ASyHg6a.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/rbgSrGQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9nZfl7V.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eS99ijc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tEs62Hh.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/kMQTBj6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/toentZ2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ozn837y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Signs Of A Washout?\n\n> The S&P 500 Index’s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.\n\n> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.\n\n> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn’t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market’s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday’s sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. “These are truly frightening times,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.”\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Signs_of_Washout.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Fastest Bear Market Ever\n\n> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “From major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Markets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.”\n\n> Last, one of Warren Buffett’s most famous quotes is, “Be fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.” We’ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning’s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines\n\n> Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.\n\n> First of all yes, this time is different – and yet it’s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market’s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it’s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.\n\n> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It’s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/31cca506c45d87ad962ce9c707baf21a/fc7021573b50880b-76/s500x750/0a6588971f599cbbca194b38b62a47c087875238.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak\n\n> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday’s have been weaker in bear markets.\n\n> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.\n\n > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c8d6237984423d89dc5b20f4a1bf7009/07327bf517318c16-1e/s500x750/13020ac23c0adf1831e35c982c37f1602a236fd1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages\n\n> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**\n\n> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Above-200-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016\n\n> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.\n\n> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/raymktcap.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging\n\n> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**\n\n> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%.

There are other moving parts which can escalate like oil price war (as you mentioned) and move scenarios, and thus market, one way or another. FUD per se doesn't move the market. It works only if changes opinions of those who control the money, and I believe that those who control big money made calculations for themselves and already moved assets one way or another, as made hordes of traders.

In my opinion it was Q3 and Q4 results which proved institutions that Tesla has demand for it's production capacity and is financially sustainable, so risk went way down and only potential left. Thus, as I have mentioned earlier, institutions bought, shorts squeezed and traders feasted in their blood.

Go easy on me. Two major components of extrinsic value on LEAP options (***long-term equity anticipation***) are:\n\n* **Time value** \\-- most of the value baked into a LEAP price\n* **Implied volatility risk premium** \\-- some of the value baked into a LEAP price\n\nThe reason short expiration options make great yolo day trading instruments is because there is minimal time value left, and you can get the brief types of exposures you want without utilizing buying power for time value. AKA you can leverage the fuck up. Here is a simplified example:\n\n* Jan 2021 Call: $10.00 per option, 0.50 Delta, 90% time value, 10% risk premium value\n* April 2020 Call: $5.00 per option, 0.50 Delta, 20% time value, 80% risk premium value\n* If you only plan on being in the trade for a day or two, you can get a lot more bang for your buck at buying 0.50 Delta for $5.00 instead of 0.50 Delta for $10.00\n* Again, hyper simplification, but this is the general idea\n\nLEAP Options tend to have a very flat volatility smile compared to front months, and they are very insensitive to changes in implied volatility compared to front months. I think this variance in sensitivity would be categorized as one of the Shadow Greeks (aka a Greek which can have a major impact on price, but can only be observed, not directly calculated. I have a textbook on this if anyone is interested).\n\nFor example, I was trading $SPCE calls when the stock was going fucking ballistic. I had LEAPs because I was planning on seeing the stock mooning over the year and I wanted to exercise. But as I watched the implied volatility smiles move day to day, I noticed the front months would get super exaggerated. I graphically illustrated what I saw in this link below, and it shows you how a stock can behave and why you might witness the phenomenon that I described earlier and be scratching your head instead of understanding why it happened.\n\nIf anyone wants to monitor this stuff more easily in real time, at least in IBKR, open up the *volatility lab* and type in a ticker.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/2SMGJjA.png](https://i.imgur.com/2SMGJjA.png)\n\n\\*EDIT: It makes it easier when you think of an option has having 3 different values:\n\n* intrinsic value (diff between your strike and the underlying)\n* time value (how long until the thing expires)\n* risk premium (the lottery component)\n* As time goes on and you move closer to expiration, the ratio of time value to risk premium should 'invert'", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Solid advice, thanks dad", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "This post doesn’t belong here.

So actually a calendar spread benefits only from time decay, and does not increase in value when volatility goes down.  \n\nThe original volatility harvesting strategy was selling covered calls. Since the price of the stock you own is not impacted by time or IV, when you sell calls against it, you get both the time and volatility premium. But that costs a lot of capital. So people replaced the stock with a long call option. \n\nTo harvest volatility in this manner requires messing with the strikes. Vega is highest for options that are ATM. You need to buy your long option deep enough ITM and sell your short option close enough to ATM to have a negative vega on the whole trade. Then you will be short volatility in the underlying asset.

Inverse ETFs held for periods longer than one day are affected by compounding returns. Since an inverse ETF has a single-day investment objective of providing investment results that are one times the inverse of its underlying index, the fund's performance likely differs from its investment objective for periods greater than one day. Investors who wish to hold inverse ETFs for periods exceeding one day must actively manage and rebalance their positions to mitigate compounding risk.\n\nFor example, the ProShares Short S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SH) is an inverse ETF that seeks to provide daily investment results, before fees and expenses, corresponding to the inverse, or -1X, of the daily performance of the S&P 500 Index. The effects of compounding returns cause SH's returns to differ from -1X those of the S&P 500 Index.\n\nAs of June 30, 2015, based on trailing 12-month data, SH had a net asset value (NAV) total return of -8.75%, while the S&P 500 Index had a return of 7.42%. Additionally, since the fund's inception on June 19, 2006, SH has had a NAV total return of -10.24%, while the S&P 500 Index has had a return of 8.07% over the same period.\n\nThe effect of compounding returns becomes more conspicuous during periods of high market turbulence. During periods of high volatility, the effects of compounding returns cause an inverse ETF's investment results for periods longer than one single day to substantially vary from one times the inverse of the underlying index's return.\n\nFor example, hypothetically assume the S&P 500 Index is at 1,950 and a speculative investor purchases SH at $20. The index closes 1% higher at 1,969.50 and SH closes at $19.80. However, the following day, the index closes down 3%, at 1,910.42. Consequently, SH closes 3% higher, at $20.81. On the third day, the S&P 500 Index falls by 5% to 1,814.90 and SH rises by 5% to $21.85. Due to this high volatility, the compounding effects are evident. Due to rounding, the index decreased by approximately 7%. However, the effects of compounding caused SH to increase by a total of approximately 10.25%.\" [risks of inverse ETFs ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/risks-investing-inverse-etfs.asp)", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is the type of DD i would want to jerk of too", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dal", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Got my puts Friday.

This means that you can’t use Gold Buying Power to purchase them. You have to sell 1x the call amount because these stocks get 100% release from sales. \n\nExample: If your call amount is $100, you have to sell at least $100. $100 * (1.00) = $100", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It’s a good thing too, it’s time to get your ass to a new broker.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you have margin turned off like you stated and are using cash then why would robinhood close a debit spread (or any spread honestly) when it gets out of the money??
