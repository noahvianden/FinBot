Much of the country was largely shut down for several weeks, families stayed at home with one healthy family member allowed to go out to buy food 1-2 times a week, personal protective equipment (PPE), public transit shut down, lots of tests and anyone thought to be infected quarantined. In places where the problem has lessened, public transit is working, but people coming into the area have to be quarantined (which could be at home, for example) for two weeks before they can go to work. Many workers are encouraged to work from home if they can. There are rules about wearing PPE and not doing things that might spread infection in public places. \"Draconian\" measures included police-controlled drones that flew around yelling at people who ignored the rules, and in one city the police smashed some mahjong tables because people had been congregating against the rules to play. \n\nThe US could probably do most of that using state of emergency declarations, but they probably would not smash the mahjong tables.\n\n> The USA still hasn’t done more than a thousand tests yet.\n\nA US official on cable news last night described plans for an extremely rapid ramp-up of tests, with plans for potentially millions in the near future. The US had a very slow start on testing, but now they seem to be doing the right thing. In areas of the US where the virus is known to be spreading, officials do seem to be taking it seriously and taking strong measures.\n\n> The R0 is between 2.6 and 6. That’s the only number that really matters.\n\nAs has been discussed several times, that's the number if nobody does anything to reduce the spread of infection.

The vulnerable ones are abroad, and they're the ones with really lazy lending standards. US banks will be hit, but likely won't tank. Also, as stated at the end of this post, please correct me where I'm wrong. Feel free to leave a comment, but definitely reach out to me via chat or DMs so your message doesn't get buried. I would rather prioritize constructive criticism than a bunch of excited assent - *if I am wrong, tell me in my DMs, preferably with an explanation rather than just \"you're full of shit\"*\n\nDrop me a chat (not a dm, swear to god, reddit doesn't need two different messaging systems) if you'd like to talk about coordinating. I'll get up with you guys tomorrow. I would love to pool information and repost this over the weekend with a more comprehensive picture of what the fuck is going on with the international lending system. Cheers!\n\n***Jesus, this really blew up. I'm at work right now, so I won't be super available to respond. Suffice it to say, though, that I've received an overwhelming amount of responses indicating interest in collaboration. After work today, (4-5 pm EST) I'll start really going through all the messages you guys have send me and shooting off replies. Mods have approved a Google doc so we can all contribute, and a disc chat might be in order, since there are so many of you fucking autists that have reached out. God bless. I'll be in touch soon.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForgot to put strike/date at the top: I'm in September BAC $18 puts. Banks will start failing later this year. It's hard to tell which ones will fail, due to the *shadowy* nature of the *shadow lending* market. That, and the dollar will moon. You want positions spoonfed to you? Fuck off. This post is half food for thought, half explanation. Trying to follow the money here is *hard.* If you're lazy, just buy puts on indices like $INDA and $EWG and $EWY: any country that's loaded up on eurodollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, you tards, listen up: this is going to be a long, confusing post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that I'm not smart. But that doesn't concern me, because you're not smart, either. I just began reading about repo operations a few days ago. I've seen a few posts on here lately remarking on the repo ops, and a lot of misconceptions about what they *are* and what they're intended to *do*. I've learned all of what I'm going to post here from other users on here and from my own research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important thing you need to understand about the repo market is that it's a black box. It's an **interbank loan market** **where securities (ideally bonds) are put up as collateral for short-term cash loans**. The transactions are private and the market usually sets the rates. Repurchase agreements are semantically different from fed repos, but **operate in the exact same way.** This is important. Banks, per federal legislation, are required to keep a minimum amount of cash on hand to prevent liquidity issues. The repo market exists as a way to circumvent these requirements; banks run as close to the reserve requirements as possible to maximize their profitability, and sometimes run below the limit. In this case, the bank posts collateral on the repo market in exchange for liquid cash to meet the requirements again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn September of last year, the fed was forced to offer hundreds of billions of dollars in repo agreements to banks. This is because the interbank repo interest rate had reached 10% due to liquidity problems. I'm still not sure, and I'm not sure that anyone else is sure, why the liquidity shortage arose, but it did. If I were to hazard a guess, it's because big domestic lenders, sensing volatility abroad, started to pull out of the repo market. Since then, the fed has been, on-and-off, offering repo agreements to large banks (designated banks are called Primary Dealer Banks \\[PDBs\\]) and they hold a special status and maintain accounts with the fed. Once these PDBs post collateral (again, securities), money (kind of) is transferred temporarily to their fed account. These PDBs then distribute the cash in the interbank repo market (which is anonymous) at a slight profit. The fed repo interest rate was around 1.6%; on Tuesday night, it jumped up to 1.8% because of the emergency demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fed had planned to cut repo ops to 0 by April of this year, essentially weaning the US banking system off of liquidity infusions. This didn't happen. Due to supply chain disruptions and market volatility, the fed was forced to offer several hundred billion in overnight repo agreements this week to PDBs in an effort to maintain liquidity. In fact, this month is set to hit record repo lending balances. Furthermore, the [fed is expecting another $130b](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details#monthly-summary) to be repaid in the next three weeks, sucking even more liquidity out of the market.\n\nEdit: The fed was also pondering establishing a standing clearing house for fed repos to smaller entities like hedge funds. Hopefully, they're walking that idea back, because it's a fucking *terrible* one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, here's where I learned I was wrong, and this is a point of confusion for some: **the banks don't need the liquidity for themselves.** They need the liquidity for their *borrowers*. See, these PDBs float money anonymously in the repo market to lots and lots of entities, both domestic and foreign. This is *shadow banking*. Remember when I said the repo market is a black box? Right, well, American banks have been lending money to foreign banks that don't have as stringent of regulations as American ones do. In the US, between two US banks, when a loan is written, some percentage of the loan size must be physically transferred over to the borrower (the reserve amount). Between an American bank and a foreign bank, though, no such requirement exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom this discrepancy in regulation, the eurodollar is born. **The eurodollar is imaginary money** that is printed by American banks: when they make a loan to a foreign bank, the loan exists only on the balance sheets. There is no physical manifestation of currency transfer. Consequently, eurodollars get *leveraged to shit*. Instead of the fractional reserve system, the ideal interbank loan system in America, eurodollars can get loaned indefinitely, forever. Eurodollars are paying factory workers, building bridges, and trading as currency. But it's *not* currency. And because eurodollars are what circulate outside the US, real USD are becoming increasingly rare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou see, the USD has become the de facto global currency. There's a lot of confidence in it. It backs virtually every exchange of goods or services in the world. Right now, though, emerging markets' banks aren't really using it; they're hoarding it. Additionally, they're accepting *awful* collateral in exchange for eurodollars, because they know the USD has intrinsic value and eurodollars are imaginary. Collateral like subprime loans. Sound familiar? It should, because the 08 crisis was global *because of the international monetary system*. The mortgage defaults here at home were just the impetus - just like the supply chain disruptions this year might be. The subprime mortgage scandal was just the scapegoat for the **underlying fragility of the eurodollar system.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, PDBs are aware of this. That's one reason they're starting to become stingier with their lending. They know that their borrowers are accepting garbage collateral in exchange for eurodollars. They know that foreign banks are leveraging themselves up to the tits on *low-grade collateral,* which means, in essence, the fed is, by proxy, making out hundreds of billions in loans to banks in places like India for fucking used car loans instead of treasury bonds. So, say that Shyam over in India can't make his car payments this month because he hasn't worked since the quarantine began. And his neighbors all do the same. Without US liquidity injections, channeled through the PDBs and into the shady repo market, that Indian bank will fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, that's why it matters that US lenders are pulling out of foreign markets: with supply/manufacturing disruptions and increasing volatility all over the world, foreign banks are direly hurting for liquidity so they can make out loans for businesses and manufacturers and individuals and all sorts of entities. If they don't get this liquidity, they're likely to default. And what happens when these capital groups and small banks die? They default on *their* loans. So on, up the chain. Say JPM takes out $50b against its treasuries from the fed. It then sells that money on the repo market. Eventually, that money finds its way to Yong Jiang over in China, who took out a loan to keep the lights on in the McDonald's Toy factory in Hubei. Well, three months later, sales haven't made up for lost revenue during the quarantine, and Yong Jiang becomes insolvent and defaults on his loan. That default makes its way back up the ladder to JPM. Now, JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJPM has made this calculation and decided, fuck no, it wants none of that. The problem is, though, that the loan has already been taken out by Yong Jiang. Say Yong Jiang's bank needs some liquidity because Yong defaults. Well, JPM has stopped taking fed repos because of the risk, so there's no money to buy on the market, and Yong's bank fails. This happens dozens of times, across dozens of countries. Pretty soon, the international banking industry faces systemic collapse. For reference, the global repo market [is valued at $12T](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=2ahUKEwjqgof02IToAhXwm-AKHY3rA8gQFjACegQICxAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.org%2Fpubl%2Fcgfs59.pdf&usg=AOvVaw21Jay8zD6uNqWJcspNvCXa) USD, and only 3/4 of it is backed by \"pristine collateral\" - government bonds. **That means that $3T of it is in equities or derivatives.** The fed's balance sheet is only *$4T* USD in comparison. Additionally, $.5T is in private capital groups, which are entirely opaque and likely have rotten fucking lending standards. No way to see who they're lending to, or what collateral they're taking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're already seeing this beginning: [India's Yes Bank is about to be nationalized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/india-s-central-bank-to-seize-yes-bank-to-help-revive-lender) due to, you guessed it, *liquidity* problems. It's been involved in shadow lending practices, and American liquidity is starting to dry up across the world. China is also heavily dependent on eurodollars, but I'm not sure how that relationship will shake out. Their economy might be so big and so vital that we're forced to prop them up. If not, China's banking system will go tits up, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe question then becomes, is the fed willing and able to meet global liquidity demands? And beyond this, how do they force PDBs to keep printing eurodollars and continue to assume risk, risk which may violate their fiduciary obligation to shareholders? Trillion-dollar question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what does all this mean? Who can we short? Honestly, this is hard to say. Personally, I have september puts on BAC for $18, and I'm still looking for anyone else who might be vulnerable. Any of the PDBs with accounts at the fed might be at risk. I'm going to start hunting for SE Asian, African, and South American banks that've been taking repo money. Those are likely to be the most probable to fail. On top of that, as banks start dropping like flies and the global economy tanks, the USD is going to fucking \\*moon\\*. That's a worthwhile bet, too. The issue here is that the repo market is anonymous, so it's hard to follow the money. If anyone has any recommendations for specific banks or lending groups to target or look into more, please feel free to let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the global banking industry started to fail, though, look for it to hit full swing later this year. This is going to be driven by large amounts of defaults that will be spurred by the manufacturing disruptions, the extent of which won't be fully felt until at least midway through this year. Add a few months for missed loan payments, and I'm wagering that you'll see banks start *really* failing by August or September.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot here I'm going to continue to research, and if there's anything I've gotten wrong or anything you'd like to add, please speak up and correct me/educate me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nu/Psicopro, u/farisbuellerRULES, u/FlexMcgooch, u/meritorius_demotion, and every other fucking angel who answered my stupid goddamn questions and let me bounce ideas off of them\n\nThis is a good sub, guys; embrace cooperation and weaponize your collective autism\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For further reading, check out Jeff Snider. He's a macro economist who's been shrieking about this for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the positive responses and the awards, guys! Please, let me know if you find anything related to these repo market participants, either in the comments or (preferably) in a DM. I'll either update this post or write an updated DD. Cheers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: list of vulnerable recommended banks from the comments - Bank of East Asia, HDB, IBN (both in India) - keep em coming, guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 4: this blew up even more than I expected. I'm likely going to repost this over the weekend with more information and more citations, and I'm considering the possibility of opening up a google doc to aggregate research into vulnerable banks. Hit me up in my chat if you've got relevant information on this, or if you'd like to talk about the possibility of collaborating.

You think they are external entities to the bank but no, they are the banks own entities. Say the European division of the bank has a repo agreement with the American entity of the same bank. This can and has gone wrong (read Lehman Brothers Repo 105). Now, only the banks that were designated as too big to fail have to meet the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rule which is the requirement to maintain an amount of High Quality Liquidity Assets (HQLA) sufficient to meet stressed cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period.  Historically banks keep this over the requirement of 100% except banks like Goldman who keep it as close to 100 as possible due a opportunity cost decision (money you use in a repo is money that you could've used in something more profitable). Just getting this part wrong is very big flaw in your analysis since your premise is that the repos are backed by low quality assets when its high quality-ness is the underlying basis of this rule.\n\n If you want to know more about repos you need to read Zoltan Poszar from Credit Suisse, he's the absolute BSD in the matter.

Here's the best explanation I've seen. TLDR:\n1. The US Treasury used to keep their deposits at commercial banks. \n2. Now they keep it at the Fed. \n3. As the Fed's balance sheet shrank, banks had less ability to lend to the repo market.\n4. When corporate tax day came, deposits flowed out of the banks to the treasury's account at the Fed, reducing banks' lending in the repo market, causing rates to spike.\n5. What's the solution? Let the Fed lend into the repo market.\n\nLink here: https://bpi.com/two-little-noticed-and-self-inflicted-causes-of-the-feds-current-monetary-policy-implementation-predicament/\n\nTo go even deeper, look for posts by the incedibly-named Zoltan Poszar, an analyst at Credit Suisse and former staffer at the NY Fed, starting with this Odd Lots podcast episode: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bloomberg/odd-lots/e/65193721", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "And my even longer answer:\n\nWhat's true about the post above: US banks have exposure to foreign banks. US banks may be reducing that exposure (no information one way or the other, who knows?)\n\nWhat's false: US bank exposure to foreign banks is different from their exposure to other banks. Repo is a way of cheating on liquidity requirements. Our banking system is \"fractional reserve\". When US banks lend to each other they send truckloads of cash.\n\nHere's why the Fed is lending to repo markets:\n\n1. After the crisis, the Fed's balance sheet increased and provided more high-quality liquid assets to the banking system \n\n2. After the crisis the Fed and other regulators implemented stronger liquidity requirements, requiring banks to fund themselves through more high-quality liquid assets\n\n3. One source of funding for banks is the repo market. It's like a very short-term loan that usually gets rolled over daily.\n\n4. Another source of funding for banks is deposits.\n\n5. Some banks make loans in the repo market. Some banks (and other entities) take loans in the repo market. You can think of the banks with Lots of Deposits making loans and the banks with Fewer Deposits taking loans.\n\n6. Another thing that happened after the crisis is that the US Treasury moved their checking account (the Treasury General Account) from the banks to the Fed.\n\n7. So it used to be that every time depositors paid a lot of money to the Treasury (like on corporate tax days), those deposits were still at the banks, available for loans.\n\n8. Now they are not. They go to the Fed.\n\n9. More recently the Fed has begun reducing its balance sheet (see 1 above).\n\n10. The higher liquidity requirements are still in place (2 above)\n\n11. We seem to have reached the point where if the Fed shrinks its balance sheet much more, banks will have trouble meeting the new higher liquidity requirements\n\n12. So when tax day came and money moved from deposits at banks to the Fed, banks couldn't lend as much and pulled back from the repo market\n\n13. What's the solution? Put the Fed in the repo market so that those funds are still available for lending, and repo rates are stable", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "This is really interesting, thanks for sharing.

Even if the cash they loan out is defaulted on, it doesn’t matter in terms of the repo, the guy who gave cash and received a treasury security has a HQLA that is very often worth more than the cash they lent out. Plus these loans are for very short term. So what does the repo market even have anything to do with foreign bank lending?\n\nSecond your understanding of Eurodollars is extremely poor and is literal tinfoil hat theory. The money doesn’t exist and is never physically sent over?

I understand that repo agreements are collateralized, but that doesn't guarantee that the recipient of a repo loan is accepting collateral for loans it makes to foreign banks, does it? I guess I may have misstated (misunderstood?) the flow of cash. I'm presuming in this post that foreign banks are demanding increasing amounts in loans of American lenders as their liquidity dries up and consequently American lenders are forced to borrow more from the repo market to maintain their reserves.\nI'm not going to lie, I don't have a strong understanding of the eurodollar market. It was, however, implicated in the liquidity crisis of '08 though, no? And it depends on injections of American liquidity to remain solvent during hard times, yeah?\nI disclaim at the top that US banks are fairly well insulated from this.

Can you explain your understanding of what happens from start to finish of what you’re trying to explain?\n\nRepo market:\n1. Us treasuries or agency mbs in exchange for cash. The lender receives short term us treasuries and lends out cash for a short period, mostly overnight. He then holds this treasury for that period and gets back his cash and interest. \n\nThis transaction has nothing to do with Eurodollars, full stop.\n\nPart 2 of your argument (I guess):\n\nThe person who borrowed in the repo transaction is I guess a shadow entity / private capital firm who then invests in a Eurodollar deposit. I don’t understand where you think this is fake or synthetic really. The foreign bank takes the US denominated money but it’s a liability, the foreign pays interest on it. On the assets side the foreign bank get to invest more since they have more deposits. \n\nThe shadow entity either withdraws their Eurodollar deposit in time to pay for the repo or they pay it somehow else. If they withdraw the Eurodollar the foreign bank has to sell some assets to meet the obligation of the withdrawal or take a dent in the capital they hold. Even in an a situation where they don’t pay the repo lender holding the treasury still has a lot of collateral. \n\nSo where is the weak link in what you’re trying to argue?\n\nEDIT: I also don’t understand what you mean the foreign banks are demanding more loans so they’re reaching out in the repo market to meet the demand. No one is forcing them to meet the demand, and it’s quite literally against the rules for them to overleverage or something so they can continue to make Eurodollar deposits.\n\nAlso, my understanding of the Eurodollar in 2008 is that it what made the US housing crisis contagion to the Foreign banks. The us banks mortgages crashed on them so they called in those Eurodollars which caused funding issues for the foreign banks. \n\nI’m not a liquidity expert or a Eurodollar expert nor was I around during the crisis, but I’d really recommend expanding your DD outside of this Alhambra investment jeff guy.

This repo money is mixed in with the rest of that PDB's account. Money is then lent (or sold) on the repo market, either to another US bank or to a foreign one. Between US banks, some physical currency has to change hands, per reserve requirements. Between a US bank and a domestic one, physical currency doesn't necessarily change hands. The loan exists on the balance sheets of the two parties involved. From there, the foreign bank can write loans and accept collateral, and the collateral requirements for a foreign bank may be far less stringent than those for a US bank - the foreign bank may accept very low-grade collateral in the form of corporate bonds, equities, or derivatives. If this collateral defaults or otherwise fails, the foreign bank is left holding the bag. \nUS lenders have become aware of these practices and therefore less willing to loan money to foreign banks; as this liquidity dries up, defaulting collateral will result to defaulting foreign banks.

Give it up for Deutsche Bank to find the shittiest deals and lose money in every form possible known to mankind. Invest in Seaworld? Of course! Build the Cosmo hotel in Vegas and bleed money since inception? We’ll lend you that money! Give old Trump a hand job and some loan money? DB will do it! \n\nIn all seriousness, DB has about 44T $USD in derivatives ( shit like CDS that bankrupted Lehman and potentially many other banks in 2008). How the hell did it get all of those derivative contracts, I will never know. I all know is those $15T of those contracts were set to expire In 2020 and be repaid by the debtors this year and somehow DB hasn’t exploded yet. One could posit that DB has been taking in the repo money and lending it out to their borrowers against their own books to keep the flow going. Taking it from one account and putting it in the other. Well here comes coronavirus to really fuck up the supply chain and liquidity chain. DB’s equity is sitting on about 22billion or whatever (I’m on my phone, someone check their cooked 10k for me) and trillions of dollars worth of contracts that are basically lent to junk rated companies. These companies who may fall short 2-3 months of cash flow and you have solvency issues. \n\nIf I were to short banks DB and HSBC are the two primary targets. They have a history of greed and fucking up deals and I don’t see how this can get any better for them. DB is exposed to junk loans, and HSBC is exposed to Hong Kong and asian markets. \n\nMy only concern is because DB is pretty much intrinsically attached to the US SIFIs, the fed is propping up everything it can to prevent systematic failure. At that point, we will have bigger problems. Or not, Feds can just keep printing and we would never know just like how millions slept through 2008. \n\nTLDR: puts on $HSBC and $DB.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "> It appears that NO ONE wanted to give out a interbank loan for a ridiculously high rate of nearly 10%.\n> \n> Why wouldn’t you do that? \n\nthe true trillion dollar question.

They're policies. Entirely predictable and manufactured outcomes. The course prescribed to our economy by the Fed (or any central bank in theory).\n\nStep 1: central bank prints lots of money\n\nStep 2: interest rates go down and debt goes up despite there not being an actual increase in available savings (think more slices of pizza that are smaller, but same amount overall)\n\nStep 3: increased debt phase appears as a boom to everyone as business expands, unemployment drops, and financial assets rise\n\nStep 4: inflation begins to rise. Prices are going up because the same amount of \"stuff\" is being chased by a larger total amount of dollars\n\nStep 5: central bank destroys money to fight this inflation\n\nStep 6: interest rates go up and everyone who expanded debt because of the artificially low interest rates can't afford it anymore, begin to default/contract/lay off/ and file bankruptcy; this applies to individuals and businesses and is what we call the bust\n\nStep 7: rinse and repeat, just more bigly each successive cycle\n\nThis can't go on forever though obviously because eventually they'll lose control of inflation. Or more accurately, eventually everyone will wake up to the fact that they've already lost control of it. Because what happens if they stop the cycle? Rates go up and suddenly everyone with debt, including/especially Uncle Sam, can't afford to make their payments and must default.\n\nThis would, as you suggest, cause a lot of pain in the economy as capital shifts from unsustainable ventures/consumption to where it can actually generate a return/profit despite the high interest payments.\n\nIf the Fed would just leave things alone eventually real savings would increase to take advantage of the higher interest rates, which would soon after lower to an equilibrium due to the greater supply of savings, and the economy would expand again just in the right places this time since rates aren't so low anybody with a half baked idea can launch an IPO without a company or buy a mansion with a no money down mortgage.\n\nBut they don't leave it alone, because neither them nor their government partners in crime want to face that inevitable pain, particularly the part where Uncle Sam defaults on 22 trillion of debt, so instead they just keep hammering shots to delay the hangover ultimately making it worse in the end.\n\nCan you blame them though? Either way they're fucked, at least with endless QE it's not as clear it's their fault and it buys time. If they default on the debt, no one will ever lend them money again and the budget will have to be balanced. Bye bye entitlements! Good luck getting votes on that campaign in today's political climate.

Eurodollar accounts are 1) *very* real and held in (mostly) Caribbean banks (eg they aren't fake by any stretch) and when Eurodollar lending grows, those accounts grow meaning they aren't fake/bullshit (I wrote in a post back in Sept about how euro/usd carry trades were helping to cause the spike on ON repo - this element was what I was talking about), and 2) while they are outside US/EU *direct* lending rules, there exist a series of regulated arbitrages that act as de facto limits on Eurodollar lending and leverage.  \n\nI'm not ELI5ing this so look it up on your own:  the cost of *any* trade is defined by its cost to hedge and capacity to hedge - this is a bedrock principle of synthetic finance.  A eurodollar loan can be synthetically replicated by 1) a straight-currency loan with either an embedded FX swaption or 2) a straight currency loan with a series of laddered and termed FX forwards.  So you have a 3-way arbitrage: 1) a eurodollar loan, 2) the swaption loan, 3) the forward loan.  All 3 have to be in balance, otherwise you have a pure arb which don't exist (for long) in reality.  So while #1 is lightly regulated, #2 & #3 are *very regulated*, meaning that #1 is de facto regulated (or limited) by the arb conditions within #2 & #3.  OP's whole premise is just horseshit. \n\nAnd just think about this from a commonsense perspective: if eurodollars were really a \"unlimited cash cheat code\" they'd blow up all the time....when was the last time there was (even a minor) meltdown in the eurodollar market?

Eventually, that money finds its way to Yong Jiang over in China.....Now, JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back.\"\n\n1) USD direct/indirect lending to China is fucking nonexistent.  Chinese state banks and state-sponsored NBFI's do literally all of China's lending. In fact, non-Chinese institutions can't even hold Chinese currency wo using a proxy. There's just no such thing as JPM using its balance sheet to do direct loans in China.  Some US banks do have semi-partnerships with Chinese institutions, but those are essentially non-recourse equity positions, and even then they are fucking tiny.  That part right there nuke's OP's whole thesis.  \n\n2) Exactly zero collateralized repo is used for mid/long-term lending.  Lehman dabbled in this a little bit and its what caused them to melt down.  As a result, US Banks/SIFIs cannot do this anymore.  Additionally, all of the 'shadow financial' system *still* has liquidity requirements that would prevent them from making such an incredibly illiquid investment with a ST funding position.\n\n3) Cash repo is used for (essentially) marginal cash settlement which is like a 2-7 day phenomenon.  The whole \"JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back\" - just doesn't exist in reality.  That's just not how anyone uses repo facilities.  If you are going to make a term loan, your funding needs to match in term; so if you are lending, LT you need a LT funding source, not a ~7 day funding source. This is true within the 'shadow banking' system as well. \n\nI could keep going, but what's the point.

I defer to your expertise on this. I'm not going to argue with you when you evidently know a helluva lot more on the topic than I do. I would, however, address the main three points you make in your response:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1: I was using China as a generic example. I am aware of the insularity of China's economy and banking system. I didn't realize it was *that* closed off, though. I wasn't using the example as a specific case. I disagree that it nukes my thesis, but what you've written about how the eurodollar is regulated might.\n\n2: Point taken. I wasn't suggesting that US banks are themselves accepting collateral for their loans. A lot of what I've posted here has been gleaned from things I've read online, largely simplified explanations of industry practices. Don't have much of a counterargument here.\n\n3: I'm aware - this was used to illustrate the reasoning on the part of PDBs in their risk calculations. Obviously, a massive bank like JPM isn't going to default on a repo or liquidate assets to pay it off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, this post is practically an invitation to get educated. I explicitly disclaim that I'm not recommending any trades or positions in this post. I have emphatically repeated that to users who have messaged me. The thrust of this post was in part to inform people here who, like myself, had trouble understanding the repo market and why repo ops were ramping up. \n\nI appreciate the feedback, though, and if you'd care to explain in greater detail the points you make, I'd be happy to edit the post where appropriate.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This isn’t a new phenomenon on WSB:\n\n1000+ word dd on something that “is going to happen and here’s links why”  \nThousands of upvotes  \nComments saying how intelligent it is\n\nAnd this isn’t the first time for this exact issue, except this time we have COVID-19 going on.

If you expect rates to go down, would you hold your security or sell it, you would hold it because they will be worth more. Demand for loans go up. If you are a bank would you want to lend to a leveraged hedge fund who could go belly up with the slightest change in rates with the tremendous convexity at near 0% interested rate? Thanks to strict regulations this is actually supressing supply of capital to the repo market, because THE RISK REWARD IS SHIT.\n\nThe solution to the problem is actually quite simple. There must be a centralized entity so that margins can be analyzed in aggregate and not on an account by account basis. This will allow for much more transparency, and will no so it increase the supply of capital.

Anyone who can enlighten this autist is appreciated (please suggest further books to read too):\n\n> The subprime mortgage scandal was just the scapegoat for the underlying fragility of the eurodollar system.\n\nWowee. So 2008-09 was just a *teaser* to the fundamental solvency crisis coming next.\n\n> the ideal interbank loan system in America, eurodollars can get loaned indefinitely, forever. Eurodollars are paying factory workers, building bridges, and trading as currency. But it's not currency. And because eurodollars are what circulate outside the US, real USD are becoming increasingly rare.\n\nHow the hell does this go okay? It is entirely made up \"currency\", backed by nothing, and with no end to leveraging? Can it always exist, and Eurodollar will always persist (or another substitute), regardless of whatever collapse of global financial system?\n\n> Now, JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back.\n\nDoesn't that leave USD's fate hanging in uncertainty? If bonds get dumped, the price drops and yield rises, making USD attractive and thus USD moons. *But*, if JPM/other PDBs manage to survive the default by finding liquidity somewhere else, USD is probably tanking or staying at level, at best?\n\n> The question then becomes, is the fed willing and able to meet global liquidity demands?\n\nThis is rather terrifying, isn't it? On one hand, as you mention, USD is scarce and it will moon. But if Fed takes on the challenge to *finance global lending* more directly than repo lending, then wouldn't that *collapse* USD due to inflation of USD?\n\nCan Fed really avoid deflation (which seems very steep) by printing USD for the whole world?\n\nDoes this \"Eurodollar\" have any relation with EURUSD?

Saved", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hey u/Joesocktwo great write-up. I just wanted to add a couple of clarifying points, and I had a question for you.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has the inter-bank rate called the Federal Funds (FF) rate. This is the amount of interest banks can charge when they lend to each other to meet temporary liquidity needs. So the FF rate is interest that US banks charge each other, if they are willing to lend to each other.\n\nThere is another interest called the Discount rate. This is the interest that the Federal Reserve charges to any US banks that ask to borrow money from the Fed to meet liquidity needs. This happens sometimes because JPM might deem BAC as a shit bank and they don't wish to lend them any money, at the FF rate anyways. So what happens is BAC goes to the Fed with its tail between its leg and asks for money. Because BAC has been a bad puppy the Fed charges a higher interest rate than the FF rate to give temporary cash to BAC, and hence why the Fed is called the lender of last resort. It's the bank of banks.\n\nNow here comes the Reverse Repo (RR) market. This is a market that behaves exactly like the inter-bank (or overnight) lending market, only it's open to finance related entities and companies that are not \"traditional\" banks and have no access to the inter-bank lending market. The RR market has the exact same interest rate as the FF rate. The Federal Reserve is the lender, and it's basically lending money to non-bank entities that have the collateral to support the loans. The loan terms are very short, usually for 2 weeks. The Feds have to keep the target rate for the RR market to be exactly the same as the FF rate otherwise the intended flow of money doesn't go exactly as the Feds want.\n\nI can tell you spent time researching about this so I will take your word for it when you say US banks have been tangled up as the liquidity providers for foreign banks. Even still though, can you please tell me how you found out that US banks are lending to foreign banks like that now? US banks always had access to unlimited liquidity through the overnight lending program from the Feds before as long as they can post collateral. So I'm trying to connect the dots of how the US banks are only just now lending to foreign banks somehow because of the RR market.

Way back in 2007, part of the problem with the trash collateral, was the banks were able to display it at \"mark to market\" value on their books, so even if you have garbage, as long as no one sells it, you get to mark it down at 100% of what you say it's worth.  That was the reason foreclosures were so slow, as long as you don't sell, there are no losses, amiright????\n\nSo my question is, just how long can they 'mark to market' the garbage collateral?

Fantastic write up by the way. One of the most interesting subjects out there is these shadowy repo operations the fed has been engaged in since late Q3 last year. \n\nMy concern is this: in 2098 no one thought an investment bank could go tits up because prior to that, no IB did go tits up unless it was for criminal behavior. They had never made mistakes so bad that it cost them the firm, until Bear, Lehman, etc. \n\nI understand now that since that time, the banks do not ever want to be put in that situation again, so they’ll do anything they can to avoid that, meanwhile they are also protected because of regulation that forces them to keep more cash on hand, so that they cannot become too insolvent. That’s great and all, but what happens if these operations actually go belly up faster, or with greater severity than originally predicted? \n\nMaybe JPM can afford India not paying them back if they go belly up, but what if 4-5 other countries banks do the same thing because this virus lingers for much longer than initially predicted? Can these banks afford the same kind of exposure to multiple borrowers who are no longer good for the money, because the people in those originating countries are unable to work for prolonged periods of time? \n\nAnd lastly, if nothing else, if the fed keeps cutting rates, don’t we get to a point where the rates are so low that they can’t make any money lending to each other, and if bank to bank lending dries up, obviously retail lending to the public (whether corporations or small business or personal) that would then thus be a credit crunch, and send us into another severe recession?\n\nI’m of the opinion that the reason the financial crisis weighed so heavily on the world was due to the fact that credit dried up overnight. One day everything is fine, the next it is frozen. No one can borrow money anywhere. Mom and pops go tits up, start-ups can’t start up, big corporations like AIG became insolvent, McDonald’s was concerned that they weren’t going to be able to make payroll. When that happens, don’t we have another 2008 + global liquidity crisis on our hands? Only this time, rates are so low that the fed can’t lower them anymore, and they’ve already felt out $1T in repo so they can’t do another massive bank bail out to give them money to lend to get the economy moving again?

{"title": "The next Housing Market Crash will be...", "selftext": "**Cars: GM 01/15/21 $20p .... FCAU 01/15/21 $10P**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the economy seeming entering in to the next recession (or worse), we are all wondering where we can get our money in to become the guy from the Big Short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs noted in the TL;DR at the top for all the autists who can only read TSE, I believe the auto industry will be the next one to crash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is why:\n\nUS households are absolutely jacked with car loans. As stated in this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-auto-loan-debt/), \" Auto loans now make up nearly 10% of all household debt, the third largest debt category behind mortgages and student loans. \" While this may not be that surprising, the point is these things are an extremely heavy burden for individuals. Additionally, cars are a significantly more liquid asset to sell than a home... more on this later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilar to what was observed in the run-up to the housing market crash, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of sub-prime loans for automobiles. You can read about this [here](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/auto-loan-subprime-crisis/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, what we are seeing in the auto industry is the same thing as the housing market: people are taking out way too large of loans they cannot afford.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How does this relate to the current state of the economy?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this being said, we know what happens when an economy is hurled into a recession. Companies layoff employees, debts stop being repaid, and people / businesses begin defaulting on their loans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince people are extremely leveraged on their car loans, any hiccup to their income may cause difficulty in repaying the loan. This will cause millions of car owners to either sell their car or it will get repossessed. Here is the intro to econ level analysis of how this scenario plays out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople lose jobs\n\n...................**This causes demand of used cars to increase**\n\nCan't afford car loan\n\nSell / get car repossessed\n\n...................**This causes supply of used cars to increase**\n\nThe increased supply and increased demand of used cars causes total quantity demanded to increase (rather dramatically, depending on your opinion of the future of the economy).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are only so many cars being sold around the country / world. With the quantity demanded of used cars increasing, the demand for new cars will decrease. As a result, firms such as GM and FCAU may struggle to stay in business, let alone make a profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort GM and FCAU... Also Wells Fargo seems interesting. Also I am stupid don't listen.\n\nEDIT: I keep seeing people bring up TSLA. I am too poor for that. I would assume the same rule applies.
