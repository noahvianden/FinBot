It cannot be as easy as \"they will buy the same tech and batteries\". There are obviously stipulations that prevent this from happening, because if what you say is true where are these equivalent spec vehicles from the legacy automakers?\n\nPanasonic batteries may be made by Panasonic, but they are made with Tesla's patented battery compositions. Those compositions cannot be bought by other automakers because Tesla owns the recipe. For another example, see Mercedes. Their production of electric vehicles was [cut in half](https://electrek-co.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/electrek.co/2020/01/24/mercedes-benz-tesla-acquisition-automation-firm-affected-battery-production/amp/?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15850692205430&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2020%2F01%2F24%2Fmercedes-benz-tesla-acquisition-automation-firm-affected-battery-production%2F) due directly to Tesla's dominance in battery supply.\n\n>politicians of both parties would never allow Boeing, Ford or GM to go bankrupt when millions of people are directly or indirectly employed by them.\n\nYou are absolutely right. The government will bail GM out again as well as give Ford their first bailout (Ford barely scraped by in 2009). Won't people start to question why GM has needed a bailout twice in the past 12 years? Due to the internet, the public is much more involved with company news than they were in 2009, and word will spread that as these legacy automakers get bailed out, the people who hold the stock will be left with two hands full of dogshit just as they were in 2009.\n\nFurthermore, it is no coincidence that as Ford and GM received $16 Billion their stocks increase double digit percentages. It's very likely they used this cash to heavily buy back stocks temporarily inflating the price. This was their one and only bullet to fire.

This is the most encouraging evidence I've seen so far that the \"social distancing\" policies implemented in the US are finally showing a significant benefit. The fact that this is the expected outcome doesn't make it any less welcome.
