{"title": "Reminder to younger investors, it’s going to be okay", "selftext": "I’m a young investor too, and I didn’t see any posts reassuring anyone. Seems we either want to shitpost or panic together, but I think it’s important to just take a second to remind ourselves that everything’s going to be okay.\n\nFirst thing to remember, no one knows what’s going to happen to the market. There’s going to be plenty of people who will divulge wisdom of impending doom. There’s going to be people talking about catching falling knives. There’s going to be people talking about tendies and buying shorts. Ignore all of that shit. Nobody knows.\n\nStick to the fundamentals. You’re young, you have plenty of time, and the best possible thing that can happen for a young investor (whether you just started or you’re a decade in), is to start your journey in a bear market. Fear and uncertainty means cheaper prices. Don’t panic sell; you cannot time the market. Don’t spend all of your cash at once thinking we’ve reached bottom.\n\nThe best thing to do, first off, is to wait out this volatility. Second, once these historical up and down days are over with, begin incrementally investing in this glorious discount sale. Index funds are your friend. I personally like tech. I’m talking a “2% of cash” nibble. Take a nibble all the way down. For all we know, it could be a year, who cares, we have plenty of time and steady jobs to give us cash.\n\nEven if you ignore the last paragraph, at the very least, do not try to time the market. You will lose. Hope this helps someone out there.

Saying HIV is effectively cured is mildly misleading, HIV cannot be cured but simply the viral load can be decreased to where it becomes difficult to detect. If you are non compliant with medication the virus can then begin to rapidly drop your CD4 count.

What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signiicantly faster than the seasonal flu.\n\n>The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[3] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[4] .\n\n>SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[5] . This makes it much more difficult to control.\n\n>Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[6] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[7].\n\n>Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[8] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[9] .\n\n> There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[10] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.\n\n>There is no herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population.

There are three general reasons for any person to sell their shares, and those are:\n\n1. **Meeting a specific goal** \\- For example the age for retirement\n2. **Your investment thesis no longer holds** \\- There's no change in Tesla's long term fundamentals that are endangered because of this. In fact it could get a lot worse, and Tesla would still be fine in the long run. There's even the possibility, that this all is beneficial for Tesla in the end, if oil, other car manufacturers, as well as car dealerships take a hit.\n3. **Personal emergency** \\- This one is self explanatory.\n\nSelling shares to buy back later is a bad decision for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Market tends to eliminate anomalous gains** \\- At any point of time you can't predict the market movements. This is in fact a quite fundamental part of the stock market, because if there was generally available information, that would yield you better than average results, the market would balance itself in such way, that those advantages vanish. This means essentially, that unless you are trading with algorithms, you are never in a position, where there would be positive expected value for selling shares to buy back later. If you profit from such activity, consider yourself a gambler, and never repeat it again, because in the long run this will lose you money. *(This is not implying efficient-market hypothesis. You can beat the market by maximizing expected value, by being rational when others are emotional, and by utilizing information in such a way that it isn't considered \"generally available\" anymore).*\n2. **Taxes and trading fees** \\- On top of having a bad expected value due to market's tendency to eliminate potential gains from generally available information, you'll lower the expected value even more by paying potential taxes, and trading fees. If you are obligated to pay taxes from your profits, and you have profited a significant amount, selling to buy back has a rigged expected value (in this case the casino is the government, and the brokerage).\n3. **Human biases** \\- The human brain isn't a computer. Any decisions involving even the slightest influence of emotion, subconscious bias, or intuition, have very bad expected values, and can be considered gambling. Usually selling to buy back later involves the feeling of fear, and imperfectly processed information.\n\nA good investing strategy involves always maximizing the expected value of your decisions. This way when the number of decisions approach infinity, the average outcome approaches the average of the expected values of your decisions (the law of large numbers). Always make a payoff matrix for your decisions, and be self critical. We humans have this tendency called *confirmation bias*, which makes us overlook information, that could challenge our intuition, and the view of the world. Even if you were certain, that something is true, doesn't mean that it's a valid assumption. Find the first principles that are behind the concept you're analyzing, and work from that basis.\n\nThis turned into a manifesto of my investing philosophy, which I apologize for.

There are three general reasons for any person to sell their shares, and those are:\n\n1. **Meeting a specific goal** \\- For example the age for retirement\n2. **Your investment thesis no longer holds** \\- There's no change in Tesla's long term fundamentals that are endangered because of this. In fact it could get a lot worse, and Tesla would still be fine in the long run. There's even the possibility, that this all is beneficial for Tesla in the end, if oil, other car manufacturers, as well as car dealerships take a hit.\n3. **Personal emergency** \\- This one is self explanatory.\n\nSelling shares to buy back later is a bad decision for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Market tends to eliminate anomalous gains** \\- At any point of time you can't predict the market movements. This is in fact a quite fundamental part of the stock market, because if there was generally available information, that would yield you better than average results, the market would balance itself in such way, that those advantages vanish. This means essentially, that unless you are trading with algorithms, you are never in a position, where there would be positive expected value for selling shares to buy back later. If you profit from such activity, consider yourself a gambler, and never repeat it again, because in the long run this will lose you money. *(This is not implying efficient-market hypothesis. You can beat the market by maximizing expected value, by being rational when others are emotional, and by utilizing information in such a way that it isn't considered \"generally available\" anymore).*\n2. **Taxes and trading fees** \\- On top of having a bad expected value due to market's tendency to eliminate potential gains from generally available information, you'll lower the expected value even more by paying potential taxes, and trading fees. If you are obligated to pay taxes from your profits, and you have profited a significant amount, selling to buy back has a rigged expected value (in this case the casino is the government, and the brokerage).\n3. **Human biases** \\- The human brain isn't a computer. Any decisions involving even the slightest influence of emotion, subconscious bias, or intuition, have very bad expected values, and can be considered gambling. Usually selling to buy back later involves the feeling of fear, and imperfectly processed information.\n\nA good investing strategy involves always maximizing the expected value of your decisions. This way when the number of decisions approach infinity, the average outcome approaches the average of the expected values of your decisions (the law of large numbers). Always make a payoff matrix for your decisions, and be self critical. We humans have this tendency called *confirmation bias*, which makes us overlook information, that could challenge our intuition, and the view of the world. Even if you were certain, that something is true, doesn't mean that it's a valid assumption. Find the first principles that are behind the concept you're analyzing, and work from that basis.\n\nThis turned into a manifesto of my investing philosophy, which I apologize for.
