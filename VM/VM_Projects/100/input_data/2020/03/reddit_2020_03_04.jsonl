{"title": "Bearish rant", "selftext": "Not sure why there are 66% downvotes. I put serious time and though into this and trying to bring some rationality to the conversation. Someone tell me how many gigafactories you think Tesla can realistically build in the coming day.. 4 years? 4? 5? 13? The last number would be necessary to reach ARKs bull case. Is that plausible to anyone? If you include red tape, slower than Shanghai construction speed, ramping up and so on...\n\nFirst off, I want you to believe me; I am a Tesla bull in the long run, they WILL be one of the major players and I am doing everything I can to be able to buy one as soon as possible and I haven’t even sat in one! I love this company but people are just blinded by so many things. \n\nPeople also talk about FSD as if that will generate billions in pure profits every quarter almost indefinitely. No. They might get a few billions in sweet profits before other manufacturers get up to speed This is software, catching up is faster. Even nvidia hardware will be enough for necessary processing in a few years (or now? More hz might not be a dealbreaker? I don’t know), the fact that Tesla’s is better will be a moot point in just a few years. FSD will become standard and margins will disappear, it’s inevitable.\n\nAlso, most are accounting for slightly lower-than-Uber cost for taking an eventual Tesla taxi. How will that work out once you have a “safe” investment that prints free money? The markets will correct that with more supply and again; the margins are gone and the value of the car will depreciate below purchase price albeit at a slower rate than an ICE vehicle.\n\nAnother thing on their amazing data-lead that helps them with their FSD-algorithms: if Toyota decides to go all in they could fairly cheaply install cameras in ALL their newly produced cars along with a unit that sends the info back to their servers. In one year they would have 5x Tesla’s total fleet of cars out there collecting data. I even expect major car companies would cooperate and share the data among eachother (for a price) and that advantage Tesla has is not only gone: it would be surpassed way faster than anyone seem to understand. After that their algorithms (which WILL evolve closer to parity by then) will churn through that data.\n\nAnd don’t get me started on the regulatory issues with the Tesla fleet. The latest beat down might be unfair but it should warn you: these things takes time! The crash was in 2018 and you just got a statement, congressional hearings, partisanship and the Washington grind tells me 2-3 years is plausible but optimistic for a comprehensive set of laws. I am expecting them to be first and “win the race” but they have chosen a path to build their own capacity. It’s not like Apple in that way that could turn to Foxconn and have them starting to churn out millions of phones in “no time”. Sorry, that was a tangent.\n\nRegarding production capacity; Tesla has announced 5-7b in capex spending over two years which is awesome (2,5-3,5 annually). Giga Berlin is expected to cost $4,4b and produce 500k/year with possible extension to 750 according to some flaky waterpermit. That however requires further capex. Shanghai is estimated at around $3b. Those two combined will produce about a million cars by 2023. Add two more and you are likely around 2,5 (with Fremont included. That would put them 700/yr below the most bearish case of ARK invests lowest estimate by 2024. And that is during a phase of what Elon said “we can’t spend money fast enough”. Ark is talking about 7m/year in their bull case... the demand might be there but even that is unlikely with the premium price point. Either way, production capacity can’t physically expand that much unless they introduce a plan tomorrow to build 12 gigafactories in the coming three years (...2,5 if you account for time to ramp up production). So no, those who think it’s “just about ramping up” don’t understand the process. Even red tape would make that impossible. \n\nAdd to that the need to expand battery capacity for all those cars, semis, grid storage, power walls, solapanels... they have way more potential than they can meet and others will push to compete way more than they have. Tesla’s bottlenecks will buy the competition the time to catch up and become good enough to retain most of their market share.\n\nI do think that their upcoming battery tech will yet again put them years ahead of the competition and they won’t be able to meet demand. They are amazing and their tech is second to none. But the competition is coming (I know, you laugh but it’s still true. They are getting their asses kicked and their shareholders will force them to change. They probably all ready are)\n\nSo chill down, Tesla is the best and will remain so but be realistic.\n\nSorry for the long rant...", "id": "fdg1rb", "created_utc": 1583341533.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "I agree with you about remaining realistic I think that's a good point.\n\nI am bearish on robotaxis for sure and I agree about regulatory hurdles.\n\nHowever I think \"competition is coming\" is overplayed a lot. Imo if robotaxis work then the worlds 80m passenger vehicle fleet will all convert to it with electric drivertrains so Tesla only needs 10% of that in order to sell 8m vehicles per year. There's room for 10 or 20 competing systems in a market like that. \n\nMoreover you say that Toyota can just put sensors on their cars. The min cost for that would be $1k per vehicle with the computer and the cell connection and the servers to receive the data. So that would be a $10bn per year program, not exactly cheap or easy.\n\nSecondly re ramping you're assuming no improvement in manufacturing processes. We are about to see battery and powertrain day where they make a massive leap forwards on batteries and the ability to scale them. With less batteries needed per car and more produced this means they can loosen that bottleneck.\n\nI agree 7m vehicles in 2024 is a bit ridiculous.

By then the legacy automakers will be “good enough” to start retaking market share from what is arguably a oremiun brand.\n\n10% is reasonable I think but not in five years. Some 8m cars annually would require 14+ gigafactories and their forward guidance might talk about 50% growth for years to come but that would require them to begin applying for 3-5gigafactory permits annually deoending in how fast they can ramp production. That’s not in the plausible realm. Supply chain issues will start popping up as well as they will be growing so fast at the same time other brands want to do the same in the same areas (precious metals and so on). There are so many issues with scaling that fast that no one seems to consider. 50% from 300k/yr is “EasyPark compared to the next 50%. \n\nAt the same time I want to acknowledge the insane efficacy of their factory construction. No one can do it like they can. But it’s still not feasalbe even if you assume Shanghai speed for each factory (which is completely unreasonable in western nations).\n\nThe battery capacity bottle neck I assume will be completely worked out in some five years and I assume they will keep their lead there. I’m focused on bottle necks related to production of the cars. And yes, new stamping techniques will pace even that up and they will keep a lead in efficacy. But it’s on the margins and won’t push Tesla from 300k+ in 2019 to say 3000k in 2024. Even 50% growth will only get then to less than 2m cars in 2024 and slightly above in 2025.

There is no way that VW investors would let that happen unless VW owned a significant stake in the company they are partnering with, and at this point, I don't think their 35 billion war chest for electrification and autonomy is enough to buy that stake. \n\nRegarding how fast they can build more gigafactories, GM has just said that the conversion of their existing Hammtramk plant is going to take 18+ months, cost 2 billion dollars, and result in a plant capacity of 100,000 vehicles. Given that Tesla's Giga Shanghai was built from scratch in 12 months for the same price, I feel like Tesla's capability to ramp is at at least equal to their competitions ability to change over production.  What they have to say in their Q1 financials about the cost of the model Y production line in Freemont, and how quickly Giga Berlin gets built over the next few quarters, will provide a lot more information about what might be possible in the next 5 years... if model Y lines are less expensive than expected and ramp quickly, and demand is high, Tesla should easily be able to raise money to build as many lines as they want globally, probably with significant government support from whatever location they decide to build in.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Agree re govt support, people are not realising that subsidies are going to increase, not decrease, as the world realises the scale of the problem of climate change.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "> google will most likely be there to license their knowledge for an amazing price tag by then.\n\nOnce Waymo's tech is roll-out ready, it will still take a full production cycle before it's integrated into new models.

Gigafactories can produce 50 gWh/year already. With Tesla's improvements in batteries coming (to be announced on Battery Day), each gigafactory could produce even more than that. So Tesla may not need as many gigafactories as you think to meet the terawatt hours of energy production that Elon said they need to hit.\n\nYou can be skeptical of the plan, that's reasonable, but Elon says they very much have a plan for achieving multiple terawatt hours per year.

Who do you see as major competitors? What vehicles, specifically? When do you expect these vehicles to hit the market? When will they achieve volume?\n\nYou scoff at the idea of Tesla building more gigafactories.

He has shown time over time, that he is capable of leading his ventures through the realms of what truly is possible. If something can be done, Elon does it. This is grounded deep in his way of thinking (the first principles thinking), which allows one to think past their subjective frame.\n\nThe phenomenon is quite similar to what happens in the world of sports.

They also need to be able to access the best talent the global markets have to offer. Also I don't think Tesla's advancement will just slow down as the competition starts to catch up. Their tech will most likely stay the most reliable and advanced, even after there are other agents who have reached full autonomy.\n\nTesla has also strategic advantages in many ways, that can be difficult for competitors to achieve. For example their network of superchargers, no advertising costs (more money goes to improve the products themselves), cult-like following similar to Apple, and a rock star CEO. Their involvement in home energy storage, and insurance are also things that make Tesla a go to option compared to rivals.\n\nUnless something very drastic happens to Tesla, I don't see them being anything but the number one agent in what they do.

On the one hand the big companies (especially Euro and Japanese) are developing technology to roll out as safety systems, on the other hand Tesla are pushing FSD development.

Maybe “a list of some ways I disagree with the most optimistic Tesla forecasts?\n\nI partly or completely agree with some of your points, and disagree with others. For example, I think you did a pretty good job of taking a snapshot of how Tesla has performed recently and extrapolating it into the future, but I don’t think that is what Elon is planning. You seem to assume a certain number of vehicles per year per gigafactory (in the sense that it will take this many gigafactories to produce this many cars). But remember that Elon dreamed of an “alien dreadnought” factory where the machines work so fast that all a human would see is a blur unless they use a strobe light to freeze the motion. Elon supposedly gave up on that and said humans were needed to do much of the work – but since then they’ve gradually increased the automation, reassigning the humans to new tasks. I expect the main thing limiting Tesla’s ability to build factories is not the ability to borrow money and put up buildings, but the reluctance to build new factories that are still far from what they want the factories to be. At first (and Elon mentioned this ~2018), the greatest gain could be obtained by working to optimize the Fremont and Nevada factories. Tesla is still working to optimize the factories and increase production per factory, but more recently the tremendous benefits to be gained by putting a factory in Asia and one in Europe (in terms of tariffs and other trade issues and transportation logistics) became the dominating factor, and Tesla has built the factory in Shanghai and started the one near Berlin. But note that these so far have not involved public plans for further sites in Asia and Europe, but instead continued expansion and improvement of the Shanghai and Berlin factories. It’s only very recently that Elon has hinted of building another gigafactory in the US (Texas). This may be a hint that the maturity of the factory design is sufficiently advanced that Tesla is now more comfortable with the idea of building more factories for something other than transportation or trade incentives. If this is true, then they could start building new factories far faster than they have been, possibly financed largely by local loans (like the Shanghai factory).\n\n> red tape, slower than Shanghai construction speed\n\nMany locations have been anxious to host a Tesla factory, not just for the direct economic benefit (e.g. jobs, tax revenue), but also for the prestige and the prospect of attracting other companies. And in their site search in Europe, Tesla made it clear that minimizing time to start and completion of construction were major selection factors. That doesn’t make red tape go away, but it makes local officials eager to facilitate the process in every way they reasonably can. And having started with Shanghai sets an example for construction speed that others will strive to meet as a matter of pride.\n\n> People also talk about FSD as if that will generate billions in pure profits every quarter almost indefinitely. No.\n\nI’m inclined to think that eventual competition will come from other Tesla owners more than from competing companies. Either rates will go down, or only a limited number of people will be able to participate in the Tesla Network. There will also be large low population density areas where individual ownership makes more sense than Tesla-owned robotaxis.\n\n> Even nvidia hardware will be enough for necessary processing in a few years\n\nComparable processing power is already available. But Tesla’s costs much less and uses much less electric power. And Tesla is working on another generation beyond hardware 3 so they will continue to lead.\n\n> Another thing on their amazing data-lead that helps them with their FSD-algorithms: if Toyota decides to go all in they could fairly cheaply install cameras in ALL their newly produced cars … In one year they would have 5x Tesla’s total fleet of cars out there collecting data... After that their algorithms (which WILL evolve closer to parity by then) will churn through that data.\n\nI think you enormously underestimate the work involved to usefully process that data and to convert it into teaching material to train the neural net. Much of what Tesla collects is selected by the onboard computer to meet certain criteria to train for given “corner cases”, and recording of incidents where the self-driving system chose one course of action and the driver overrode (or differences between driver actions and what the system would have done when in shadow mode). Tesla is also implementing steps to greatly increase the speed of creating training material. The Tesla team has worked for years on their approach, and continues to work hard – they are likely to maintain their lead.\n\nA major difference between Tesla and taxi systems like Uber and Waymo: Tesla can make money during the development process as drivers enjoy the increasingly useful FSD features in their vehicles and more people pay for FSD, while the other companies have to wait until their systems are essentially completed before realizing significant revenue. In the Q4 2019 earnings call, Elon said it would make sense to start up the Tesla Network even before level 5 – Tesla owners can provide rides while lightly supervising their level 4 autonomous vehicles.\n\n> And don’t get me started on the regulatory issues with the Tesla fleet.\n\nGovernment agencies have in general been very supportive of the development of autonomous driving systems, because they know that in the long run that will save many lives, and they are not insisting on perfection before such vehicles are allowed to operate. Some states are considerably more supportive of FSD than others, and if it works well in those states then other states will be encouraged to allow it too.\n\n> …Elon said “we can’t spend money fast enough”\n\nAgain, Tesla still has great opportunity for improvement in speed and cost of production in their factories. And once they have the factory design dialed in to their satisfaction, I expect that we will be astonished at how much faster they can raise funds / borrow / build. Elon said Tesla would like to get to 20 million vehicles per year.\n\nElon has emphasized that speed of innovation is by far the best moat. Elon and his great team have been working for years innovating as fast as they can, and have a huge lead, as shown by the recent stumbles of so many “Tesla killers”. And unlike the expectations of so many people who say it’s just a matter of competitors catching up, Tesla’s goal is to continue to accelerate, to continue to increase their lead.\n\nNote that I do not endorse a specific timeline for development of FSD good enough to support robot taxis. Some of the greatest challenges for level 5 autonomy involve “negotiated” interactions between the autonomous vehicle and people or other vehicles, as discussed in the recent Tesla Daily interview of Pierre Ferragu – for example being pulled over by a police officer, or one vehicle signaling that it is yielding right of way to another vehicle. I expect that Tesla will have really nice non-geofenced level 4 ahead of its competitors, and both Tesla and the drivers will benefit from greater safety and more pleasant driving. Even when level 5 is achieved, it will not be a binary value – continued improvement will continue to make the vehicles safer and more pleasant to ride in, and Tesla’s rapid pace of development will continue to provide an advantage to Tesla.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Tesla is the best and will remain so but be realistic.\n\nTesla is the best what?\n\nI think it it useful in investing discussions to separate out the product from the company.

It's current debt holdings stand at $1.15trillion. Its GDP is around $5.3trillion dollars. Its last GDP report showed negative GDP growth and if it gets another report of negative growth - its called a recession for Japan at that point.\n\n\nWith China being under lockdown still, global trade slowing down, yields going down and Japan on the brink of a recession.

Reading a book on the 1997 Asian financial crisis now.  During post-WWII all the way up to the 80s Japan was the economic powerhouse of Asia.  They lent out money all across the continent.  Right after the Plaza Accords, you also had a massive asset bubble fueled by almost unlimited amounts of credit and shit tons of speculation.  At one point, small parcels of land in Tokyo alone were worth more than the entire state of California.  It truly looked like Japan would wipe the floor with America (who was stagnant around then), and the Japanese GDP was even greater than the US GDP at one point IIRC.  But what happens to every bubble?  It pops.\n\nA short while after the Plaza Accords, the Yen started to strengthen against the dollar.  Japan was largely driven by exports, and the economy tanked due to a strong Yen around 91-92. And what happened to all of that credit banks were lending out to people to buy massively overpriced real estate that they could no longer pay?  Banks had HUGE losses on their books. \n\nBut the banks were able to hide it for a long time.  During the 1997 Asian crisis it was revealed that financial industry interests would routinely bribe Japanese Ministry of Finance bureaucrats with kickbacks etc.  MoF 'crats eneded up becoming infamous for their affinity for *no-pan shabu shabu* restaurants, dining checks at such fine establishments paid for of course by the banks' interests.  In exchange, the banks were able to get information on when the MoF was planning on conducting an audit. This allowed the banks to hide massive amounts of bad debt from regulators for years...until the 97 financial crisis hit.  \n\nWhen the crisis hit, it was eventually discovered that Japanese banks were hiding almost $1 trillion in bad debt that accumulated when the asset bubble that popped.  Japan's entire banking system almost collapsed. Some of Japan's most famous financial firms ceased to exist once the crisis hit. It required huge bailouts, caused a massive scandal that led to lots of jail time and suicides for MoF 'crats, and an even more prolonged recession that lasted into the 2000s.  \n\nEveryone thinks the Japanese are straight as arrow honest. They're just as dirty as everyone else. I mean it is a society where the mafia digs up dirt on company CEOs, they send a poison pill to an investor meeting, and the poison pill asks all sorts of embarrassing questions to skewer the CEO in public.  Don't want the mafia to disrupt your investor day?  Gotta pay a little fee.  \n\nBut that's how Japan got into so much debt. And they have never really recovered well since, plus they have a huge demographic time bomb.\n\nThere are many more aspects about the financial crisis, and japans seeming inability to go anywhere, but they're too many to mention.

{"title": "Theta gang ain't shit.", "selftext": "Now's a good time for to get a lesson in the greeks you fucking retards. This document outlines the relative risks and rewards of certain trading strategies and how to manage risks along with some basic math and econ. This should be basic for most of you.\n\n**Why do stocks go up?**\n\n[Because capital growth has a diminishing returns to scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model). In the long run capital is used to create more capital generating growth until it balances with capital depreciation which is linear. You can increase the equilibrium capital accumulation by increasing savings rates essentially trading off short run consumption for long run consumption. The implications of this are that less capital intensive economies grow at faster rates than developed because developed economies are very close to hitting the equilibrium point and have to rely on technological advancements for long run growth. Not every economy is equal though, all have differences in economic institutions, government effectiveness and political norms which will also affect their long run effectiveness. Long story short if the government engages in ineffective policies like protectionism, price manipulation, overly burdensome regulations, underregulation, or inefficient redistribution programs the short run micro/macro picture will be hurt and reflected in the long run picture. The US has had a thriving stock market despite having relatively low growth because it has taken the first mover advantage in many industries. Global Tech, higher education, finance, and pharma are all centered in the US because the US policies have made doing business in the US the optimal choice for these industries. For as long as the US is a capitalist nation you can be sure that the stock market will go up in the long run. This is not necessarily the case for commodities or forex as higher growth has typically led to investments in productive efficiency outweighing increased demand in raw materials and exchange rates do not have a long run trend. Fundamentally, the stock market is a good place to invest savings into in the long run.\n\n**Stocks and exponential returns.**\n\nStocks go up so you want to capture the value of price increases. Stocks have a delta of one and a gamma of zero resulting in a linear return to movement of the stock price. Long run capital accumulation, although diminishing, is still exponential and in the long run will return an exponentially increasing return to investment on stock. Linear gains * exponential increase in underlying = exponential gains. But what if things go down? In the short run stocks decrease in value at exponential rates which is absolutely fantastic for investors because exponential declines are diminishing in scale. 10% of 100 is 10, 10% of 90 is 9, 10% of 81 is less and so on and so forth. You may get linear returns from movement but you receive increasing returns to scale gains on the upside and decreasing returns to scale losses on the downside.\n\n**Delta and Gamma**\n\nLong options have even better fundamentals than stocks because they amplify the exponentiality through gamma. As an option moves into the money its delta increases creating exponential gains in value. As an option moves out of the money delta decreases, lowering losses. Thus options while having more risk per dollar than stocks have far superior risk returns in the short run.\n\n**Theta and Vega**\n\nThe opposite is true of selling a call and you're put into the position of wanting to sell when times are most dire and hold when times are good. In exchange you get benefit from theta decay but if you can reasonably predict the movement of the market that's pretty much nothing compared to the gains from delta you could get investing the same amount of money into long calls. Selling also requires way more money further reducing its risk to return. But what about vega? When markets crash, volatility skyrockets. Long calls gain and the opposite is true once again for selling them.\n\nMathematically, buying longs has the best return on risk of any option strategy but higher absolute losses when delta doesn't move in your favor. Selling longs or spreads has a way worse return to risk but you'll lose less money when delta moves against you and it's harder for any one position to lose all of its value.\n\nTheta gang isn't more profitable than bullgang, it's less risky per dollar spent. The reason market makers don't play like WSB retards is because they play on margin and the 20-30% losses we typically take and make back buying longs would cause their investors to flee bankrupting them.\n\n**Strategy implications**\n\n**Longs**\n\n* If you can reasonably predict positive price movement these should be your go to position to capture delta and gamma. Otm has better delta to price but comes at the cost of worse theta to price. I recommend getting slightly OTM options to balance collecting gamma with exposure to theta risk.\n* Optimal position size: The total size of spy correlated longs should not exceed 25-50% of your account balance.\nOnly double down on a losing position if your longs get blown up. Your risk return from delta gets better the more blown up your contracts get and exponential gains can bring you back to green.\n* When to sell? Sell when you think there's a chance risk from theta or vega might outweigh delta gains. Also sell when the underlying moves against you but that should be obvious. Delta goes up the more you go into the money so its better to hold winners than profit take early when possible.\n* Profit taking: If you don't want bail from a position completely when you profit take consider selling a call to lock in most of your profits while retaining some delta risk with a debt spread.\n* You will take losses buying tons of longs but if you do it right your winners will outweigh your losers easily.\n\n**Selling naked longs**\n\n* If you're doing wheel, go for it. Selling naked longs shouldn't be done otherwise unless you want to park your cash somewhere and bond yields are too long for your liking or you anticipate a IV decrease. The tradeoff is receiving gains from theta, smaller delta per dollar spent(lower risk) and less options leverage.\n\n**Credit spreads**\n\n* ~~For all intents and purposes OTM credit spreads are like selling naked with more leverage.~~\n* Edit: The prior statement was kinda wrong. Selling a wide credit spread is like selling a long. There's still a tradeoff with reduced gains from theta and reduced delta.\n\n**Debit spreads**\n\n* When deciding between debt or credit make a prediction about whether IV will increase or decrease and whether you want risk up front or later.\n* Absolutely do not buy OTM debit spreads in any situation where you wouldn't buy the same position as a credit spread. Compared to a long call you're reducing your delta and vega in exchange for the possibility of theta gains as you reach the short leg of your spread. If you actually managed to reach the short leg of your debt spread before expiration a long call would have made many times more money and now you're stuck sitting on your debt spread waiting for theta to decay it to its maximum value at expiration. Every youtube resource I've seen on debt spread pricing is wrong, if your spread goes completely in the money you will not have something worth max value, you will have something that decays towards max value akin to a close to the money credit spread.\n* The best usage for OTM debt spreads is as hedges where you think the price will reach a certain point at some specific point in the future and you're worried about adverse movements in delta or IV between now and then.\n\n\nEdit: For what to do with your cash position, you could put it into gold, bonds, bond etfs, non spy correlated stocks or whatever.

{"title": "Impact of the Coronavirus (COVID19). Be Safe, life is more important than money.", "selftext": "I had been doing lots of research since early January about this epidemic and thought I should share some findings. Firstly, I always believe that when a government tries to cover up something, it usually mean the situation is way worse than we can imagine. If it is only a little horrible, the government can say, “It is very bad but we can still fix it, that’s why we are telling you the truth.”. But if the government tries to cover up, it usually means the truth is beyond horrible and there is no way for them to be transparent about it. And that is usually when I am really worried.\n\nHere are some facts from the more transparent countries. For those who don’t know, the following charts (credits to Braydo25) shows exponential growth in the number of infected people. For people who don’t understand the power of exponential growth, if you have a dollar on the first day, and it doubles each day, you would have more money than the entire world combined in less than 2 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3bczy8qflk41.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=11a6ee6c63cc869a3459e52b013c245b297c8f3d\n \nAnd this is the number of critical patients whom will need ventilators to help them breath when the virus took over their lungs. Combine this with the exponential growth of the infected, one can’t help but come to the conclusion that the healthcare system is going to be overwhelmed by the number of patients coming in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdi18nzpglk41.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=0131cb562001baaf2b3aa5fd551f33c119e652d5\n \nIf it is growing exponentially, then why is China and Iran telling the entire world that everything is good and dandy? And this is the part where government cover up is in play. Do you remember the few whistleblowers of the coronavirus situation? 2 of the doctors are dead and 2 of the journalists whistleblowers had been arrested and never heard from again.\n\nSource: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\n\nSource: https://nypost.com/2020/03/03/chinese-doctor-who-worked-with-late-whistleblower-dead-from-coronavirus/\n\nSource: https://qz.com/1801361/wuhan-virus-citizen-journalists-fang-bin-chen-qiushi-go-missing/\n\nIran is another country trying to play down the numbers. If one is willing to look for it, there are videos of mass graves being dig in Iran right now (Source: https://en.radiofarda.com/a/lawmaker-in-iran-dismisses-official-coronavirus-death-toll/30460224.html ). In fact, 8% of Iran's parliament has tested positive for coronavirus. Source: https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/h_13306122baecfcaa123a7ca59478d0d6\n\nWhat is the percentage of parliament people to the total population of Iran? That may give you a clue as to the actual cases in the country so if you see Iran only reporting 2000 cases in a country of 81 million people, take it with a grain of salt. If Iran only reported 20 people dying from the coronavirus but they are digging mass graves for the bodies, then it is really suspicious\n.\nLike I said, if the government is trying to cover up, it simply means the truth is beyond your imagination and they are not able to be transparent about it.\n\nTLDR: The world is not only going into a recession, but the healthcare system may be overwhelmed during this epidemic. Governments are trying to coverup because the situation is so much worse than you can imagine.

Up until now, the only time that patients were even tested for the virus is if they're in a HOSPITAL with a FEVER.. that means you could be walking into the doctor with a cough, runny nose, and sore throat, and they wouldn't even bust out the test kits. Let that sink in. This explains why the death rate for corona cases in USA is way higher than the average for other developed countries (\\~7% vs \\~2%). the US was only testing severe cases, which supports the story a supposed patient posted in the /r/coronavirus sub a few days ago, claiming they were sent home untested despite showing symptoms.\n\nThe US saw the first community transmission case a WEEK ago - since then we've had potentially contagious people being sent home untested. The old testing criteria probably damaged containment efforts, and the new testing criteria is going to cause an enormous spike in reported cases, guaranteed. We all saw how markets reacted when Italy reported a sudden spike in cases on Feb 22.. \n\nStill not convinced this is a problem? This virus is more contagious, and more deadly than seasonal flu's. Here's how the COVID-19 outbreak compares to similar epidemics in recent history. SARS, 2003 and MERS, 2012, the biologically most closely related viruses were not nearly as contagious and had almost no cases in the USA. We saw no disruption in daily lives. Now consider the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. Over 43,000 confirmed cases and over 1,200 deaths in the USA. Much more contagious/widespread than SARS/MERS with a similar death rate. Yet none of the above viruses had any negative impact on the markets. Basically, the flu is also less contagious than COVID-19. The average person with flu infects 1.3 other people, while beer virus infects 2.2. This is because a lot of people already have a naturally built up immunity to a lot of strains of the flu, while no one is immune to corona. \n\nCombine this with the fact that there is no vaccine in sight for the next year, you're gonna see some shit. During a calm year, the flu has some 10 million cases in the USA. If corona reaches even this level, we'll see deaths in the six figures. Hence the (failing) scramble to contain. Some people are speculating that the virus will go away with warmer weather, but both SARS and MERS flourished in the summer months, so good luck. \n\nAnd unlike the first death over the weekend, or the rate cut, a sudden spike in cases is not priced in. People were expecting a red Monday just because someone died over the weekend? The US had more than 60 cases at that point. With a death rate of some 2.5%, a death was highly probably. After today's rally the S&P 500 is less than 9% below its all-time-high. Plus, if technicals are any indication, this back and fourth volatility is all the more reason to suspect we haven't hit the bottom.\n\nTLDR; Hope you're using these green days to buy cheap puts.

Off the top of my head:\n\n* Fed repo operations have been going on for a while and are becoming oversubscribed as of this week\n* 2/10 bond yield curve inverted last August, average time until a recession is 22 months afterwards\n* 10y bond yield hit all time low this week\n* interest rate cuts late last year (or was it early this year?) for the first time since 2008\n* emergency interest rate cut yesterday for the first time since 2008\n* interest rates are historically low right now and cutting might not be as effective as previously\n* markets have been known to be overvalued for a while now, I believe it's based on CAPE ratio\n* auto loans are now extended out to 72ish months for Americans to be able to afford them\n* passive investing has been theorized to cause overvaluation in its component companies\n* longest bull market ever, with a president that will do anything to make stocks go up\n* record number of IPO's in 2019, with a shitload of unprofitable companies\n* the entire WeWork saga\n\nSome of the points above might not be 100% accurate, but it's just what I remember in the news, or similar stories. It just seems like there's tons of warning signs. But it also felt like we were hitting the top around 2017 too - had I jumped out there, I would've missed on tons of gains.\n\nAnd look at all the other shit that you see around you. \"Instagram Influencer\" is now a legitimate job title. Doordash, a company that delivers food to your door, for fucks sake, is worth billions.

NO, because had it the potential to do so it would have demonstrated TO SOME SORT OF ANY DEGREE; for several weeks the only observed, real, undeniable facts in the US include an absolute minimal, almost negligible (with regard to a virus) count of cases, of which ALL were either extremely minor in virulence, or completely asymptomatic, or only caused the types of ‘promised’ complications among at-risk elderly during the time of the year that illness is at its worst.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">You say we’re about to see it fucking explode\n\nliterally never once said that. do i think it's possible? yes, just like you do. i was merely pointing out your point is retarded, and it still is even after reading this.\n\n> I’m saying that even within limited time of outbreak it has shown extremely insufficient evidence to support any notion of being capable of a sudden explosion\n\nabout a month back china reported 16K new cases in one day, so that's false. i also think sk and italy's growth in a matter of a week is extreme.\n\n>there SHOULD by all accounts, be MANY clear-cut cases of coronavirus demonstrating undeniable biological harm to anyone that is not elderly and at-risk during winter/flu season\n\nthere is, many 25-40 year olds in good health and no prior health problems have died purely because of the virus. especially the doctors treating it. \n\nyou also mention asymptomatic cases several times without realizing the virus can spread while being asymptomatic. the cdc said it doesn't if i recall correctly, but china and sk have observed this as well as people being reinfected upon being cleared of the virus. that's a major fucking problem and will increase the likelihood of it spreading without anyone knowing. \n\ndo i think this is the end times virus? no. do i think you're really underselling it? without a fucking doubt. \n\nalso, it's almost 10ET. why the fuck are you doing addy now, and why the fuck aren't you sending me one?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "LMAO! What, so everyone’s supposed to sleep every single night now?
