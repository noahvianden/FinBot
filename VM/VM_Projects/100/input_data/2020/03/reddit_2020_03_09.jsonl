{"title": "Prediction for the coming week, plays included.", "selftext": "This week has the appearance of being an absolute bloodbath. However I believe it will create a possible opportunity for short term options plays. As of 8:50 PM, it appears that the dow will open down by about 11-1200 points. This will likely cause panic and possible intervention from the federal reserve. This intervention will likely consist of a further rate drop of about .5-.75 basis points and controls on shorts. (Based on reactions to the ‘08 crisis) If tomorrow or Tuesday leads to rumors of a possible meeting by the fed, I would suggest picking up ITM calls on XLF and or XLK with an expiration of March 20th. I would highly recommend dumping these on Friday. In addition, should news come that rates will be cut and the markets rise, I will be purchasing XLF and XLK puts to be held into Monday. \n\nI am curious about this subreddits moves for the next week and possible issues that people may have with my moves.", "id": "ffmfpx", "created_utc": 1583715239.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Another cut already?

When closing my position to extend I'm \"selling to close\", taking my losses as the \"credit\" to open a later position?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Rolling a position is just a fancy way of saying that you're closing one position and opening a new one.  When you close a long position, there's no need to open a later position unless you want to, but you'll need to probably add more money to do so.  You'd typically think of the profit or loss simply as what happened for each transaction individually though.\n\nShort positions are a bit different.  If you're in a losing position, you can often close that position and open another one at the same or better strike at a later expiration for more credit.  It's still two separate trades, but the overall P/L is typically tracked over the entire history.\n\nSo think of it this way.  You buy a lottery ticket for 10 bucks.  You win a dollar.  If you want to buy another lottery ticket for the next drawing, you have to add 9 more dollars to your 'winnings'.  Or you can choose to keep your dollar and stop playing.  Now imagine you're the lottery authority.  Someone buys the 10 dollar ticket that you're selling and they win $1000.  You're at a loss right now, but you are going to sell more tickets for the exact same lottery next week.  If nobody wins next week, then your at less of a loss.  You're only a loss overall if you stop having weekly lotteries before you've recouped the $990 you lost the first week.  Now, the risk is that you could sell tickets and have back to back winners and you'd be at an even bigger loss.\n\nSo let's put this in practical terms.  You buy a call for a premium of $10 with an expiration in 45 days.  In 30 days, the stock hasn't moved, and your call is worth $2 dollars due to theta decay.  You decide to sell the call and get your remaining $2 back.  You think your original thesis is still sound, so you want to open another position for a later date at the same strike.  You find one 45 days out that's selling for $10, so you need to add 8 more dollars to your remaining 2.  That's an additional debit to you in order to 'roll' that position out to a later expiration.\n\nNow on the other side, if instead of buying a $10 option, you sold a $10 option then you'd have opened a short position.  So you collect 10 bucks immediately.  After 30 days, the stock has moved in price by a bit, and the option you sold for $10 bucks is now worth $12.  You look at the option chain for the following month and see that the same strike is selling for $15.  So you close your short position in the current month by buying back the $12 option, and simultaneously sell the one for the next month for $15.  So you 'roll' your expiration date out and collect an additional $3.  Now here's where you have to track credits over time, because if the option price drops to $14 and you decide to sell, instead of seeing a $1 profit, you're still at a loss overall because you lost two dollars before you rolled it.  Remember you collected 10 originally, paid 12, collected 15, paid 14.  10-12+15-14 = -1.  This is more complicated to track than the long position we discussed before, because you generally think of long positions as a bunch of individual transactions, vs shorts which tend to think in longer terms over the life of a series of rolls.\n\nNow that's a very long answer to a bunch of questions that you didn't even ask yet, but you will eventually.  Hopefully it helps you understand things a bit better overall, so that you understand why there's a market on both sides of an options trade.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your time.

In addition to the intrinsic value, there is extrinsic value which measures the uncertainty about the future price movement of the underlying.   The 190 strike in this example has less uncertainty because it's further from the current price of the stock.  So it will have less extrinsic value.

The term \"naked\" only applies to short positions and means with no collateral. The correct term would be, \"Even though these calls and puts are long.\"\n\nYes, the premium paid is your max loss on a long call or long put. HOWEVER, something that is overlooked sometimes is that if you let long contracts go to expiration ITM, your broker may automatically exercise them, even if only ITM $0.01, and you will need more money to pay for the shares you buy if a call, or more money to buy shares to sell if a put. So your total capital outlay may be higher, even though you don't lose any value (stock is worth what you paid for it at the time you pay for, so no net change in profit/loss).\n\nYes, close the positions when the current value of the position, less transaction costs, is greater than the money you paid for them.

This is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3[2] . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads signiicantly faster than the seasonal flu.\n\n>The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3%[3] . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is around .1%[4] .\n\n>SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms[5] . This makes it much more difficult to control.\n\n>Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention[6] . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu[7].\n\n>Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month[8] compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days[9] .\n\n> There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2[10] whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.\n\n>There is no herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population.

The seasonal flu averages somewhere between 0.1% and 0.8% mortality rate depending on source and which country you look at. \n\nThe current values for China are at 3.8% mortality rate. Which still isn’t high for a virus when compared to Bird flu, Ebola and other outbreaks over the past 100 years. Now if we look at South Korea. They have 7,500 cases that are confirmed but they only have 54 deaths so far. That gives us a percentage of 0.7%. Japan has had 530 confirmed cases but only 9 deaths, this leaves us with a percentage of 1.7%. Sweden has 320 cases but no deaths. Italy has 9,200 cases currently and 463 deaths. Both Italy and Iran have a high amount of deaths compared to cases when compared to the rest of the world. Italy has a relatively old population, especially in the north around Milan. So they will be more effected than other places. Iran on the other hand has a healthcare system that lacks funds and the country in general lacks a lot of resources to handle an outbreak of this scale because of the amount of sanctions placed on them. Because of these factors you have a higher mortality rate in these countries. You will also likely have a higher mortality rate in the United States unless the government does something to fix the healthcare system as well as making sure that people don’t loose their jobs because they are sick. This may cause people to go to work and infect others when sick. As well as not seeking medical attention when really sick because of lack of funds or insurance. \n\nWhen averaging out the mortality rates for each countries then sure I might be a bit off with 3% but I am not far off, but the numbers are also affected by what each country is doing to curb the amount of deaths. A country like Sweden or Norway will have a lot more ability to save people’s lives when compared with somewhere poorer with less of a built up healthcare system.\n\nTo be clear, both my parents work within healthcare and work with some of the top doctors and medical professionals in Sweden.
