Musk slipped out of his legal problems somehow, car production rose (most importantly without stories of him being a maniac to staff and building cars in tents).  A factory in China went from fantasy to plausible.  As the stock inched upward, their ability to fix their debt phantom started to fade.  Then some good ER showed profitability might be attainable sooner than later.  Production kept rising, along with the stock.  The big cap really silenced the debt problem.  Good news can be a self-fulfilling spiral, and indeed it was.  When you're hot, nothing can derail you.  Bad demo of truck windows?  Doesn't matter.  \n\nWith a lot of things, we judge their potential based on what figments of evidence we've seen.  When you see your child get their first A in school, it makes you realize they can get A's in the future.  Until then, you don't know.\n\nSo anyway, I feel the old support levels are representative of the \"old\" Tesla and might not reflect a potential that we've now had a glimpse of.\n\nI still wish grown ups would take over the company and board, and bring on un-famous professionals to run things, make Musk the pitchman only with zero access to people or power.

Best case scenario and worst case?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In 10 years, this is what I think:\n\nWORST CASE \n$0 per share, because the world ended and TSLAQ was right all along! Damnit. \n\nBASE CASE\n1. In 2030, Tesla sells 20 million cars per year, which is something like 45% compounded growth in unit volume from 2019 numbers. This is like Toyota style volume. \n2. Tesla‚Äôs ASP at that point is $40K per car ‚Äî there‚Äôs SEXY + Roadster, Semi, Cybertruck, and the mass-market ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù ‚Äî which translates to $800B revenue\n3. Tesla achieves 20% gross margins, so $160B off the top line. \n4. SG&A and R&D spend of 40B per annum, so $120B left.\n5. 20x multiple on that, so $2.4T market cap\n6. 300M shares outstanding, that‚Äôs $8K share price in 2030. \n\nBEST CASE \nAbove $8K. Like to the MOON and beyond!  Seriously like $15K or $24K per share. Crazy. I don‚Äôt know. \n\nHere are some drivers of better scenarios that improve upon the base case: \n\n1. higher unit volumes than 20M per annum (although hard to fathom sitting from here in 2020...)\n\n2. higher margins in 2030 than the 20% gross margin in the above scenario (NOTE: they get close to 20% already in gross margins today at much lower volumes, and they‚Äôre achieving those margins before the battery day impacts on margins have had a chance to appear in the financials...so maybe this isn‚Äôt crazy to think gross margins could go higher). \n\n3. higher ending multiples, especially if Tesla‚Äîorganizationally speaking‚Äîis still a world-beating engineering culture a decade from now, and people have finally climbed the wall of worry and negativity on it. I remember when it was controversial to buy amazon stock at $60 per share and people would argue with you...I bought it from $60-75 a share and value investors looked at it and puked at the valuation, especially coming out of the 2008 bear market with so many bargains lying around that on a p/e basis were better buys than amazon. a decade later it‚Äôs at $1800...in the middle of a 2020 bear market. So a 25x on 30M cars per year, 30% gross margins is like $26K per share on the car business alone.  \n\n4. I valued Tesla Energy at zero in the base case. What if it‚Äôs worth more than that a decade from now? The economic case for building solar roofs to replace solar panels+traditional roof is quite compelling. So basically, the proposition is: you replace your asphalt shingle roof (usually rated for 15 years?) that only has a single function (protecting your house from the elements) with a new roof that is warrantied for 25 years that has a double function (protecting your house from the elements PLUS printing money). oh and also you can do this for a combined cost that is cheaper than doing a roof plus solar on top separately, and it (from my biased point of view) actually improves the aesthetics of your house versus the roof + solar on top situation. I think most homeowners haven‚Äôt yet caught on to this. But this will grow in every neighborhood ‚Äî it only takes one neighbor to do it, and then suddenly the rest of the neighbors see the light, and as it comes time to think about putting on new shingles at the end of their 15 years...why not do solar glass? Bob who lives three doors down the street with his lovely wife Betsy and 2 kids just installed one on 6 months ago and he raves about it all the time... \n \n5. I valued Tesla‚Äôs efforts at Full Self Driving (along with potential robotaxi business) at zero. Let‚Äôs call those free call options built into the stock price. Even though I valued these businesses at zero, I secretly think that they are the crown jewels of this entire operation. Like the car business is just a Trojan horse for the FSD A.I. to come into existence and print money.  I secretly (don‚Äôt tell anyone! Shhh) think that the car and energy biz are just the appetizer and FSD with robo taxi business is the MAIN COURSE plus DESSERT plus lifetime tickets to a BUFFET. It‚Äôs huge. But of course if I pound the table out loud on this right now it‚Äôs guaranteed that all my noise will bring out the naysayers and the haters and the doubters so they can poop on my parade.

I am selling everything today. \n\nI recommend you read the paper more carefully. The implications for the US are nowhere near as horrible as you seem to think.\n\nThe quote you give is for \\*mitigation\\*. A very important theme of the paper is the distinction between \\*mitigation\\* and \\*suppression\\*. The US appears to be ramping up an effort for suppression - an effort to reduce the infection rate R0 to below 1, in other words to genuinely reduce the number of new cases. And the announcement on March 16 that this effort could extend as far as August or possibly longer appears to indicate that the US is making a serious effort at suppression of the virus.\n\nIn contrast to the US effort, the UK appears to have given up on suppression, and embraced a policy of mitigation, in other words, following the UK policies, at tens of millions of UK residents will be exposed to the virus, they're just trying to limit the peak rate of hospitalization and to protect the most vulnerable individuals (for example the elderly) to some extent.\n\nIf you look at the graphs, the more thorough supression (not mitigation) efforts do indeed result in a dramatic reduction in the number of cases needing hospitalization (and by implication also dramatic reduction in the number of cases overall).\n\nYou quote from the paper *\"Perhaps our most significant conclusion is that mitigation is unlikely to be feasible without emergency surge capacity limits...\"*. Notice that the quote uses the word \"mitigation\" - you are looking at the wrong part of the findings - the \"mitigation\" part is for the UK policies, while \"suppression\" is more relevant to the US policies. And the results for \"suppression\" are not nearly as bad.\n\nIt's also very important to note that this paper is not a prediction of the future, it's a result of a modeling effort, where (also very important) the model makes certain assumptions. If I read the paper correctly (would appreciate if somebody could check), the model assumes very limited testing - essentially only test people if they are very sick, so at any given time a large number of people who are infectious but don't know it are circulating through society. That (regrettably) pretty much fits what the US has been doing so far, but the US is now enormously ramping up the number of tests given - at least to millions, and at least one official mentioned eventually tens of millions. At first additional tests can be used to test people who may have been exposed, but eventually (for example) a large sampling effort could be undertaken to track the virus, and in principle 100 percent testing of the population could be done - the more testing is done, the more effectively the virus can be tracked, the more infected people can be put in quarantine, and the better the outcome is in comparison to the results from the model described in the paper.\n\nIt's also very important to be aware that a large part of the effort underway in China now is to maintain the suppression (which has been very effective, going from ~15000 new cases per day to ~15 new cases per day), while reducing the cost to society of doing so. A high percentage of businesses in China are now back up and running (using methods such as those used in Tesla's Shanghai gigafactory to increase social distancing and detect sick people while still allowing work to continue). \n\nThere doesn't appear to be any fundamental reason that the US couldn't adopt some of these lower-cost suppression strategies (or develop innovative new ones) to keep suppression of the virus going for as long as needed while lowering the impact on individuals, society and the economy.\n\nThe paper does mention some of the innovative methods being used to track, detect, and suppress the virus in other countries, but doesn't incorporate those methods in their models, which is appropriate because the models are limited in scope and not trying to anticipate all possible outcomes. But if you just look at the results of the models without considering the option for new improved suppression strategies, you may get a far too negative view of what will happen.\n\nThe models described in the paper also appear to assume that it would be impractical to keep controls in place for more than a few months, and that policies would then be relaxed and allow the number of new cases to start increasing again. As I mentioned earlier, more testing, better tracking, and ways of increasing social distancing at work/school/etc. could very well allow society to maintain suppression at acceptable cost while still allowing society and business to function.\n\nThe models appear to assume very poor compliance - for example high levels of breaking of quarantines. I don't know if that's true for the UK - but in the US, while there have been isolated reports of people breaking quarantine, I'm inclined that the overall rate would be much lower than the models use - people who are willing to wait an hour in line to buy toilet paper seem to be taking the threat of the virus pretty seriously.\n\nThis is a UK paper, and its strongest conclusion is that mitigation (the method apparently being selected by the UK) has a lot of problems and that suppression (the method used in China and apparently being adopted in the US) is a much better way to go.
