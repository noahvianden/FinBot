The Italian, US, and other bans have proved, by clear data, to have been both pointlessly long and self-defeating on both population dynamic and economic fronts.\n\nSo let's recap:  you, by failure to rebut, implicitly accept that Trump knowingly lied, implicitly accept that the policy of travel bans was held too long, implicitly acknowledge that his lies undermined the efficacy of his own policies, and implicitly accept that the overwhelming consensus of scientists believe as such.\n\nBut you're latest movement of the goal post boils down to \"but we can pretend that his policies flattened the curve, right?\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You couldn't be any more wrong.

Did you bother to read any of the direct statements from leading experts?\n\nThe travel bans work *for a few days* and only *if* you use other local containment techniques.\n\nDisease spread is based in the same mathematics as the statistical mechanics underlying fluid dynamics and magnetism.  Every system has a conversion, or in this case, \"infection\" constant.  That number can be small, but unless you have a perfectly efficient system, there will be spread.  Once that spread crosses the boundary past a critical value, the boundary becomes meaningless and the state undergoes phase transition.  In the example of magnetism, this is where a substance becomes a ferromagnet.  In the example of a pandemic, the critical values are functions of the pathogen's R0 value and incubation period, amongst other values.  The nCov virus has a decently high R0 value and long-ish incubation time.  So once the critical transition value outside of the boundary is reached, further border crossings make little difference -- like worrying about stray seeds from your neighbour's dandelion collection when trying to deal with your own garden getting overrun by weeds.  Like, yes in theory it'll help somewhat, but it really won't affect your real-world situation.\n\nSo certain travel bans or restrictions make sense for a time.  But, balancing with population dynamics and economic and information spread dynamics, they are absolutely limited.  And the restrictions *only* work when the population is well-informed and practicing local containment policies, which Trump directly undermined.\n\nSo maybe you should read the study cited in the articles above:  border closures have been *measured* to be ineffective in historical pandemics, and were just as worthless now, outside of mild help at the very, very beginning.  For H1N5, no cases were altered *at all* -- meaning no additional containment achieved.\n\nOh, and before I let you get away with another gem of disinformation, you've completely misinterpreted what \"flattening the curve\" means.  Flattening the curve means you slow the rate of infection in order to not stress the medical system.  The total number infected remains the same.  But flattening the curve is, once again, *totally local*, since healthcare is intrinsically local.\n\nAnd don't just take my word for it, since according to you I'm just saying this to hate Trump (which I'm not).  Here's a peer-reviewed paper from experts *proving explicitly* that you're wrong:\n\n>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4313627/\n\nI won't bother quoting from it... just to see if you'll even bother to read it long enough to be able to cite it without completely misconstruing it.  Like you did the past two times.  I mean... c'mon, the *next frigging sentence* and then *entire proceeding paragraph* after the sliver you quoted t0ta11y R3kT your argument.\n\nSo to recap, since you're still silent on the matters, you still intrinsically admit that:  Trump knowingly lied, that the effect was the total ineffectiveness of the travel bans due to a disinformed public, that Italy's travel ban also totally failed, and that experts told us about this all ahead of time.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"The travel ban works for a few days and only if you use other local containment techniques.\"\n\nUmm.

You present a false dichotomy, your question is *irrelevant and meaningless*.  The international travel restrictions don't appear to affect the pressures on any local curves except giving a bit of prep time.  And, so, you still implicitly accept that the travel ban was kept too long and was kneecapped.\n\nSo if that study, which talked about travel restrictions including border screenings, wasn't enough, and the multiple global experts saying that travel restrictions including bans do more harm than good, and the other 20-odd citations I already gave you and that you didn't properly read won't convince you.... I guess I'll just have to cite **more** peer-reviewed literature.\n\n>The overall risk of bias in the 23 included studies was low to moderate. Internal travel restrictions and international border restrictions delayed the spread of influenza epidemics by one week and two months, respectively. International travel restrictions delayed the spread and peak of epidemics by periods varying between a few days and four months. Travel restrictions reduced the incidence of new cases by less than 3%. Impact was reduced when restrictions were implemented more than six weeks after the notification of epidemics or when the level of transmissibility was high. Travel restrictions would have minimal impact in urban centres with dense populations and travel networks. We found no evidence that travel restrictions would contain influenza within a defined geographical area.  (https://www.scielosp.org/article/bwho/2014.v92n12/868-880D/en/)\n\nThe closest thing I could find to agreement with your premise was one paper from over a decade ago which, while modeled on SARS, does not assess the economic impact or number of total effective cases:\n\n>We found that a ban on journeys >50 km would drastically reduce the speed and geographical spread of outbreaks, even when compliance is < 100%. The result was found to be robust for different rates of intermunicipality transmission intensities.  (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1741-7015-4-32)\n\nAnd in fact, most diseases, beyond just influenza but also including Ebola, seem to have a distinctly opposite pattern:\n\n>The travel restrictions were not effective enough to expect the prevention of global spread of Ebola virus disease. **It is more efficient to control the spread of disease locally during an early phase of an epidemic than to attempt to control the epidemic at international borders.** Capacity building for local containment and coordinated and expedited international cooperation are essential to reduce the risk of global transmission.  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033593/)\n\nAt very, very best for your argument, we at least need more study:\n\n>Some of the evidence suggests that a travel ban may delay the arrival of an infectious disease in a country by days or weeks. However, there is very little evidence to suggest that a travel ban eliminates the risk of the disease crossing borders in the long term\n>...\n>In the end, the researchers were able to identify just six studies that fit their criteria. Those six were based on models or simulations, not data from actual bans after they were implemented, to assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling outbreaks. Consequently, to improve research in this area, the study authors recommend that research questions, partnerships and study protocols be established ahead of the next outbreak so empirical data can be collected and assessed quickly.

When **I** can argue your case better than you, and you *still* lose, you're on quicksand.\n\nSo you also implicitly admit by your suspiciously continuous silence that:  Trump intentionally lied, the direct result was the ineffectiveness of the travel bans due to public disinformation, bans which wouldn't have flattened the curve but instead just shift it back, that that prep time was squandered, that the bans were kept on way too long, that the positives of the bans were drastically outweighed by the economic and information spread negative effects, economic effects which are now almost certainly a recession because of the incoherent response, and that experts told us about this beforehand.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Right.

I challenge you to find one peer reviewed paper anywhere that states than it does.  You're pushing a nonsensical burden of proof onto me.  Travel restrictions can sometimes, maybe, depending on the nature of the virus, delay the international spread.  But local curves are not flattened, especially when prep time is squandered.  I've given you now over 20 papers proving that the travel restrictions, even with their positives, are quickly outweighed and that there is a direct correlation with the economic downturns we see.  That and they're often discriminatory.  And lead to the public lacking information.  Which makes the whole venture almost worthless.\n\nTo eradicate the virus implies local tactics.  That is separate and apart from delaying its arrival.  Your question makes no sense, as I will say now for the fourth time.  You are conflating different issues here, and you don't seem to have any interest in presenting any more novel disinformation to debunk.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You're right.

Once again... do I smell desperation?\n\nI'll respond to you thoroughly, although in a different respect.  You've played a very defensive game so far.  You actually have contributed nothing to the discussion.  As I noted above, you are a \"just say no machine.\"  Your implicit admissions, and the fact that you never even addressed them with a 10 foot pole when they were over and over pointed out explicitly, has made me quite curious.\n\nSee, it seems to me that you are utterly incapable of actually defending a position.  You don't have the tools available to look at the data and meaningfully interpret them.  Hence why you didn't understand what \"may be\" meant in the sentence fragment you quoted above.  So, instead of actually engaging with the conversation, you try to shut it down.  I don't think you know what an endpoint to thin conversation even looks like.  Do you expect that the evidence presented to you will just... go away?  That I'll realize that I was interpreting it wrong even though it's all in plain English from dozens of reputable sources?\n\nI've already gone over the mathematics of it explicitly, in the magnetism and weeds example.  The papers do that as well, in great detail if you'd like to read it.  But you won't because you can't.  Hence also why you confuse \"flattening the curve\" with \"eradicating the virus,\" as if the analysis in any given paper of one had to at once address both and yet \"choose one.\"  A very curious impossible choice.  A false dichotomy which I think arose because you haven't actually been following, but rather passively flowing with the conversation, allowing all direct responses to your points float by you without any actual engagement.\n\nWhen I challenged you to find a paper supporting the idea that closing borders flattens the curve, since you insisted that the conversation would only proceed if you got an answer, you were mysteriously silent.  When I pointed out that Trump lied, you diverted the conversation away from that and reframed it as \"what if he said what you wanted him to say\".... which wasn't the point.  The point was that he lied.  So you just implicitly admitted it, because engaging that fact would be outside your grasp.  But I engaged you anyway, and proved that, had he not lied, we would see real-worl impacts, and that your beloved travel bans might have actually worked as intended for some short time.  But then you once again shifted the conversation to \"but won't that not flatten the curve?\" -- once again a completely different point, so you implicitly admitted to being wrong, but never addressed it even when itwas pointed out.  Because you couldn't.  Then once even that point was discredited with thorough mathematics across several papers and two upfront analogies, and then the fact that your proposals are mostly outweighed by demonstrable harms, you turned to a completely passive response.  Because you couldn't defend your point.\n\nWe see a perpetual shifting of the goalposts, total non-engagement.  It is quite sad, really.

When demand for shares goes down, it takes the price down, but doesn’t mean companies are not productive or profitable.\n\nI think the market, and perception of the economy, would be less prone to hysteria and anxiety if more reality-based metrics were quoted along with share prices.\n\nThis is a very special situation. Yes, it could trigger an overdue natural recession, but it’s caused by a temporary, external, partly artificial,  phenomenon.\n\nConsumer demand still exists, but it is artificially suppressed. When the suppression is removed, demand will resume. Some will take a while to recover, but a lot will come back with a vengeance. Moreover, productive potential may not be reduced that much. With enough financial lubricant, economic activity will resume, and demand will return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis is not a bubble bursting. While there was probably some asset valuation inflation, and plenty of speculation, its not like consumer demand was artificially inflated.\n\nPeople will be coming out of this with an intense case of cabin fever. I would expect an orgy of consumer activity when the smoke clears. Possibly with additional demand for safety precautions which will also stimulate demand.\n\nIt’s certainly very inconvenient for everyone, and harmful to those who risk short-term unemployment, or problems meeting financial obligations, or who were getting ready to retire. But industries are not collapsing. They are pausing. When the all clear is given, they will be right back to productive activity.\n\nIn the meanwhile, look for the movement of spending to alternative markets and venues, including delivery services and Internet entertainment.

I think MOST people will sell the option. The point of exercising the option is if you want to keep the shares long term maybe.
