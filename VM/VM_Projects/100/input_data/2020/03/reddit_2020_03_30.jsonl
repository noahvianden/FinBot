What is expected of me from my broker (I am a UK resident with an account with an Interactive Broker margin account) where my account has £4.73k in total including the premium (there are no other positions other than the two mentioned)?\n\nWill I need to fork out the $15,500 for the PUT (money I don't have)?

One possible explanation is that balance sheet heavy companies tend to be mature companies that are already generating considerable amount of payouts with poor growth prospect, while tech companies tend to be growth companies where the much of the cash flows responsible for the NPV are farther out in the future in an environment where people are looking for duration exposure and decent returns since 10 year yields were barely above inflation.

So the Fed goes into the open market and purchases large amounts of USTs, MBS, corporate debt bonds, etc. This, like you said, is like a shot of liquidity into the financial system. Rather than an asset which is going to pay out over the next n years, the bond holder, US corps, US banks, etc get the entire value upfront in cash. Since the Fed isn't part of the economy, this acts as a (temporary until maturity) liquidity shot to help a slowing economy. Bond market crash avoided, liquidity provided, cash for for payroll, cash the bank can lend out, etc. This is the exact point of the expansionary monetary policy, to in a way, move future liquidity to the present. This is also not quite inflationary because shit is deflating too fast anyway, and this is not literal money printing. Is that just about right? What would you say to the common argument that \"When investors sell their bonds to the fed, the money gets invested into the stock market propping up asset prices?\"\n\nSo far none of this has acted as helicopter money in any way, no money was \"printed\" so long as the fed gets fully repaid by the Treasury and bond issuers. So far everything to this point was completely real and organic, no artificial price propping. \n\nHowever now we are at the following scenario. The Fed has trillions of assets on their balance sheet. QE was supposed to be an emergency measure to jump start the economy in the middle of a crisis, but at the expense of future \"pain\" in the form of letting the bonds mature or selling them off, hence why it wasn't helicopter money up to this point. The Fed had to unwind the balance sheet, but as more and more assets mature, the fed just rolls the maturity further out by using the proceeds to buy more assets, while not decreasing the balance sheet. The Treasury does the same thing. The Treasury issues more USTs in order to fund the maturity on their old USTs on the Fed's balance sheet. Low interest rates are essential for this, as rising rates would massively increase the cost of servicing the debt. Exactly the same thing happening right now with unlimited QE. The US Fed balance sheet is up to 6T and counting. \n\nI'm not here to claim some impeding crisis, but how is the Fed planning to unwind their balance sheets without crashing the economy for the exact opposite reason why QE works in the first place to organically help the economy and increase stock valuations? By letting the bonds mature, the Fed takes away cash and thereby liquidity from the market. Say A issues a zero coupon bond to B for $100. Net cash added is 0$. Then 2008 happens, Fed buys that bond, and now both A and B \\*\\*each\\*\\* have 100$. Well, no problem because one of them still owes 100$ to the Fed. But if the Fed just buys another bond using the 100$ it got, how is this not the Fed just kicking the can down the road hoping that one day the economy will be booming so much they will have to contract it by unwinding the balance sheets?\n\nSo then how does the Fed unwind the balance sheets? The Fed can always monetize the debt, but wouldn't **that** be a definite source of extremely high stagflation? That would be the Fed indirectly loaning to the Treasury and then letting the treasury default by simply writing off that position. What's your first hand insider take on how the balance sheet can be normalized, or whether that's even necessary (Bernake called for a permanent balance sheet position IIRC, though I have no idea how that's feasible). Is the hope that we grow fast enough for the Fed to be able to \"repay\" for the liquidity they \"borrowed\" by letting bonds mature as a tightening measure?\n\nTL;DR The feds balance sheet is like a \"loan\" they took out during the GCF to pay for the recovery, how isn't a ballooning balance sheet of this size a concern for the far future?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I can’t give you a detailed explaination now. But you do roughly have the mechanics right. \n\nThe thing you’re overlooking is that in a zero rate environment, bonds and cash are identical. (Separately, in a positive rate environment, a bond is just a ‘cash forward’). As such, issuing debt is the most efficient way for a govt to match ‘cash need’ with ‘cash availability’. Since a bond = ‘cash + rate mechanism’, the advantage to issuing debt over just straight cash is that it allows the Fed to later adjust cash levels via the rate setting mechanism. \n\nThe ‘moment of inflation’ when a bond is issued is the second the bond hits the market - *not* years later when it matures. I used to use the monopoly to teach this to juniors bc it doesn’t make intuitive sense in the abstract. But if you have multiple ppl playing and I’m ‘the govt/the Fed’, you can see how players are able to bid up the (in game) price level as soon as debt is issued, *not* as its repaid. This element is true for sovereigns as well. \n\nSo instead of thinking about repaying, think more along the lines of ‘appropriate cash level’. If the economy grows strongly, rolling off should be trivial - you just redeem the bonds w cash (but keep in mind this won’t change the aggregate cash level). Tapering into a low-inflation environment *shrinks* the cash availability and you have to be careful - the Taper Tantrum was bc the Fed was too aggressive at the wrong time. It’s basically inducing deflation into a disinflationary environment - this is a bad thing. The cleanest way is to just sterilize everything as it rolls off. \n\nYou still have the problem of ‘troubled assets.’ Honestly, the most likely path is this: there are going to be a bunch of companies that take debt and limp along. They probably should be failing right now, but that’s politically impalatable. So these companies limp along. This is stagflation in the real economy. \n\nIn 1983, we would have had a volker recession to clean out the pipes and reset balance sheets - 18mo of pain but a pretty healthy recovery. The *other* thing that could happen is that the Fed/UST hold the loans and work it out that way; essentially sterilizing the debt out of the public eye. This is basically what happened in 2009 with resi mortgages. I think we are about to repeat it with commercial debt.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Can you possibly explain why letting the bonds roll off won’t decrease the aggregate cash but tapering does shrink the aggregate cash?

It’s like moving a $20 bill from your left pocket to your right pocket. \n\nTo tapering: Although cash and bonds are basically fungible from a financial perspective, cash has a *vastly* more potent ability to impact price levels which is the ultimate measure of inflation (eg bonds move about the finance sector w/o have a huge impact on price levels bc of the institutions that are holding the bonds; this is a key part of why the Fed/UST auction bonds as opposed to just dropping cash). When the Fed/UST creates less cash ex nihlo to buy bonds, there is in aggregate less cash going into the real economy.

These two phenomena are detailed below:\n\nSuckers Rally\n\nA “suckers rally” is when innocent and naive investors with their investing baby diapers still on experience a high degree of FOMO (fear of missing out) and buy the hell out of a market when it has a technical rebound after hitting a new low. This almost always ends in disaster as the market bounces and then proceeds to fall further from its previous lows. This occurred prior to the record lows during the Great Depression and the Great Recession in 2008.\n\nBull Trap\n\nA “bull trap” occurs when people “bullish” about the market fail to recognize that the fundamentals of earnings, revenue, and employment are screwed, and yet continue to buy up stocks ignoring the obvious. They think that sentiment will overpower the fact that companies are screwed and going bankrupt and buy into an overpriced market thinking it will magically go up.\n\nConclusion\n\nRegardless of what category you fall into, it is clear that the current rally cannot be sustained until the economy starts functioning again. Unemployment numbers are skyrocketing and we have yet to hit earnings season yet.

Reportedly they are inexpensive, can be quickly manufactured in large volumes, and can be taken orally, so if they are useful in treating COVID-19 that would be very good news. Of course the trials should continue - not just for treatment, but there have even been some suggestions that they might be useful for the most at-risk healthcare workers as a preventative measure - that would be great if it turns out to be true.\n\nThese are two of the drugs that Elon Musk has been suggesting for further investigation, and apparently his comments significantly raised the visibility of previous tests. (And since that time, Trump has been urging further tests.)\n\nThe FDA has recently been subjected to harsh criticism for excessively strict adherence to formal protocols that greatly slowed down the availability of COVID-19 testing in the US. While there's plenty of blame to share among various parts of the government, reportedly the FDA made it extremely difficult for many labs to develop COVID-19 tests, while the one test they initially approved for development turned out to be useless, resulting in a six-week delay in the widespread availability of tests in the US. Six weeks could have made an enormous difference in knowledge of the spread of the disease, tracking of individual cases, and ultimately in the number of people in the US who get sick and die from the disease.\n\nSome models suggest that most of the people in the US who are going to die from COVID-19 are going to do so in the next month or two. The FDA appears to have figured out that if a full formal approval process takes six months (or whatever they have planned) and then finds out that the treatment is safe and effective, then blocking use of the drugs until then would have resulted in many unnecessary deaths. It's encouraging if the FDA has now recognized that during a fast-moving health crisis, the optimum approach calls for a quicker than usual decision process.\n\nAnd relevant to this subreddit, of course, if fewer people get sick and die from COVID-19, the impact to the economy can also be lessened, and TSLA can go back up sooner.
