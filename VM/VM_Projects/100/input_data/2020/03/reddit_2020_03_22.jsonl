They think it will end up being ~0.5-1.5% when all is said and done.

The breakdown goes something like this (I am using my personal experience auditing a wide variety of healthcare companies; on a patient by patient basis it’s hard to calculate costs which is why we group them for analytical purposes. It always falls within a range.)\n\nWe calculate net revenue by looking at \n\nGross Charges\n\n-Contractual Adjustment (what the ins company won’t pay)\n\n=Net Charges\n\nCommercial health insurance pays ~72-75% on the dollar\n\nMedicare pays ~68-72% on the dollar\n\nMedicaid pays ~42-50% on the dollar (this is state based, however so that’s just for my state)\n\nOn average uninsured patients pay ~5-10% of the gross charges. Most of it is written off. But that doesn’t mean that they aren’t still attempting to collect, it’s just not usually very successful.\n\nThe takeaway:\n\n1.) Medicare actually pays pretty well. Our healthcare system could run on their funding. \n\n2.) Medicaid would be unsustainable and is basically a cost-sink on our healthcare industry\n\n3.) you are already paying the costs of care for the people that are uninsured and poor.\n\nThe issue right now with Medicare and why it costs so much is because all of the high risk individuals are put into the same pool. People over 65; people with disabilities that make them unable to work; the general poor. This is the dream for insurance companies. By pooling, all of the healthy 26 year olds into that pool the average costs per person goes down.\n\nI have discussed the idea with many people in different billing departments and they’d much rather only have to deal with a single payor instead of having to jump through different hoops.
