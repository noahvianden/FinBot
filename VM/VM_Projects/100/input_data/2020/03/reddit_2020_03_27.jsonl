Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia Tuturiol](https://www.investopedia.com/university/all/fundamental-analysis/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "fpt5qp", "created_utc": 1585296479.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Which one of you sold your BA and Disney stocks this morning?

Some of them may recover but some, depending how bad this goes, may go bankrupt and you lose money. What I’ve been doing (not expert advice) is looking into strong companies year average compared to now, if it’s a 60%+ decline, odds are it’s damn cheap. However some like huge companies take hardly a dip, just compare how much.\n\nI typically buy some,not all, when I think they’re low at like 60-70% lower than normal, then the next week put some more into it and then the next week. That way, if it continues, then you get lower and lower prices and theoretically more money out of it, if it returns to normal. Even if the market starts to rise, I still buy because you’ll still make some off of it, may not be 75% difference but hey in the end, you’re increasing your value.\n\nAlso hold on to ya stocks, do not sell if your scared. Odds are in your favor that it will only go up from where it is.
