{"title": "Sen. Kelly Loeffler Dumped Millions in Stock After Coronavirus Briefing", "selftext": ">The Senate’s newest member sold off seven figures worth of stock holdings in the days and weeks after a private, all-senators meeting on the novel coronavirus that subsequently hammered U.S. equities.\n\n>Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) reported the first sale of stock jointly owned by her and her husband on Jan. 24, the very day that her committee, the Senate Health Committee, hosted a private, all-senators briefing from administration officials, including the CDC director and Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institutes of Health of the United States, on the coronavirus. \n\n>“Appreciate today’s briefing from the President’s top health officials on the novel coronavirus outbreak,” she tweeted about the briefing at the time.\n\n>That first transaction was a sale of stock in the company Resideo Technologies worth between $50,001 and $100,000. The company’s stock price has fallen by more than half since then, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average overall has shed approximately 10,000 points, dropping about a third of its value.\n\n>It was the first of 29 stock transactions that Loeffler and her husband made through mid-February, all but two of which were sales. One of Loeffler’s two purchases was stock worth between $100,000 and $250,000 in Citrix, a technology company that offers teleworking software and which has seen a small bump in its stock price since Loeffler bought in as a result of coronavirus-induced market turmoil.\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/sen-kelly-loeffler-dumped-millions-in-stock-after-coronavirus-briefing", "id": "flm21j", "created_utc": 1584667425.0, "score": 3311, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 353, "comments": [{"body": "That needs to be looked into.", "score": 864, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/03/burr-unloaded-stocks-before-coronavirus/\n\nchairman of the intelligence committee, yikes.", "score": 451, "replies": [{"body": "For some reason I don’t think this would be legit to do in those roles.", "score": 173, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 117, "replies": [{"body": "they do.", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "I work in the industry and one saying we have is \"you can tell when someone is ugly but it's hard to say why, and you can tell when someone is beautiful but can't quite put a finger on it.
