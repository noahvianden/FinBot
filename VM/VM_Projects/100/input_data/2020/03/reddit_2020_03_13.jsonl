Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia Tuturiol](https://www.investopedia.com/university/all/fundamental-analysis/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "fhw8q1", "created_utc": 1584086891.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "Also, anyone notice that when the regular stocks are going up, many of the biotech corona stocks are mostly going down?

Otherwise, I’m not interested.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "\"Ok so you seem to make a lot of statements such as “swing traders” and shorts are responsible for these insane price swings. I’m not sure if that’s true \"\n\nShort interest is number reported by NASDAQ 2 times a month. Each open short position creates additional stock (sold) to those which was released by company (giving more supply than there are stocks released), thus it artificially distorts supply/demand balance and suppresses price. I use \"shorts\" in this sense and in sense as interest group, which feels pressure to buy back stock and close position due to rising stock price and growing loss.  Short squeeze is well known phenomenon and common sense knowing market mechanics. As for swing trading, it's commonly declared position in this and other TSLA play related subs. This sentiment diminished after Tesla broke from earlier mentioned channel, but is sort of having rebirth with all those Tesla \"believers\" who are trying to sell their stocks in last couple of weeks and buy back in lower prices (which is nothing but shorting with your own stock). One never can be 100% sure, but also one could easily observed my mentioned sentiments in forums for years. Also, TSLA at that time was as much \"trader stock\", as it was \"growth stock\". You always can check how many shares change hands each day relative to shares outstanding and compare to other companies.\n\n\" Also, the argument that it first hit 180 in 2013 and then 360 in 2017 and the extreme swings should be ignored is a terrible argument. The exact opposite which can be made is that these “highs” you mention are bullshit prices from hype, and the lows are proper valuations. Obviously the correct valuation is between these extremes, but the fact that the price swings so much is concerning. \"\n\nI can't agree more that this is concerning and would add - not good for the company as well. It's ok to have <30% swings down, when you are constantly and fast growing, but having >50% swings would be ridiculous.  No need to normalize them as last year was special case and now is combination of 1 in 100 years pandemic, oil price war and growing probability of first recession after more than decade.\n\nAs for everything else - well no. Its normal for stock price of constantly GROWING company to grow multiple folds, sometimes it happens in few months. Usually after braking long term resistance at top and while having big short interest at the bottom. There are multiple examples and it's not the first time even for Tesla. But it is not normal to go lower than 1/2 of previous top. Please give me some examples of relevant size companies which were constantly growing and folded down 5-6 times due to volatility? AMZN went many folds down after burst of dotcom bubble, but I'm not sure about relevance of its size by then and it was market bubble and its collapse contrast to Tesla's growth, which was largely ignoring market movement.  Tesla swings in its last channel was extremely volatile for company of its size, but it was usually well below 50% down (a bottom of the channel for a few years was 240-250).  So for years it was somewhat consensus price by market (also narratives of both sides chanted prices way  of the channel) and it's nothing innovative to look to new high in the context of previous consensus and date of its beginning (to quantify rate of growth) . \n\n\"You later state that the “model 3” could be profitable. I’ve yet to look at the numbers, but it looks like the cost is going down, however I’m not sure what the production and R&D costs are, or of other ways in which they may waste money. For ex, about a year ago they laid off like %20+ of staff due to tremendous wasteful overspending. \"\n\nWell they missed on initial plan by implementing innovations on automation too aggressive and then needed to improvise... quick or go, one may say, tits up, so it's not unexpected that they created, pardon my French, shitload of redundancies and inefficiencies. Especially bearing in mind that m3 was a new platform and first real mass market model for Tesla. They promised that costs will go down with scale, by ironing down redundancies and by implementing innovations  (with slower pace). All 3 are quite common sense and quarter sheets supports that premise.  Also quality went up, which helped with service balance, which is still distorted by the fact that exponentially growing Tesla fleet has relatively huge part of cars still on warranty.  Of course constantly growing and innovating company is not easiest thing to financially deconstruct and evaluate for outsider, as each quarter has its own context.\n\nBig part of R&D will be covered by model Y, as it shares many parts with m3, as well as by new production lines (with increasing efficiency). Also you always can look at Tesla cars as platform for soft, revenue of which will be \\~pure margin.\n\n\"The thing is I’m not buying into this company, or any company for that matter, on faith. The company will succeed or fail regardless of your desires or wishes. Which is what you and many of your lackeys seem to be doing. If the assets and business model are mathematically valuable, and it’s priced correctly, I’ll buy. Otherwise, I’m not interested. \"\n\nWell, as there nothing to be sure about 100%, there is part of faith in everything you choose to believe (even if in particular probability), and then there are bets. You can't evaluate Tesla as slow growing cash cow. It's quite unique, as its hybrid between a fast innovating and huge markets disrupting tech company and a company of heavy industry with its specific inertia, product cycles, hunger for capital and moats. On top of that you have Tesla mission and its political charge on brand. How many similar companies there are to invest? SpaceX even haven't had IPO. I personally give a close look to corporate identity and its alignment with recognized and unrecognized needs of society in various time scales (the context in which corp try to perform), then I'm analyzing tech and moats, then finances (I don't hate numbers nor money), than market sentiment and media discourse. There are many ways to play the market, TSLA has huge long term potential, but you always can find medium term play by finding various misalignments among various identities of corporation (including its valuation).  As for Tesla I followed it closely for many years and could test my predictions and contrast them with loads of BS in media and bearish opinions. So I can say it's no wonder that Tesla is here were it is, that was predicted. And yes, there is always left place for possibility, that it goes tits up, but this possibility becoming comparatively low as Tesla growth and gains invested interest of more more powerful stakeholders.  \n\nNow, please expand on your Tesla evaluation model and it's time scale, and where the hell could you possible use P/E, as this company's strategy is not about optimizing them in the next few years, but about growth and creating platforms for far future profits?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "airport special doll safe poor school deliver far-flung shaggy thought\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Rise up was crazier than the ride down.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "$1200 EOY for sure", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao.

{"title": "How the Fed might actually fix this fuckup, or kill us all - DD", "selftext": "Pre-TLDR for the blind children who cant read -\n\nTAN puts $20 strike, July.\n\nTLT call, $160 strike, Mar 20.\n\nIEUR puts, $25 strike, June 19th.\n\nSpy puts, $230 strike, June\n\nEEM puts, $25 strike, May\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Fed has an ult as spicy as wasabi snooters, and they started stage 2 of it today. Before I get into how the Fed might actually unfuck the bulls, some context.\n\nThe externalities that are affecting the market right now are downright marvel movie ridiculous.\n\n\\- A growing bubble of stock valuation (like the dot com bubble)\n\n\\- A growing corporate debt bubble akin to 2008, but instead of Amanda buying a truck and a condo as a hooters waitress, its WeWork being... well WeWork.\n\n\\- A supply chain disruption that disrupted 94% of the Fortune 1000, that isn't priced in yet (I'll ge to that later)\n\n\\- A small sovereign debt crisis (Lebanese bond default) forming like Greece bangin rails whiter then snow.\n\nLiterally one of those is enough to trigger a correction event, but fuck that it's 2020 we go big or go home, there's FOUR major externalities hitting the market within weeks.\n\nBut why does this all matter? Well large corporations like Boeing have large lines of credit with large banks like JP Morgan Chase. JP will credit an amount, say $100, to be drawn down at any point. JP has hundreds of thousands of businesses under its credit line. From your local pizza shop with a $5,000 credit, or GE with $19.8 Billion in credit across 6 banks. But not all companies will need to draw down on credit at the same time - so no need to keep liquid capital = to your commitments on hand.\n\n[GE's credit limit is higher then Cheech and Chong](https://preview.redd.it/tvgof2odvcm41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6e1fcdabbccf35ca26bf4840179574c08689424)\n\nThat is - unless some externalities like ModelobolaBeerVirus show up right in the middle of a Saudi-Russian pillow fight turned knife fight because the dumbass babysitter China passed out on Xans and cant watch the children.\n\nSo now every company and their mom is trying to draw down credit to cover losses anywhere from supply shortages to payroll to legal fees.\n\nWell now wtf does JP Morgan and friends do if it has credit line obligaitons it can't pay?\n\nYou take out a credit card... but from who? THE FED!\n\nWell what can the Fed do? This isn't QE4 - A New mortgage, atleast not yet. Then what the everloving shit was Powell thinking sleeping on the print button to the tune of 500 billion in offered liquidity TODAY, and more importantly - where did that money go?\n\nWell, liquidity isn't going to equities. That was apparent by the almost immediate crash after the announcement of repos and relative flatening of value. The liquidity isn't going to solve solvency issues, there hasn't been enough time for a firm to declare insolvency. Well then where is that liquidity (cash) going?\n\n# So my Thesis?:\n\n# Repo Ops are being offloaded to Banks who are using the liquidity to fill credit line obligations, in turn selling those credit lines as bonds through securitized bond swaps to Banks 2: euro boogaloo, who are then using those SBS's to securitize their obligations on negative yield ECB bonds.\n\nFirst, what's the ECB? It's the Feds autistic cousin in the eurozone.\n\nSee the ECB has the same job as the Fed, regulates monetary policy for the eurozone, and that for some reason includes giving debt out for free, and paying people to take loans and bonds. See, the negative debt ratios in Europe are assblasting bad. Like, 96% of your debt you are paying to loan out bad (looking at your Switzerland)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxe4580iscm41.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f03df2f3986656cf7d88fe59788fbc3212f1652\n\nSo all this negatively yielding liquidity can be attained in the market - free money that can be amortized over 100 year bond obligations by Euro banks like Deustche Bank.\n\nWell how does SBS get ahold of the money to pay back these bonds. They transact an SBS with an American bank who have these lines of credit and their obligations. What is a SBS? an SBS is a bond swap. Easy right? A bank like JP will gather a group of bonds that are securitized\n\n\\--(grouped together (tranched) for risk, I would also note the actual mechanics of an \"SBS\" is much more complex then just throwing a shitload of corporate bonds together, and this is just to make this train of thought as simple as possible.) --\n\nThen JP will go diddle his skull and crossbones fuck buddy at Deustche Bank, and ask for a swap. Deustche Bank, always in the mood for felatio, will go to the ECB and take out 100 euros in German backed 100 year treasury bond at -.69% interest. Deustche Bank will then bend over after said felatio, and give JP that 100 euros - or $112 to JP in exchange for that SBS. The SBS obligation from groups of companies like Boeing have long term value as long as the companies do not become insolvent and thus default.\n\nBecause The Euro has a favorable exchange rate, the US bank can then turn back to the fed same day and payback their Repo obligation with interest, and have some cash to spare.\n\nGE gets their tendies to pay for hookers and blow so long as they can rollover to the next month and pay their interest.\n\nJP Morgan Chase gets their money to pay Daddy Powell and not get sued by GEs dad's lawyer for making promises it couldn't keep.\n\nDeustche Bank gets a % value of the obligated credit line, and say they helped and can keep playing options like it's roulette.\n\nAnd Germany has a securitized bond obligation against corporate bonds and can keep paying gibs.\n\n**Literally can't go tits up.**\n\nHowever, this game of grab ass only works so long as the market allows firms like GE to stay solvent. If enough of these corporations with credit line obligations default - we are fuk.\n\nAnd this is why the externalities are throwing a monkey wrench into Wasabi snooter time. If no companies are operational because beervirus wants siesta time, and meaningful gross domestic product stops the Production part, it doesn't matter how much appetite the Eurozone has for bondage, the interest payments will eventually not get covered.\n\nCorporate credit is 50%+ BBB or lower rating - absolute junk. Sound like 2008 all over again? It is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0m4c2gs0dm41.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=7004a38680385fbdc767bd7d097a1b98ab40b201\n\nOnce a percentage of those corporate bonds are not paid, the whole securitized bond swap tranche is GUH, and Germany will restart the Weimar republic part 2. As that happens, the circus stops, and the entire world economy grinds to a halt. Any company with debt obligations it cant meet will collapse, the Euro will be worthless, the German Casino will finally get around to kicking Deutsche Bank out of the casino entirely, JP Morgan Chase will get absolutely reamed by daddy democracy, and the FED will be stuck being the cause of the collapse of the modern economic system - all because they wanted bigger numbers on balance sheets.\n\nThis is not 1907, this is not 2008, this is not 1929 - It is MUCH MUCH worse.\n\nWe won't know if the credit lines can stay liquid, but after today it looks as though the fed wants to keep the flood gates open for when the liquid capital is needed. Of the 500 Billion offered in adition to the \"normal\" \\~200 billion offered, only 90 billion was taken by JP Chase Morgan and buds.\n\nAnd so while everyone is happy making tendies off puts, seriously be aware of the implications, because the Fed and Co. are tryna fly to the sun, and might end up getting burned.\n\n# TLDR -\n\n# IEUR, EEM, SPY PUTS $1 Strike, September, diamond hands you might be in the money by August, watch those long D/E ratios, and what Q2/Q3 earnings look like for heavily leveraged corps like GE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:\n\nAs of 20 minutes ago the Bank of Japan introduced added stimulus of 1.9 billion in japanese bonds and \\~14.12 Billion in direct lending.

Well, the obvious answer, and the one we've been doing for the last 40 odd years, is the EuroFed drops its interest rates (negative if it ~~must~~ has) and the Fed drops its rates so the transaction of Corporate Debt for EuroFed bonds stays profitable for US banks in times of trouble. The rub however, is that we were already doing this when we shouldn't have, we should have been pulling those Fed and EuroFed rates back up but didn't. Now the rates were both so low that the US bank could give out stupid corporate loans because it didn't need to worry so much because it could just trade em in for Eurobonds at a slight profit. \"But why not just go lower?\" you ask, well, because if we go low enough those standards continue to drop (or some massive economic event like 30% of the world being unable to work) until you get to the point (were at?) where no amount of wheeling and dealing makes the corporate debt worth holding because a lot of it is going belly up no matter what.

To the thesis:\n\n\n>Repo Ops are being offloaded to Banks who are using the liquidity to fill credit line obligations, in turn selling those credit lines as bonds through securitized bond swaps to Banks 2: euro boogaloo, who are then using those SBS's to securitize their obligations on negative yield ECB bonds.\n\n“Repo Ops are being offloaded to Banks who are using the liquidity to fill credit line obligations”\n\nThis is 100% correct. In fact that precisely *why* the fed dropped nuclear cash into repo mkts. \n\n“in turn selling those credit lines as bonds through securitized bond swaps to Banks 2: euro boogaloo”\n\nThis is insanely wrong for like 100 reasons. 1) you can’t securitize a Corp bank revolver for a fuckton of reasons - this has been talked about for like 15years and nobody has actually structured it (a Corp revolver, not a Corp loan). It’s just not an attractive investment given the cashflow responsibility. Realistically/practically it’s just not possible. 2) anything that you do structure has to sit for like 6-9mo before you securitize it. This is called ‘seasoning’ and it’s a core part of the process. 3) you then need to package, underwrite, market and transfer it. This takes several weeks. TLDR: securitizing anything is like a ~10mo process from A to Z; it’s just not something that happens TODAY. \n\n“who are then using those SBS's to securitize their obligations on negative yield ECB bonds.”\n\nThis sentence is gibberish - idk what it means. I use SBSs all the time to, for example, get exposure to a thinly traded bond that would take weeks/months build a position in by trading. I’m trying to make sense of that sentence: it’s saying that you’d need to hold collateral against a short euro denominated neg yield bond?  This is a common leg of a euro carry, and a lot of people are in this position, but think about it: if you’re in this position, you’re facing a cash/margin call. You don’t go buy more USD denominated shit - you’d be selling to raise cash. HOWEVER, thanks to the Fed, you don’t need to sell (repo mkt to the rescue!). Since 2008, the Fed & ECB have maintained open & deep USD:EUR open credit facilities. So in practice, if you are a European non-bank facing a USD margin call, you can still access the Fed repo window via your prime broker, via the ECB. If you’re a European bank with direct USD exposure (which they won’t materially have due to regulatory reasons), you’d still have access to the Fed facility. I just don’t understand OP’s thesis. \n\nAs far as the rest is concerned, the Fed action yesterday is a huge net positive for inv grade credit. I’m not screen grabbing my terminal, but go google any BBB and above bond etf. They’re surging bc the underlies are far more cash stable.  Additionally, (as far as credit mkts are concerned) when the Fed brings $1.0T to the repo mkt - which has a ‘normal’ size of $1.3T - the Fed is saying “thou shall stay liquid no matter what.” It’s bringing a nuclear bomb to a knife fight - don’t short the Fed. \n\nSide note: mother fuckers got DESTROYED shorting the Fed in 09-13 to the point it was a meme before memes were a thing.

A couple of years later, it dropped the uptick rule for all equity securities. However, the SEC still monitored naked short selling (even though naked short selling is prohibited in the U.S), and within a few years the SEC took emergency actions to limit illegal naked short selling as the mortgage crisis and credit crisis deepened and fluctuations in the market increased. In the fall of 2008, the financial crisis had spread across the world, leading countries to implement temporary short selling bans and restrictions on financial sectors securities. These countries include the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Canada and others that followed suit. (Read our tutorial on Credit Crisis to get more in-depth information on this crisis.)\n\n>\tShort selling bans have been utilized from the beginning of the financial markets and throughout history to address abuses like spreading negative rumors about a company to manipulate markets. However, many bans are repealed because short sellers have a significant role in the markets.

There's a lot of survivorship bias here - only those with outrageous gains and losses are really posting here for the lolz. \n\nI graduated in 2013 and it took me a month to find a job. It paid $35,000 to start.  I almost got fired once from another shitty job because I was lazy and unfocused and the job sucked. I make $81,000 now. My sister graduated in 2015 and it took her six months to get her first job. Now she's in advisory at PwC after working really hard and proving her worth at her first job, which only paid $40,000. \n\nIt's easy to goof off at work and be constantly on Reddit and your favorite brokerage website dicking around and not being productive, but you should first and foremost be kicking ass at your job first. That said, no matter how hard you work, you might still end being laid off due to circumstances outside of your control and the company you work for. **But don't be the fat that gets cut off because you were found to be dicking around trading options on company time or unable to keep up with your deliverables.**\n\nKick ass at what you do.

If you're neglecting your responsibilities to take on someone else's, more often than not, you're not helping your situation.  \n\nEven if your boss is an absolute cock bag, you wont get promoted without their blessing.   Do whatever you can to get on their good side (doing your job and being respectful are good places to start).

You don't have to be an expert on everything, but you do need to know your basket in and out. A lot of people here post huge gains on really obscure things that I know nothing about, and while that's great, I made a conscious decision to forsake those tendies because I know nothing about them. Make sure you focus on your circle of stonks. \n\nSecondly, the market is EXTREMELY volatile right now. That's both good and bad. Use this time to pay attention to market movements and try to find patterns. Despite what anyone says, we are most certainly in a bear market right now and a very possible recession. This means that stonks will continue to go DOWN, even if you see sharp green opens on certain days. On days that open green, try to buy puts on sale. Out of the money, and with a farther out expiration date. DO NOT trade weeklies. That's how I lost $13k last year coming straight into the market with no experience.\n\nThird, pay attention to news. CNBC, this subreddit, and other sources you're familiar with. Look at futures here: [https://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures](https://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures) . Just start learning.\n\nDon't be down man. Money comes and goes, and over the course of your life you'll see so much more that what you lost. This I promise you. Keep your head up, okay? If you're serious about this stuff, start learning. Any way you can. \n\nI learned everything by going down WSB posts and just Googling or YouTubing terms I wasn't familiar with. It sounds ridiculous, but it's worked wonders so far. Just never stop learning and be rational about your decisions. Good luck man!

Let's pretend today is Thursday, and we have a SPY put expiring tomorrow, Friday. Our strike price is 220, and the current price just dropped from 270 to 250. Your contract MAY be worth a fat load of cash because of the price movement, but if tomorrow SPY isn't under 220, your contract is WORTHLESS tomorrow because nobody will exercise it, because the contract strike price is out of the money and your contract expires THAT day. Another reason to buy far out options is because the Greek known as Theta will fuck you each day. If you don't know, Theta is the Greek that means \"all else the same.\" If all else stays the same, meaning stock price, etc., the value of your contract will decrease by X amount every day because you're getting closer to the expiration date. So if you buy a weekly contract, your theta is going to be MUCH higher than that of a contract that expires in a month or in a year.

HOWEVER, that is ASSUMING you cash out at the same time for both options. Imagine you keep the option that expires later, and the SPY price plummets to anything below 200.

Large managed accounts are buying in a tiered format after a couple down days, so that they can become profitable in the future and will (somewhat) have bought some stock during the low point.\n\n2. Short sellers are cashing in and claiming their tendies.\n\n3. Bullish investors are trying hard to create a support line, but don't realize that they are just pushing the price up to a point that some panic investors will sell out while they can on the up day.\n\n\n\nUntil the market starts stabilizing, take these green days  with a grain of salt.

That's a 61% return\n\nWorst case lets say carnival jumps 1000000000000% percent in two weeks. Still only out $100\n\n\nLets use the above example. With a call spread what you are doing is saying\n\nI will pay 1.25 per share (and they are sold in blocks of a 100) for the right to buy carnival cruise at $30 a share on/by 3/20. This cost me $125 (100x *1.25)\n\nThen I turn around and sell the rights for someone to have the right at $1.65 per share to buy carnival for $29 per share on/by 3/20. This gives me $165 (100x * 1.65)\n\n165-125=$40. However I have to put up $100 collateral because of the difference in strike price (explained later). Most brokers deduct the $40 from the sale right away and the $60 from your cash reserves\n\nSo lets say I start with 250 in my account\n\n-125 to buy the 30c call\n\n+165 at selling the 29c call\n\n-60 for collateral (explained later)\n\nLeaving us with $230 in our account. Meaning we're only out $20 at max? (huh my math above must have been wrong, or im messing up here)\n\nIn order for either of these options to break even and make money, the price has to increase by the premium paid + the strike price.\n\nWe don't want the stock to break even.\n\nFor the $30 it would be $31.25 (30+1.25)\n\nFor the $29 it would be $30.65(29+1.65)\n\nIf the stock on 3/20 is $28 both of the above options expire worthless because who in their right mind would pay 29/30 for a stock selling at 28?\n\nWhen both options expire worthless, I'm out the 125 i paid for the 30c but I'm up $165 for selling the 29c.\n\nIn addition, I get the $60 collateral back putting me at $290 in my account.\n\nWhich would put my gains at 200% (this can't be right... either i messed up my first post gains or this)\n\nNow...about that collateral. When you are offering to buy a stock at 30 and sell it for 29 you running the risk of the stock increasing and the options not expiring worthless. Since options are sold in blocks of a hundred you are down $100 (i think premiums lower amount loss? My head is fuzzy right now)\n\nSo your in order to protect against that loss, your broker subtracts the difference (30-29)*100 = $100.\n\nHowever since you just sold for a $40 they hold onto that and then take $60 from your account.\n\nNow a $0.40 premium difference is pretty insane and not common. I don't know how I got that order filled.\n\nYou are much more likely to get $0.10-$0.20 which changes the formula. Lets say there is a $0.15 difference between strikes.\n\nLets say I was only able to sell the 29c for $1.40\n\nSo lets say I start with 250 in my account\n\n-125 to buy the 30c call\n\n+140 at selling the 29c call\n\n-85 for collateral (risk is still $100, but as the premium difference is less more is collected)\n\nLeaves us with $180 in our account. $70 put up for a max gain of $15, or ~ 21%", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "> So lets say I start with 250 in my account\n> \n> -125 to buy the 30c call\n> \n> +165 at selling the 29c call\n> \n> -60 for collateral (explained later)\n> \n> Leaving us with $230 in our account. Meaning we're only out $20 at max? (huh my math above must have been wrong, or im messing up here)\n\nShould be -100 for collateral, since the 40 that offsets it is coming from the difference between the two premiums of the options you're working with.\n\nTo make the math easier, assume you start with $100.

IVE BEEN TRYING TO BOOK A CRUISE LIKE AN AUTIST ALL DAY WAITING FOR A DISCOUNT, JUST NOW THEY MADE IT UNAVAILABLE TO BOOK ANYTHING.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProof of yolo trade:\n\n[https://imgur.com/1lGkVBJ](https://imgur.com/1lGkVBJ)\n\nDon't doubt your vibe...few times in life you get information before others :)\n\nEdit 2: lmfaoo.. this is insane, THEY JUST DID IT.\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/13/2000512/0/en/Norwegian-Cruise-Line-Holdings-Ltd-Announces-Voluntary-Suspension-of-Voyages.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/13/2000512/0/en/Norwegian-Cruise-Line-Holdings-Ltd-Announces-Voluntary-Suspension-of-Voyages.html)\n\nEdit 3: MONDAY UPDATE\\* Premarket this stock was up 14% early Friday and down 13% early monday, seriously an insane ride of emotions... I honestly had the worse weekend thinking about this because I agree with some of the commenters that much of this stock was already priced in...when I placed the trade, I thought I had the information of a lifetime, and acted on it with autistic confidence...lesson learned, to truly make money, you have to decipher the information, worst/best case scenarios before people are even aware, and take options as accordingly. Like one commenter mentioned below, this was like trying to eat what little is left in the bone.\n\nLUCKILY, within the first 15 minutes (after circuit breaker) I liquidated all my options in chunks on this play as fast as I could, even at some losses/market price vs my buy price as I felt super uneasy with the movement and had the gut feeling it would spike up (which it did around moving closer to 10a and up. It may still tank, but I think it's a strong investor buy. It has heavy resistance to break $9.50, so the downside is not worth the attempt from an options standpoint. Luckily I was able to leave this position when the stock was still down, however, I did lose approx. $2500.00 from premium BUT I am honestly SUPER happy at the end result because after Friday's close, like most mentioned, the stock was up 10% AH...and would have been like that Monday if we had a green day, I think if not for the red day, I would have been slaughtered....the entire weekend was super hard for me, I was hoping for some recovery which happened, this stock held up really well even with a massive red day...if you're a long term holder, I would consider even buying this one as I believe it's at its bottom.\n\nI would also note, personally, I've decided I'll never trade going into the weekend anymore, don't have the shirt for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnote 1: I would also note, personally, I've decided I'll never trade going into the weekend anymore, don't have the shirt for it..literally was surfing news relentlessly hoping the winds would change and probably was my most unproductive weekend ever.\n\nnote2: Be super careful with short and long puts, this situation can drastically change on information, and the money can disappear in an instant. With the amount of minds looking for a solution, the market is pricing in every bit of news each market day.  Be fking grateful with what you have made thus far as a gay bear and manage risk, I almost really fked up.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "fi4boa", "created_utc": 1584124243.0, "score": 1236, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 428, "comments": [{"body": "Proof motherfucker, where is it!", "score": 258, "replies": [{"body": "Try to book any room in the USA.\n\n [https://www.ncl.com/](https://www.ncl.com/)", "score": 185, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 169, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck so we missed the boat on this one", "score": 190, "replies": [{"body": "Li-te-ra-leh", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "wrong", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "OP probably caused the halt.

Like one commenter mentioned below, this was like trying to eat what little is left in the bone.\n\nLUCKILY, within the first 15 minutes (after circuit breaker) I liquidated all my options in chunks on this play as fast as I could, even at some losses/market price vs my buy price as I felt super uneasy with the movement and had the gut feeling it would spike up  (which it did around moving closer to 10a and up. It may still tank, but I think it's a strong investor buy. It has heavy resistance to break $9.50, so the downside is not worth the attempt from an options standpoint. Luckily I was able to leave this position when the stock was still down, however, I did lose approx. $2500.00 from premium BUT I am honestly SUPER happy at the end result because after Friday's close like most mentioned, the stock was up 10% AH...and would have been like that Monday if we had a green day, I think if not for the red day, I would have been slaughtered....the entire weekend was super hard for me, I was hoping for some recovery which happened, this stock held up really well even with a massive red day...if your a long term holder, I would consider even buying this one as I believe it's at its bottom.\n\nnote 1: I would also note, personally, I've decided I'll never trade going into the weekend anymore, don't have the shirt for it..literally was surfing news relentlessly hoping the winds would change and probably was my most unproductive weekend ever.\n\nnote2: Be super careful with short and long puts, this situation can drastically change on information, you aren't just dealing with the most brilliant minds trying to solve the problem in the USA but the world now and I wouldn't put all your money against them... the money can disappear in an instant.
