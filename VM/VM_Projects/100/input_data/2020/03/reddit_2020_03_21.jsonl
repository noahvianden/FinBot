Not price-of-food inflation as some expected; but when you give money to rich people, the price of things that rich people buy, rises.\n> \n> Ask yourself this: what would've happened to risk asset prices over the past 11 years if the Fed didn't do any QE at all? Or even if they just did one round in 08/09, and didn't do QE2/3/NotQE/current QE?\n\nIt's likely that the market would be lower than it currently is. Or, we could be in a deflationary environment and it would be vastly lower. But, no one really knows. Would you have preferred that the Fed never did QE? Where do YOU think we'd would we be at today? Your phrasing makes it sound like you actually think the economy would be doing better if the Fed never started 'printing money'. There isn't some huge conspiracy to create a bubble or devalue the dollar and its definitely not the doomsday scenario that the original poster described. The Fed is supposed to support private banks and the economy.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "The treasury is the one that prints the physical paper bills, yes.

In Marxian economic theory the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism.The German sociologist Werner Sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work Krieg und Kapitalismus (War and Capitalism, 1913). In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation (German: Vernichtung) implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.In Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942), Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx's thought (to which the whole of Part I of the book is devoted), arguing (in Part II) that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system (see below).\n\n***\n\n^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/options/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Congrats on your startup.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 23rd, 2020.\n\n# **Another harrowing week looms for markets as US economy shuts down and virus spreads  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/another-harrowing-week-looms-for-markets-as-us-economy-shuts-down-and-virus-spreads.html)**\n*****\n> Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.\n*****\n> The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.\n*****\n> As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.\n*****\n> “The Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. ”$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.”\n*****\n> # Sharp recession\n> In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.\n*****\n> Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.\n*****\n> Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.\n*****\n> “We’re going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we’re going to get a clearer picture,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he’s watching the PMI data. “This data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it’s sell first, ask questions later.”\n*****\n> Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.\n*****\n> “I expect that we’ll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don’t think we’re going to see that in the next few weeks at least,” said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.\n*****\n> # More Fed Artillery\n> Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.\n*****\n> The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar’s run on Friday.\n*****\n> As the world’s reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.\n*****\n> “I think the market is going to be looking for indications that there’s some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we’re not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,” said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. “I’m watching what’s going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.”\n*****\n> # ‘Liquidity infinity’\n> Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.\n*****\n> John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed’s actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. “Things are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can’t take it anymore,” he said.\n*****\n> “The amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ...

As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&P 500 Index didn’t ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn’t yet reflect it.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive—the S&P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.\n\n*****\n\n# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds\n\n> We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook—visibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases—remains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.\n\n> We’re getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession—almost surely coming soon—and to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week—the amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.\n\n> The last box—markets pricing in recession—was also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.\n\n> Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n> “Stocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,” noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “When comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.”\n\n> The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.\n\n> The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We know it’s tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.\n\n*****\n\n# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?\n\n> The market volatility continues, as the S&P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we’ll take another angle on this.\n\n> We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn’t. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? “Historically we’ve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That’s the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.”\n\n> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-18-20-Bear-mkt-recoveries-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear\n\n> The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.\n\n> With the S&P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.\n\n> What happens next? “Clearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We’d like to stress, we don’t know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stocks-3.17.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns\n\n> Even though equities rose today, the S&P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/Image-38.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Oil Slippery\n\n> Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!\n\n> While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-WTI.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record\n\n> While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031920-Russell-200.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Buck's Bounce\n\n> In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**\n\n> This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**\n\n> In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-abs-Day-Change.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 20th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOzzG6Qk28))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.22.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=744D8neX74s))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$MU** \n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$NKE** \n> * **$PAYS** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$PAYX** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$ONTX** \n> * **$CSIQ** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$INFO** \n> * **$GO** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$LX** \n> * **$SCVL** \n> * **$SNX** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$BWAY** \n> * **$AEYE** \n> * **$KBH** \n> * **$RKDA** \n> * **$FDS** \n> * **$ERJ** \n> * **$PRGS** \n> * **$OPGN** \n> * **$SCS** \n> * **$NEOG** \n> * **$PUMP** \n> * **$HYRE** \n> * **$AIR** \n> * **$MYOS** \n> * **$LIQT** \n> * **$SAIC** \n> * **$SCWX** \n> * **$ESLT** \n> * **$VTSI** \n> * **$OCGN** \n> * **$QIWI** \n> * **$WOR** \n> * **$TNP** \n> * **$HTHT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K1bLbWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/107ZeJs.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.23.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NfAAUPz.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.23.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/z5JU3Mu.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gat7EsR.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ts5W5Ym.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJwu9pN.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zXXW3Uq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/L4hm0cl.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ieFs9fM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s8zrA0y.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.27.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $36.11\n> **Micron Technology, Inc.

If the share price goes up the contract price goes down.\nIf 17 April rolls around and you’re in the money it’ll close and you’ll assign those 100 shares to the guy who sold the put. If it is not in the money (e.g. share price is $80 or above) the contract expires worthless and you lose the $580.\nNow this goes both ways, let’s say you want to buy 100 share DIS and you’re happy to pay $80. You could SELL a put. If it hits $80 at expiration you’ll buy the shares ($8k) AND pocket the premium. The risk is tho if they go to $60 then you pay $7.5k when you could have paid $6k.

So far, her predictions has come through, and she's made a lot of money on buying Tesla puts.

They found the disease in around 1% of the general population over a period of a couple weeks (reported 1 week ago) - an implied per-capita rate twentyfold that of the country's official diagnoses at the time of reporting (which in turn has involved one of the most aggressive testing regimes in the world). Over half had no symptoms whatsoever, and the rest, generally just a minor cold.  \nIn an experiment which started several weeks ago, Italy tested the entire town of Vò in a series of rounds and successfully eradicated the disease from the town. Again, this is one of the few cases of experiments of testing of the general population rather than suspect cases. 3% of the population was determined as infected during the first round. 50-75% of them were entirely asymptomatic. Most of the rest had only minor cold symptoms and did not suspect that they had the disease. During the study, asymptomatic cases usually remained asymptomatic, and most minor cases remained minor.  \nThe net picture is that the disease was already widespread even several weeks ago; that people with no symptoms whatsoever are the majority; and of those with symptoms, symptoms so minor that people don't get tested are by far the most common. To match with the death rate (as severe cases almost always get tested), a widespread disease in the population implies a low IFR (infection fatality rate), and implies that places with overloaded medical systems are overloaded not because the disease sends a large percent of its victims to the hospital, but because a large percent of the population has already gotten infected. This implies that the disease will tend to play itself out sooner.  \nAs mentioned, the other study I mentioned (still preliminary) estimated that Wuhan hit a 19% infection rate at its peak, and that the disease had a non-time-delay IFR of 0,04% and a time-delay IFR of 0,12%. They also found (as others have) that the disease is highly prone to nosocomical transmission (spread inside hospitals and clinics, generally by staff) - that is to say, prone to spread to the most vulnerable of patients.

I have serious doubts about any investment thesis that uses technical analysis as its foundation. It would be hard to argue that charts don’t matter though  — even if only as a leading indicator for herd mentality.\n\nTo your last point though, about algorithmic trading, I’m sure many of these algorithms are based on tried-and-true investing heuristics, but I’m also sure that most of them were coded between 2008 and today. No doubt the developers back-tested their algorithms against every bit of historical data they could get their hands on — bull market, bear market, bubble, crash, inflation, deflation — if it’s happened, they tested it. \n\nThat’s not nearly enough though. New, unexpected things happen all the time. So to really test their systems they can’t rely on history alone. No doubt they have entire business units dedicated to Monte Carlo simulations. They model as many many different hypotheticals as they can imagine, tweaking the input parameters to study how their systems will respond.\n\nBut there’s something about production-hardened code. It’s extremely difficult to code for hypothetical edge cases. The incentives are aligned to get some of the smartest people in the world working on algorithmic trading, and no doubt they’ve poured more resources into testing and proving their systems than most of us could imagine. \n\nHowever... software is messy. There is no way to test for every possible combination of inputs. They use Bayesian statistical models to inform the edge cases they should focus on, but for the past decade-plus (several lifetimes in software development cycle)  those analyses would bias toward a bull market.

That's how fast the coronavirus spreads. So basically, there will be a lockdown of important sectors. Guaranteed. The US might be hit worse than Europe, I have not seen a country see 50% growth figures while they're already at so many cases, which indicates that they're still catching up with testing. New cases in the US yesterday were at the same level as new cases in Italy, indicating that total cases in the US are already at a similar level to Italy, if you'd use the same testing criteria (not sure which one tests less, to be honest). Globally, we're eyeing 1 million pretty soon. The virus is hitting Latin America and Asia. The realization that summer won't make the virus disappear is not completely priced in yet, I think. It will take some more growth in cases in Malaysia or a Latin American country before that gets priced in.\n\nOther investors have the same problem, they cannot fathom that shit is hitting the fan right now in the US, and if they can understand it, they cannot fully intuit what exponential growth actually means.

There was false hope with the Nike earnings imo. Yes it included China's dealings with the virus but it wasn't a worldwide shutdown like it is now. Second thing the market is looking towards isn't necessarily case count or deaths with the virus but more so on ending it. I think everyone has realized the world is relatively fucked by this. This realistically happens by either waiting it out til a **treatment AND vaccine** are made **OR** herd immunity starts to kick in.

Boomers are buying based on the Stim bill passing the house not knowing its priced in.\n\nVolume still very very low while climbing. Once the MMs come in at EOD, its gunna fucking DROP. Possibly 3-4%\n\nWe should've went passed yesterdays resistance ($260) already. The fact  that we haven't is also a huge sign. Gunna bounce off HARD on $260, thus  creating a new low and a lower high.\n\nIf I'm correct about this EOD, expect a bloody monday that will start green then drill", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "The price action. Today I’m sure you noticed we stalled at specific prices on our way up, $255, $257 and $260. Those prices were the “resistance”, and when you break through a resistance price the stock price goes upwards towards the next resistance.\n\nAt EOD, we drilled from a high of $260 all the way down to around $252/253, thus blowing through TWO supports ($255 and $257) \n\nStocks don’t go straight down. They can drill for a while but not for long, they must go up eventually. \n\nWe are not in the same market we were in when the coronavirus scare first began. Volume is much lower,\nand “stable” in a way. Still volatile af, but less volume makes these dramatic swings less likely to happen in a short period of time like the last 3 weeks. \n\nSo why will it be green at first? Normal everyday people will see today’s close as a buying opportunity on Monday. They may think stocks are on sale and they’re just “Buying the dip”. Not a bad idea, but they’re too early. These buyers will bring us to the last support we broke through ($255) and we’ll drill down from there on to the $247 support. \n\nNote, the open can also be RED, but we will rally to around $255, then drop from there towards the $247 support. \n\nThe MMs showed us the future. They do not believe our market should go above today’s high. This virus will get worse and they are now in the process of pricing it in.\n\nYou ever hear of “buy the rumor sell the news”? This drill is the rumor. We passed the stim bill today in the house so “WHY DID WE DROP?!”. It’s because this bill is priced in already. Anyone buying now is buying the news. They will lose. \n\n\nIn conclusion/TLDR: Stonks go up and down. Price action today suggests that $260 was too high to break through. MMs and other investors knew this and waited till the end to dump. Today was basically a giant bull trap. \n\nOn Monday they will do the same but it’ll happen rapidly at open. We will have another bull trap all the way up to the last resistance ($255) then start drilling from there to $247 and below. I expect this next week to be red and green with a trend going towards SPY $180 by the end of April. \n\nThis is not to be taken as fact.

Obviously, there is some risk associated with doing this as you probably won't time the top exactly and higher interest rates could cause your bond to decrease in value in the short term, but I'm assuming in this scenario you are effectively trying to use bonds as a hedge. \n\nWait until the interest rates of bonds are roughly what you expect inflation to be and then start buying bonds with a long duration. Keep using the top up method, reinvesting dividends, or the transfer strategy to keep the bond percentage of your portfolio steady as bond yields increase. Then as the market falls and interest rates on bonds drop, you should see the bond section of your portfolio start to gain in value. Depending on the situation you can then either use the bonds as a form of liquidity to keep you afloat or to buy the dip. \n\nI'm pretty sure this is the logic behind modern portfolio theory and why you should have bonds. So I'm not really sure that section of your post holds up unless something truly crazy is happening in the bond markets and even bonds with higher percent returns and long duration are losing value. \n\nFor anyone on here who doesn't understand why as bond yield increases the value of your bond decreases or vice versa, it is because when you buy a bond you get a percentage return promised. So, if  the rates of bonds on the market increases but you want to sell your bond and not wait until maturity, the value of your bond decreases because why would someone want to buy your bond with a lower interest rate when they could buy the bonds that are currently on the market with higher interest rates? Similarly as interest rates fall on bonds, your bond that has a higher interest rate is worth more.

I hadn't given much thought to that. It definitely makes it harder to have a bond that is going to match inflation or even do slightly better. I'm just hoping America doesn't try to go negative, and that maybe during the next bull market they will have learned their lesson and put interest rates back where they belong.\n\n>raising interest rates when everyone has low interest stuff will fuck shit up. from what i can understand.\n\nYes, the longer the duration of the bond the more changes in interest rates effect it. I mean you will always get what you are promised if you hold it until maturity, but if you want to sell it early, you need to make the price worth it. Why buy your shitty 1% interest bond from you when the government is offering 3% interest? The only way someone is going to take that deal is you make it worth it for them. \n\nThis might not seem too important if you are planning on holding bonds until maturity since you get what you pay for, but from what I understand a lot of firms use bonds for liquidity reasons which is why even when they have negative interest rates in Europe people still buy them.
