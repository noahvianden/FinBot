{"title": "Market going back up to the MOON tomorrow, all your puts going to 0", "selftext": "On Thursday I called that Friday would be the bottom of the market, the SP500 would hit near 2850 and bounce back up. I was on WSB discord and EVERYONE was laughing at me when I said I was buying SPY calls. Well keep fucking laughing while your puts expire worthless tomorrow. Look at the charts and see for yourself.\n\n(EDIT: Im calling for a big bounce this week, not a bull market to ATH. You gay bears can have the fun next week. At the end of this week we may still close flat or red).\n\nLets look at the 15 minute chart of the S&P500. Inverse head and shoulders pattern, stocks going up. Buy calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onvps9fgbdk41.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db767e064c84977fc8f5f484dbfc38a33a316b1\n\nNow lets look at the daily chart below. The S&P 500 chart today easily broke above the 200 DMA, that is a good sign for the bulls. Next resistance ahead is the 3139 level which is the 9 DMA.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryz6lgxxbdk41.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=529ff7f83174621a9c3b3cfcdbd97b82c788abe3\n\nLets look at the 60 minute chart (below). There is some resistance at the red line around the 3129 level. This is close to the 3139 level on the daily chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6x4fgshccdk41.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7891a4beb11a11d1c36bd8fb0f21ad652a878f1\n\nSeems like tomorrow there will be a big resistance zone between the 3129-3139 level. If the S&P 500 can break above that level, then the next resistance is 3168 (100 DMA), but honestly I think itll just shoot right over it and go for 3263 level (50 DMA). Here is the reason why, look at this last chart below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/03bf0e6scdk41.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=391838680758d0d004219ef805de917d0a6be9b4\n\nThis chart shows the ratio of puts to calls in the market.\n\nMore than 1 means more people buying puts. Anything above 1.1 is getting too risky and 1-sided. Anything above 1.2 is extreme\n\nLess than 1 means  more people buying calls. Anything below 0.8 is extreme.\n\nLook at this fucking chart, people are STILL holding onto their puts that were bought last week. The ratio today closed at 1.29, which is at the same level that we had on Thursday and Friday.\n\n**MOST PEOPLE HAVE NOT TAKEN PROFITS ON THEIR PUTS FROM LAST WEEK.**\n\nTomorrow the market will open higher and LOTS of people will be selling their puts to cut their losses, which will bring the market much higher. We will go way past the 100 DMA (3168 level), we just need to break above the strong 3129-3139 level, then we go to the moon.\n\nTLDR: Everyone in this subreddit is fucking autistic and is still holding puts (thanks to Robinhood). Market opening higher tomorrow.\n\nEDIT: My call option position [https://imgur.com/1NC0lRs](https://imgur.com/1NC0lRs)\n\nEDIT 2: My previous post calling the bottom last week [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faloru/we\\_are\\_close\\_to\\_the\\_bottom\\_buy\\_spy\\_calls\\_soon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faloru/we_are_close_to_the_bottom_buy_spy_calls_soon/)\n\nEDIT 3: So many people pissed off and downvoting this to the ground.
