My plan was to close it around 50% profit.\n\nInstead, the market plummeted, and now the entire spread is way ITM. Expiration is in a couple of weeks.\n\nI had originally figured on rolling the spread out a couple of months in hopes that the market recovers somewhat, and then roll it again as needed. At current volatility, each roll will cost around $1200-ish. Not great, but better than losing the whole amount at once.\n\nBut it just occurred to me that it might be better to split the spread, sell the long puts now and roll just the short puts with some of the proceeds.\n\nSince the spread is way ITM, to close it outright would cost around $12,500.\n\nBut if I were to roll the short puts out a couple of months (at a cost of a couple of grand) then I could sell the long puts for around $300k.\n\nNow obviously that leaves me with big exposure on the short puts. Currently I have $800k in marginable purchasing power so I should be able to at least hold that big of a short position unless the market tanks a lot further and the margin requirements change. Currently my broker has a $120k margin requirement for one SPX short put, though I wouldn't be surprised to see that number increase.\n\nThe other problem is that unless I want to face a margin call, I probably couldn't use any of the proceeds from the long put sale - it would probably need to be collateral for the short puts until those expire or are exercised.\n\nI'm not looking to YOLO here, just manage a bad position into something less crappy.\n\nAny helpful suggestions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[edited for clarity\\]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If both legs are itm, you will have an offsetting position, but since SPX is cash settled this is a moot point, you cannot be assigned SPX.\n\nLegging out of a trade by selling the long put alone is very risky.

Rules of thumb say around 2% of your account give or take.\n\nOk, with a long put you can simply purchase one or more that add up to this value. Good, but sets some upper limit.\n\nAnother thought is what is significant about 3/20? That is 4 days away. The trade off is that short dated options are cheaper, but for a given distance from the money they will have a bit less delta, more gamma, and much more theta decay.\n\nThis means it will not do well if the move comes too slowly. The value of your put will evaporate faster than the short delta will help you. But if the move is sudden and fierce down again, the gamma will kick in and you could multiply your money quickly.\n\nLet’s compare 2 puts here, the 220 strike 4 days out and same delta put 32 days out.\n\nAt 4 days the delta is 21 and the cost roughly $600 per contract. Theta is expected to eat $100 per day and accelerate. So you will need spy to move down about $5 per day to about keep up. Changes in IV notwithstanding, though options close to expiration are less sensitive here.\n\nAt 32 days the 21 delta put is the 205 strike trading at about $970. It has an estimated $25 of theta decay per day. Obviously this gives you a lot more time to be wrong, but it also costs more, will not accelerate in value as quickly if you are right (less gamma) and is also more vulnerable to a drop in IV.\n\nIs the 20ish delta put what you want? I dunno. Depends what you want to spend. I would not buy a put based on where you think the price will end up, and when. I would buy it based on your risk tolerance, desired delta, theta, and vega (IV) risk.\n\nMy own opinion: short dated out of the money options are lottery tickets.

Increases mean more uncertainty and option prices are more expensive.  Vice versa for decreases in volatility.

What that means is that the market sets the price of the option, and the IV and all the greeks are calculated based on that price.  So price comes first.

You will always pay more money for more time.\n\nHowever, in terms of the volatility of the underlying over the life of the option that the price of the option is implying (that's a mouthful), in general, from what I have seen, short dated contracts can often be considered 'more expensive'.  I say that in quotes because as I mentioned, the absolute prices are less, but the price you are paying for a move over such a small amount of time is what's 'expensive'.\n\nThis may not really matter as the underlying stock moves though, due to gamma, as is mentioned in the comment I linked. In extreme cases (like what you see on wallstreetbets), you could see returns on the order of hundreds of percent.  So what you thought was expensive turned out not to be.\n\nWhat really is the killer though, is whether or not an option is just too far OTM for gamma to make a difference.  For this you would look at how small delta is, and where the stock would have to move for gamma to have a profitable effect on delta.\n\n>...is extrinsic value actually a positive thing is what i think i am asking.\n\nI hope by now you can get a clearer picture that it is neither good nor bad.  It depends on what trade you are making and why.\n\n**Protip:** if you really want to internalize the way all of this is interconnected, fire up excel and see if you can create your own black scholes calculator for the price of any option, the greeks, and implied volatility.

{"title": "This is how you know if a stock is a buy", "selftext": "A lot of people buy stocks because it feels right and they think the company will be around for a while.\n\nWhen you buy a stock you’re buying into the company therefore you want to look at several factors rather than just go with your gut, if you don’t look at the following factors then you’re better off buying mutual funds or index funds such as VOO and QQQ.\n\nLet’s proceed:\n\n1. Pull up the balance sheet for the last quarter, the last year and the last 5 years. Look at 2 categories, assets (money/money making investments)and liabilities (debt/long term expenses)\n\nThe total assets should be 2x or more of the total liabilities. The short term assets should also be about 1.5-2x the short term liabilities. If the balance sheet looks good move onto #2, if not move onto the next company.\n\nTHIS ALONE CUTS HALF THE STOCKS MOST PEOPLE “FEEL LIKE ARE A GOOD BUY”\n\n2) Ok so you found a company with a good balance sheet, great! Now let’s look at the historical earnings, look at these for the past 10 years. Are the quarterly earnings growing steadily like you want them to be? Or are there huge peaks and valleys showing a more volatile company? Are they trending downwards showing the company is losing money consistently? Or are they flat/slowly growing showing a steady but boring company?\n\nIf the historical quarterly earnings over 10 years are steadily growing, that’s what you want. So move onto 3)...\n\n3) now let’s look at the EPS, this is how much you’re paying for the earnings you receive. Lower is generally better, anything over 20PE is considered high. Look at Ford to see an extremely high PE showing an extremely overvalued company, even at $5 a share!\n\n4) Does the company pay a dividend? This means the company pays you money, typically quarterly, to hold their stock. Not always necessary because a lot of high growth tech stocks don’t but you make a ton due to natural growth, but a dividend is nice.\n\nThis will get you started. If you don’t do this for every stock you want to buy then you’re just buying stocks based on emotion and what you “think” looks good on a chart, and you will lose money more often than not.\n\nEDIT: I feel the need to say this is NOT a one size fits all, this is just a good way to find out the value of a company. \n\nAmazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Tesla, etc. do not follow this formula, but this can tell you how to price companies like airlines.", "id": "fj6f6y", "created_utc": 1584298689.0, "score": 480, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Excellent advice on how to get started the right way.
