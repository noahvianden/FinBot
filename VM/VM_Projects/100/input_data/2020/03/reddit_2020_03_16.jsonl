On my flight back to NJ 5 days later, my flight was only at 1/5 capacity; I had a whole row of 6 seats to myself.  This route is the only non-stop from NJ to John Wayne (SNA) in CA; I have never seen it NOT at capacity in the 6 years I've flown this route.  Travel is going to grind to a halt. Hotels are going to be vacant. Restaurants are going to be closed. Retail stores are going to see decreased foot traffic. Uber and Lyft volume are down. My daughter's school just announced a two week closure. Parents are going to have to call out of work and use their PTO. The point: people are going to lose jobs and lose income and this is going to dry up consumer spending.  \n\nEconomic activity is going to contract, but the worst part is that we have a slim social safety net for tens of millions of Americans and that net is about to be stretched to its limits. People are going to lose their income. People are going to lose their cars. People are going to lose their homes. My wife works in a school and she is telling me how heartbreaking it was discussing how they are going to feed the kids that are on free and reduced lunch programs. Yes, they are planning on how to feed these kids for the next two weeks as we go into a shutdown.\n\nDenmark and other EU countries are announcing aid packages for their workers knowing that the slowed economic activity is going to absolutely push many low and even middle income people to the limits.  The US has no plan to help average Americans; not healthcare wise, not economically, not anything.  Average Americans are basically being told \"Sorry, you're on your own.\"\n\nYou may feel OK with a nice rainy day fund and a few thousand dollars -- maybe tens or hundreds of thousands in savings -- but a big, big chunk of your fellow Americans are about to be fucked.\n\nWouldn't you think Netflix should be up? Everyone's going to be at home! NO! NFLX is the first non-essential people are going to cut once they start running out of money. As money dries up, every non-essential is going to get cut to the core. That's why the entire market is contracting: everyone is anticipating that consumer spending and economic activity is going to completely and utterly dry up in the next few months. In my 38 year lifetime, I've never seen any situation like this. There has never been a situation where large portions of the American population working hourly jobs are going to be out of work for potentially weeks if not months.\n\nThe economic fallout of this event is going to be absolutely crippling. If you are optimistic, you are dead ass wrong. If we were handling this like Taiwan or South Korea, I would be somewhat optimistic that we could contain this and get back to a normal pace by Q3.

At some point, even Fox News and Rush Limbaugh aren't going to be able to claim that this is a liberal hoax because the evidence will be right at the peoples' door step.  [Devin Nunes is still telling people everything is OK; go out and go to bars and restaurants](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fj3z72/devin_nunes_just_went_on_fox_news_and_told/).\n\nLook [at this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjjlb3/things_to_do_in_dallas_this_week_stay_the_fuck/) and see reports from folks talking about people still going out and gathering.  Look at what happened in O'Hare after Trump closed all inbound flights without warning.  We're going to get a big outbreak in the next few weeks as we catch up to Italy.\n\nThen people start dying either directly as a result of complications from the virus or lack of access to medical care.  Finally, a good portion of the citizenry will wise up and decide they don't want to die and quarantine.  Right now, I think the warming spring weather has thrown a curve.  Had this happened in the middle of winter, we'd see a different reaction.  I think this process will take 2-3 weeks before every state realizes how bad this is.\n\nI'm in NJ and we've been progressing fast.  Last Thursday, my kid's school called a half day on Friday.  On Friday, they called two weeks.  Now Governor is extending it statewide and curfew at 8 PM.  I think he is seeing what's happening in the hospitals in North Jersey where they have the biggest outbreak ([read this account from the CEO of the hospital if you want to know how bad this really is](https://www.roi-nj.com/2020/03/14/opinion/life-at-the-epicenter-of-n-j-s-coronavirus-outbreak/); he has 1 adult isolette and he's ordering *50 more*).\n\nSo by April, most of the country will probably be in lock down as we try to contain the spread.  My current guess is that my kids are not finishing school this year.  The means that after April, we're still going to be in lock down through June because there's really no answer at this point other than letting it fizzle out through isolation.  That means the economy is fucked through summer at least.\n\nThen the questions are:\n\n1. How likely is it that isolation will work and everyone will follow protocol voluntarily?  If it works well, it can fizzle out like in China where ***enforced isolation*** stopped the spread.\n2. How likely is it that we get some counter measure by Fall?  There are several teams progressing right now, but my guess is that the earliest approved treatments are probably still minimum 9 months away if they fast track the approval process.\n3. How likely is it that we get some real economic relief other than tax cuts and 0 interest?\n\nThere are really no other ways out of this.  UK's \"herd immunity\" experiment is basically \"let's let 2-5% of our population die\" (that's not the death rate from CV; that's factoring in that hospital systems are going to be overloaded and many other medical needs are going to go unmet).\n\nMy take?  We're not back to normal until 2021 because unless they declare martial law, it will be impossible to achieve the necessary isolation to cause the virus to fizzle.  So we're basically waiting for more science to give us a solution.\n\nI think no matter what, we are witnessing a history altering event in terms of our form of government.

However, as many observers have noted, many humans have a nearly-overpowering instinct to \"buy high, sell low\", and therefore lose money: \n\nWhen a stock is moving upward really fast, people tend to think \"wow - what a great stock - it's going to infinity - I'd better buy some before it gets higher\" (also called Fear of Missing Out or FOMO). \n\nHowever when a stock is dropping (especially if it's dropping rapidly), many people get a strong urge to sell, reasoning one of two ways: (1) wow - it's going much lower - I'd better lock in my gains / limit my losses\", or (2) \"hey, I've got a great idea - since it's 'obviously' going much lower, I can sell my stock now, and buy back later to get more stock\". (Shortsellers have similar sentiments but in the opposite direction, complicated by the fact that they have to consider factors such as margin calls.)\n\nThe problem is that nobody knows for sure when the bottom will come, and the only way to really know when the stock hits bottom is looking back after it's gone back up. So it's certain that many people will end up selling at just the wrong time, just before the stock goes back up, and end up doing worse than they could have (losing more money, or making less money). And the risk of selling just before the bottom becomes greater and greater the lower the stock goes.\n\nThe actual bottom comes right about the time when everyone who can be persuaded to sell has sold (and the shortsellers have shorted all the stock they dare to short). If that happens rapidly and forcefully, it's called a \"capitulation\".\n\nStock prices are ultimately driven by the sentiment of the buyers and sellers. There seem to be more and more people in this subreddit talking about getting out of their long positions, or selling now with the hope of buying back later at a lower price. The people who are doubtful about owning TSLA are being flushed out. That doesn't tell when the stock will hit bottom, but it does indicate that the stock is moving along the natural progression toward a bottom.\n\nThe bottom in the price of a stock can be rounded (gradual change in sentiment) or V-shaped (relatively abrupt change in sentiment). The significant amount of panic here and in the market shows a possibility that sentiment is drifting further away from economic fundamentals, so the predictions of very low stock prices will turn out later to be less and less accurate. Under those conditions, some significant good news (or reduction in the rate of bad news) could cause a V-shaped recovery - which is pretty much what happened to TSLA in mid-2019. The more the panic, the sharper the eventual recovery in stock prices.\n\nMore people seem confident that the expected loss of several months of productivity will lead to a \"depression\" indicating strong and increasingly negative sentiment that may not be accurately indicating the future functioning of the economy, and possibly indicating that the market won't go as low as some people think.\n\nOthers are welcome to buy and sell as they see fit, but be aware that the lower the prices go, the greater the risk involved in tricky maneuvers. Tesla is an unusual company in that it has really outstanding long-term prospects, which should drive stock prices (years from now) many times higher than they are now.

With less than two hours left before the close of the week, markets and traders began to look nervous as if they were going to rollover and puke again from the lack of availability of dramamine at drugstores. Trump's to speak at 3:30 or so concerning a state of emergency for the coronavirus that has brought the world to a state of panic. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere he goes, he's at the podium.. markets start to tank again. S&P down over 2% since he started talking 3 minutes ago.  Everybody who's short the market starts to feel like winners, and they all start believing in their abilities to outsmart the madness of crowds and forecast market events on multiple timescales.  Just as soon as the last holdouts FOMO their bearish positions on for the coming crash, and the shorts add to their blossoming gains, the market rips 1.4% in less than a minute. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat did he say?!? The speech sounds generic and pasted from a 2D pastel edu pamphlet circa 83'. Market rallies another 1.5%, moving noticably quicker than the words from the podium. What's the big deal? Market gaps up half a percent on a single tick. Green basis points flashing growth-rates that remind you of the corona counter ticker you just saw on twitter. Wtf is going on? I can't close now.. I can't do anything now.... It's too fast.  When is it going to reverse?  Just then you notice the calm demeanor of the lecturn, the parading of CEOs, and you finally get a glimpse into the perspective of someone who could be buying. This isn't the end of the markets, this guy's going to get elected again. It's not a complete shift to communism. Right??  F that, this thing is still screwed, the corona, the zombie companies, the debt. It's all coming home to roost. Hold those shorts...  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMarket's green over 5%..  It was just 10 minutes ago or so you thought we were crashing.  This is crazy. +6% People start dumping shorts & puts trying to break even or limit the P/L that just turned negative. Permabulls think we just bottomed so they throw everything they have into the rally. Short margin calls go popping off across desks and platforms all over the world. Absolute panic buying sets in and all those shorts throw in the bloody towel. The massive put holders from the week look shakingly at their losses that were just gains, they liquidate.  No time to figure out the next week right now or anything.  Just get me out! Can't you see my tonsils, damn it!  Market closes, finally..  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nUp 9.5% on the day, wtf just happened? Glad I got out of that position before it turned into a bigger loss, bears say..  So glad I got in before the end of the rally, bulls say..  Not knowing that they're both fk'd...  Market's going to gap down 7% and lay a big fat -18% the next Monday, just in time for the bulls to sell bottom, and the bears to double down on their barely profitable trades they re-entered back at -11%, and then in the midst of complete pandemonium, the market rips & lands us back to end the day at -7%, right where it started.

According to that website you so kindly linked, in the year 2016-2017 they had an estimated flu rate of 29,000,000 cases, 553,000 were hospitalized. So if COVID were to infect the same rate at which the flu has and we know that 20% of patients need to be in hospital for a MINIMUM of 2 weeks to be treated with oxygen that would mean that 5,800,000 people in the United States will require hospital care within the next 6-9 months.\n\nIt is estimated that the United States has a total of 45,000 beds in the ENTIRE country. So lets reiterate, if it were to infect at the same rate as flu, 5,800,000 people will require beds within the next 6-9 months in a country that only has 45,000 beds nation wide, if these patients do not receive hospital care to be treated with supplemental oxygen than it is very likely they will die or be left with life altering conditions.\n\nSources\n\n* Hospital Beds:\nhttps://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/14/21179714/coronavirus-covid-19-hospital-beds-china\n\n* WHO China COVID on the ground findings PDF can be found here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/fbsray/new_covid_findings_from_the_report_of_the_who/\n\n\n>5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration.
