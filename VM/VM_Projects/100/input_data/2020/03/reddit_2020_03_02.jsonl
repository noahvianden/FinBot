Would have been better to sell friday, but hey I made like a mil in a week so I’m not going to start complaining.  I held because I was 98% sure the market would drop heavily today because of 2 days of bad news about the virus.  I didn’t think the fed or credit upgrades or anything could overcome continual increases in the number of infected, and I thought it unlikely that good news would come through like that in the first place.  Obviously I was wrong!  Investors were hungry for some good news it looks like.  At this point I’m still not confident that we’ve seen the bottom.  The virus will continue to spread rapidly, that’s basically a given at this point.  And continued containment efforts will damper the economy, that’s also almost a given.  But we’ve been learning a lot about how to treat and not to treat, and how to handle mass influxes into hospitals (tell people it’s more dangerous there than at home unless you’re in critical condition), and there’s a couple drugs already approved for use in humans that seem to be very promising to treat the condition.  All that has to happen is to get the CFR down very low using all those methods and the virus slowly becomes more irrelevant.  So basically at this point I’m not confident enough to continue cancelling my long-term TSLA investing.  Used 1/3 of my portfolio to buy 6/2022 $1800 calls (which are conveniently at a discount), and used the other 2/3 to buy stock.  I would put more of my portfolio into calls, but I’m about to owe a crap ton in taxes and I’d also like to keep some low-risk $ for personal peace of mind.  Go TSLA!\n\nThings I’ve learned:\n\n- never be afraid to look at a situation just because it’s inconvenient.  There’s always a way to turn something you know into an advantage. But you’ve got to know about it first. The first video I watched on the virus was published by a guy running a sketchy website that honestly comes across at this point like a fear-mongerer.  But he seemed to have some interesting data so I took it at face value and for what I thought it was worth.  His name was Chris Martenson & honestly I have him to thank.  He was right & even though I’m not a huge fan of his videos anymore - it taught me to always take data for what it’s worth.\n\n- nothing is EVER 98% sure.  After you’ve done all the research, maybe apply a discount multiplier to your certainty level.\n\n- the data can be there, but that doesn’t mean it’s being taken into consideration.  The markets are NOT efficient - they’re emotional.  After you’ve done all your research on something and you think you know of an event that’s about to happen - now you need to think how the big-money investors are going to feel about it.  There’s only so many of these that exist and they can be pretty predictable, so this isn’t as hard as it sounds.  Basically, when an event comes up the market can turn into a cold war where every big investor has their finger on a trigger and they’re waiting to see what each other will do.  As soon as a couple people push the button everyone pushes the button.  This leads to overreactions that can be taken advantage of.  But in order to know if something has been overreacted to - you need to analyze the real data, NOT listen to opinions.\n\n- Always risk-manage and never feel bad if you leave money on the table for this reason.\n\nMods, hope I didn’t get too virus-centric for this thread lol\n\nGo TSLA\n\nAnd seriously - for your personal health - this virus is still something to be taken very seriously.\n\nEdit - two big things that changed over the weekend was that the CFR seems to be improving (still concerned it will go up if hospitals get overloaded, but there’s hope..), and the fed will be cutting interest rates.
