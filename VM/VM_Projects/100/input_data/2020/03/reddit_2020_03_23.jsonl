On the other hand, the further OTM you are, the more time you may need to make a profit. This means that closer to expiration is cheaper, but your probability of making a profit is lower, for the same OTM strike.\n\n> Secondly which is less risk buying volatility calls like vix Val’s outs and the same with inverse etfs like Spx sqqq ??\n\nThat's a little like asking which is less risky, fighting a tiger bare-handed of fighting a bear bare-handed. ;) They are both relatively high in risk.\n\n> Everyone talks about spy options why ?

I recently invested quite a bit in Century Casinos (CNTY)   I am now looking at buying calls from them and I’m currently looking at a 7.5 call for September 13th. The limit price right now is .15. If I were to buy 30 contracts at .15 a piece, what would I need to happen to make money? I need the stock price to hit above the 7.63 break even price to start seeing returns? Once it did hit that number how much could I actually make with only 30 contacts?  Any advice would greatly help as I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can via YouTube videos since the quarantine! I also have only about 1k to play around with so can’t be dropping heaps of cash unfortunately.

Unfortunately, Theta will also reduce the price of that option by about -$0.36 wiping out almost all the gains from that directional movement.

Anyway, when in doubt start from the top down: \n\n1.  Analyze the global and domestic market, and identify environmental factors that may effect the price.  Covid-19, oil price war, upcoming news like earnings or FDA drug approvals, etc. \n2.  Form a directional bias based on your analysis for the appropriate time-frame.  Are you bullish, bearish, neutral, or unknown?\n3.  Based on that bias, choose an appropriate strategy from your playbook and start using the greeks to tweak it.  I usually go in this order:\n  * **Vega**: Where is IV, and where do I think it's going?  If it's high and I expect it to drop I'm probably going to use a credit strategy, and vice versa\n  * **Delta**: Do I want a directional bias in my legs or not?  Where do I want my strikes?\n  * **Theta**: What expiration do I want?  If I'm long I want to avoid theta by going further out.  If I'm short I want theta on my side with expirations under 30-45 days.     \n\n4. Choose your profit targets, the max loss you want before exiting, and what [adjustments](https://tradeoptionswithme.com/options-adjustment-strategies) you'll be making if you need to modify a losing position.\n\n5.

Some industries rely on trade fairs (you cannot choose textiles for your factory online etc). Some trade fairs happen only every 5 years and every world industry player is there. Many have been cancelled, some have been moved a year forward.\n\n2. All sorts of service industries closed. Some can't cope with 3 month closure. Means insolvency, means unemployment.\n\n3. People are not driving, oil industry suffers.\n\n4. Airlines suffer, oil industry suffers.\n\n5. Even small stuff like beauticians, hairdressers, barbers - suddenly no work, no income. Suddenly they are not using all these stockpiled products like hair dyes, shampoos and stuff. Chemical companies suffer. And so on.\n\n6. Mid-sized companies that were thriving now are facing insolvency in 3-4 months. It's a damage you cannot undo. The big companies will survive, but all these orders for materials/machines/services from small companies will be gone next year, and the year after.\n\n7.

Your original post complained about people criticizing capitalism for the situation we're in, when it's exactly what got us in this situation in the first place.

Unless you expect the state to maintain its own boundaries in a system that sells it's services out to the highest bidder, but that sounds ridiculously naive to me.\n\n>This is why the power of the state should be severely limited.\n\nThat's not a thing. \"The state\" isn't some magical monolith, separate from the rest of society. The holders of power (in late stage capitalism, the holders of capital, since they also own the flow of capital and information) decide what the state is, and will obviously not limit its own power, especially when it comes to the state's ability to maintain the power of those who hold it.\n\n>Worst case scenario is that if you're right, the consequences won't be as bad.
