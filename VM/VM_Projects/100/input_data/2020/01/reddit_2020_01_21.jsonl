Meaning that if their net income remained constant it would take 20ish years to make a profit off of your investment. That’s a very healthy stock price given their earnings. Starbucks is sitting at like a 94 P:E which is absurdly high, that’s an overpriced company to be concerned about. Microsoft is solid and its PE is sitting around the high 30s. Granted, their cloud business is priced in to the stock price and the cloud is expected to keep expanding.  \n\nI think Google is relatively safe to buy in to definitely, even at $1400, their services are pretty well established/depended on by society. Apple I can see being slightly risky due to ambiguity surrounding sales on future iPhones, even though they are trying to break in to finance and the streaming industry (jack of all trades is not necessarily a good thing - see GE). I haven’t followed Apple news much lately so I could be wrong on them right now. But I would definitely buy in if their PE ratio drops below 15 again like they did in Dec ‘18 ($160-180 dollar price range). Microsoft and Amazon are potentially oversold territory. I don’t know cloud services well enough. Microsoft seems to have momentum and their current CEO has clearly turned them around since Ballmer stepped down. Microsoft’s services are entrenched in the business world as well along with government work/contracts. Visa/Mastercard may not be a bad option but I would wait for their stock price to come down,  because they have a relatively stable market as CC transaction processors, but they earn money so slowly that their stock is priced very high (PE is like 40 I think for a company with meh year over year revenue/income growth. Microsoft it’s different because they earn more faster). If a crash/correction comes then Visa could possibly never reach its 52 week high again, or it would take a long time to catch back up to it which is an opportunity cost sink if you weren’t throwing more money at it while it became cheap. \n\nMy top 5 stock picks:\n\n\nGoogle > Facebook (risky play due to government intervention, but if the final ruling is negligible then this stock is going to the moon based off how much they earn) > Apple = Microsoft (Apple at the current price I like more) > Visa/MC \n\nMind you I have a tech-heavy bias. You have to be mindful of innovation changing market conditions. Nokia was top dog in the 2000s but got shitted on very quickly once iPhones hit the market. Things can change very fast, coupled with companies trying to recover from a crash and they may never reach their previous 52 week high. It took Microsoft 16 years to reach their dot com crash stock price peak (stock peaked in 2000, crashes and doesn’t recover until 2016).\n\nEdit: I see you want dividend stocks. The issue is that dividends are generally negligible amounts of money. Here’s an ex:\n\nApple is paying a $3 dividend right now, their stock price is $300. If Apple kept the same dividend for 5 years you’d make $15. However all it takes in a iPhone sales miss for the stock to drop to $280. You still lost money despite the dividend. The point I’m making is that you should focus on the company’s long term future. Dividends are irrelevant as they show the company has money they don’t know how to use to reinvest back in to their business to boost the stock price. When times are tough, the first thing a business slashes is the dividend + bad guidance means the stock price plummeted which is a double whammy.

Also Starbucks still has competition with companies such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Keurig/K-cups, other cafes and other coffee sellers. I count things such as k-cups as competition since Starbucks only does coffee, no one goes there for the food.

It’s all speculation how much profits they’ll actually turn if they pull through. \n\nIn the meantime, money could’ve been thrown at companies like Facebook and Google where the only thing holding their stock price back is fear of government intervention.

That is just not the case - at least, it's not the reason that they are producing all these shows. They are producing shows for the reasons I specified above, it's not rocket science - if everyone else pulls their content from the service, they need to have SOMETHING that will appeal to users as evergreen content. \n\n> Yes they are so ahead in terms of streaming. That’s why they can’t produce positive free cash flow or stop taking on debt\n\nThis is such a stupid comment dude. Of course they could produce numbers that Wall Street would love, IF they wanted to, but is that really best for business? Is that the strategy that they are employing here? No - they're not just trying to boost their stock value for the next quarterly. They NEED content to survive - yes they need GOOD content, but they also just need content PERIOD. No studio out there has nothing but amazing content in their catalog - everyone has some duds, but that content likely still has some fans out there and once it is produced, there is virtually no cost in digitizing it for release on a streaming platform. All of this spending is reinvestment in their own business. Why do you think so many different companies are all getting into the content business right now? \n\nReally everything you are saying is wrapped up in this. It's not like this just occurred to them the other day - they rightly saw what was coming YEARS ago and that is why they have been investing so much in content. Obviously what they are doing isn't sustainable with their current subscription revenue, but if you don't think they have planned for various contingencies based on all kinds of revenue scenarios, you're crazy. Either they will make more money to make this spending sustainable, or they will pull back once they have enough of a library, and they have enough experience as a studio to know what works and what doesn't.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "awwww… I've offended the poor snowflake.

Theatrical distribution is still physical, but it's not reels of film, and the low cost of digital media and storage have made this VERY cost efficient compared to how it used to be. Home media distribution is the most costly since you are actually creating physical products and then shipping them around and trying to put them on store shelves, but even these costs aren't that much, but Netflix isn't in home media so they wouldn't have any of those costs anyways.\n\nSo, what you are saying about \"a bigger share of the budget went into production due to these savings\" is completely off base. That is the case for EVERY movie - all of their budget goes to the production.\n\nThat said, what makes you think Netflix doesn't have any marketing costs? Just because they aren't distributing films like the big studios doesn't mean they don't spend money on marketing. They absolutely do, but unless they use budgeting that aren't in line with the industry norms, then those costs would be separated from the actual production costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This creates an opportunity for Disney and Apple to differentiate by only sticking to better quality content. Even if they have less content, but if they are considered higher quality, people will be willing to pay.\n\nWow, you've solved the entire issue of the entertainment industry. Just create high quality content. THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT. IT'S SO EASY, HOW DID NO ONE ELSE EVER REALIZE THIS\n\nOk, sorry for being a dick, but again it's quite obvious you are speaking from the outside of the industry. If it were really that easy, why hasn't Disney (or anyone else) done this already? They've been in the content business for a while now, even though Disney+ is new - what is stopping ANYONE from just sticking to better quality content?\n\nThe thing is, creating \"better quality content\" isn't as easy as you think it is. It's not just some content machine where you put in a quarter and pull the lever, and boom out comes Game of Thrones. Like, no one is TRYING to create \"garbage content\" - what would be the point of that? It's just that you never know what is really going to land with audiences - it's always a crapshoot to some extent, and if you don't think Disney creates low quality content, then you just aren't paying attention. Look at John Carter. Look at how many shows they make every year that get cancelled.\n\nThe notion that \"creating high quality content\" is this easy thing that anyone can just do is so misguided it's ridiculous, and even when you DO make something great, people don't always watch. Look at Arrested Development as just one example - that was a show that was pretty beloved by fans and critics, but the ratings weren't strong enough, and Fox cancelled it. This isn't the only show that this has happened to, there have been a lot of other shows and movies that fit that criteria, so clearly it's not just as simple as making \"high quality content\". I work in the industry, and I consider HBO as having the best reputation for consistently making high quality content - but are they the biggest company in Hollywood? No - not by a long shot. They're successful, sure, but having that reputation for high-quality content hasn't made them the biggest or most powerful company in town, and even they can't guarantee a hit. They have had good shows that performed poorly (Enlightened) and they've had bad shows that performed well (True Blood) - but calling shows good or bad is completely subjective. There are TONS of hit shows out there that I think are crap, but that get really good ratings.

In summary basically what I am saying is that since Netflix is offering a lot of shows and movies, they seem to care more about quantity. As you have mentioned that HBO has decent quality shows and is not that big, this is the opposite end of the spectrum. There is definitely a lot of space in the middle for someone like Disney to position themselves in between HBO and Netflix. \n\nWhile it is hard to make quality content, there is still a correlation even though its not a perfect one between quality of content and investment. Investment can be in many forms, relationship, culture, other intangibles, and money. HBO did not get lucky continuously each time they make something, but they do invest more into their shows. \n\nWhile calling things good and bad are subjective, if you want to even remotely start investing, you do have to have a sense of how a large portion of people who might represents suppliers, consumers, etc regard as an aggregate certain products. It does not matter from an investment perspective how good or bad a particular show is, but more how overall the company is. I just used Underground 6 as an example as on Netflix there are more of those than something like Black Mirror and Stranger Things.\n\nIf you feel otherwise that Netflix has good content, a good pricing to match those content, and competitive advantages that they can sustain, then you should invest in the company. I am saying they do not because of some of the items above. They used to have pricing power as well, but it has been weakened by new entrants.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> In summary basically what I am saying is that since Netflix is offering a lot of shows and movies, they seem to care more about quantity\n\nThe reason they are emphasizing quantity right now is because they didn't have any original content of their own. They started as just a distributor, and they realized that that moat will begin fading away and all these other content companies can start their own services with minimal effort. The content companies had CONTENT, but they didn't have a platform or users. Netflix had a platform and users, but no CONTENT of their own - and now that more and more studios are pulling from their own service, they are trying to build up their own original content to retain their users - they literally HAVE to, just to even be remotely on par with any of these other old-school media companies. And again, they're funding a large variety of content, to appeal to a wide variety of people, because of the whole \"content is subjective\" thing. The stuff that you think is low quality is going to appeal to other people, and the stuff that you like may not appeal to them. They have to cater to ALL their users - not just you or me. This really isn't any different from HBO or Disney, they operate the exact same way, but again the difference is that they all had a head start in terms of content, so Netflix is trying to catch up. \n\nTo put it another way, I wouldn't say they're emphasizing quantity OVER quality. They're really emphasizing BOTH, which is why it costs so much, good quality content isn't cheap and they're trying to produce a LOT of it - it's just that not every show is made for the same type of person. Do you watch a lot of Grey's Anatomy? Do you consider that \"low quality content\"?

He has enough of it to make his own world go round, stop praising this man, he is another Bezos in disguise. He will always play good guy since Bezos has his \"villianious\" wrap.

The consumer has and will continue to receive cars this way because robots are not foul proof. Automation is not what everyone makes it out to be, entire days are spent fixing 1 robot which takes down the entire line. Just because you automated one process doesn't mean down the line people don't need to get involved. If you got this far, sorry, rant over. DM for more insider info. I wish I could tell someone the truth and expose them, I heard the Freemont factor is worse. Sex in the staircases, drugs, smoking, and it's openly known. Once you are in and prove yourself the truth falls fast, you're nothing and everyone has a chip on their shoulder until humbled. 15yr engineers unable to work patch panels because of technology. I am working on the same level as this man, he has an entire career of knowledge but can't do the correct sequence because he can't understand the fucking patch panel that's now a full-blown controller station with a touchscreen.
