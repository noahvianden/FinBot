I'll lay out my line of reasoning for wanting to buy this call, and whether you agree or disagree, I ask that you please explain why. I've gotten a pretty solid understanding of the basic concepts of option trading, but I'm really trying to understand how to apply that in real-world application.\n\n\\*\\*AMD current price: $50.83\\*\\*\n\nBased on the extensive research I've done, AMD's gain has consistently defied both analyst and investor expectations over the past year. Every recent article seems to be nothing but good news about the company, from management hires to new technology and increased investor confidence. 2019 Q4 earnings are set to be reported on the Jan 28th - three days before this call expires - and EPS is estimated on Robinhood to be $0.31, which is $0.10 higher than Q3s actual.\n\nThe only piece of information I've found that makes me hesitate was a single sentence in an article from an analyst who gave AMD a hold rating, who said that their main bull run is over. However, it seems like anyone who has said that in the past year has been wrong.\n\nSo, does this seem like a relatively good pick at this point? Why or why not? I know Delta and Theta aren't great, but are they bad enough to not buy this call?  \n\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for the massive amount of replies to this. I've already learned a ton more, which is exactly what I was hoping to do! As it stands, if I do buy this call, it would be with the intent of 100% selling it back before earnings are announced for hopefully a small profit. Not at all planning on holding it to expiration.\n\nEdit 2: I bought it at $1.07 for the reasons listed above. It jumped up to a $30 profit almost immediately this morning and I learned my lesson about not being greedy...currently at a $3 profit. In Su’s name I pray. \n\nEdit 3: Sold the option for a $16 profit and bought the exact same call when it dropped down to $1.10...price of underlying stock has moved 2%+ since Intel announced earnings and its now at $52.63. Can’t wait to see how much this premium is worth when the market opens again!\n\nFinal update: sold that for a $22 profit. Chump change for many, but it worked out in the end!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vr3kspqpelb41.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9991ef85806847738d3169996640f3cf6b9f836f", "id": "eqlhrt", "created_utc": 1579377731.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "It is relevant :D I bought 55s for 2/7 and was about to check how tf you had higher earnings than me thus far", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I have the same", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "That seems like a smart idea. \n\nI’m also realizing that, because I’m not really at a point where I can have a decent amount of funds to invest, that I’m looking for cheaper options that are also inherently more of a long shot. \n\nI might buy a $51.5 call for $70 or a $51 for $90 that expires on the 24th instead.

This strategy won't net you as much money as a call or bull call spread, but is more likely to succeed. With a put credit spread, you will make 100% of the premium as long as the stock price is above the strike price of the put you sold at expiration. Thus you will profit if the stock price goes up, or if the price stays the same, or even if it goes down (as long as its above the strike price of the sold put).", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "What sort of price would you be looking to sell the put leg? Thanks.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Depends on your goals and risk tolerance. For me, I like to look at delta to help decide which strike to use. I usually look for a delta of -0.25 or lower. If I stick to this rule, then my trades will have roughly 75% chance of success. The closer you get to the money though (I.e. selling your short put closer to the current stock price) the more premium you can collect. So if you are really bullish, you could sell the put closer to the money or even at the money. The closer your short put is to the money though, the riskier it is and less your chances are of success.\n\nAs for the width, again it depends on your risk tolerance. The long put protects you from losing your shirt if the stock price goes below the strike of your short put — since that long put is there to save you, your max loss is equal to the difference between your short and long put, minus the premium you collected from opening the position. So the wider you make it, the more premium you can collect, but also the more you can lose.\n\nAnother thing I like to do sometimes when looking for good put credit spreads to open is to look at the ratio of max profit (premium) to max loss. Typically I’m looking for that to be around 1:3 or better while still having a delta of around -0.25. \n\nYou will collect a lot more premium placing credit spreads with expiries farther out though. I usually try to aim for about 45 days away as from what I have read that is the best timeframe to use to collect the most premium.

But for that short seller timing is everything because he is a gambler not an investor as media portrays him.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Wk057. Here's a quote from him pulled from TMC:\n\n\nUnlike their sluggish ICE counterparts, the Model S/X/3 will immediately respond to a throttle request. You don't have the same time to react, consciously or unconsciously, to the mistake before action is taken by the vehicle. In the case of the S/X/3, you're likely to have moved the vehicle a significant distance prior to figuring out that you screwed up, where in an ICE, especially an automatic, the engine is likely to rev and gears need to be changed, yada yada, in response to the throttle mash... generally enough time to realize your error. I've almost made a pedal misapplication mistake several times in the past with multiple different vehicles... fortunately not in any catastrophic situation. We're not infallible creatures. You get in a zone of habit, feel like you know what's going on, and when something unexpected happens you'll swear you were doing everything normally the way you've done it 10000 times before, when in reality you just screwed up. It happens.\n\nTesla's accelerator pedal is actually the exact same drive-by-wire pedal used in several other manufacturer's vehicles. It's highly proven technology over decades. Nothing special at this point. No Tesla secret sauce here. Just two hall effect sensors with slightly different curves for redundancy and position validation. If they don't agree, the car doesn't move. If one has an issue, the car reduces power and gives an error. I've personally never seen one of these throttle assemblies have a problem because they're literally as basic as these things can get. It's plastic, a spring to return the pedal to rest, and two hall effect sensors for positioning. They're rock solid on reliability and used in millions of vehicles.\n\nTesla's side for sensing this goes even further to improve safety. They have two independent systems monitoring and logging the pedal sensors, isolated from one another. They both log the read position from both sensors. If anything doesn't exactly agree, the car doesn't move, gives an error, and reduces power to the point where you can barely do 0-60 in a minute.\n\nThe autopilot side of things also is not capable of accelerating the car at any major speed. The AP system just tells the motor, \"this is how fast I want to be going and this is how quickly I want to get there\" and the inverter firmware maps out a curve to get the car there based on the data, clamped internally to extremely reasonable values as far as acceleration goes. (Deceleration is another story, since AP is capable of commanding full regen and full braking.) The fastest AP can do 0-60 on its own is pretty pathetic, overall. I've tried it. The car will not launch even when commanded to go to 90 MPH at max longitudinal acceleration rate. It just gradually ramps speed, just as if you were at a light behind a vehicle with AP engaged. Nothing sudden about it.\n\nI went a step further and modified the section of inverter code that limits the acceleration rate. No dice. The two other systems inside the drive unit immediately sent the system into limp mode when I tried to command massive acceleration digitally. To be able to do a full digital launch with no pedal application I had to modify the firmware in three different systems to bypass probably two dozen different safety checks. Long story short, it's simply not possible for the car to command massive acceleration on its own.\n\nGoing even further, the throttle map for acceleration is super accurate. It can interpolate 2^16 throttle positions with reasonable accuracy... which is impressive, since the ADC is technically something like 10-bit, and we're working with a throw distance of maybe a couple of inches at the end of the pedal. (Edit: Correction/clarification: The crosscheck ADC is 10-bit, the primary is actually 16-bit and doubled for redundancy on each input... so the throttle position is actually read 8 times in hardware for comparison.)\n\nFinally, if the brake is applied, three different devices report this. There's the brake pedal switch, the iBooster, and the ESP modules. All are able to sense and report brake pedal application, and the three systems in the drive unit accept these in a binary OR fashion (if any report the brake is applied, the brake is applied). If the brake is applied even a tiny bit, the car is incapable of accelerating at full power. At best, if the accelerator is already pressed, the car will apply something like 5% of power for about a second before fully cutting power due to both pedals being applied. Those that think they had their foot on the brake and suddenly accelerated, try it yourself. Go somewhere safe with open space in front of you, apply the brake, and mash the accelerator. You'll either go no where, or at most move at super low power for less than a second (depending on the exact internal state of the system, which would be too complicated to get into full detail here).\n\n\nOverall, I have a lot of beef with Tesla over many things... but this is one aspect where they did their homework and did it right. I'd argue that Tesla's throttle setup is probably at least twice as safe if not more than any other drive-by-wire throttle system out there. There are some many independent checks that it is just impossible for the car to do something like full acceleration without the drive explicitly commanding it, either intentionally or unintentionally, via the throttle pedal.\n\n\nOf course, humans are going to human... and thus never fully accept responsibility for their actions or mistakes when there is a way to push that onto someone or something else. But my advice is to just get over it, keep the car in chill mode, and move on. In this particular case, your wife made a mistake, caused some damage to the vehicle, and that's the end of it. No sense trying to argue otherwise... especially in the case of a Tesla vehicle with its extensive logging and redundancy. Should someone ever take such a case to court and try to go against the data, I couldn't see how a reasonable judge or jury could possibly see this as anything other than what it is.\n\n\nhttps://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/sudden-unexpected-acceleration-today.114650/page-4", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for finding that, daughter had friends over today, a bit of chaos but a good day.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just sucks for my short term calls.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I've been doing some sort of martial art for all my life, mostly the full contact ones with real sparring.\n\nI've seen countless guys ket knocked out.\n\nI'd say 90% of the time they have no fucking clue what happened or the mistake they made that led to them getting KO'd.
