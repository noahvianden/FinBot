The key people wanted to be off on their own, saying no would just result in them quitting and you are left off with random lower people.

Who cares.\n\nLinkedin is one of Microsoft important (not most) businesses. It's still consistently growing and bringing in great revenue. It's also not just business related social media website but also a great learning platform for IT, developers, designers, analysts, etc. Skype is dying but that's not really an issue, it's just a service that makes money serving ads and was never really a large part of Microsoft's revenue. It'd be nice if more people used it and that business adapted much earlier, but if you were to look take a look at all the other major companies who do a shitton of different things you'll find a bunch of things that used to be relevant that are declining or are already cancelled because there's better versions of their services/products out there. Hotmail/outlook (and OneDrive) is still widely used, it's just extra cash for them. \n\n> And then lets look at their products. I'm a PC user so yes Windows is great. But for tablets, I've never even considered the Surface. With Ipads being so awesome, I've never thought of any other tablet. \n\nSurfaces are not great for personal use but for certain enterprise users it's a great balance for them.

Amazon was around first and dominated the space. \n\n> Sorry if I offended anyone, I'm just very unimpressed by their product line and acquisitions.\n\nI'm not offended but your post has a mix of ignorance (I'm not saying that in an insulting way, I just mean you have a naive view of certain things or don't know a whole lot about certain things and brush it off), and using of your personal opinon of the product as a user instead of as an investor on a stock community. Microsoft may not be number #1 in all these business but you don't need to be #1 to be a good investment or to make a shit ton of money. Not everyone has to beat McDonalds, Pepsi or others to be #1. If you are growing your market share or even growing at all and your bottom line is huge and gets better and better who cares if you are not #1 at everything you do.

Let me list off a few points of what's made me bullish as fuck on them:\n\n- Gone from concept to mass production faster than Tesla\n- CEO and founder William Li believes they will turn a profit faster than Tesla\n- Has NIO Formula E Team, a professional European sports car racing team that has set multiple records at world-reknown racetracks\n- Backed by the Chinese fucking government\n- First production car to have an interactive proprietary artificial intelligence, NOMI\n- Has their own clothing collection, NIO Life\n- Fucking in-seat massagers\n- 5 minute battery swap stations\n- NIO house, a showroom on the first floor with 3 more floors of community center space, look it up!\n- 200 planned NIO House/NIO Space showroom openings in 2020\n- Developed a driverless car while waiting for driverless tech\n- Can literally use Tesla's shared IP to get a competitive edge \n- Shared environmental preservation sentiment as Tesla, their name in Chinese literally means Blue Sky Ahead \n- NIO Service, can charge your car/swap the battery for you while you sleep if your home does not have a charging station\n- Cheap as fuck right now because people think they're going to run out of money\n\nThey're about to be even more heavily discounted over the next few weeks due to some hick ass bat soup disease. Gettin my money ready to wade deeper into the communist waters of China. You should to! Imagine being able to get into Tesla when it was this cheap. \n\nTesla is more than a car company you say?

That makes sense. Best estimate currently of R0 for the Wuhan virus is 2.5 . For H1N1 it's like 1.5 . That's a big difference. For H1N1, patients are contagious, but asymptomatic for about 1 day. For Wuhan, Chinese officials are saying 14 days - and even once symptoms develop, they are not as severe as swine flu.\n\nChina has locked down 50 million people - so far. No other outbreak comes close to that kind of response.\n\nI'm not buying puts, I don't mess with that stuff. I reduced equities to 50% recently and will buy the dip if it exceeds a 25% drop from ATH. I'd give it a 50/50 chance.
