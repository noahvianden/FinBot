I've always  believed that it's just propaganda by the oil industry, just like how the tobacco companies  in the 70's were telling people nicotine wasn't addictive and cigarettes don't kill people. I am not knowledge enough to refute your point lol. I guess this is more in the territory of you choose to believe Part A while I choose to believe Party B.\n\nI can understand your rationale behind point 1 and 3, and using smart phone as comparison is a good choice too. Here's what I think:\n\nInstead of using smart phone, I think you should consider cell phone as the better comparison. Cost, practicality, and functionality are the biggest factors of mass market adoption for any product, and EV is not an exception. \n\nFunctionality is always first. Can the technology work? Once invented and commercialized, yes.\n\nWhen cell phone was first invented in the 80's only the rich used them. They were definitely functional, maybe not practical because they are bricks, and the cost is definitely prohibitive for the average Joe's.  EV was the same way when the first generation of cars were introduced. They were functional (saves money on gas, performs well in the case of Tesla Roadster but no other OEM's) but not practical (no Tesla charging network yet) nor cost effective. \n\nThen cost will come down and practicality will increase as the tech improves. More people started having cell phones in the 90's, but not everybody. They didn't look like bricks anymore (more practical to carry). However, older generation didn't care for one and younger generation couldn't afford one just yet. This is basically the Model S and Model X phase for EV. A charging network is established and the cars can travel 300 miles on one charge, so they are practical now. They don't cost as much but still only the top 10% can afford it (cell phone is cheaper so obviously more people can get them, but you get my point). \n\nThen finally cost is low enough for the everyday Joe. Practicality also becomes a non--issue. That leads to full market adoption. Nowadays, everybody can afford a cell phone. You can get a cheap Cricket Mobile and pay $20, or you can get a top of the line Apple iPhone for $1400. There's a reason why every OEM is coming out with their own EV. If your point about EV not being viable, then not just Tesla but every OEM's money are being wasted. You can't deny the fact that even the OEMs are realizing this  and are developing EVs. \n\nIf you can accept my argument about EV being the future, then we can keep going...\n\nOnce the we enter the phase of full market adoption, Tesla will have the best EV with the most expansive charging network. There will be competition, sure, just like Apple has Samsung, Huawei, etc.. They only own 20-25% of the market share but have 60-80% of the profit.

I’m convinced that happens in Q1. It would be a huge help for a normally terrible quarter. Tesla knows that they can’t do the normal “Y is ready to ship in 3 months” because that pulls demand out of Q1 and into Q2 which would be bad. Also, I’m thinking the delays in model 3 delivery forecasts in the US might be due to lowered production as they port in the Y production line...\n2. News from China: if the Q4 call includes an update of big orders in China, I think we’ll see one hell of a jump. \n3. Battery day: the second this goes on the calendar I think we see a jump. Tons of big but reasonable expectations for this event and people will be buying specifically to prep for the news.\n4.

That cannot be allowed to happen. \n\n2. No one has any certain idea about battery day announcements and there are a ton of people with big bets that have more middle of the road forecasts. \n\n3. I’m CONVINCED that the success of the China gigafactory wasn’t factored in until this latest run, the point at which a car actually makes it into customer hands. I don’t see anyone forecasting Tesla selling all of capacity in 2020 in China. I think finance models struggle to evaluate something like the Chinese obsession with US luxury brands and products.\n\n4. The squeeze is obvious, no one knows when it happens. Maybe some of this buying was getting in in case.\n\nPointing at GF3 reactions among many others, I think two things are happening. First, the market continues to treat Elon’s promises as totally crazy until the moment they happen. You can’t blame them. Elon has a history of optimism and when he said he was gonna spin up a massive cutting edge factory in record time, it’s easy to lump that into the same realm of long term misses like FSD.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla has learned to set the trap. Under promise and over deliver. I expect this will continue for quite a while.\n\nThis is just my thesis. Elon out there dancing weighs heavily on my thesis that they are through the woods and ready to land some big knockout punches in quick succession. \n\nI’d love to hear your challenges to these points though", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "What if the rise was just pricing it accordingly?", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Bought faggy delights for tomorrow.
