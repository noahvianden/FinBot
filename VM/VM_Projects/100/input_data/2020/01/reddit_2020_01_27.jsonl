Nearly half of that was accounted for in deliveries within the two weeks immediately following the end of the quarter.  It's idiotic to assert that 700M loss meant anything like a quarter of what everyone acted like it did.

The subreddit built by a community of TSLA shareholders seems to be overran with \"just bought x more shares\" and \"HODL\" bitcoin nonsense, all while posts/comments of significance are short-replied and brushed off. Other posts, as u/flufferbot01 has pointed out, offer fair criticism and may bring real concerns to shareholders, yet is dismissed without thought as \"FUD\". Are we becoming what some here have accused other subs as: an echo-chamber?\n\nSome have expressed their opinions of this matter within the daily thread post, while others have stated they have considered unsubscribing and removing themselves from the community due to its lack of discussion of anything except the stock price. I also received a private message asking if I wanted to start a new subreddit to get back to basics: fundamental discussion of the company. Is this how we proceed? Splitting the community?\n\n I, myself, am not a mod and cannot do anything to restore the sentiment of this sub apart from making a post. I can, however, suggest we create some additional guidelines to battle this repelling behavior.\n\n1. I'm requesting, with the support of others in previous daily threads, we ban the word \"HODL\" and phrases alike. This is a stock of a real company, not a cryptocurrency.\n2. Also proposed: adding post flairs to sort and encourage posts outside of the daily thread. This subreddit is growing and would benefit from such search features (even if optimized in the future).\n3. We all know what the stock price is, for most of us are also invested in the company and keep track of this. I do not see the merit in spamming the daily thread with green/red updates.\n4. Bearish arguments should be welcomed and not downvoted (and thus buried). Give some thought and discussion to those who do not share the same sentiment as you. Who knows, maybe you can learn or share some insight you never would have otherwise.\n5. Snobby comments about TSLA stocks isn't a good look. If you are invested in a company, chances are you are an adult. Act like one. If anybody serious about their investment were to visit this subreddit and see \"We don't invest in stocks, we invest in TSLA\" my guess is they will consider us an immature community and spend their time elsewhere. I, for one, hope the community grows in hopes more people bring focused discussion and opposing arguments.\n\nThese are just some opinions and suggestions myself and others have brought up in the past few weeks. Feel free to critique and add to them as you see fit.

I also started a mod discussion about this.

And then maybe add a new Weekly Big Picture Investor Discussion thread where we don‚Äôt really focus on the day-to-day movement, but where people can discuss/analyse whatever is relevant in the longer term for both the stock and the company.\n\nI think that would take some of the frustrations away (as depending on your interests you only follow one of those threads, or both). Flufferbot also had a good idea on using flairs on posts to make it easier to find stuff that‚Äôs relevant for you. Honestly: I‚Äôd actually love it if people would stop creating new posts all the time and keep the discussions in the daily and weekly (if we ever do that) threads.

Everything else is functionally an \"upvote with commentary\". \n\nThe issue is that if you tried to apply this to today's daily thread, for example, you would have 80 removed comments (I'm being kind at only 80) out of the first 200 shown.

In short, if we tried to apply this all of a sudden, it would mean a few days of absolutely nuked threads until people adjusted.
