I personally thought all their formula racing experimentation and their huge scale would have led to at least a few models that would give Tesla a run for the money.  But yet there's not much.  The only thing getting buzz is supposedly a Ford E-Mustang or something that's a year out.  \n\nI wonder if and when the true automakers will wake up.

Government and private incentives for electric vehicles arent there yet.\n\nUmm, there were lots of very rich incentives.  It's just that they've gone away since they weren't really needed.  Tesla actually got hammered when news came about incentives being rolled back.\n\nAnd that's a key point: no sufficiently revolutionary business model needs incentives.  Demand and value take care of things.  When broadband internet came along, it didn't need half price government subsidies.  Everyone just wanted it, and boom we went from sparse dial up country to high bandwidth in every home.  Smartphones didn't need a subsidy plan to take over the world.  When electric cars have the right no-brainer proposition, incentives won't be needed.  I'd kind of hoped $150/barrel oil was going to do that but then oil crashed and has never come back.\n\n\n\n> It’s still just not efficient enough for the vast majority of car owners to drive electric.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"not efficient\"?\n\n\n>  Why pump billions into r&d for a product that isn’t the chosen market yet? \n\nYou,don't need to \"pump billions into r&d\".  Mature automakers just outsource and buy what they need.  That's very capital efficient.  \n\nNotice how practically every car suddenly got satellite radio standard overnight?  They didn't invent that.  Vendor had it worked out, and it just became pert of the supply stream.  Same with commoditized rear view camera and ABS brakes and now, all the various car-phone integrations.  Some white label electronics supplier offers it for $20/car license or whatever, and each of them gets to call it \"Hyundai Biue Link\" or \"Merdedes Touch Link\" or whatever.  It's all the same thing, just with a brand label on it.\n\nThe same could easily be with EV's.  You just drop in 4 DC motors (which have been optimized over their 100 year existence) and you order some battery packs from Panasonic, and you load a different body control module firmware and boom, there's your EV.  \n\nSeveral even have hybrids.\n\n\n> Just to compete with a company that is solely focused on electric and will kick your ass in r&d in the short run? \n\nWe could debate whether Tesla will kick anyone's ass in R&D, but even if we just agree on that for discussion, who cares?  GM, VW, Toyota don't sell R&D, they sell vehicles.  As long as it's sort of the same as every other car, that's enough.\n\n> Better to wait until the tech becomes more available or the buyers/incentives are there.\n\nI continue to believe the most powerful incentive is personal economy.  If an EV will cut your fuel bill by $500/month and an EV costs an extra $250/month, that's a no brainer.  No incentive needed.\n\n\n\n> As soon as government subsidies for eco friendly cars arrive in a big way, \n\nGovernments are all in massive deficit, they can't and shouldn't be handing out subsidies for rich car moguls.

This deleverages Tesla's balance sheet *massively*. For example that $1.4b tranche due in March 2021? Strike price is $360, it's all shares now. $0.977b due in 2022? Similar story. The \"Tesla debt cliff\" thesis is no more. It's dead. A goner.\n- Moody's upgrade\n- S&P upgrade\n- S&P 500 inclusion\n- Realization by major OEM's how valuable Tesla's EU ZEV contributions are. Serious cash flow from FCA alone to Tesla.\n- There's still an amazingly high number of ~25 million shares short TSLA. The normal rate for a company of Tesla's prospect is maybe 1-2 million shares short. This short covering is going to act as a major share-buyback program.\n- In the Q4 update letter Tesla has shown pictures of the Model Y underbody, which shows that those parts were already created with their new, patented metal injection molding/casting machine. (!) This is a major cost reduction from 70 parts to 1-4 parts and reduces stamping load as well, which increases Fremont top capacity.\n\nAny of these catalysts could open the floodgates of institutional investors, the combination will be an overwhelming force ...", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "People get easily lost on what their goals are.

Their efforts to be an influencer actually conflict with the effort to be objectively correct because it forces them to play a character that people expect and for which they are only paid with cheap attention. These two both attach themselves to derivative games. Well they can have it. Cliffordcat has plenty of people that admire him despite he being approximately as wrong as one can possibly be on the real game...\n\nAnyway, people need to sort out their priorities and be careful.

The irony is that he could have become incredibly rich had he realized his error sooner.\n\n[Or as Herbert Diess said it recently](https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/17/vw-nokia-ceo-herbert-diess/?guccounter=1):\n\n> \"Volkswagen needs to accelerate the overhaul of its business **to avoid becoming another Nokia**, which lost its dominance in the handset market to Apple, the German carmaker's chief executive said.\"\n\nI believe cliffordcat never realized his own Nokia moment and remained stuck in the increasingly more negative echo chamber 'realtesla' frame of mind.\n\nOr to quote a classic:\n\n> \"**It Ain’t What You Don’t Know That Gets You Into Trouble.

Those calls are worth $29.13, yes... but that value is constantly changing.  You can sell those calls at ANY time, even if you're well under breakeven, and possibly profit.  If the stock moves fast enough to make people think that the chance of it reaching breakeven is increasing, it will be worth more.\n\nPersonally, I don't even think about calls as something to exercise. It's just a stock derivative whose value goes up and down, like any other investment. Sure, you can exercise, but it's basically the same as selling the call and using that money to help buy stock.... often with added fees.  (hey anyone... IS there any case where exercising actually helps somehow?)\n\nStock options have two components to their value, intrinsic value and a time value.  If you exercise, you give up the time value entirely... you only get the intrinsic value out of it, (current SP - strike) \\* 100.  So, never exercise calls with distant expirations, that's for sure!  Just sell them.\n\nWhy these two components?  Well, the call's intrinsic value is the value if you exercised it right away... it can never be worth less than that.  So, that's obvious.  The time value is the added value for the call that accounts for the chances of that call being worth more before expiration.  It's not a fixed formula, it's like stocks in that it somewhat depends on investor sentiment.  There's a formula to calculate a call value taking in to consideration the time to expiration, the strike, and the current stock price... but it includes a fudge factor called \"implied volatility\" to account for this investor sentiment.  It's basically how volatile investors think the stock is... that's why it's called \"implied\" volatility instead of something more concrete.\n\nFrom that point, you can get into the \"greeks\", or different aspects of the call like \"delta\", a measure of how much the call's value changes for a given stock price change... or \"theta\", a measure of how fast the time value drops due to the time to expiration ticking away.  I currently find it easier to just look at option planning software to see graphs of profit and loss vs. stock price on a given day, etc.  Analysis tools are your friend.\n\nYou don't have to get that complicated, though.  Long term options are much easier in that it's more of an evaluation of how you think the company will do, and the \"greeks\" aren't as important to worry about.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Wow great explanation.
