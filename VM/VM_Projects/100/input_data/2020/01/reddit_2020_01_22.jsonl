If you even did your research you’d know that the $70k performance model 3 has the same 0-60mph performance as a $195k Audi R8. But at a fraction of the fuel cost and maintenance. EVs are so cost cost efficient that government agencies like policies departments are switching to electric vehicles because their cost of fuel and maintenance are so low.\n\n\n\nYou keep talking about 30s to fill up a tank. First off, as someone that his driven gasoline cars since getting my license it does not take 30s. Secondly you don’t have any other option with gasoline vehicles. You have exactly one option: drive in your car to a gas station and pay 2-4x for the cost of fuel. EV drivers can fill up at home, even while they sleep for a fraction of the cost. There are Ben laws that make it illegal for apartments, condos and landlords to deny home charging solutions. \n\nAerodynamics. I hate to be the one to break your bubble but every car manufacturer takes into account aerodynamics. Yes, even gasoline car manufacturers. Even cars with poor efficiency like the M4 have had engineers studiously pour time into making it as aerodynamic and appealing as possible. Aerodynamics effects both EVs and ICE cars so it really is a mute point. Coefficient of drag, weight and speed are the main attributes to efficiency of any vehicle.
