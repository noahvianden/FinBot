Just take a look at the financials. Literally everything is in the negative. PE ratio, net income, PEG ratio, EPS.\n\nElon Musk is basically Billy McFarland of Fyre Festival. Tesla has diluted shares and made a lot of promises. The stock price right now is driven solely by the public perception of Elon Musk. There are no financials to back up that price. The stock is dangerously over-valued right now. Shareholder money is being used as a giant band-aid in hopes that the company can stop hemorrhaging and turn it around.\n\nAlso as a consumer, take a look at the process to buy a Tesla car. You have to put your name on a waiting list for car that you'd be lucky to get in 1.5 years at a premium price. Oh wait, you also risk getting your ordered completely cancelled. How old is the model S and 3 now? 7 years old?  So people are waiting in line for a 7 year old car. And you don't even get much of a federal tax credit for them being electric cars anymore.

Out of curiosity!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sure.\n\nLast year, my father died.  We weren‚Äôt close, but all the same - I accepted it as my responsibility to take care of his downhill decline.  (Not solely my responsibility - but a responsibility nonetheless.). Just before all that happened, my brother in law who was also one of my employees had decided to quit.  It was family and it was also business.  He blamed me for his reason for departure, even though I was convinced he hadn‚Äôt worked hard enough and therefore was his fault.  My entire reason for sharing all this personal info - the lead-in was epic and emotional.  (I‚Äôm still in good relations with my brother-in-law, and I don‚Äôt hold anything against my father.)  I had to hire someone super fast to replace my brother-in-law.  This guy sucked.  Like seriously - even using drugs and alcohol to explain this guys behavior - I can‚Äôt explain his behavior,  I had to let him go.  At literally the exact same time - my dad landed in Hospice and passed away.  It was emotional havoc - knowing I had to be there for my dad and family but at the same time knowing I couldn‚Äôt do anything for them - and I wanted to be there for them and my step-mother.\n\nI was in financial distress.  I had my own business but one of my employees had just quit and the person I rapid-hired to replace him sucked so bad I couldn‚Äôt even use cocaine as an excuse...     Yeah, after my dad died I had nothing to do but to go back to work.  And there was plenty of work to do.  I had to cover my own work as well as the new person, as well as train some new people to take over everything.  I somehow managed to hold it all together.  I don‚Äôt know how.  But somehow - the new people I hired were eventually able to get up to speed, and I was able to hand over a significant amount of work to them.\n\nAbout the same time that my dad was passing away - I realized that it would be in my best interests to refinance my house.  This is the house I‚Äôd gotten a 30-yr mortgage on and had spent the last 5 years paying the 15-yr mortgage rate.  I decided that as long as I needed to refinance - I should do a refinance with as much LTV as possible.  I was able to get 90k cash out of my refinance.\n\nThe income from the business was good, so even though I was approved for a 100% finance on my Model 3, I decided to purchase a Model 3 for $60,500 and put 10% down.  I put the rest (about $70k or so - into buying TSLA stock.)\n\nMy $70k turned into ~50k after the Q1 and Q2 results.  About the same time I learned about options, and about the same time I watched the Autonomy investors live-stream.  My confidence in TSLA‚Äôs tech was never higher, and the stock price was never lower.\n\nI sold half my shares and bought 6/2020 $420 calls.  The stock went down another $20.  I bought more 6/2020 $420 calls.  My average cost per share was $4.69\n\nThe stock continued to hold about the same, even through Q2 results.  Because of beta, my ~70k investment in stocks and subsequent ~50k investment in call options turned into ~20k.\n\nI was nervous and seriously considered re-leveraging before the Q3 results hit.  Did the math and realized it wasn‚Äôt worth the potential upside from Q3.

Despite breaking ground at Gigafactory Shanghai less than 12 months ago, we have already produced just under 1,000 customer salable cars and have begun deliveries. We have also demonstrated production run-rate capability of greater than 3,000 units per week, excluding local battery pack production which began in late December.\n\nLastly, we want to thank our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and supporters who made another record-breaking year possible.\n\nOur net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q4 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more.

All it had to do was open slightly green and I was raking in tendies...\n\nBUT THE FIRST DAY I TRY TO DO SOMETHING WE GO TO FUCKING WAR!?!?!  \n\nOf course, I saw the AH rally and futures looking strong, I thought for sure I was gonna kill it tomorrow, but instead, I'm literally gonna lose every penny more than likely...  \n\nThis absolutely floors me though... I didn't touch SPY this entire bull market, not once.  I literally played roku mostly, and some other random stocks, but the first day I buy SPY calls, FD's at that, futures plummet because Orange man decided he wanted to provoke a war overnight instead of just letting me make some money... What a bunch of absolute garbage...\n\nPlease kill me.\n\nEdit:  Like the Autist I am, I doubled down on SPY calls this morning and its recovering!!  Wish me luck lol\n\nEdit2:  Im gay...

Cramer, the ultimate hype man extraordinaire turns bearish the day I buy Calls.  Literally insane I actually single handedly ended the bull market and started a war.  \n\nWent from up 25% two days ago to down 60% today. Im optimistic. Afterall, money is just paper anyway.  \n\n Final Edit 4: ok.  So.  Rode some dailies all the way up till just now.  Ended up selling on this spike down because I made like 20-30% and it dropped so I decided to take profits instead of holding while this dumpster fire unfolds.  Currently sitting at about down 40% overall, compared to my 2 days ago up 25-30% so not great, but better than my -60% earlier today.  Not gonna lie.  Its been a wild ride, prolly gonna do it again next week, I havent learned shit.  Im either going broke or gonna be rich.  Prolly broke.  But hey, its just paper anyway.  To the idiot that said \"this is on you for buying at ATH\" Its been at ATH for like 10 years bud.  \n\nFinal edit #2:  its my post, I can make as many edits as I want.  Fuck you.   Im dumbfounded I missed that massive drop right there.  Somehow sold my dailies for a gain and bought puts after to spiked down then back up, I bought puts at that top there.  So gonna ride these puts over the weekend as this dumpster fire political environment unfolds.
