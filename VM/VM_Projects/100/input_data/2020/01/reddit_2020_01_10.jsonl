These \"one size fits all\" solutions, though, actually tend to perform *better* than tailor made ones, because in the cloud they run on clusters of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of servers. Most companies can't afford that kind of infrastructure. Plus, even though these solutions are \"one size fits all\", they're also very modular. You don't *have* to use every single piece of the puzzle, you can pick and choose the parts you want.

Customers could expect to just buy it, swap it in, make no changes on their end, and start reaping the savings.  For them, it was a promise of instant extra profits the minute the plane arrives.  Thus it should be obvious they were flooded with orders.\n\nThe new engines are larger and would normally have caused problems for airports if they changed the physical shape of the plane.  That led Boeing to kind of squeeze big engines in a less than ideal positioning onto the plane.  This apparently created a really poorly balanced aircraft.  So to deal with a plane that could easily flip out balance, they enhanced their autopilot software to try and predict that and take control of the tricky maneuvering of a wobbly plane.  But since their marketing pitch was for no customer changes or retraining, this software was supposed to be seamless, and Boeing recommended no pilot retraining.  \n\nAs it (allegedly) played out, the software relies on sensors, and problems with the sensors and the software logic caused the two fatal crashes.  Pilots might have been able to step in and deal with the crisis, but they hadn't received thorough training in how the revised plane and its new autopilot worked.  \n\nInitially there was an idea that Boeing could just improve the sensors and software as a quick fix.  However that would still mean delays and costs for retraining pilots, and undermines the marketing promise.  As we're now a year later, apparently a simple sensor and software fix wasn't enough.  And the regulators, who Boeing had been able to sweet talk, are now reluctant to do any hasty approvals.\n\nI personally don't know, but there are some who claim the engines combined with the plane's shape will always be wobbly and can never be made smooth.

As soon as that happens, we hit the tipping point. After that point, everyone will prefer EV. This is similar to how the society switch to flat TVs and digital cameras.\n\nThere are 2 billion ICE vehicles that need to be replaced. After the tipping point, each year at least 2% ICE owners will want to switch even if the units they have still function fine.

Your point was about the Board. I don't know if you've ever worked in the corporate world, but the Board is seldom heavily comprised of techies. That's because the role of a board is not to manage the company day to day. Your BS about NVDA is stupid as fuck given that Huang (Idk who Jenson is) came from AMD, which even at that point had a bunch of computer scientists and engineers in its BOD and rank and file. How well did that work out for them? Then there's also the obvious case of Jobs and Apple (i.e. pre his rescue). To have a successful company, you need talent from every discipline.

Before, every engineer would engineer a little margin in each component that they were responsible for ending up with a bunch of margin when the whole aircraft was constructed.  Now, whoever the lead is manages to model all the margin in the aircraft as a whole, therefore being able to be both more efficient, but also making margins thinner throughout.
