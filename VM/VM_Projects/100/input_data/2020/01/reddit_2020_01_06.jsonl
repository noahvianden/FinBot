It is inherently unstable because of the move of the engine locations in order to have larger and more efficient engines. The main problem with the instability is that it contains a negative feedback loop. The definition of negative here is \"unwanted behaviour\". So in certain situations like a possible stall when you add more power you get the unwanted behaviour of the plane pitching up further which actually increases the chance of a stall occurring and also negates the purpose of adding power. Which  would involve more power being required to be added which results in an obviously undesirable feedback loop.\n\nThe only known types of planes which have a unstable feedback loop which must be compensated by computer are military based. In particular fighter jets this is why they have such fast roll, pitch rates (when they roll they want to roll further and faster). No other commercially/civilian available plane actually has instability corrected by computer for this reasons. When you have a commercial airliners and you roll them they \"centre the stick\" they automatically by design attempt to roll back to level again. Same happens on pitch, yaw and various other common flight characteristics and the 737 MAX is an exception to this rule.\n\nEven if it passes the US regulator in this case.

Sure, there's some industry knowledge they're having to learn that competitors have known for decades... but for the most part Tesla is crushing it.  Musk attracts -very- talented people.\n\nThis actually gets to the heart of perhaps 75%+ of what I like about Tesla and maybe half of what I like about Musk... and it's actually a huge part of why I think Tesla is going to be nearly unstoppable for quite some time.\n\nMy strong impression is that the normal process for any modern manufacturing is to optimize as much of your design as possible up front, before building the factory or line... then perhaps take lessons learned to inform the NEXT factory or line.  Improvements and retooling happen, but quite slowly and the scope of individual improvements stays small.  This is MBA-driven management.  (make the business case for something, decide to do it, and get it done)   To justify making a significant improvement on an existing line would take engineers recognizing the potential improvement (I think they're not on the line watching how things run nearly as much as Tesla is), then building a business case and pushing it through to whatever management level is required for it to be approved.  The risk to someone's career for trying out something wildly different and failing would be catastrophic, so it's avoided.\n\nAlso, mediocre engineers LOVE to sit at their desks looking at designs and simulations without \"getting their hands dirty\" or \"stooping to the level of a mechanic\" by going out and watching how everything actually fits together or how the products of their intellectual labor are fully realized in production.  You'd think it'd be obviously a good idea, but it's rarely done.  It's kind of a classist thing... white collar engineers not wanting to go associate themselves with blue collar work.  Good/great engineers usually know that's ridiculous... but mid level really tend to think that way.\n\nI can't tell you how many software development teams I've been a part of that never bothered to send people to watch how people actually use the system.  They just depend on operations managers to feed back new or changed requirements to them.  Those operations people are not software developers though, so they don't fully recognize what can be improved or how it could be different. Whenever I saw how things were actually used, it usually drove me crazy.  Nothing ends up coming of that, though... because there's no incentive for the software managers to be proactive.  They just wait for new requirements.\n\nI've also seen the same sort of thing with machining parts.  Mechanical engineers rarely if ever bother to see how their parts actually get machined.  Machinists pride themselves on figuring out how to machine a difficult part, so difficult parts are actually fun for them.  Sometimes, an enterprising machine shop or machinist may try to suggest improvements... but in effect they're saving the customer time and possibly reducing their billable time.  I've even witnessed engineering managers completely chew out a machinist for having the nerve to suggest there was a better way to do something.  So often, very simple design changes can make parts drastically easier to produce... but there's no incentive for anyone to look for them.  Engineering would just be highlighting how they didn't get it right the first time, and machinists would lose work.  There is a time in the design cycle to look for those improvements... but they're typically just done in a short research stage (relative to how long something is in production) before finalizing the design / building the line.\n\nThen there's the whole \"If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail\" thing with how problems tend to get solved within a person's own domain of expertise.  Rarely are problems correctly divided between domains (Software, mechanical, electrical, etc)... there just aren't enough people that can cross those domains to recognize when something should be done differently.\n\nThese kinds of observations regarding the typically high levels of dysfunction in corporate engineering was perhaps the greatest single piece of encouragement I took in deciding to start my company.  It's why my company is also highly vertical, why I'm still regularly taking a day to go run manufacturing equipment... looking for places to improve.  I can guarantee my approach is a huge part of why we're successful.\n\nI have the strong impression Musk approaches engineering and manufacturing very similarly.  It's so much of what I like about him... it's me cheering from the sidelines as he champions an engineering-driven corporate philosophy vs. the usual MBA-driven one.  He's my guy, he's championing more or less my style of business.  I can finally point to Tesla and SpaceX when one of my kid's friends' MBA parents decide to try to tell me what I'm doing wrong (\"You need to outsource, focus on your core competencies\").  It's far from a definitive justification of a highly vertical, engineering-first approach... but at least I've got something to respond with now.\n\nTesla pays a huge amount of attention on the manufacturing processes and equipment (more than designing the products themselves).  Lately, Musk has been repeating his \"the best process is no process, the best part is no part\" mantra everywhere.  He obviously is not just asking engineers to go design, implement something, and move on... he's focusing them on looking everywhere for some way to improve things.  Making something isn't likely to impress Musk.. Making something BETTER is.  He encourages engineers to take risks when suggesting something and think big.  It's a stronger focus on continuous improvement than (I believe) anywhere else in the competitive landscape, by a wide margin.\n\nThat plus the usual high level of dysfunction in most corporate processes leads me to believe there's a huge scope for possible improvements. This stuff is horribly complex... they'll probably adopt quite a few standard industry practices at first, and slowly figure out what was not so good and improve it.\n\nSo, that's why I believe they have as long way to go on improving margins... and more generally why they're so difficult to beat.\n\nOk, fuck it.

{"title": "Credit Spreads Are Literally Free Money", "selftext": "So I just recently started trading options, and like most noob retards I just bought calls and puts because everything else was too confusing and hard.  Credit spreads, iron condors, butterflies?  What the fuck does that mean?  Stock going up= Calls, stock going down= Puts.  I thought that was so simple and easy.  Turns out it was simple and easy except my win percentage was like 20%, and I was losing a bunch of money.  I started to get pissed off, but then I realized that if buying calls and puts only won like 20% of the time, then selling them must win 80% of the time.  So I switched strategies and looked into selling calls/puts.  I learned ( I know learning might be too difficult a concept for some of you retards) that selling calls/puts had a much higher probability of success, but also had basically unlimited loss potential if you're wrong.  Now since I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, I learned about credit spreads, which not only have a massively high probability of winning, but also cap your losses at a certain amount.  These things literally CAN'T go tits up.  I'm now trading credit spreads and holy shit these things are literally free money.  Like just pick a number you know the stock isn't going to go past and sell that call/put. Then just buy a call/put and little further out of the money, just in case shit goes bad, and you get to keep all that juicy premium you collected when you sold.  FREE FUCKING MONEY.  Check it out.  AMD is a fucking bull train running harder than the train your friend's ran on your sister last night.  No way that shit drops below $47 again.  Sell the $47 put, buy the $45 because I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, and the difference in premium is all yours when the options expire, mine are 1/10s.  Free fucking money.

But when you lose, you tend to lose big relative to your wins.  One loss can wipe out many weeks of wins.\n\nFor choosing stocks, I tend to go for stocks that are slightly volatile (so that your premium for selling will be high), but not so volatile as to be crazy unpredictable and dangerous.  Usually I aim for stocks with 20-30% implied volatility (on robinhood, click on one of the near the money options and see what the implied volatility is).  I have recently had a lot of luck with tech stocks, especially AAPL.  MSFT, NVDA, and NFLX have also been good to me recently.\n\nYour chances of making money will depend on how far out of the money your spread is.  When you sell an option on robinhood you can see the \"chance of profit\".  I generally try to stay in the 85% or even 90% area.  The farther out of the money you go the less premium you collect, but the greater the chances that the stock doesn't move against you.  I generally aim to collect premium of 3-6% of whatever I'm putting at risk.  So if I were putting $1000 at risk, I would want to collect $30-60 in premium.  (You can see here why the wins are small and the occasional loss can be big.)  If you are less risk averse than me you could go for smaller chance of profit but collect bigger premiums.\n\nThe width of your spread will determine your max loss.  I generally do $10 spreads ($1000 max loss).  I think of this as the amount that I'm investing.  If you want to \"invest\" more, it usually is better to make a wider spread rather than opening more contracts.  The wider your spread is, the more you can lose, but the farther the stock has to fall for you to experience max loss.  If you have 10 $1 spreads, or 1 $10 spread, your max loss is the same, but the stock has to fall a lot more in the latter case for you to experience max loss.\n\nThere are a lot of strategies for picking expiration date.  A popular one is to choose a date a month+ out, and then close it as soon as it has hit your profit target. This has the advantage that you can usually exit the trade without too much loss if you see it going against you.
