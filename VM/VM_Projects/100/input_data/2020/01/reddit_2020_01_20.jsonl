Here are some of the reasons why I believe Slack is still going to lose significant market cap.\n\n*Users:* Companies like Slack are judged primarily on their MAUs, subscription base & its ability to attract new users. Slack has been failing @ the latter. \n\nBTW Slack spends about 28cents on every dollar to acquire a user. Only 16% of these users actually give Slack money - i.e paying customers.\n\n\n*Competition:* Slack's moat has been eroded, it's just another software company. Microsoft Teams launched in 2017, 8yrs after Slack now has more users than Slack. \n\nBy bundling Teams with the rest of it's services, MSFT eliminated their cost to acquire new users and it's a no-brainer for companies already within the Microsoft ecosystem to add Teams to their communication arsenal.\n\nFacebook @Work a.k.a Workplace is another stiff competition. \n\n*Moat:* Slack no longer has a moat. It used to be a great communication tool that improved quality of work. Now, the product itself is filled with bloatware as the company/product struggle to find identity. \n\nSlack missed the opportunity to layer value added services. These things would have been multiple hooks used to retain or attract a divers customer base. Unfortunately, their entire product is now a feature of MSFT's offering.\n\n >>>>>>>>\n\nIn conclusion, I don't know the maths but it's super overpriced. I reckon something in the early $20s may be a fair valuation. For that to stick, Stewart Butterfield and the rest of the team needs to figure what Slack should evolve to be.

See $24k YOLO below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MARKETSHARE CREEP**: As the collective US/EU retail industry looks around and wonders if they should be establishing or growing their competitor's cash cow, they'll be looking to strategically invest elsewhere. There are only a handful of major IaaS providers: Microsoft, Google, IBM. Microsoft has greater IaaS market share than every other remaining hypersized cloud player combined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Player|2018 IaaS Market Share / Year Prior +/-|\n|:-|:-|\n|Amazon Web Services $AMZN|47.8% (-1.6)|\n|Microsoft Azure $MSFT|15.5% (+2.8)|\n|Alibaba Cloud $BABA|7.7% (+2.4)|\n|Google Cloud Platform $GOOG|4% (+0.7)|\n|IBM Cloud $IBM|1.8% (-0.1)|\n\nSource:  [https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018)\n\nFor the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of \\*\\[the new\\] big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.\n   * Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform by Microsoft that can be run fully disconnected and power containers (Kubernetes, Docker), other PaaS platforms (Pivotal CF, Red Hat OpenShift), and more. The solution has a multi-year head start in the availability in the marketplace, ahead of AWS competing solution Outpost - of which does not support fully disconnected scenarios.\n* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.\n* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform. Microsoft has enjoyed steady climbs after most favorable earning events, provided its largely institutional (\\~73%) ownership isn't panicking.\n* **ADD per** u/ryryshouse6 **THE GREEN BUTTERFLY AFFECT:** As ETFs, funds, and retail investors will continue to gravitate toward environmentally-friendly companies, $MSFT serves as a very attractive Software Service option for managers to justify taking or increasing stakes with $MSFT. Microsoft already enjoys an overall \"Leader\" ESG score vs. Software industry according to MSCI ESG Research 2019 report, not taking into account the recent $1b investment to go carbon-negative by Microsoft.\n\n[MSFT 07\\/18 - present day](https://preview.redd.it/3p9ccnoj0ub41.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=191d019a0e7af40f2cca475e20db6d2bd60cedb4)\n\nMY $23,958.32‬ YOLO:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvizq7hj1ub41.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=246b5fccb66ce5191d9e562bc723df21bb892f5e", "id": "er5ip4", "created_utc": 1579482278.0, "score": 269, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "RIP to GOOG\n\nSaw an article Friday PM that said Epic Systems was using AMZN and MSFT solutions and moving away from GOOG due to privacy concerns.\n\nAMZN + MSFT are good long-term dueling stocks with very different base-sectors.", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "Didnt Microsoft announce that all green shit last week?

I made $30,000.\n\nMy life has literally changed overnight.
