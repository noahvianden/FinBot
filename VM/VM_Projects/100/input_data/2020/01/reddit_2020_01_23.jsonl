They don't lose by selling stocks, they just earn less potentially next week.\n\nOn the other hand, option buyers is either hedging (fixing a future price) or gambling. In either case, they usually don't have that much cash with them to buy the underlying stock now. And smart option buyers roll forward rather than wait til last week, and sometimes execute the option after Friday closes (for tax purpose).\n\nStock does not always drop back to option max pain exactly, because 1. if there are too much gamblers selling naked calls, they have no stock to backup; 2. big players also need to balance the entire portfolio not just option, and for future weeks not just one week; 3. buying force far exceeding outstanding calls that week.

I learned option basics from financial math course years ago, and only started playing with it recently, and search google whenever needed (learned rolling forward and option max pain by browing this reddit).
