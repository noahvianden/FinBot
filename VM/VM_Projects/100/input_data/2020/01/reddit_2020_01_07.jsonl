It’s currently out of control, and they estimate ~3,000 cars can go lost. Unsubstantiated rumors suggest it was an electric vehicle catching fire that started it, and with Tesla being a disproportionate amount of the EVs sold here, there’s a significant possibility it was one of their cars. If so, shorts can be looking forward to a late Christmas present with headlines like «Fire caused by Tesla destroys 3,000 cars!»\n\nSo the opportunity for you, my fellow retards, is to gamble that it was, in fact, a Tesla that started it and load up on some OTM puts expiring Friday.
