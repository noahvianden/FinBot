But I do know that he have sold shares for roughly 3 billion in the past few years, 2 billion went to his space company (1 billion to fund it at first and another billion later on) and the last billion he probably bought real estate with and/or whatever other projects he's working on.\n\nEither way, he probably sits on 15-25 million in cash.

The reason he could \"spread his wings\" was because he diversified his income and didn't solely rely on his Microsoft shares.
