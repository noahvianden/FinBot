Everything you would from a 30k car is available in a tesla and more difference is you also get a great interface, a smoother quieter ride, and much more storage. The cost is then offset by maintenance (unless you get a defect that tesla pays for) and refuel costs. \n\nps. if you are referencing the model x as being 130k thats wrong too, the model x is 104990 its easy to find these numbers btw its on their website.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I'm a Tesla bear and this is still the dumbest shit I've read all year.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Investing emotionally is dangerous.
