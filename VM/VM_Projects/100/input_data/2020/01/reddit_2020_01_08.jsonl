They make products that fit the narrative, but doesn't actually advance the world to a sustainable energy future. Why? Because consumers don't matter for climate change.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if everyone who owned cars switched to electric? That the Earth would not get polluted as much? Nope, not really. Even if you don't consider the fact that making electric cars is quite polluting, it still wouldn't change anything.\n\nWhy? Because consumers don't actually pollute that much. Corporations do. A couple giant cargo ships pollute more than all American cars combined. And the US alone has hundreds of cargo ships. \n\nSo wtf do you think electric cars will do? Cuz the truth is absolutely nothing. It's a great car that you can feel good driving, but don't delude yourself into thinking you as a consumer is helping save the planet or something. \n\nDid you know green companies were started by polluting companies? Why? To divert blame from themselves to consumers. \"Oh, instead of corporations producing less plastic, why doesn't the consumer just recycle? Which then goes to... Another company who usually decides to chuck it in the landfill anyway.\"\n\nIn fact, Coca-Cola is one of the original companies that created the first green companies. They used to sell Coke in glass bottles that you can return and they'd reuse. But then they switched to plastic bottles because it's literally cheaper to make a plastic bottle than it is to wash a glass one.\n\nThey created waste then put the blame on us to clean up. But here's the thing. Recycling doesn't really solve anything. In fact, it's supposed to be the last resort of \"reduce, reuse, recycle\" yet somehow today we mostly forgot the first 2 r's.\n\nRecycling puts plastic back into circulation so less plastic is created, but it's still in the system and will eventually go to the landfill no matter what. The problem is there's so much plastic, not that people aren't recycling enough. And that's on companies, not consumers.\n\nYou see? There's really nothing you can do to save the planet, that's up to corporations and governments. Entities of people. Not individual people. Because every problem destroying the Earth is caused by those entities, not by the individual population. The individual population has pretty much a negligible effect.\n\nI have more examples but this is pretty long and everything else you said is probably true. But don't kid yourself into thinking electric cars are some ultimate solution. It's just a marketing slogan. It's not true. \n\nEspecially if you live where your electric grid is coal-based. Which a lot of places still are at least partially. Which means charging your electric car is literally the same as filling up a gasoline car.\n\nAlso. Tesla fucking sucks. I don't approve of any giant company or corporation that doesn't allow unionizing of its working class employees. Fuck Elon.

Every one wants to know buy or sell etc. My take is that this stock has a very difficult to locate fair price. There is a relatively high probability for everything from 0 to 4000. That's called a flat distribution. Most stocks have a narrow range given by historical values, lower growth, and predictable outcomes. This one much less so.\n\nYour position should be proportional to your belief that a stock is not fairly valued, which is usually proportional to distance from price target. With a flat distribution, when the price changes, the strength of your belief changes little. So logically you should only make small changes to adjust. \n\nMost people are going to end up trading based on whim rather than any science, that leads to flip flopping every hour based on neurotransmitters and minor details.\n\nA sanity check is useful. Is 90b$ crazy? Something like that is 30 p/e on 7.5% net margin on 40b$ revenue. None of those numbers seem crazy to me. It's about 600k cars and about 20% forward revenue growth. They don't have to do this in 2020 or even 2021. But it has to look like a minimum averaged out over the long future. \n\nHigh valuations can include assignment of far off opportunities like robotaxi. That's how uber and Waymo (and many many companies) got their high values before proof. This is where shorts are often deliberately ignorant. I think if auto alone can justify valuation we are sitting pretty because all the rest is gravy and Tesla has very valuable long shot opportunities.\n\nPersonally I am not selling till at least 800 and then only very slowly. Q1 might be rather ugly compared to implied expectations like last year but keep in mind what is happening now despite bad q1 last year I do not recommend timing and predicting this history repeating itself. The market is trickier than that. \n\nAlso remember taxes. There is a significant benefit to holding 20 years rather than thrashing around and sending cash to the bureaucrats.

Then it started dipping, dipping dipping to 180. Got margin called several times. Each day was hard for me and my wife who saw our money get smaller and smaller. But at the same time, we both knew this was temporary. We were prepared to wait even 10+ years if it meant good returns. We believed in the company. At one point when it was super low, and all the analysts were predicting 10$, 0$, 25$, no demand bull shit, it was kinda a wake up call for me to realize that all these analysts are completely full of shit. I mean everyone kinda knows that, but for the Citi Analyst to say that Tesla is worth $10 is a whole another level of bullshittery. We went even more all in. Got a couple of 0% credit card loans. Took more margin loan. Searched the cushions for spare change. Took a 401k loan (which is borrowing from my own 401k and paying interest to myself) for the max amount possible, and went all in on deep ITM very short term puts which ended up with me owning the shares. Also got a few 2021 LEAPS.\n\nHonestly I never expected the returns so soon. Needless to say I am in a whole another tax bracket now and my account balance looks surreal.

Basically:\n\n3 things suddenly happened to the plane at 8,000 feet: loss of all communications with the crew, plane starts descending rapidly and catches fire.\n\nFirst of all, the communications: the plane still didn't hit the 10,000 feet speed restriction threshold which means it normally would be flying at the speed of 250 knots with a rate of climb between 2000-3500 ft/min. It would take a lot of time for it to lose momentum and hit the ground after the incident happened (at least 40 seconds). In almost every airplane crash in the past pilots did say something to the ATC, even when they had less time to respond. On top of that, the transponder immediately went off. The only way that's possible is the complete failure of both the electrical system and the standby battery within 10 seconds of each other (time it would take for the pilots to react). Which is almost impossible.\n\nSecond of all, the fire: engines wouldn't be able to cause such a huge fire since the elements which surround them are fireproof/can withstand high temperatures. The only thing that could technically be able to do that would be in the cargo or in the cabin. But nothing that would normally be allowed onto the airplane would cause the entire aircraft to turn into a giant fireball. Which means either someone smuggled high explosives or something hit it from the outside (like a missile)\n\nThird of all, the rapid descent: even if both engines lost all power, pilots would still be able to glide the plane to the ground, unless obviously control surfaces didn't work properly. In order to lose all hydraulics you would need to disable both A, B and standby hydraulic systems which are independent from each other, are all over the plane, and located in a way, that the plane would have to take damage from all sides for all of it to fail.\n\nIn my opinion, it was likely a missile. 737NG (not MAX) is a very reliable airplane with a bit less that 0.06 crashes per 1,000,000 flights.

Typically air defence systems are not fully automated and would still need human authorization to launch (well, hopefully they do atleast) however, I would assume that missile defence systems, or ICBM defence systems would be automated just because the timeframe from target detection to when that missile hits its target is a much smaller amount of time compared to a jet flying in with a potential payload. \n\nMaybe Iran has a make shift missile defence system of some kind that is completely autonomous, and it was turned on and told to fire at will since they were expecting retaliation.
