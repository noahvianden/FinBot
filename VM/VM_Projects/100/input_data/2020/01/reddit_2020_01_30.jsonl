I understand your deep love for this company but let me  throw some numbers at you to see if you think the current price is justified. Let's say Tesla will eventually get its earnings up to the point that the stock will have a P/E of around 50. So if the stock doesn't move at all that's a 150√ó earnings of what they are making now. But let's say this is the likely scenario and give it a .8 percent probability but let us also say that there may be competition in there space from other tech companies in the future so let's put that at a .2 probability. Let us assume in the second case Tesla still grows but not as much so maybe 10x there earnings. So now your long run estimate of the earnings that should have just went from 49 billion to about 10 billion.

They will keep chugging along fine though as the market for gas fired autos is safe for the next decade or so. After that?

If we subtract the cost OP spent on each contract, we find the strike price of the calls is $1880. The EXP Date (expiration date) is 1/31, or tomorrow at close. Finally, the current price ($29.23) is the \"current\" price of the contracts. Because option markets are open only during normal trading hours, this cost represents the last price at close and are not updated to reflect after-hours market movement.\n\nIn summary, OP walked up to a roulette table and slapped 77 grand in cash on the \"AMZN stock will be above 1905 by the end of day tomorrow\". Note that is closed at 1870 today. If it's above 1905 by tomorrow, he will gain money overall. And if it's below 1905 he will lose money. If it's below 1880, he will lose ALL 77K.\n\nAMZN absolutely fucking killed earnings, released after hours today. Straight up Trogdor Burninating the peasants type of slaughter. In after hours trading AMZN is now at 2074. OPs call options are now \"in the money\" which means they have intrinsic value, because they allow the owner of the contract (currently OP) to buy 3000 shares of AMZN from someone at a price of $1880, when it's clearly market valued at $2074. What a deal right?! That intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price (1880) and the market price (2074), which is $194.\n\nLet's say OP doesn't have the capital to buy 3000 fucking shares of AMZN ($6 mill+ now) in order to then immediately sell it for a profit. Well, that's fine, because somebody in the market absolutely does, and will buy his contracts off him for at least $194.\n\nThus OP bought 30 contracts, each at a cost of $2,578 ($77K initial cost) and is going to be able to sell them tomorrow for at least $19,400 each ($582K final result). So 582K-77K initial cost = 500K+ profit, as OP stated in title. Another way to look at it is: 194/25.78 = 7.53x multiplier in one night, on a 77K bet.\n\n**Edit:** It is **seriously concerning** that, on a stock market subreddit, a detailed explanation of how call options cost and profits are calculated is given gold.

It's a little more complicated so it may be longer. \n\nThere's a bunch of math involved in determining the \"true value\" of an option and frankly you don't need to know that much about it (look up the Greeks if you want to learn more). The main thing you need to know is that an option contract's value is the sum of two things: 1) intrinsic value and 2) extrinsic value. **Price of contract = intrinsic value + extrinsic value**. Importantly, at expiration, the only thing that remains is the intrinsic value. \n\n1) Intrinsic value is zero whenever the option is out of the money (OTM), and is equal to the difference in the strike price and the current underlying stock price when it is in the money (ITM). If you are **buying call or puts** the ideal situation is for your contracts to gain as much intrinsic value as possible before it expires.  When OP bought this contract the intrinsic value was 0 because it was OTM. It was literally worthless, intrinsically. So why the hell did he pay 77K for it?!\n\n2) Because of the simplified equation. Remember, options price = intrinsic + extrinsic. He paid for the extrinsinc value of the contract, hoping that by the expiration it would have intrinsic value. Put simply, **extrinsic value is the capacity for the contract to create intrinsic value before its expiration.** What the fuck does that mean exactly? Reread it and try to understand what that means. What factors might go into the capacity for a contract to create intrinsic value before its expiration? Seriously, try to come up with some answers before I explain. \n\nIf the underlying stock's price moves a TON daily, swings of + or - 5% regularly (weed stocks, BYND, meme stocks in general), then a call option that relies on a +5% increase to be in the money will be more expensive than a call option for a different stock that only sees regular swings of + or - 1% (MSFT, SPY, any established company). The extrinsic value is HIGHER for the more volatile stock, because it will always have a HIGHER capacity to create more intrinsic value.\n\nAnother factor that goes into extrinsinc value is time until expiration. This one is pretty obvious. The further out an option contract's expiration, the more time that a stock's price can actually move. The more time that a stock's price can actually move, the HIGHER the capacity to create intrinsic values for options, and thus the higher the extrinsic value. This factor of extrinsinc value is responsible for the classic \"time decay\" of option contracts. Why? Because when you buy OTM options, say a month out, their value is FULLY extrinsinc. And if, after time passes, you are still holding onto those previously-month-out contracts that now expire tomorrow and it's *still* OTM, it has only ONE DAY for the stock to move enough to get in the money. It used to have a month remaining. So clearly you lost some capacity to create intrinsic value since the time you bought it. Thus all option contracts shed value with the passage of time, *especially* OTM options though because that's the entirety of the value. (Theta gang [a reference to one of the Greeks theta] loves this shedding of extrinsinc value over time. That's ultimately how they make their money!)\n\nAnother factor for the capacity to create intrinsic value (our working definition of extrinsinc value) is a \"catalyst event\". Sometimes catalysts are publically announced scheduled things, such as earnings reports (AMZN in this thread) or a new product reveal (Cybertruck). But other events could simply be randomly timed updates on current world events (Trump tweeting about Trade War, coronavirus, brand new Boeing planes forcing themselves into the ground, etc.) Before a scheduled catalyst event occurs, like earnings, the capacity to create intrinsic value is HIGH, because there's a \"known unknown\" that gets everyone fucking hyped regardless of what direction you actually think the stock will go. Thus before scheduled catalyst events, extrinsinc value is HIGH. The next trading day AFTER that known unknown turns into a known known, that capacity is gone. It has been fully dissolved into the actuality of the stock price. No one is hyped anymore that the stock *can possibly* move a huge amount. There's only celebrating for the people who bet correctly (like OP), or despair and sadness for the people who didn't.\n\nFinally, the last major factor in extrinsinc value is the price difference between the current stock price and the strike price. This is another obvious explanation. Because intrinsic value is based solely on being ITM, and the amount to which you are ITM, the more extreme the strike price the less extrinsinc value it has because the LESS capacity it has to create intrinsic value. For example, OP could have bought $2000 calls expiring tomorrow for something like $2.50 before earnings. (I think I saw this price somewhere on this thread). Instead he bought $1880 calls for $25.78. That huge difference in price represents the huge amount of extrinsinc value difference. Clearly the chance that AMZN hit $2000 by tomorrow, after closing at $1870, was waaaay less than AMZN hitting $1880 by tomorrow. The capacity to create intrinsic value (by getting beyond the strike price) was waaaay less for the $2000 strike call. Thus the extrinsinc value was waaaay less.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for writing this out.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I was going to give you another upvote, but you left out the Strongbad reference.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Trogdor Burninating the Peasants.\n\n\nWhy in the fuck do I see a SB/Homestar reference from 2007 in WSB? \n\nGod I love it here more and more everyday.", "score": 161, "replies": [{"body": "Really outrageous and it‚Äôs nearly the most impressive part of the rant.", "score": 39, "replies": []}, {"body": "STWONGBAED", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Heh, and we recognize it.

It's an incredibly important distinction. \n\nThere's actually two ways you can buy or sell options. You can Buy to Open, Sell to Open, Buy to Close, or Sell to Close. They come in pairs (Buy to Open, then Sell to Close) or (Sell to Open, then Buy to Close). Normally Selling to Open is referred to as \"writing\" options. \n\nThere's always two parties to each option contract. One party (the buyer) is paying a premium to the other party (the seller), in exchange for the options contract (the option to buy/sell stock after it hits a certain strike price, before the expiration date). The OP in this thread did a Buy to Open for a Call contract. What that means is he paid someone $77K for the option to BUY 3000 shares of AMZN if it goes above $1,880 by tomorrow. This is signified by the +30. Someone got paid that $77K to either Sell to Open, or Sell to Close. We don't know and we also don't really care because all the contracts are technically the same and \"being assigned\" occurs at the broker level. \n\nWhen you Buy to Open (a Call or a Put), you are only EVER risking the amount of money that you pay for the Call or Put. This point is important to remember later. \n\nIf he had done a Sell to Open, OP would have taken the $77K from someone else and been on the hook to sell 3000 shares of AMZN ($5.5mill+) had the option contract gone into the money. In this case, it did go in the money. If OP doesn't have 3000 shares to sell... Well then he needs to pony up millions to buy market value AMZN shares (to then sell them at $1880 for a loss if assigned). The other option is he can Buy to Close the exact contract so that he isn't assigned. The exact contract could now be worth 10x what you got paid for it. So when you Sell to Open you expose yourself to potentially HUGE losses. \n\nSelling to Open without owning the underlying stock is called \"writing naked options\" and is incredibly risky. Selling to Open while owning the proper amount of underlying stock/cash is the smart thing to do. For calls it's called \"Selling Covered Calls\". For puts it's called \"Writing Cash Secured Puts.\" This is a part of a well-known long term strategy named The Wheel of buying a stock to hold it, while selling covered calls to extract value out of that stock. Whenever those calls expire worthless, you write new contracts and get more money. Once your shares are ever called away and assigned, you write puts at the strike price you'd like to buy back in, and gain money until the stock goes back down to your buy in price.\n\nSorry this comment went WAY LONGER than I expected.

There are also more complicated option strategies that allows you to combine selling (to open) and buying (to open) to limit your potential losses (but also lowers maximum gain).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If i may ask - what is selling to Close then looking like?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "People love to over complicate by saying shit like \"buy to open\" vs  \"buy to close\" vs \"sell to open\" vs \"sell to close\". This notion of \"to  open\" vs \"to close\" is completely useless, and only accentuates this  confusion related to \"writing\" options. (TW and ToS do that...)\n\nPeople usually emphasize this notion of WRITING  an option too much, as if there was any difference between \"creating a  new option\" or \"trading one that had been created previously\" or  \"destroying an option\". For example, people who suffer from this  confusion may wonder: \"this option that i just bought... was it just  written by a seller right now? Or was the seller just reselling  something they had previously bought?\". Similarly, you could be  wondering: \"did the seller sell to open? Or did they sell to close?\".  Finally, another common concern that's also due to the same confusion:  \"if I want to close my short put, when I buy that put, what if it is not  exactly the same option that I wrote previously?\" The answer is: it  makes no sense to even consider these questions! They only arise because  of this underlying confusion.\n\nSo, here's how to prevent the confusion: forget about this whole idea  of \"writing\" options. Instead, use a mental model in which options  positions are nothing more than \"counters\". These counters actually do  exist, and are stored in a huge database at the clearing house. And the  way they work is super simple (as should be your mental model!). Here's  how they work.\n\nYou want an option, and the market right now is 1.00 bid, 1.01 ask.  You go to the market and buy that contract for 1.01. All that will  happen is that the clearing house will (a) increment by 1 your counter  for that contract, and (b) decrement by 1 the seller's counter for that  contract. You don't know whether the seller's counter was 0, or  positive, or negative. And it doesn't affect you at all! All that  matters, for you, is that your counter is now 1.\n\nImagine now that the market moves, and it's at 1.05 bid, 1.06 ask.  You want to take profits. You may consider whether you want to add or  remove liquidity (ie, am I in a hurry to get my fill? Or can I wait and  get a rebate?). Whatever you decide, let's say you get your fill. The  clearing house will (a) decrement by 1 your counter for that contract,  and (b) increment by 1 the buyer's counter for that contract! Notice  that all the clearing house is doing is updating counters: the price,  and whether it was adding or removing liquidity, makes no difference!  Also, like before, you have no clue what the other trader's counter was.  In fact, you don't even know whether the other trader was the same as  before or a different one! And again, it doesn't matter at all for you.  All that matters for you is that your counter is now 0.\n\nWith this idea of \"counters\" (which is really how it works), see how  there's no room for confusion regarding \"creating\" or \"destroying\"  contracts, or \"reselling existing ones\", or \"to open\" or \"to close\"?\n\nHere's an \"extra\". Say you sell a given option. You then buy 2x the  same option. What happens? A ton of people will get confused and think  something like \"ok, I first sold 1 to open; then I bought 2, but was it  to open and to close? well, we must separate, so I buy one 1 close, and  only then I buy 1 to open\".\n\nNah. That's just the confusion speaking.\n\nAll that happened was this. Your counter was 0. Then the clearing  house subtracted 1, and it became -1. Then the clearing house added 2,  and it became +1.\n\nSee how everything is easier like this?\n\ncredit to /u/bfreis for this explanation and text.\n\nIn your example of \"selling to close\" just means that you had a position with an option you bought (+1), and you sold it back to the market (-1) to close your position. (+1 from the buy, -1 from the sell. = 0, you are out and the position is closed)", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot man.

A random trader who was short that contract (i.e., counter was negative) is assigned, and that random trader will see his counter corresponding to that same contract increased by 1. Or whatever amount of options were exercised/assigned.\n\nNotice that you don't have to exercise all your contracts. So if you are long 10x of a given option (i.e., counter = +10), and you exercise 2, you end up with counter = +10 - 2 = +8.\n\n> Do I have counterparty credit risk with a CCP, or is that only for OTC derivatives?\n\nOne of the main reasons for a clearing house is to mitigate couterparty credit risk. When you trade a CCP, or really any position, the clearing house will ensure that no matter what happens, you'll be paid whatever you're owed.\n\nThat's why when you trade in the regular markets there isn't \"one specific trader\" who is on the other side. It's just that \"someone\" is on the other side (e.g., that \"random\" assignment is a manifestation of this fact). Margins are held, in part, to ensure that there will be assets available for the clearing house to pay whoever needs to be paid.\n\nWhen you trade OTC derivatives, then you have very direct counterparty credit risk.

The **main** difference if you bought a contract with a further out expiration date (even next week, for example) is the initial cost of the contract.\n\nFor example, the last price listed for the $1,880 call with an expiration date of 3/20 was $67.30. The contract OP bought (expiring tomorrow) was $25.78. Both contracts have an intrinsic value of \\~$194 (the difference between the strike price and market value price is the same for both contracts). So 194/67.30 = 2.88x multiplier. Much less than what OP ended up doing.\n\nWhat I didn't touch on in my previous comment is the extrinsic value, which represents the probability that the underlying stock could go higher (thus gaining more intrinsic value for the call). That's because for the 1/31 expiration calls, there's almost no more time for the stock price to move, relatively speaking, and so the intrinsic value is the bulk of the price of the contract.\n\nThe reason that the 3/20 expiration was $67.30 is because there's *way more time* for the AMZN stock to move, thus it is much more probable that the AMZN stock can get in the money for that $1,880 strike price. After all, AMZN closed at $1,870.\n\nFinally, OP was rewarded with a higher multiplier on his initial bet because he took on more risk. It was a **much** riskier bet to say that AMZN will be above $1,880 by end of day tomorrow than to say that AMZN will be above $1,880 by end of day on March 20th.

I'm not going to explain The Greeks at the bottom, because it's not really that important after you understand the basics of options.

There may be other outstanding bids, for example, maybe there's someone who wants to buy 1000 contracts at $1.30. That doesn't really matter though, because the ASK price is currently at $1.47 x 21. People who are selling the contracts are asking for $1.47, and there's 21 of those asks. Transactions occur, and orders are filled, whenever the Bid and Asks are the same. Then, the next \"closest\" offers are displayed in the Ask and Bid.\n\nMark ($1.46) is (I believe) the *weighted* average between the Bid and Ask. In this case, it's just in the middle of the two Bid and Ask amounts. But if the spread, or the difference, between the Bid and Ask was much larger, then it might not be directly in the middle. The Mark is often the displayed \"price\" in a bunch of brokers, including Robinhood.\n\nPrev Close is previous close, pretty obvious. It's the last price at close of markets. The High and Low are the highest and lowest prices of the contract recorded today.\n\nVolume (2,587) is the amount of contracts that have exchanged hands today.higher volume means there is more liquidity, so if you want to exit your position quickly then you more likely will be if there's large volume.\n\nOpen Interest (4,054) is the amount of contracts that are still outstanding. This is a good number to get a sense of the \"popularity\" that still exists for the option contracts.\n\nImplied Volatility (52.01%) (IV) is a measure of the expected volatility of the underlying stock. I don't actually understand what the number itself means (why is it a percentage, for example), but the concept behind this is that the the more volatile a stock is, the higher the chance that at some point in the future the option will be in the money. IV is talked about a lot on this sub, and really what it comes down to is a measurement of \"certain uncertainty\". Some stocks barely change price on a day to day basis.\n\nChance of Profit (19.14%) is the mathematical calculation, based on all the current Greeks and Implied Volatility data, that you will make a profit if you buy this contract right now at the current price and hold until expiration. I don't see this number as being very useful if you already know that options is essentially gambling. In options, the underlying stock is either gonna go in your direction or not.

The call option contract he bought only gives him the OPTION to buy the shares if it's above the strike price. That's it. It does NOT put OP on the hook for anything if the call is OTM. What you are describing is more similar to a futures contract, where both sides are OBLIGATED to buy/sell shares in the future at some fixed price. \n\nTo be clear, there will be no OTM scenario where OP is forced to buy the 3000 shares. Because that's not the contract he bought/agreed to. He did not expose himself to lose any more money than what he put into the call (77K, which is a shit ton to 95% of people).

That's all they are. There are four main features for any contract.

You have to do simple subtraction to get it instead of it being a listed number.)\n\n3) Expiration date - 1/31\n\n4) Your position (buying or selling) - Buy Call\n\nHere's an analogy. Imagine that OP wandered into a casino filled with traders and people generally knowledgeable in the market and shouted out loud the following \"I bet that AMZN stock will be above $1,880 by end of day tomorrow, and I'm willing to put $77K on this bet. Any takers?\" The answer was yes. Options is a purely zero-sum transaction game (unlike stocks, which can rise in value for all involved). Somebody (we'll call him the dumbass) took his $77K, and in exchange gave him the OPTION to BUY 3000 shares of AMZN for $1,880, but ONLY IF the stock was above that price at any point before the end of day on 1/31. Turns out the earnings made AMZN worth 2050+. So that dumbass in the casino who took OP's bet is now on the hook for 3000 shares of AMZN if OP executes his option. Alternatively, the dumbass can go find OP and say \"You know what, I want to close our bet\" and OP says \"Fine, but you'll have to pay me the difference that I could make if I executed the contracts and then sold the shares at market value.\" Dumbass agrees, and now the bet is resolved and the option contracts no longer exist. \n\nIn this instance, the dumbass basically handed over $500K to the OP.

I don't have any experience with e-publishing, so I didn't know if you have the opportunity to make corrections over time (i.e., is a 2nd ed. of an e-book a thing?).\n\nThanks for creating this community.
