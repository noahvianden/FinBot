Lets take FSLY for example. I missed the stock when it dipped to $80 because I was being absent minded. Its now back at $98. Can I sell $80 PUTS as a way to see if I can enter the stock at a price point I feel comfortable? So if the stock drops below 80 and the PUTS become ITM, I get assigned.

But you're right, I didn't do my research on ERIC prior to buying the Jan 2021 $12c options which I think has left me in a tough spot. I bought the option because it seemed affordable at a price movement I thought was reasonable. But now that  know more about delta, its not that great.\n\nLike you said, ERIC is currently at 11.74. The delta for the Aug 18 $12c is 0.41, but the delta for the Aug 18 $13c is 0.14. And if I understand correctly, delta is a measure of the option price change compared to the underlying equity price change. So if someone was holding the $13c call, a $1 movement in the stock price (ie. 11.74 ---> 12.74) will only return $0.14 of return. Am I understanding this correctly?\n\nBut since the ATM strike of $12 has a delta of 0.41, should I not assume that if the stock price moves from current ($11.74) up $1 ($12.74), the $13c is going to move from a delta of 0.14 to 0.41? Which again becomes favourable for the buyer and unfavourable for the seller.\n\nI'm just trying to understand more (from a mathematical sense) why you're saying that a delta of 0.14 on the Aug 18 $13c is undesirable. I think I understand it, but let me just spell it out for clarity:\n\nYou're saying that since the delta for one strike above the money is 0.14, the delta movement is so aggressive that the risk and cost efficiency of buying options hoping for a price move from $11.74 to $12 is too high. Its more cost effective to buy 100 shares of the stock and just get the gains from the move since the risk profile is much lower and the gains for capital risked would be comparable.

Through backtesting, we know that 30 delta is a good balance between risk and reward (example linked below). So that's why I said 14 delta was bad. Your probability of profit is higher (100 - 14 = 86%), but your premium is lower.\n\nThis is for a short put rather than a short call, but apart from direction, the results should be similar: https://spintwig.com/t-short-put-45-dte-options-backtest/\n\nNotice that the Average Daily P/L and CAGR are pretty good for 30D (30 delta).

However, after looking at a couple of reddit threads I feel like I've made a couple of incorrect assumptions. Firstly, I thought that modern exchanges uses the Black-Scholes Model or a variant to determine the price of options. Is this true? I tried looking on exchange websites and they simply state the factors that go into pricing options, not how it's done.\n\nAs a secondary question, I tried looking to see how options were priced prior to the BSM model. I couldn't find a lot of information, but some forums mentioned that pricing was done arbitrarily and there were many different models in use. However I wasn't able to find a trustworthy source that definitively states this as true.\n\nI would be really grateful to anyone who can help me out here!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "MARKETS DETERMINE PRICES.  \n\nPricing models provide an interpretation on the price.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Really appreciate you taking the time to write this all out.

{"title": "Thoughts on aviation from inside the industry", "selftext": "I see a ton of talk and speculation on this sub about airlines - some good but some totally wrong and showing a clear lack of understanding of the industry instead, but more so how COVID is affecting it. I am an experienced airport operations manager who holds a BS in Aviation Management, so I hope that I can provide a bit of insight. I’m not a financial advisor so I can’t advise you to actually buy or sell anything. A lot of my info is coming from internal docs so I can’t share them as they contain information that can’t be shared. The information I share is likely verifiable with other public sources. \n\nObviously we’re all aware that traffic is way down. But to show you how much it is, in the USA the daily average passenger throughput at commercial service airports this time last year was approx 2.5M. The past four weeks have been hovering at ~750K and are now starting to decline with the most recent data showing just shy of 700K and likely declining through September. Speaking of, airlines have been publishing massive schedule reductions (feel free to buy a Diio subscription if you want data) through September and continue to do so week after week. There is some hope in that the October schedule is being elevated but my personal take is that they are just pushing the schedule in hopes something changes. Hawaii flights have been doing this for months - just having their schedules pushed each month Hawaii renews their quarantine orders. The only somewhat stable international travel I’ve noticed is Mexico flights which are, for something reason, even growing in some capacity. All of this is to say that just because your state is opening doesn’t mean that air travel is returning yet. In fact, I see it declining until the holiday season which is actually normal in a seasonal sense, but is much more drastic right now. \n\nDoes that mean you shouldn’t invest in airlines? I don’t think so. I think that there needs to be a bit more waiting as the aviation industry tends to lag behind general industry and we’ll see some more discounts on airlines like we did back in March. EXCEPT for maybe Southwest because they have insane cash reserves. Also remember that airlines are not “too big to fail” in the financial sense, only the laymen sense. I see a ton of talk on this sub like “Trump would never let American Airlines go under!” It’s not up to Trump, and he would - especially if he had a shiny penny to make off of it. Airlines go under all the time. American is actually a conglomeration of bankrupted airlines at this point. American as a label will probably exist forever, but they could bankrupt and send shares to $0 in the process. \n\nThis does not mean that aviation is doomed forever as I’ve seen on this sub. Do you really think that the fastest and safest transportation method known to modern society will stay dormant forever? Even if Covid never ends our society will perform its own large scale Darwinism experiment. People will fly to Disneyworld or wherever regardless as long as someone is willing to sell them a ticket.  \n\nIm sorry that this post became more of a rant, but I had no real focus for it in the first place. Let me know if you have questions and I’ll try to answer.\n\n**Edit**\n\njust finished some Monday reporting and August continues to bleed air traffic as well, as well as continuing to more in sept with pushes to November for resuming service on some routes. \n\nAs I added in another comment chain - cargo is king right now. Thanks to the explosion in e-commerce, airlines are starting to spread out to keep operating and are even filling seats with packages. Domestic US airlines will probably only carry USPS (or affiliated) items as at least at my airfield FedEx and UPS have their own dedicated flight departments. Speaking of, FedEx and UPS are obviously huge global cargo handlers! Along with DHL as well.\n\nWow I didn’t expect this post to get this kind of attention.

Yes, they'd all have to do it, but airlines have had a long history of magically and simultaneously agreeing on things like bag fees and security and other things.  A \"covid\" fee and a \"cleaning\" fee and a \"sanitizing\" fee and whatever else they can cook up... wouldn't be unprecedented.  Changes that flick the switch from loss to profit and only require them to silently collude seems like a no brainer.\n\nGetting even more ruthless with their schedules could also shift the numbers.

So the 3 major cost levers are already being pulled. I don't think there is much variable cost left to cut. Everything that remains is \"fixed\" cost. We shall see if they can do things like renegotiates leases. It's a big unknown at this point. i.e. you are leasing a 787 dual-aisle widebody from Air Lease for a certain route, now how are you going to fill it? You may be able to substitute a 737 or an A320 on that route, but you've still got a 787 lease sitting on your books generating costs. I'm sure Air Lease and others are extending some credit terms at favorable rates but they aren't likely to want to shift all the risk onto their books just to help the airlines.\n\nIn terms of pricing, I think it is unlikely that they can drastically up-gauge ticket prices on desperate fliers due to the unemployment/economic data that we are seeing, there may not be any capacity to pay drastically increased fees. I do agree that there is likely to be some pricing power though.\n\nFor me, i just think you are taking a lot of risk for not much guarantee of reward.

Start some regional or spin off, stick them with the bad planes and leases and tenured employees, then it can go bankrupt separately on someone else's dime.  \n\nI quite disagree that airlines can't jack prices.
