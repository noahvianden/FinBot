{"title": "Apple & Tesla Announced Stock Splits; Here’s How It Could Impact Your Investments", "selftext": "## What’s A Stock Split And How It Could Affect Your Current Holdings\n\nApple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, let’s understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be ‘too high’. For example, in [Tesla](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=TSLA) 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.\n\nA stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they end up boosting demand and driving up prices. A stock split also reminds investors that the share price had been increasing in the past. It is not surprising that many investors extrapolate the historical growth into the future and bid up the share price again. One thing to also note is that even though the number of outstanding shares increases and stock price decreases, the market capitalization doesn’t change.\n\n# Who Tend To Benefit From Stock Splits?\n\nGenerally speaking, stock splits are neutral events for current shareholders. In the case of the Apple 4-for-1 stock split, you used to own 1 share, but moving forward you will own 4, but the total value remains the same. Essentially, a stock split wouldn’t change the company value, all else being equal. But the truth is, all else is rarely equal when we apply it in the market.\n\nBoth TSLA stock and [AAPL stock](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AAPL) jumped after the announcement. This may be the fifth time for Apple to do a stock split, but it is Tesla’s first. The price change will be more dramatic for Tesla, whose stock split will bring individual share to the $300 range. Compared to Apple’s post-split of $100 range, Tesla’s post-split stock might find it harder to attract smaller investors.\n\nCertain online brokerages offer investors to buy fractional stocks. Conceptually, it offers the same thing in the absence of stock splits. Then again, not all brokerages will offer such services and it’s not that easy to move shares between brokerages. Therefore, it will not create a much stronger demand than actual stock splits. Now, like it or not, news of stock splits tend to cause share prices to jump. And that is not really rational. But who cares? As long as the prices go up, existing shareholders would not be complaining.\n\n## Tesla & Apple’s Stock Splits Could Restart The Trend Again.\n\nIs stock splits a thing in the past? Tracing back the history, in 1997, 102 companies in the [S&P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) split their stocks, and in 2016, only 7 companies did so, a decline of more than 90%. That is about to change when two of the hottest tech companies announced they will be splitting their shares at the end of this month.

{"title": "Can someone make the positive Apple stock outlook make sense?", "selftext": "I am in my twenties and like many \"new\" investors became very interested in the market as a result of the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. I saw a lot of my peers on Twitter and FaceBook making decent gains and it really piqued my interest because I have been saving roughly 4k per month in a high interest savings account and not really doing much else with it. I always thought the market to be too risky for my taste but after becoming comfortable with my base savings, I was ready to start my own journey into investing. I am not really the kind of person to go off of word of mouth so I set out to learn as much as I could on my own through reading and online courses. I took a course on the basics of the stock market on Udemy which mainly covered fundamental analysis but touched on the technical side of things as well. In addition to this I took a more in depth course on just technical analysis which covered trend lines, candlestick patterns etc ... I didn't find it too helpful for long term investments but it still seemed interesting. Lastly I read the Intelligent Investor as well as One Up on WallStreet and a book on basic accounting to help me understand how to decipher what I was seeing on these annual reports and what all of the numbers meant when I was attempting to valuate a potential purchase .... as well as various YouTube courses and tutorials\n\nAll of this has occurred over the course of the past 3 months, so while I have become a little more knowledgeable than most of my friends just blindly throwing money into the market, I still don't feel very confident in my newly developed skills because .... well, they are new and I haven't had enough experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME AND MY JOURNEY INTO THE STOCK MARKET, SKIP TO HERE:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I have been seeing a lot of talk about this 4:1 Apple split that is coming up and while I understand that this doesn't change the company fundamentally at all, I really can't seem to see why Apple is trading for what it is ... or more importantly, why so many analysts are rating it as a \"buy\". I know that Graham specifically warns against needing validation from \"professionals\" for your decision making but since I am still really a newbie, I wanted to know if there is something I am missing in forming my opinion that the stock is severely overvalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is how I arrived at this conclusion:\n\n**Point 1:**\n\nIn my opinion, Apple is nothing more than a 1 dimensional hardware company. When you look at the annual report for FY 19' the revenue stemmed from the following:\n\n* iPhone Sales: 54.7%\n* Services: 17.8%\n* Mac: 9.9%\n* Wearables, Home, & Accessories: 9.4%\n* iPad: 8.2%\n\nOut of all of these things, the only one that is not hardware is services which means that 82.2% of the sales come from hardware alone ... mainly iPhone.\n\nFurthermore, if you look at what exactly makes up this \"services\" category you will see that it is Apple Music, Apple Care, iCloud, App Store Subscriptions, and also baked in there is the free version of iCloud, Maps, and Siri.\n\nNow, while I respect apple for growing this particular vertical (services) of its company which has experienced some good growth over the last few years\n\n2017: $32,700M in sales\n\n2018: $39,748M in sales (increase of 21.55%)\n\n2019: $46,291M in sales (increase of 16.46%)\n\nI can't help but also realize how closely coupled the services vertical is to the hardware vertical. Mostly all of the services Apple provides depend on the successful sale of its hardware. I can speak personally that I cancelled Apple Music in 2017 for Spotify because I switched jobs (software engineer) to a position that required me to work in a secure environment where I couldn't bring in my phone and since Apple Music had no web app, I couldn't listen to music and code while at work. This makes me weary of their services business as a whole because if for some reason the hardware becomes less popular then the services will suffer severely it seems ... you don't really need Apple Music without an iPhone .... and you aren't really paying for app store subscriptions if you don't have an iPhone or Mac ... and you also don't need Apple Care without an Apple Device, see where I am heading?\n\n&#x200B;\n\niPhone sales are plateauing which can be seen by the data leading up to 2018 as well as the official announcement from Apple that they would stop providing exact numbers on the numbers of units sold at the end of 2018.

PC sales have been declining across the board for a while due to the fact that handhelds have become increasingly more powerful, this has also resulted in the plateauing of Mac sales as well. Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say all of this to point out that for a company that is getting 82% of its sales from hardware, the hardware growth seems to be slowing down tremendously and the services market that it seems to be  shifting into seems largely dependent on the hardware, which seems concerning to say the least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Point 2:**\n\nApple does not appear to either be a growth stock or a value stock in the current climate. Don't get me wrong, I think Apple is pretty good company as a whole and they appear to clearly be financially stable  even despite the declining hardware sales ... but at this price they are far from a \"value\" stock and from a financial perspective, they don't seem to be a \"growth\" stock either.\n\nWhen you look at net income for the past 5 years you will notice that it hasn't really changed too much, when comparing the most recent annual report with the one from 5 years ago the net income has only increased by 3.5% which doesn't even take into account inflation which in actuality would make it seem like the net income for FY 19' was actually less than what was earned in FY 15'\n\n2015: $53.39B\n\n2016: $45.69B\n\n2017: $48.35B\n\n2018: $59.53B\n\n2019:  $55.26B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, what seems funky to me is that the EPS actually seems to be increasing over time ... but it is not due to the net income rising, it is due to the fact that Apple has been buying back stock each year thus decreasing the total number of shares outstanding from 5.75B in 2015 to 4.62B in 2019, a decrease of 19.65% over the past 5 years ... this makes the EPS seem higher and the P/E seem lower, making the stock seem more valuable than it actually is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SHARES OUTSTANDING:**\n\n2015: 5.75B\n\n2016: 5.47B (-4.87%)\n\n2017: 5.22B (-4.57%)\n\n2018: 4.96B (-4.98%)\n\n2019: 4.62B (-6.85%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: - 19.65%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS (as is in annual report):**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $8.35 (-10.02%)\n\n2017: $9.27 (+11.02%)\n\n2018: $12.01 (+29.56%)\n\n2019:  $11.97 (-0.37%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +28.99%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS (based on consistent shares outstanding of 5.75B across all years)**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $7.94 (-14.44%)\n\n2017: $8.40 (+5.79%)\n\n2018: $10.35 (+23.21%)\n\n2019:  $9.61 (-7.15%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +3.56%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen if we use each 2019 EPS to calculate the P/E based on todays closing price of $452.04\n\n**P/E TTM as is:** $37.76\n\n**P/E TTM adjusted based on consistent shares outstanding:** $47.04\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot really sure if I am even allowed to make an adjusted calculation based on what if they never brought back the shares but nonetheless here it is ....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Point 3:**\n\nThis is purely speculation which is against the rules, I know .... but I can't help but think consumer psychology has to play a role in the market.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that consumers don't really know what they want until it is presented to them, iPhone has dominated the market for what seems like forever but in actuality, it has really only been about a decade. iPhone 4 was the real game changer since it allowed people to get their hands on an iPhone for other carriers. There seems to be a general consensus among many consumers now though that all Apple does is slap a new camera on each new model, repackage it, and put it on the shelf .... being in tech myself, I understand that the technical upgrades such as chipsets and other components that don't bring forth clear, tangible improvements do play a vital role in allowing the device to move forward and become more capable but I don't think the average consumer understands that.\n\nApple vs Android is a tired and pretty much done battle, they have been battling for the market for a while and many consumers have chosen their side and will likely stick with it at this point when comparing the 2 ... however, I have a feeling that if a new product were to emerge onto the market that were neither android or apple but introduced something reliable, new, and fresh then consumers would be more than ready for a change. Apple's double edged sword is that it is a complete ecosystem, all of the devices rely on some type of proprietary operating system which when paired together create a pretty good user experience between the devices. However, make no mistake, iPhone sits at the top of that ecosystem and for many consumers, iPhone is the segway into the Apple ecosystem. You get an iPhone and you like it .... so now when you get a computer you want a Mac etc. I say this to point out how financially dependent Apple is on the iPhone, if ever it should fail ... then the performance of the company will suffer miserably. How long can iPhone continue to dominate? Touch screen phones of this type have been running the scene for the past decade, I honestly think a major change is on the horizon for smart phones, but I don't necessarily believe Apple will be the company to usher it in .... and because of that belief I just don't think it would be a good idea to overpay for a stock now with the stupid belief that the what goes up must continue to go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom everything I see it seems like Apple is severely overvalued right now, the company  has shown a long history of growth and one would like to think that would continue but based on the financials it doesn't seem like the growth factor is really there right now. I don't think the company is doomed or is a bad pick, I just don't think it's a good pick at its current price. However, with that being said ... I don't have nearly as much experience as many of you I'm sure and definitely not those analysts. on Wall Street, so I was trying to figure out why people are so excited as the price sits now and why the buy rating seems to be so high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure, I have no position.

This can be seen in their decision to keep iPhone sales the same at 999 since the X and offering cheaper models like SE, xr, regular 11, and future 12. The 12 is expected to be a \"supercycle\" for iphones where everybody buys this model because it has a different body design. The rumoured price of the regular 12 is also lowered to 649.

Apple is a tech company, R&D is what tech companies do, and in the past they have done it well.\n\nAlso another important note: Apple currently has cornered about 13% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android has the other 87%.

Prior to this late last year/this year, Apple's PE ratio was only between 14-16x.  Take a look at the historical PE ratio for Microsoft and Google.  I won't even mention Amazon.\n\nIn 2019, the big 3 hyper-scale cloud providers were trying to get a piece of the $100B cloud spend for the year.\n\nApple with it's \"one trick iphony\" had a revenue of $260B in 2019 and $265B in 2018.

I bring this up because with the amount of cash in hand and the amount of cash Apple generates on an annual basis, Apple has enough cash to enter and invest in new markets.  For example, there has been rumors that Apple is building an autonomous vehicle.  Apple could easily have acquired Tesla when Tesla's market cap was around $50B.  \n\nStreet's valuation has always been based on \"potential\" revenue of a company and not the historical revenue.

I don't agree with your points personally, but I think they are well thought out and rationalised.\n\nMaybe not necessarily counter points, but a couple of things that come to mind are:\n\n* **Lack of new product segments/innovation:** I see this as a super common complaint about Apple, but truth be told I think because people don't see a hugely game changing product like the iPhone or iPad they assume this is true. I believe it's not. Take the Apple Watch for example, which is now about 5 years old. It's now one of the best selling wearable devices in a segment that's growing. Sure it's a digital watch (to over simplify it) so it's not ground breaking, but the useability has jumped in leaps and bounds since Gen 1 which is driving it's success. Airpods are another example. I think where %'s are concerned, yes iPhone dominates it's revenue streams, but %'s don't necessarily tell the story. 5 or 6 years ago, if you bought an iPhone, that'd be it. Now you are likely to buy Airpods and an Apple Watch to go along with it. So regardless of whether iPhone sales go up or down, Apple has already bolstered it's revenue streams with these add-on accessories. Yes you're right Apple needs iPhone as a gateway product (and Watch only works with iPhone), but there are so many Airpod android users (and it's one of the best selling android bluetooth headphones, or at least were previously).\n* **Management and People:** One thing that gets discounted too often is the talent within of some of these companies. People often look at the figurehead, whether that's Steve Jobs, Tim Cook or Johnny Ive and tie the companies fortune against them. What Apple have shown is that they are long past the era where 1 person makes or breaks the company. There is clearly a fantastic team of people working at the company that's driving this performance, even if they aren't the ones in the head lines\n* **Share market is crazy:** This kind of ties with the point above. Ultimately it looks as though the share market has decided that it's just going to look as far into the future as possible and price based on that. That would explain some of the crazy P/Es we're seeing in big, established companies. I think people (and have been for a while) are pricing in unknowns due to proven track records. This is most likely the case with Apple, and has been for years now. I know past performance is not indicative of future performance, but one thing Apple management has shown is that they certainly know how to meet or exceed already lofty expectations consistently.\n\nI know you didn't say AAPL bad, so I'm not trying to discredit anything you've written.\n\nDisclosure: I'm a happy holder, but happy to pick up more if it comes crashing again.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "With companies like Apple and Amazon, you are not suppose to trade them.

Therefore, it would be one of the most covered companies in the world. Therefore the probability of the stock being \"severely overvalued\" is lower than other stocks on average. That is not to say future information won't have a significant impact on the stock price because every company faces risks. \n\nAlso, with respect to your points that are centered primarily on PE; forward PE in itself can't be used to determine whether a company is overvalued. There are many companies with higher forward PEs than AAPL in this market, including NKE, SBUX, AMZN, DIS, COST, V to name a few. \n\nI'll introduce one concept that is important: earnings quality. Look at INTC's financials, and repeat your same analysis. \n\nNet Income increased from 11bn in '15 to 21bn in '19.\nShares outstanding deceased from 4.72bn to 4.29bn\nEPS increased from 2.39 to 4.78.\n\nPE is only 9.\n\nIf you apply your metrics to INTC, it is severely undervalued.

Not every dollar is equal. The market doesn't deem Intel's earnings to be of high quality, it's not reliable and at significant risk. The market deems Apple's earnings to be reliable.\n\nThe COVID-induced recession highlights the importance of earnings quality. Where many companies/industries suffered major losses, Apple was not impacted, in fact their net income went up YoY. If a company is the sum of future cash flows, and there is bound to be downturns every now and then, then the companies that experience major losses during these times, should be valued lower. There are commodity-based companies that are cyclical like major oil companies, and then there are discretionary companies like luxury good sellers. While Apple is classified as either a \"technology\" or \"consumer discretionary\" company, the performance during downturns shows it to behave more like a \"consumer staples\" company, which is highly valued by investors as they want their investments to continue to perform when they need it most.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Paralysis by analysis.

Apple manufacturing their own chips looks extremely promising from the standpoint of better performance and pricing. \n3.

And because the market is forward looking, I think that's the answer.\n\nLike you say, vertical integration is key to the success Apple has. It is a largely closed system, but it works really well, and they are always improving it. I don't think you can discount how big of a deal an iPhone is, considering a person that has one, has it with them 24/7/365...and they are making that device do everything from Home Automation, to Music, to the new Apple TV, to Health, to Payment. Apple takes all of the responsibility of it working too, which is a big deal.\n\nAs you say, the design of the phone is crucial and critical to their success and thats why it makes up the majority of their business. Can it all come crashing down by reliance on the device? Absolutely. But what device are you going with currently? I'm not switching from the Apple Ecosystem and neither are a lot of others. \n\nApple has never been first with anything. And they are big enough at this point to buy out anything new that comes about. But the larger point is, that Apple has looked at the things people want to do, and while slower to market, are very focused on making sure it works, basically QUALITY over SPEED to market.\n\nHaving said all that, in a world where everything is even, is Apple overvalued? Yes it is. But until Apple gets to big for itself (ie. General Electric), you kinda just ride the wave.

Furthermore I think one trend you are too far in to see is the large swash of new retail investors like yourself who would have never been in the market 10 years ago. Thus that trend is driving all consumer positive facing stocks up to higher evaluations then have traditionally been seen.\n\nAdditionally buy backs are insurance, they are smart in buying back to drive up eps to keep looking great cause then they can deploy that reserve asset at a higher evaluation later if needed in an emergency.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I totally agree.

I absolutely agreed with your perspective here when I first started investing. \"Their revenues are too based on iPhone... and iPhone doesn't offer anything better than any competitor (there is no moat),\" I thought to myself.\n\nAs an iPhone owner myself, I'm also quite annoyed at the built in obsolescence and the slowing of the phone that happens with each update. They force you to buy a new phone after 4-5 years which is horrendous. It is for this reason I won't be getting another iPhone myself next time (I should still be using my last one for another 2-3 years).\n\nI think that you have to assume Apple will be adaptable, though. They created Mac, the tablet, the iPod, iTunes, and so on. They will find some new niche eventually to carve out a space for themselves. They have an absolutely titanic pile of cash and allegedly some of the cleverest people in tech working for them, so if they can't diversify and find a new source of revenue it will be a colossal failure for sure haha.\n\nSo, I think they are a worthwhile investment, and Apple still has a lot of potential for the future overall.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good write up and I don’t think your wrong.

I would also stress that a saving account is a risky investment since it’s pretty much a guaranteed loss with inflation. So back to the original point why is Apple so high? My guess \n1) again as I mentioned uncertain times lead to companies with strong moats holding up well\n2) it’s just caught up in the overall bubble of tech and software stocks that’s why they are really pushing the services revenue and trying to tweak that with a one cost covers everything. They want to reinforce their own ecosystem.\n3) possibly the market is just reevaluating them as a consumer staple company as opposed to a hardware company at this point which would support a higher evaluation.\n\nGood well thought out research on Apple on your part I wouldn’t fear it but it’s overvalued for sure.

If epic wins, it essentially means that everyone can choose not to pay the IOS “toll” and there’s no financial incentive for Apple anymore.\n\nFirst, Apple has a huge financial incentive to continue to develop IOS. This development is a critical part of maintaining a competitive product in the cell phone market. If IOS falls into disrepair, then iPhones sales will drop. This will hurt Apple's bottom line. When you consider how central iPhones are to Apple's business, the continued development of IOS is central to the success of the company. I can think of no greater finical incentive.\n\n\nSecond, it's not clear how much the continued development is a major advantage for EPIC. EPIC games can run on multiple operating systems. If one system falls to the wayside, then EPIC can pivot to the other systems. In fact this is arguably better for EPIC, as it would reduce the additional development costs associated with cross platform support. If there are IOS specific features, Apple could alternatively support the development of those feature by charging developers a fee to access the features through various developer software licenses. This fee is fundamentally different than restricting market access (see below), and is a common practice in software development.\n\n\nFinally, the question of why companies should pay the IOS \"toll\" hits at the heart of antitrust matters. Ideally, the answer is that Apple provides a useful services to those who pay a fair price. But instead, the phrasing of your question implies that Apple does not provide a service. Instead Apple restricts access to the market, forcing a toll on all who want to enter. This later is anticompetitive behavior that anti-trust regulations were intended to prohibit. This is the heart of EPIC's complaint.  \n\n\nTLDR: Apple has plenty of financial incentives to continue to develop IOS.

Apple has made clear that from day one, the developer should be budgeting with the cost of access to the marketplace in mind. If Apple’s marketplace means a developer must charge more, due to the costs of accessibility into that marketplace, how is that any different than the market dictating higher prices on downtown real estate compared to the lower density rural areas? Apple has created the real estate (hardware), and charges a substantial fee that has never changed (rent-capped), and yet people are complaining as if Apple is acting in a new or predatory way.

There is also the issue of heat that intel has been increasingly having in the 10th gen line of processors. [laptop review of one model](https://youtu.be/6x8SAAk_J4c) shows that current intel offerings require more heat dissipation in the mobile lineup which could be spent towards gaming performance or productivity workloads with an AMD processor. The mobile lineup is far more accessible and practical for most buyers. If you do a simple VRIO analysis, AMD and Intel both fufill VRI but only AMD has the organization to make use of their offerings. intel has been stuck making the same processor and lack real development. Even the factory they have is just a liability due to their inability to produce sufficient yields and is considering outsourcing. Which will cost even more to get all the value chain up and running. \n\nAMD is selling increasingly more to businesses and consumers and Intel has made no meaningful steps to come back. AMD’s stock value has shot up because investors believe, with reasonable evidence, that for the next few years, AMD WILL be able to provide improvements to the product and their value to their customers that their products will provide value whether it is in production times, heat, overclocking support, or in-socket upgradability.\n\nIn conclusion, I just put an order for a stock of AMD.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Your youtube link reviews intel i7-10750H, which is a 14nm chip.

Even though Intel CPU only has 4 cores (vs 8 cores in AMD CPU), it is only 6-17% slower than AMD CPU for multi-threaded workloads. So that's why I think the upcoming 10nm Tiger Lake can still compete with AMD 7nm CPU if it is priced competitively.

RNN can employ the internal memories to process input time series, which is different from the traditional back-propagation (BP) neural network. However, the RNN model is generally not directly used for long-term memory calculation; thus, the improved RNN model known as LSTM was proposed. LSTM can process sequences with thousands or even millions of time points, and has good processing ability even for long time series containing many high- and low-frequency components. However, the latest research shows that the TCN, one of the members of the convolutional neural network (CNN) family, shows better performance than LSTM in processing very long sequences of inputs\n\nI don't remember seeing exactly what Tesla uses, but it's probably some type of convolutional RNN. \n\nThe Encoder - Decoder setup of Temporal Convolutional Networks looks really cool. Encoder-decoder architecture is a key part of transformer machine learning models, along with attention. In the last year Transformers pretty much revolutionized natural language processing, and if you look at GPT-3, it's pretty much achieved some level of general intelligence in language. \n\n [https://towardsdatascience.com/train-a-gpt-2-transformer-to-write-harry-potter-books-edf8b2e3f3db](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-a-gpt-2-transformer-to-write-harry-potter-books-edf8b2e3f3db) \n\n(that's the architecture, GPT-3 is [a lot stronger](https://towardsdatascience.com/gpt3-the-dream-machine-in-real-world-c99592d4842f))\n\nYou take a lot of data, try to encode it into as tiny a package as possible, then decode it to retrieve the original data. If you can compress the data a lot, you've learnt some higher level features of the data, ie the image is just all black pixels, very easy to reconstruct. \n\nNatural language kinda exploded in popularity after transformers, but now that it's pretty much solved (you just make them really big and spend millions of dollars on training), there's probably a lot of researchers looking to move on to Time-Series Forecasting, which has been kinda neglected, nothing has really happened since 2018. People have stuck to the basic convolutional, recurrent or LSTM pieces, and that's all that's been done really. \n\nTime-series forecasting is what Tesla is trying to do, they're trying to predict what will happen to the car in the future. The other part is depth estimation, but a lot of good work has been done in that area this year. Processing very long sequences of inputs and making predictions of more than like 3-5 frames into the future has always been crap. If we actually get some proper development in that area with advanced architectures like those applied to natural language, a lot could happen in the near future for higher level planning and predictions. \n\nCompute and GPU memory will probably be a big bottleneck for working with images, just like compute is really the only thing stopping transformers currently. But in general if researchers are shifting their attention towards solving time-series forecasting now after natural language, that would mean a lot new developments will be happening over the next year or so. Being able to much predict traffic and movement, exactly when to execute a lane change could really benefit Tesla.\n\nIt would be the difference between, \n\n1. No No No Yes Yes No No No\n2.

Adam Jonas - after today's upgrade - reaches a price target of 1,300. \n\nSo I guess this gives you a rough idea about the ranges one can justify, if one wants to do so n a standard DCF framework. \n\nAnother thing regarding Tesla valuation is that many retail investors 1) are absolutely certain the Elon will succeed and 2) are happy to give their money to a good cause. In terms of asset pricing and fair value, both of these mean that the discount rate of future cash flows is lower than it otherwise would be. \n\nFinally, a lot of the risk in Tesla is Tesla specific. Yes, it tends to move a lot with the market, but it also has a lot of fluctuations related to Elon's tweets, innovation, company specific news etc. All of this type of risk can be completely diversified away by institutional investors.

Too little money and too reactive to volatility. There are bizarre bubble scenarios that can happen and Tesla might with robotaxi when that starts ramping and the extrapolations get idealized but the delusions are usually widespread.

These numbers seem very high compared to other car makers, but other car makers are not the right comparison.

I definitely don't think we are in a bubble now.\n\n> If you can reasonably justify the price using DCF etc, it is not a bubble\n\nMaybe. The math assumptions can be simply wild eyed though. It is easy with robotaxi to come up with numbers that *sound* plausible (nearly every car on the road, X$ per mile, 50% margins, minimal competition competing away profits, in just a few years, etc.) but in hindsight may be totally laughable. One of the concerns on robotaxi is the sheer amount of capital required to replace the planet with functioning robotaxis. That stretches out the timeline and lets other companies potentially see the profit potential and intervene (for instance scooping up cheap automakers and acquiring the FSD tech, potentially from hiring ex-Tesla employees -- I do think the tech is hard to keep proprietary), and then combining maybe with some other assets acquired with hard cash that Tesla might not have a direct response to, like Uber. I'm optimistic though.. just talking about possibilities.\n\nIn practice, I am also putting a very wide range of prices but the ability for options to make more specific predictions more profitable has me perhaps attempting what is infeasible and narrowing my predictions.

{"title": "September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids", "selftext": "Hello fellow degenerates. \n\n I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver, but none of them so far have addressed the unusually large number of open contracts for September. Most of them have just been money printer go BRRRR = inflation = silver go moon. So here's a fun little argument of why silver might enter the stratosphere faster than a hooker in light up sketchers during September. \n\nLike I said, the current open interest for silver September contracts is NUTTY\n\n[COMEX Silver Futures](https://preview.redd.it/772mapunqug51.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0b944dbbc70766eb70b90692f105d7c1edc7dd)\n\nEach contract represents 5,000 ounces of silver. Now, most of the time only a small portion of these contracts stand for delivery, say 1 or 2% amounting to \\~4 to 9 million ounces of silver. Back in July, an astonishing 17,294 contacts stood for delivery amounting to 86,470,000 ounces of the devils metal. For those of you that can't count, just understand that is a lot. \n\n[Silver Contacts standing for Delivery](https://preview.redd.it/901urvyarug51.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=a83e739ffcc3996b381f67177a89c91a3c012f45)\n\nIf something similar happens in September, we might be looking at a similar number or more of silver ounces being delivered. So the question is, how much do the banks have? Glad you asked young autist.\n\n[COMEX - Registered and Eligible Silver in ounces.](https://preview.redd.it/bsdee47rrug51.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1cc36d27e3da9a3834549ba95b23a202050b07)\n\n As of today, there sits a total of roughly 335 million ounces of silver at the Comex across all the big boy banks. \\~128 million of that is registered for delivery, meaning can be used to cover short position and stand for delivery. The other \\~208 million sits eligible, meaning it meets the exchange requirements and COULD be moved over to registered if desired. Funny thing is, a lot of the banks have been moving their silver from eligible to registered in the past couple months, wonder why. For fun, here are the current standings for JPMorgan and The Bank of Nova Scotia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5f3ovl1sug51.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=be44c4e4bf3c6f1359ce828efab40ef162c413e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu98xvv4sug51.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b624a4a89126f4f5ebb1019347b3969be10feea\n\nJPMorgan has \\~33.8 million ounces registered, and \\~131 million eligible, while the bank of nova scotia has \\~15 million registered, and 6.5 million eligible. Now what happens when a bank holds a net short position and the longs stand for delivery? Well, good things for the price of silver, bad things for the bank depending on how much they actually have in the comex. \n\nSo what does all this mean? This is probably going to play out either one of two ways: \n\n1. A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts.  Basically, if enough longs stand for delivery, the amount of silver available to the market goes down = price goes up. \n\n2. Few of the contacts stand for delivery. This is the bear case, if this happens, you better hope your bet on silver being a hedge for inflation is right boys. \n\nTLDR; Huuuge open interest on September silver contracts. If enough stand for delivery you might be able to move out of your wifes boyfriends basement and afford health care. \n\nSLV 9/30 27C & SLV 12/31 30C", "id": "i9b1th", "created_utc": 1597362113.0, "score": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 217, "comments": [{"body": "Is real DD allowed on wsb?", "score": 145, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck I thought this was /r/investing.", "score": 96, "replies": [{"body": "This is godly DD tho.
