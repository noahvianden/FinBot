And then, it looks like, all previous prices are multiplied by $9. So what looks like $900 in 2014, in real-time may only have been a price of $20, but the number is much larger looking back after several reverse splits.

Very clear and concise how the stock split will happen\n\n—————\n\nTesla Inc. (\"Tesla,\" trading symbol: TSLA) has announced a 5-for-1 forward stock split in its shares of common stock, effective before market open on Monday, August 31, 2020.\n\nOur records show that you have a stock and/or options position in Tesla in your account, so we want to be sure you have the information you need.\n\nHere's What You Should Know\n\nThe 5-for-1 forward split means that for every share of Tesla common stock you own on or before the market open on August 31, you'll receive five shares of (new) Tesla common stock to replace it.   \n \n\nThe stock price will be affected by this event: it will decrease to one fifth of what it was at the close of trading on Friday, August 28. When the markets open on Monday, August 31, your net position in Tesla will be equal to what it was before the split, plus or \nminus market movements. \n\nFor example, if you own one share, and the price at market close on August 28 was $1,500, at market open on August 31 you'd own five shares, each worth $300.  \n\n\nIf you are trading options on Tesla, the number of contracts (calls or puts) will increase by five and the strike price will be adjusted by one fifth. For example, one call contract controlling 100 shares with a $1,500 strike price will now become five call contracts controlling 500 shares with a $300 strike price.\n\n\nTesla will not be available for trading in Extended Hours Trading (EXT) on Friday night, August 28; Sunday night, August 30; or Monday morning, August 31.*\n\nYou don't have to do anything. This corporate action will happen automatically, and there will be no fees charged to your account for this change.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Was probably written day after announcement and only just now legally approved and put into the message tool correctly.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "*$1900 has entered the chat*", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "And here I am the Texan who stayed up late enough to see it happen", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "May I ask - what is the general Texan consensus with regards to Tesla?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You guys it’s doing that thing again!!", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Ha! this made me laugh! :) reminds me of...\n\n\"The red thingy is moving towards the green thingy..\"", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Is that from Galaxy Quest? lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Hit +$1,000 profit on my TSLA shares today.

To imply Tesla is just a car company is kinda like saying Apple is only a computer company, yet now they are one of the largest cellphone producers and they took the world by storm with the release of the first iPhone.\n\nTesla could very well start making infrastructure to align with a more mass adopted appeal.\n\nI’ve wondered and dreamed of a day that we no longer drive on shitty asphalt or concrete roads. My thoughts with the future for EVs lead me to believe our road ways will be made of tech at some point. Self driving, wireless charging infrastructure making sustainable energy.\n\nWith this idea, I see gold rising as it’s a really good conduit for electrical, having lasting sustainable tech required gold. The demand for gold with only serve for the demand of gold. Cyrpto would start to take over.... we are already closing in on a cashless society, I mean for fuck sakes.... we already know money is just digits on a screen and cash is just a blend of paper and ink. Valuation are purely speculative across the market. As mad as valuations are right now... they could seem even more minuscule in the future.\n\nThere’s also the issue of lower interest rates inflating the price of everything. 10% of 30k is 3k. 1% of 300k is 3k. In terms of interest and making money it makes sense that the banks have to lend more to make the same amount of money. The whole damn thing has to snowball to be affective. The crazy part is we either take the hit at some point and just deflate the balloon, or we keep pumping people into the market. Most of the world’s population isn’t even in tune with a currency. Hell we can deliberately leave a currency behind and flock to a new one. \n\nI’m just gonna end my rant here.

If you think google isn’t making money on the backend you are wrong.\n\nAnother reason that designing and developing their own mapping software ties into the self learning for auto pilot vehicles.

It may not be a big deal when you're making only $100m but remember that $100m will be close to $1bn by that logic in 3 years.\n\nIt is the same logic when Warren Buffet says that he would have far more opportunities if he was investing $100m instead of $1bn, because that's when the absolute amount matters, i.e. you cannot simply grow $1bn 10% as easy as you did $100m.\n\nAnd I did not even mention competition here.
