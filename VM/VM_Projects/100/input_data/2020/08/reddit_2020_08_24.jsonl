Then suddenly you needed to close the trade, it's an emergency, and you can't afford the delay of negotiating a fair price, you are forced to sell at the market of $4. That $1 difference is the amount of profit you have to make before you start to break even on the spread. This a notional value, of course, and a thought experiment, but it's useful for evaluating the initial burden the bid/ask puts on your position before you start earning a profit.\n\nThis is seen more easily if you don't get in at the mid. Say you are buying and no trades at the mid are happening -- you can wait until hell freezes over, no takers -- so you bump up your price and end up with $5.50 on the $4/$6 spread. Your brokerage will calculate your P/L against that mid, so that your position will immediately show a $0.50 loss. Again, this is notional, it's not necessarily a real loss, but it does give you an idea of how much you have to dig yourself out of an initial hole before you start to profit.

The triggering effect was a big ripple from a cascade of events that were for one reason or another bound to happen.\n\n**3) You can't predict when the bubble will burst.**\n\n\\- Just not happening. It comes down to your level of risk tolerance, how you diversify your portfolio so that when it does it, that portfolio will recover just as most people did in March.\n\n**4) Wall Street is not Main Street.**\n\n\\- Though I primarily subscribe to Mohamed El-Erian, to quote/paraphrase Bill Ackman, \"Wall Street may be hitting all-time highs. However, if you create an index for Main Street, it is down 80%.\"\n\nAccording to the SBA, 99.7% of the US comprise of small businesses. Most of these will not be listed on the stock market.\n\nThe best indicators you can get is probably look at commercial rental properties.\n\n**5) Wall Street indices/indicators are mostly comprise of top performers who are at least in part digital and all globalized. This is not representative of even established small corporations.**\n\n\\- Even if you were to focus on Dow Jones and S&P etc. solely, you are not getting a full picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\nMy thoughts on the disconnect between the stock market and sentiments:\n\n1. **Macroeconomic effects takes time to materialize.**\n\n1a) With or without stimulus checks, most people have some level of reserves. Even those living paycheck to paycheck, they can get creative, and the quarantine itself creates more ways to save on expenses. I'm sure a lot of people are also working with their landlords to weather through the pandemic. Smart landlords know that even if they are unhappy with it, 1) They're not likely to be able to find new tenants during this time 2) Even if they really wanted to evict, that process may be a serious PITA because of the pandemic.\n\nIt's only been 6 months. If those reserves and creativity are to dry up, we'll see it in the next 6 months. The past 6 is not a good indicator of anything at all.\n\n1b) Small Businesses, PPP, or responsible ma & pa stores or what have you probably tried their best to take care of their businesses and employees the past 6 months mitigating the larger effects of unemployment. Sure, the economy is \"opening up\", but retail consumers have not come back. The new equilibrium has changed and the cascading effects has yet to be seen.\n\n1c) Only after busineses go through a full finacial cycle or exhaust their reserves will you see mass layoffs, in turn means people can't pay, which in turn means other businesses will receive less revenue because of lack of spending, and the spiral continues.\n\nTHIS is the real macroeconomic effect. This happens at scale and takes time. 6 months is absolutely nothing at the macro scale.\n\nThink about it, at the macroeconomic scale it doesn't matter if a few businesses are thriving. If the rest of the economy is failing, people have no money to spend on the big businesses. This is a huge ticking time bomb you will not see on the stock market \\*now\\* but it will be felt later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) The Stock Market is being propped up by more than the Fed**\n\n2a) One hugely significant thing people are not talking about is toward the end of 2019 all major brokerages eliminated the commission fees for stock trading. This HUGELY increased money velocity on the stock market because there's no perceived costs or barrier to entry to trade. When you rapidly trade stocks between people the slightest positive outlook will lead to much more rapid growth, even if you assume only existing participants are trading.\n\nBut that's not all, retail investors exploded BECAUSE it costs nothing to trade. They may had been hesitant and sat in the sidelines in the past, but where value-investors are hoarding cash? These formerly sidelined retail investors/non-investors are pouring in, their cash contribution easily rivals what cash previously taken out.\n\n2b) The Stimulus packages are being thrown into the stock market rather than the economy.\n\nThe stimulus packages came in too early for most people who had no fear of their job security (yet) and had not felt the squeeze in their usual spending. It was not selective enough so many middle class and those in hi-tech just wound up with money they didn't know what to do with. With extra cash on hand they bid the stock market because that's what everyon'es doing, right?\n\nThis is latently harmful to the macroeconomy, because bidding up stock prices doesn't inherently produce value, its actually spending them on the economy that does.\n\n2c) Rise of retail investors\n\nWith no where to go, people who normally have budget for travel or casinos, or other forms of social activities/make-up etc. that don't make sense in the social distancing era they move their money into \\*drumroll\\* stock market, rather than purchase alternative consumer goods.\n\nAgain, like 2b with the stimulus checks, this inflates the stock price but does not produce economic value. While the US economy is in a deflationary period, the stock market is absolutely in an inflationary period.

A quick google search will show that for Nasdaq, the basic requirements is $4mil value company with $2mil shareholder equity (there's other requirements but they're pretty easy to meet). That's not a high bar. That said, vast majority of businesses are not listed on the stock market.\n\nYour favorite local steakhouse burger place down the street? That's \"Main Street\". The neighborhood grandma's flowershop? That's \"Main Street\". Joe Bob son the handyman? He's not retail per se but in this context is lumped together with \"Main Street\" All of these guys are not represented by the Stock Market and they're all royally effed over by the pandemic.\n\nI can't say I'm well versed in how franchises work, but my hunch is most franchisees are on their own when they're not making money. Big Daddy Franchiser is not gonna bail you out even if you've been a loyal franchisee paying 3% of your revenues to them for 20 years. My understanding with agriculture industry is that they're pretty similar, they lease the land and profits goes to the big company overlording them but individual farmers are effed when an event like this happens.\n\nIts understandable that these businesses have their livelihoods on the line that they would support the economy opening up despite scientific concerns. They're desperate. A white collar employee has an easy time to sit on a high horse and criticize them along partylines or what not but they have other things to fall back to. When you're the business owner / self-employed, you have nothing to fall back on. None of these issues are reflected by the Stock Market. No corporate bailouts will help these businesses.\n\nA lot of the stimulus focus has been on bailing out airlines or putting money in the hands of employees. I personally haven't heard of anything really done to help actual \"Main Street\" small business owners.\n\n2) I can't say I'm an expert on commercial property either though I've been looking into investing in one before the pandemic. For example, I usually browse loopnet.com and the area I was looking at used to have about 50 results that meets my criteria back around January/Feb. Now I see 300+ results.

What I would offer in addition to what I've already said in the post you replied to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Look at historical YOY growth. The S&P for example, the accepted historical average is 10%. Plot that onto a graph chart and look at that trend line. We REALLY shot up sharply in the past couple years [close to 30%](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/31/dow-futures-last-trading-day-of-2019.html). From the same article if you look at the deep red bars they coincided with economic crises; the 1975 oil crisis/recession, 1982 inflation/recession, the 2000-2002 dotcom burst, the 2008-2009 financial crisis/great recession. By all accounts and historical data we should be in a recession right now. But immediately after March 23 '20 the stock market got immediately propped up. You can keep propping that bubble up, but eventually it will burst, and with nearly 100 years of stock market data we fully expect it to correct back to the trendline.\n\n2) I personally have moved my 401k out of the stock market and into cash-equivalents as of a couple months ago. Do I regret it? Ya, a bit, many of the plans I was on has grown 10-20% within the past few months. I still don't trust this kind of hypergrowth, and coming back in now would be unwise based on my own risk tolerance because it feels like I'm buying at the highs while expecting it to crash and sustain a value well below current values. I have a couple stock picks that I deeply regretted with my own \"spare money\" which I personally succumbed to FOMO but it turns out I bought them at the peak and really should have stayed in tech rather than bet on volatility.\n\n3) Prior to February I never, ever actively managed my 401k or stock account. I was actually doing really well (I worked in hi-tech and had company stock). I did the smart decision of selling all my stocks in late Feb fully anticipating the pandemic issue to explode globally because no one's taking it seriously. What I regretted was that I didn't have a re-entrance plan, I just stayed out, and returned at a peak in April and missed out on a lot of gains since March 23.\n\nHad I simply kept my original portfolio, which was tech-centric, (I had a lot of Apple, Zoom, Square, etc.) my portfolio easily would have doubled even WITHOUT timing the dip. (That sentence alone should also be a redflag just how inflated the current bubble is).\n\nHindsight is 2020, but some hindsight can be turned into experience for the future because some information actually ARE available beforehand. What I learned from my mistake was that I could have anticipated the difference between the current economic crisis fromt he past; that online and hi-tech will largely be unaffected and the March 23 drop was just irrational fear across the board.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my takeaway for you is, if you are currently on a portfolio which you established before the pandemic, just stick to it, you'll likely turn out ok. At the very worst, any losses you incur would just be from the blown up bubble that no one's really entitled to anyway. Don't let greed take hold of you. At the end of the day, if you stick with your old portfolio, even should it crash, it will just wipe out the balloon portion but you'll be back to where you deserved to be pre-pandemic whether that comes out to a net of 10% up or 10% down, ultimately not too bad. If you're one of those people who already doubled their money from the pandemic investments, my advice to you would be cash out and GTFO. Take your winnings and don't succumb to greed. \n\nMy best actively-managed investments were ones where I had a plan on how much profit I would be happy with, and stick to the plan and sell when i met my goals. My FOMO stocks where I deviated from that plan all tanked below my original investments. If you're going to active manage, make sure you have a plan. Stick to it, becuase chances are, you were a lot more rational when formulating that plan than you would be with glowing greedy eyes when you see the stock keep going up.\n\nIf you've had been actively managing your portfolio all this time.. I really don't have good advice for NOW. Intuitively, I'm tempted to say shift to large cap tech stocks, but that's what's everyone's already doing and its greatly inflated, as we discussed P/E ratios are ridiculous. Chances are, a lot of money in large caps right now are retail investors trading on margin. What's the risk? March 23's crash could happen again but this time it might not bounce back. March 23's crash was induced by a credit squeeze as a cascade and massive heavy downpour of margin traders not able to meet maintenance requirements and forced to firesell their stock. In March, that was just the broad market in general. Now? Everyone and their grandma has their money thrown into tech stocks and I anticipate the next crash would disproportionately affect tech.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now a lot of stock analysts/commentors you watch/read will say \"well where else would you put your money?\" They automatically assumed cash is not a valid option, probably because subconsciously, that's \"boring\". I interpret this as, \"Ya, we all know there are risks in the market, but come on, it's not reeeaaaally gonna happen... stonks will keep going up, riiiiiight?\" this mentality is like an alcoholic who just can't quit. \n\nThere's too many that can happen right now. November; School outbreak cases; School outbreaks that spreads back home; trade war escalations; upcoming bankruptcies/evictions, etc. etc. Like I said, past crashes were never pinpointed to any one singular event. It takes a series of events to ripple out and we don't know which or which ones will do it, and there's many events coming up in the next few months. I certainly don't think successful vaccine development alone (and what everyone forgets: Manufacture + deployment) can counteract all these factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) There are a lot of market noise right now. A lot of things happening now are going against past wisdom. My personal assessment for this is that the demographic for the stock market players has largely changed, which in turn greatly influences market trends and psychology.\n\n\\- Value-based investors have taken large chunks of their cash out expectin a bubble to burst.\n\n\\- Short-term traders surged, along with Robinhood \"investors\" (read: traders) is creating a dominance in short-term trading which increases the emphasis on technicals.\n\n\\- Technicals is king now, which is dangerous because technical analyses largely ignores news and company growth strategies. It's traditionally based on statistical data that included value-investors but now that most of the market are short-term traders technical trend graphs are more of a self-fulfilling prophecy because everyone buys into the \"heand and shoulders\" or whatever the shape of the day is. When stock price is based on self-fulfilling prophecies, that's also very dangerous. That's not how stocks are supposed to work; stocks are supposed to represent equity.

Internet just started booming, a lot of people were literally discoveirng the internet for the first time. It is this brand spanking new thing that no one knew much about.\n\n2) All of the internet companies were ballooning, severely. If Sillicon Valley venture capitalists weren't investing in startups based on speculation before, they sure are now.

Anyone who got hyped by the WSB story had over a full week whether they bought at $100, at $150, at $200, hell even at $300 to take 25%-3000% profit from a single week's of speculating, that is well beyond the entire stock market's historical average's YOY return.\n\nIf anything, the GME was orders of magnitudes more forgiving than any \"pump and dump\" (Luckin coffee) or \"bizarre phenomena\" (Hertz) that has ever happened before, since anything before GME you had maybe 1 day and mess up your timing you get royally eff'd in the rearend. I'm neither sympathetic to those who lost money to GME nor do I believe proportionately retail *traders* who were hurt by it was anywhere close to retail who were hurt by other situations. Only the most irresponsible, most irrational, most lacking in plan *traders* AND sat through the entire week ignoring every opportunity to get out got shafted. (e.g. a ponzi scheme)\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nIf anything GME has shown me is that it confirmed something I've been suspecting and worried about for a long time; the total divorce of stock price from fundamentals. \n\nEveryone has talked about this and this is echo'd in my original post, but more specifically certain stocks are traded more like BitCoin - this is a speculative trading model far more extreme, volatile, and dangerous than your typical short squeezed / rumor/news hyped stock fluctuations.\n\nI for one, never believed in the goal of the original conception of BitCoin, which was to eliminate inflation on the premise of finite coins in circulation (how laughable that was looking back, right?) because I knew inflation isn't primarily driven by money supply, its the perceived value and whether or not it is based on a certain intrinsic value. BitCoin has no intrinsic value. Stocks/Equity do, or, are supposed to.\n\nGME has divorced the equity/fundamental basis to the stock's value, it was entirely traded like BitCoin. Nevermind that it is a failing business model that will become extinct in half a generation when today's teenagers (who are all on Steam or directly purhcase on console's digital stores) become the dominant consumer base.\n\nGME isn't the start of it, it's just a big symptom. This has already been happening in many stock especially in the tech sector. A lot of young, greedy, irrational *traders* are selective in information they consume, trying to justify why they believe the stock is worth the price they are paying for it, even convince themselves that they are \"investing\" and not *trading*, when they forget that a P/E ratio of 100 means that the company will need ONE HUNDRED YEARS to earn enough profit to cover what you paid for the stock just to BREAKEVEN. Amazon when it was founded surely worth P/E of 100, but now that it already satured the market? People are still expecting 9,000%-10,000% growth in the coming years instead of a more realistic 30-50% or an already optimistic 200% growth?\n\nThere's a confluence of factors that created this giant stock bubble that keeps building, building, and building, most of which were already addressed in my original post, but to reiterate - Fundamental investors have shifted out to more conservative investments, retail *traders* moved in, so the primary driving forces are people who spend money speculatively.\n\nHowever, what I haven't mentioned is that one part of the reason why this situation is so bad is a social behavioral/psychological level; retail *traders* are having an identity crisis convincing themselves that they are \"investors\" and try to do a mishmash of convoluted investing/trading strategies that makes no sense.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nBest case scenario:\n\nSpeculative explosion of stock prices will continue to happen to random stocks now and then, but they continue GME's pattern or slower in terms of gradually fading out the price for a smooth transition to normalcy until retail *traders* turn their attention to the next thing.\n\nNot very likely, but like I said, best case scenario.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWorst Case scenario / Latent risks:\n\nI recently learned there may be more story to Robinhood's freezing of purchases and have observed E*trade radically changing margin requirements on certain stocks seemingly no reason. It seems that thse rise of retail *traders* and easy access to margin accounts has led to a huge horde of (irresponsible) *traders* who are buying stocks on margin. Stock brokers between mitigating their own debt risks (a lot of these retail *traders* probably can't pay it when the stock implodes) and the fact that the amount being borrowed may be seriously stretching or even exceeding what the Broker platform can legally/physically borrow themselves has forced them to stop lending out so much.\n\nWithout either regulation on margin trading or stock brokers to cut down how easily they lend out margin accounts and margin debt, there exists a potential ticking timebomb that the \"next\" GME could cause the entire stock market to implode as they rapdily call upon margin debt from bankrupted individuals who can't pay.\n\nThe more I write/think about this, the more I see/worry that this is in fact a gaping loophole for a potential repeat of the \"subprime market\" crash of 2008, because there's very little requirements to qualify for a stock margin loan, espeically on Robinhood, and there's a growing number of retail *traders* who are spending that debt even less responsibly than 2008 home purchase decisions.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "62.75 by my calculation.", "score": 438, "replies": [{"body": "I was thinking 69.420%", "score": 353, "replies": [{"body": "I know what you did there.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "I see who you are here", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I know who you blew over there", "score": 22, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Careful our Lord Musk frequents as wells as lurks these here subreddits to stoke our collective autism.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Smells musky in her.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Smells like cash money tendies!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ahh how i love reddit", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nice", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hey", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nice", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "SEC!

It is almost impossible to time the market under any circumstances, but over the last decade or two the price of securities have become increasingly detached from real world performance, economic indicators and reality in general. This makes it even harder to get a pulse on the market.\n2) Purchasing equity positions in established companies from one another is not value added investing. You are not putting capital at risk in hopes of wild returns when the business you helped fund innovates in their respective market. You are purchasing fractions of those original equity positions in hopes of a stable returns.\n3) Returns come primarily from two sources: a) sharing profits with shareholders (dividends) and b) an increasing share price.\n4) Reason dictates that a highly profitable company should yield better returns than an unprofitable company, however this is not always the case. Early investors want an exit strategy which often comes in the form of an IPO. Many companies in an \"innovation\" field IPO well before they are profitable so secondary investors can also speculate. While an IPO can represent a capitalizing round for these companies, those shares are still bought buy institutions and those with big bank relationships meaning that the vast majority of trading that occurs immediately after an IPO is of this non-value-add return seeking type predicated on the idea that you are \"speculating\" and seeking higher returns by buying into riskier businesses with a promising future.\nConclusion:  Share prices are determined by what the market thinks they are worth. When people use the stock market as a means to speculate, rather than a means to park capital for a decent return bubbles happen quickly as share prices cease to reflect what a company is worth, but rather what people think a company might be worth in the future. Not only that but there is a lot of wealth looking for a good place to sit and the US stock market has always been a great choice. Also that coupled with the rise of retail investing demand for US equities is higher now than at any point in history. As long as there is demand to support these inflated share prices we won't be seeing a market crash. How long can we keep this up? Who knows, but probably a lot longer than you think.\n\nTLDR: Demand for equity in the US market is high. High demand = high prices.

This goes on until a rate that nobody / nor bank can pay which causes mass foreclosures. (Hence, the \"bubble\")\n\nThe same exact thing is happening right now.

I'm interested in specifically how Tesla will capture my money and yours, indirectly or directly, as consumers, and how much of it.  \n\nI've looked at solar and energy storage, and I just don't see the market being that large any time soon or for Tesla to have some sort of monopoly in it.  Competition is going to be tough if the market materializes, and better tech / efficiency is great but it's not going to command significantly higher profit margins unless it can do so while also being the best value for the consumer.  Energy and energy storage is a commodity, brand doesn't matter there as it does with cars.\n\nEvery household has an electricity acquisition bill which covers generation and distribution.  Most households are not paying anything currently to store energy because they don't feel they need to, they are relying on the grid and they'll just wait out power outages.  Will that change?  Well let's see what the value proposition is.\n\nCurrent Tesla Powerwall pricing is $17,000 installed (I just priced it on their site) if you don't have solar (the minimum suggestion is 2 Powerwalls in the quote tool) and this will protect a normal sized home from most power outages.  The two Powerwalls have a 10 year warranty.  So for $17k you can get no power outages for 10 years for your house.  This cost is equivalent to 12 years worth of the average US household electric bill.  So let's say your battery outlasts its warranty and lasts 12 years with a usable charge capacity.  You have essentially upgraded your home to outage-free electricity at a cost of doubling your total electricity costs for 12 years and having to pay that second 12-years-worth up front, right now.  Tesla makes 12% (last reported energy storage business margin) which averages out to $170 net profit per year from this household for that time period.  IF the Powerwalls last much longer then your cost is lower and Tesla's profit is lower.  \n\nThat's still not a bad per-household annual net, but the limiting factor though is just how many households can afford it.  I think the answer is not many, and even the ones that can probably aren't jumping at the value proposition.\n\nOkay now what about solar?  First I will have to update my previous example, because if you have or are buying solar panels or a solar roof, then Tesla's quote generator will tell you you need a minimum of 1 Powerwall and its installed price is $11,000.  So then the numbers above get better for you (but enough to make it attractive?) and worse for Tesla for just adding the Powerwall.\n\nAs for the solar generation capacity, I'm not going to go into as much detail because I'm tired, but I have looked into this in depth before.  Basically solar pricing is such that you pay for the cost of 15 to 25 years of electricity usage up front and for that you get solar panels which will generate that power and should last longer so eventually you're getting an ROI.\n\nSolar generation is still not a thing that makes sense for most household budgets or ROI timelines.  It's also not a high margin business, though Tesla's solar roof (which looks amazing and that counts for sure!) might be an exception to that.  So idk, maybe I'm missing out on some massive annual per-household profit that will come from the Tesla solar roof?\n\nAt a PE of 35, a trillion dollar company making 50% of its profit from the super-spendy-not-so-savey United States needs $14.2 billion net profit per year from the US, which averages out to $111 per year per US household.  Or, you know, $1110 each annually from 1/10th of the households or some other weighting.  I do not see that happening from \"energy\".\n\nCould it happen from cars?  Well, I suppose, VERY optimistically, if Tesla cars only last 10 years (lower is better from Tesla's perspective!) and Tesla can sell an average of 1 car every 10 years to 12 million households at a profit of $10k per sale, well that's most of the way there.  The top 12 million US households (90th percentile) by income made $184k or more last year, so they're in Tesla's target audience for high-margin vehicles.  This example, however, assumes 1.2 million cars produces per year and still takes 10 years to each that level of net income and assumes production and customer base are both still growing at that point.\n\nIt might happen, but this is not a thing I would bet on today.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I have a tesla solar setup.

Even if it's 1-2 weeks after that it's not abnormal. I agree with your thoughts that August holidays likely skews the probability to a later inclusion instead of earlier.\n\n2) Can the committee announce a lower weight? Wouldn't that be unprecedented? I thought S&P was strictly market cap weighted with no individual treatment - hence how Apple and Amazon have effectively saved the index this year...\n\n3) I don't expect a phased inclusion, seems too unprecedented to be likely.\n\n4) the large number of sales from people trading inclusion is the elephant in the room. I think it is possibly very underestimated by the members of this sub. There are billions of $s in hedge funds that run this exact play (they are agnostic on the stocks, they just try to front-run additions and deletions from the S&P). If that is the case some increase may be already baked in. Hard to estimate how much the effect is, especially since TSLA is not in the S&P400 so you don't have the internal tranfers.

But, this being WSB, how can we profit? The answer is oil.\n\n# Chevron (CVX)\n\nIt's simple economics, when hurricanes threaten the gulf states  oil production and refining slows, hurting supply and driving price up. Which oil company is best positioned to profit from reduced competition? Chevron. Chevron operates 5 refineries in the United States. 2 in California, 1 in Utah, 1 in Mississippi and 1 in Texas. Unlike its competitors, Chevron has very little oil refining exposure in the gulf states. Its operations in Texas and Mississippi added up do not make one Richmond, CA refinery in terms of barrels per day.\n\n[Chevron Facilities](https://preview.redd.it/eyqhecluuvi51.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c80a98ba6906d9db7179ab7e0b53cf0ce4f141c)\n\nAs a foil to Chevron's advantageous positioning, consider Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A). Shell's **entire** US refining operation is concentrated in Louisiana and east Texas. This represents nearly 30% of their global refining output. Similar competitors like Valero (VLO) and Phillips 66 (PSX) are highly concentrated in this area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shell Facilities](https://preview.redd.it/709sy6dyvvi51.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=4feddcbc8ef424558acfebed11c823a9f29f5615)\n\n# Historical Precedent\n\nHistorically has Chevron benefited from Gulf Hurricanes? Yes. Following Hurricane Katrina in 05 and Hurricane Harvey in 17, Chevron stock gained around 12% in the following days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Effect of Katrina on CVX](https://preview.redd.it/710e8wlxwvi51.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a23db5c384475913e99b5923d134b56f52e39cf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Effect of Harvey on CVX](https://preview.redd.it/nrdo8jr9xvi51.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d1c478913eac2da5067ee780f9862c4ac6b949)\n\n# Technical Setup\n\nRegardless of the hurricane play, CVX looks oversold and ready to bounce. It, like many other non-tech stocks is testing one of its last uptrends from the initial crash. We're already watching the Russel 2000 bounce off of this level in futures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CVX 4 hr Candles](https://preview.redd.it/ownt0ss1yvi51.png?width=1853&format=png&auto=webp&s=da9036bf33548be26c718c242ce2f4b332bcb23c)\n\nTo me, there seems to be some positive divergence on the RSI with a bullish setup on the slow stochastic.
