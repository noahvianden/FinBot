Not spread it over 10 stores and have redundancy delivery crews and the logistics associated with that.  Any single store may not have the space to store those 1000 items.  \n\nPeople will return items at whatever store they want and that’s also a logistic nightmare. \n\nSeller on Amazon has a very strict agreement with Amazon to the standard to repackage and resell and yet there are still a lot of variations on that.   \n\nI don’t see how Wal-Mart with its workforce can do a better job.

After all, why would they buy shares at $7 when they could buy them on the open market for less? I already have their $9 in premium, and I still have the shares. At this point, I could sell the same contract again and collect more premium!\n\nThat's the gist of it. I'm not sure exactly what you were asking, but if shares get assigned, the broker will manage selling them for you to settle the contract.\n\nThe most important thing to remember here is that we're selling *covered* calls, so you already own the shares that you're writing calls against. Selling *naked* calls would be saying \"yeah, I'll sell you this stock at $7/share, but I don't own any of it\".

People who stay at a hotel, eat at a restaurant, buy an item on Amazon who had a satisfactory experience are less likely to leave a comment online than people who were dissatisfied. Similarly for frequency of comments - a person who generally approves of what Elon is trying to do may comment occasionally, but a person who dislikes him or his goals may comment every day or many times a day.\n\n2) Elon is a disruptor, which creates many amazing new opportunities, but which has the unfortunate side effect of leaving many people disrupted or at risk of disruption. Some of these people will be philosophical about it, but others (and their friends and relatives) will be unhappy enough to criticize Elon publicly. People in the fossil fuel business, automobile business, space launch business, and many others.

However, Elon makes himself unlike able a lot.

He has a big ego. He does have a personality that is a little narcissistic. He believes he is right and that justifies his comments. People don’t like people who are not humble. \n\n2. He has made pretty ridiculous statements that are out there and haven't come to fruition. (We know here he tries to be optimistic and he thinks exponentially. Thus, as an exponential thinker you can be barely wrong in your growth rate and be a decade off). This can make people think he is crazy. \n\n3. He believes in personal responsibility a lot. Culture now a days does like to blame the past for the present more than trying to simply better yourself. This can rub people the wrong way because not everyone is successful. So hearing a message that’s it’s up to you to be better makes people feel like failures. \n\n4. His corona virus take. He was not correct in the math and projections and again he was very confident he was right. \n\n5. He doesn’t admit he’s wrong often. This ties in with number one.

They're going to need another massive bailout AND a vaccine by end of year to keep the lights on. Government gave them a $25b allowance and said hey keep flying all your routes cuz you're like idk a public utility. Ok well the airline industry did $248b in revenue in 2019. That $25b is only going to carry the industry for 1.2 months.\n\nBut being mandated to fly light planes doesn't just decrease revenue, they're filling the fuel tanks with cash money and burning it across the country. Someone who read their 10-Qs can chime in on exactly how fucked that is, I just remember their earnings were fucking atrocious. Routes they would otherwise kill to reduce losses they just have to nut up and fly anyway. For this kind of cutthroat business with astronomical operating costs that is really really fucking bad for bottom line.\n\nAnd here's the real problem. The great vagina shaped stonk recovery is not materializing for raw air travel numbers. In May and June air travel rates showed steady growth. But in July it started to plateau hard.\n\n[TSA throughput vs last year](https://preview.redd.it/gj0ubshlsdh51.png?width=2416&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb8ec757fa1023f1fbf0257e206c64c1657c6a1)\n\nExtrapolating out, ASSUMING IF that steady traveler growth continued, we would have been looking at 4 months at least before approaching normal levels on the same trend. That would have been 9 months total from near total cessation of air travel to recovery. That would have been an airline industry revenue reduction of roughly $100b or a 40% haircut for the year. Assume 10% profit across the industry (very generous), their $25b profit for the year just turned into a $75b loss. $50b after trump bucks.\n\n[TSA throughput extrapolated](https://preview.redd.it/3jow0v8osdh51.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=0926eb0feef2f477ba50fa2d80f4ae52b0169ce1)\n\nBut it's all so much worse than that assumption. They're mandated to fly loser flights, increased expenses from safety precautions, salaries to non-generating furloughed employees, juicy international flights cancelled cuz American passports are toilet paper right now.\n\nWorst of all, air travel has fallen out of that trend and there are no models to predict what happens next. When do people start flying again? When are Americans allowed to travel to popular vacation destinations like Afghanistan and South Sudan? Nobody knows or has the faintest fucking clue.

Nothing I say is investment advice.\n\nAirlines are a bad business. I love them. They’re great to trade in normal time where you basically bet on monthly or quarterly unit revenue.\n\nRight now though, it’s about liquidity and capital structure.\n\nThink about it this way. If an airline earned a 5% pretax margin before covid and has since raised 3x 2019 EBITDA in debt such that the interest is, say 5% of revenue, that implies you need revenue back to double 2019 to earn a profit.\n\nAirlines have to buy planes on a long time horizon and reach to demand on a very short horizon. The capital assets are extremely mobile, so they all flock to demand and gut each other on pricing such that, for the most part at least for leisure travel, all but the lowest cost carrier (spirit, frontier, southwest) fly at a loss. The hub and spoke airlines look to make this up by pooling a bunch of spokes into the hub and creating connections that only have 10 pax a day for example, like Corpus Christi TX to Raleigh. A point to point low cost carrier couldn’t fly that route with a full plane so legacy carriers make connections trying to get business passengers who typically buy last minute and pay higher prices.\n\nAll well and good except when the low cost carriers bleed your hub picking off single spokes and you try to price match them to keep them out. This is why basic economy was introduced and the long thesis on airlines this cycle was that dal/aal/luv/ual were so consolidated they could dog pile the low cost guys and keep them surpressed and they wouldn’t discount against each other so the industry would finally make some profits.\n\nWell guess what - it’s the same 8 empire-building overcompetitive CEOs running airlines and they all started price wars with each other.\n\nSo now we have covid. These guys are all on the hook for fuck load of capex in committed plane orders and they all have permission to lose money for a little due to covid, and they have too many planes.\n\nSo yeah people will start flying again. But tickets are gonna be cheap as fuck and it’ll be along time before they make any money and when they do that’s gonna go back to the creditors for years.\n\nYou can buy airlines if you like. You are betting on more aid and that politicians are going to come to the table for a deal even though trump just EOd the deal and the right has no incentive to work out something different.\n\nBottom line, the passengers figures are going to look a lot better than the revenue figures and the revenue figures are going to look a lot better than the earnings figures for a long time through recovery. And the earnings figures were shit before.\n\nOnly retail traders are buying these. With highly levered cyclicals especially when piling on lots of debt you really have to look at the enterprise value chart not the stock chart. Just cause the stock is down 50% doesn’t imply the market thinks the company is worth 50% less. It means the market things the value of the company minus debt is worth 50% less.

That creates an incentive to issue very optimistic earnings estimates (not airline specific). And when management stops guiding and the market gives everyone a pass for 2Q the range of potential outcomes gets wider and wider and wider and the sell side anchors the absolute high end of reasonable assumptions in my view. Then because interest rates are low they/we apply sky high multiples to overoptimistic earnings. Even more so for tech companies with no EBITDA because you can use a sales multiple. Once earnings matter again they’re going to come down a lot. Multiples may stay high dude to interest rates low but if your company got a high multiple from investors seeking scarce revenue growth post covid and you don’t deliver, the high flyers might see negative earnings revisions and multiple contraction.\n\nThis rambling comment doesn’t address your point, but anyway that’s my rant", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Doesn't this all go out the window if the government forgives all the airline loans?

The only short term bull case for most us airlines is more gov funding or a nice headline on recovery between now and once the world starts caring about flows again.

They could switch their entire line up for EV *right now* if they wanted; they don't do it because there's not enough demand, and the battery production is nowhere near where it needs to be.\n\nThis also applies to Tesla. They've built 109k cars last year. Toyota delivered close to 9 million. 90 times as many. Tesla's battery tech is great for the amount they deliver; they will never be able to scale beyond that without some huge amount of cash and investment.\n\nThen, you also seem absolutely unaware of Toyota's investments in self driving and AI of all kinds startups. They have battery research, they have satellite research, they have their fingers in multiple pies.\n\nThe difference? Is that Toyota waits until something is actually reliable and delivering what they promise before they release it; whereas Tesla is just building the boat while out on the ocean. Have you seen the quality issues on Teslas? Absolutely ridiculous. Panels gaps that you can fit 2 fingers in. And this is with them only making 100k cars. Toyota makes 90 time as many cars, and they are all perfectly equal. \n\nAnd again, you seem to think Toyota only builds cars, which is a very ignorant notion. Go look up the shit they're involved in.\n\nBy all means, Tesla is doing some pretty good work. They found a space in the EV market and took advantage of it. But now other makers have caught up. Tesla cars have been losing ground in Europe and in other markets (they barely register as existing in Japan) as other makers put up better priced/higher quality alternatives.\n\nAnd then again, Toyota had nearly 300 billion dollars in revenue last year. Tesla made 24. \n\nThe only reason their valuation is high is thanks to autists like you who buy everything papa elon says as gospel. You gotta be massive retard to believe his promises about revolutionary AI this year. You gotta be a massive turd to believe he'll deliver his robotesla fleet this year. You gotta be massively gullible to take everything he says at face value. \n\nIt's a meme stock from an otherwise decent company.
