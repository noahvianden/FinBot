Here‚Äôs the story:\n\n1) Sold 10x AAPL 375c 21Aug20 \n2) Bought 10x AAPL 380c 21Aug20\n\nThe credit spread was about $3,000 at the time (mid-July), and max loss therefore should have been $2,000. \n\nI believe the short position was ITM, and long was ATM at the time, although this is irrelevant. \n\nThis morning I received an email saying my short position was exercised (fuck me, I didn‚Äôt realize ex-div for AAPL was today). I‚Äôm assuming they exercised it yesterday to qualify for the upcoming dividend. My broker (Questrade in Canada) did nothing with my long position, so I‚Äôve gone from a max loss of $2,000 to a much steeper one. I don‚Äôt know what to do.. \n\nQuestrade rep convinced me to exercise my long position and sell the shares upon receipt. However, the share price has dropped $10 already today, so my loss has likely gone from $2,000 to $12,000 and could get worse if this drop continues. I submitted the request to exercise the calls and I‚Äôm waiting for the shares. \n\nI entered this trade assuming my max loss would be $2,000. I thought questrade would require direction for the long position, cause I don‚Äôt have 380k to cover in my account. \n\nTLDR; entered what I thought was a covered credit position, to later be naked and forced into to a $380,000 long position.", "id": "i5i91o", "created_utc": 1596821945.0, "score": 415, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 236, "comments": [{"body": "Don't panic, you are fine.\n\nYour short 375C was assigned (it happens), so you SOLD STOCK SHORT for $375K.

Thank you for your time, puddud4\n\nThen CC every dealer within an hour and a half to start a bidding war to the bottom", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Here's how you negotiate buying a used car from a guy that used to be a car salesman.  \n\nFirst, find the car on their website, but DO NOT fill out the \"enter your name and phone number for 200 off\" coupon pop-up thing.  \nIf you do, you'll automatically be put in the system for the internet sales guys.  Those guys move a lot of cars each month and aren't willing to budge as much as a walk up guy trying to hit a bonus. \n\nIf they use a digital camera to take the photos and there is a time stamp on it, take note of how long the car has been on their lot.  The longer the car sits, the more willing they will be to move it.  If they just got it, its probably not their lowest price yet.  Usually a big dealership wants to move their cars as fast as possible, but won't sit on a car for more than 60 or 90 days.  \n\nGet the vin number off of the website if possible (ill explain later).  It also helps to find a similar vehicle from their competition at a similar price point.  I bought a toyota tundra, but there was a Ford dealership (owned by a different company) next door.   They had a very similar F-150 for a few k less.  The different company is key, even if its a different brand (ford/toyota).  I worked at a Ford dealership with a dodge/ram/jeep dealership next door.  If you walked away from me and bought a ram next door, I still got half of your commission and didn't have to deal with your bullshit.\n This is why you don't fill out the internet thing, the sales guy has to split the commission with the internet guy.  You need to tell them upfront you DIDN'T fill that out.  Bring it up casually in conversation like, \"hey I didn't fill out the coupon thing online, I can do it now from my phone if you want.\"\n\nAnyway, \n\nThe price they have the car marked on the lot will be significantly higher than the internet (theyre competing with every dealership online).   They'll try to say thats a different car blah blah.   pull out the paperwork with the vin and compare it. the vin is stamped to the dash on the inside the windshield on the driver's side, so you can  call them on their bullshit standing next to the car.  The salesman will play dumb, but feel free to call them out for lying.  \n\n\nGet a pre-approval offer from your bank or capital one or whatever.   Get approved on the actual vehicle with the vin number, enter in your parameters (number of months, down payment, trade etc).  You can exaggerate the value of your trade just a bit $1,500-$2k.  Don't be stupid, you're not going to be able to make up $10k.  \n\nWhen you sit down, they're going to bring you some bullshit number (1st pencil).  Make a joke, tell them they made a mistake, you're only buying 1 car.   Give them the sheet that shows your bank approved you at the price they have listed online, on that vehicle (vin number) and tell them you'll finance through them if they can beat the price, if not, you just need the cash price and you'll deal with your bank.  They likely won't be able to actually beat the price bc you lied about your trade, and you'll probably have to give a little ground, but thats OK.\n\nChances are, they'll come back 2-3 times with numbers higher than you are already approved for. Theyll try to throw in an extended warranty, free car washes etc.  Deny any and every extra the salesman tries to sell you and get the bottom price from him. (I'll explain later). \n\n You still have the other vehicle you're already approved on at the other dealership as a trump card. If the salesman is being a dick or not playing ball, call the other dealership, either when he walks off or just conspicuously walk past the sales desk and ask them if they have the car in stock.  Tell the dealership you're already pre-approved can you come buy that car *right now*.  The dealership will 100% of the time say yes, even if they already sold that car (yeah, they're all fuckin liars).  \n\nIf they still won't budge, tell them you're tired of playing games. You're buying a car today, if they won't work a deal, pull out the sheet and say this dealership is ready to sell me this car right now and you already called them.  If they're willing to let you walk at this point and you're way off, they can't and/or aren't willing to make the deal.   \n\n\nNow remember, you lied about the price of your trade in.  Its highly likely they won't be able to get you to exactly the price you quoted yourself.  Depending on credit and interest rate and term, every $1000 financed is roughly $15-$30.  If you lied by 2k and you're pre-approved at $405/month and they're offering you $430/month, that's a pretty good deal.  If they offer you a range of between $430-$450 cross out the 450, circle the 430 and sign it saying you'll buy it right now at 430.  They'll agree.  \n\nThe bottom line,Get the lowest price they're willing to give you from the salesman.   Don't add any bells and whistles, just get the lowest price. \n\nIf you DO want to purchase the extended warranty, or the free car washes (scam) or the whatever just wait.   \n\nAfter you're done with the sales guy, you'll go in the finance office.   The finance people have the ability to manipulate the interest rate to lower your prices (which the salesman/sales managers either don't or wont).  \n\nThe dealership will get you approved at a rate (your buy rate) but won't tell you what that is.  If, for example,, they get you approved at 1.9% and charge you 3.9%, they make the other 2% on the back end.  This is dealer profit and is a part of the finance guys commission. They almost always try to squeeze 2% unless they're offering a promo interest rate to move a certain car.  \n\nThe finance guy makes a nut off of all of the packages the car salesman can't sell, and that extended warranty is likely a bigger commission to him than the back end interest.   \nObviously at this point, the news has spread from the sales manager that you're a tough cookie.  Here you can use his ego to your advantage.  He'll REALLY want to rub it in everyone's face that he is a really Badass salesman. \n He is the only one that can/will manipulate the interest rate,  so he can lower your interest rate to keep your payments close.  The end result is you can get a $3k package added for $15-20 bucks /month that the salesman could only offer you for $50-60/month.  \n\n\nNow, this whole process is designed at getting you the best price possible.  You're going to have to be willing to be a dick and stand up and walk out if they're not playing the game, but it's A LOT easier to pull off if you come in cool, calm and collected and act like you don't give a fuck.  If you come in aggressive, being an aasshole, and you're a tough sell, they won't be as likely to play the game and they'll tell you to fuck off.  Don't go in guns blazing.  \nYou've done your homework and have a couple of cards up your sleeve. \n\n\nTheir job is to get you to fall in love with the car to justify over paying for it.  Don't fall into their trap.  \nHertz is liquidating 180,000 cars before December 31st.  The used car market is going to be FLOODED over the next 6-8 months.  The auctions are going to be overflowing and dealerships with cash will be getting flooded with great deals.   Theyre going to TRY to sell them at the regular price at first, but if they can't move them, they'll be dropping prices (as they can't send them to auction). \n\nA few months from now will be a really good time to buy a used car. \nIf the prices of used cars drop, its going to hurt new car sales, so the manufacturers will likely be throwing around incentives left and right.  \nIf demand slows AND supply increases (hertz) it will be a perfect storm.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nice.

{"title": "Fastly - Some Myths Cleared Here", "selftext": "I am seeing a shit load of new treads discussing the following-\n\n1. Fastly vs NET\n2. Hold Fastly or let go?\n3. What does Fastly do?\n\nSo I will clear up a few myths just in case.\n\nFastly is a CDN provider, which allows their clients to host their website on Fastly's servers. Fastly's business model is catered towards large enterprises that are looking at fastest (thus the name!) cold start time, i.e. time it takes to load a webpage on mobile/PC. Here are a few of their clients-\n\n1. **Clients doing very well during Covid**\n\n* Reddit\n* Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n* Shopify\n* Wayfair\n* Pinterest\n* Twitter\n* Stripe\n* Overstock\n* Shazam\n* Wealthfront\n* Etsy\n* Tiktok\n\n1. **Clients doing not so well during Covid**\n\n* Airbnb\n* Jetblue\n* Trip Advisor\n* Alaska Air\n* Kayak\n* Yelp\n* Kayak,\n* and many more....\n\nNotice first that their clients that are booming right now are very likely to continue booming for the next year or so. Once we are done with Covid (that is if), revenues will switch to clients in hospitality business, which typically have a strong business during normal times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFastly's USP is fastest cold start time, i.e., it is the best CDN in the market which allows the visitors on their client's website to load the webpage/apps faster than anyone else in the market right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is this USP so important**\\--well there are a few reasons why Fastly will continue to have higher growth rate.  I have noted a few down below-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Apple rolls out 5g iPhone later this year. They will require webpages to load faster. Fastly is the best CDN there is to handle that request. This does not mean that Akamai or NET are sitting out catching honeybee, but really means that Fastly is positioned to serve that switch to 5g better than NET or Akamai IMO.\n2. Fastly's business model is unique. It charges their customers based on the bytes loaded, which translates to the amount of time people spend on their customers' website. Thus, while I am spending 5-10 mins to write this essay, Reddit is getting charged by Fastly (pun intended!). Notice that this is a different business model than NET. NET offers a free subscription to begin with and has lower CDN hosting rate for those willing to host on their servers. Therefore, organizations which do not feel that speed is of concern to them as much, prefer to use NET. On the flip side, Fastly has a niche set of customers who value speed, because user experience on their website is of utmost importance to them. Imagine if I had to spend several 100 microseconds for a webpage to open, I would be pissed and may not go on that website, purely because of that reason.\n3. YoY growth based on investor's copy was 62%, which is great if you ask me. As long as it is staying above 50, my money is parked there.\n4. Bergman and Josh raised guidance for this year, during a time when a lot of CFOs are holing on giving guidance. Also of importance is that these folks in the C suite like to give a conservative guidance and beat it. In other words, promise less and deliver more. This leaves no question that next earnings should be a beat but do not take my word on it because who knows what happens tomorrow.\n\n**Influence of Tiktok on Fastly's revenue**\n\nCertainly one of the most important question that needs to be addressed because Tiktok constitutes 12% of the revenues. With the stock dropping like a rock after ER and then earnier today after Donny decided to ban it after 45 days, looks like a lot of the uncertainty is already baked into the price at this moment. Those who were uncertain unboarded the train today. That point is the exhaustion point where bulls come in and drive the stock higher (e.g., Chegg today).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally feel that Tiktok MSFT should be a done deal and they are waiting to announce this sometime this month. I am neither an insider nor do I happen to know the actually outcome. However, I do follow hedge fund option sentiment and I have noticed bullish calls inflow for MSFT this past couple days. While I am a peasant who is not connected to anyone involved with the deal, I am sure some of these whales are aware of the decision, which is part of the reason for that bullish call inflow for MSFT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Should you dump FSLY or not?**\n\nEntirely up to you but I see a lot of growth in this company. Fundamentally, nothing has changed in how they operate. The company gave an upward guidance and that drives the stock in forward direction. Some sellers left the ship because a lot of RH investors have not seen losses in their life or some are not even aware of the potential of this company, except it became a meme stock lately and FOMO drove a lot of noobs in FSLY train.\n\nIt is always better to curtail losses. If you trust that they will continue to bring in revenues, I would dollar cost average on every dip. This ensures your average cost of the share is reduced significantly with any dip. Most fund managers actually add stocks to their funds when the stock is sitting at 30 day MA. Fastly had such a quick run up that the 30 day MA kept moving. All of that being said, I think it may rest for some time before beginning the next leg up. That could be a week, 2 weeks, or a month but you will have to be patient if you do not want to loose money. However, never panik sell on a red day because that is literally the day people like me buy from people who are selling.\n\nWould Monday bring a ray of light and we open green-\n\nNo one knows what happens but I would continue to DCA on every 5% drop. I remember when Square dropped a couple years ago, I kept DCAing and here I am sitting on gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped convince some of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 1: Some of you are hellbent on debating that MSFT will use Azure to provide CDN service for Tiktok. Take a look at this link to see a list of Azure CDN customers**\n\n[https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customers](https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/microsoft-azure-cdn/customers)\n\nHow many do you recognize? More importantly, how many do you think are critically dependent on cold start time?  Short answer is that except Adobe, HP, Heineken, and Maersk, I do not recognize others.  I will rest my case here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 2: Here is why MSFT will not care about moving Tiktok to Azure**\n\nFrom Fastly's 10Q  and shareholder letter published on August 7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Revenue for Q2, 2020 = $74.66MM\n* Revenue for Q1, 2020= $82.92MM\n* Revenue guidance from the chief: $290-300MM for FY2020\n* Tiktok's contribution to this revenue: 12% of $300MM = $36MM\n\nNow, think about this #---> $36MM is what MSFT would have to pay Fastly if they are going to continue using them this year. Of course this number will get compounded every year with the Tiktok's growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you really convinced that a $1.6T market cap behemoth  is interested in saving $36MM per year for an acquisition that they will be paying north of $60-65BB to Bytedance? I mean, really? This is a drop in the bucket for MSFT. Tech spends more than that much money on free food for employees. If they were really thinking about cutting costs, you would have observed it from their other practices. I will not go any further than this statement.\n\nAgain, this is my perspective. You can believe what you want to, but I tried to give you a well documented reason behind why MSFT will not pursue Azure for Tiktok.", "id": "i5nb19", "created_utc": 1596838317.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Hello knowledgeable cloud dude\n\nCan you please give your opinion of compute@edge.

Now, I'm totally not into WWE but I have a friend who is so diehard it makes me worried. He told me there was a WWE event in another city not too far away and asked if I wanted to go. I said sure. Why the fk not. I used to watch when I was in middle school. I go, and I proceed to have the most insane white trash time of my life, mind you I'm asian. First off, I get totally obliterated and I'm just screaming my ass off the entire time. That part was great. But the part that blew me away was when I went to the merch stand. You will not believe how much cash money I saw getting shilled out for merch by people who look like they do not exactly have a lot of money. And these products were extremely subpar in quality, made from China bullshit. I proceed to purchase a glowing unicorn horn thing that was like $15. Totally worth it. \n\nAnyhoodles, as we are driving back home (not driving because dammit I'm responsible), my buddy is telling me about their streaming service they're coming with as well as the other brands they have under the WWE company, which is NXT if you did not know.

These asshats loved to naked short Silver, and they could do it by stopping actual physical delivery because it was considered a \"hedge\". These shitbags have been MASSIVELY suppressing Silver since around 2011.  The \"Classic\" silver/gold ratio is around 16:1 in price.  Today it was like 79:1 - because it has been suppressed so long.\n\nSilver has industrial uses of \\~2m oz/day.  Silver itself is a pretty thin market anyways, so it tends to be volatile when supply/demand moves it around. Miners aren't really operating at full steam either, so supply is shorting up - and people still need silver for phones/TVs/Medical stuff/etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround March 23, the COMEX started settling Metals with PHYSICAL.  What this means is that the banks (mainly JPM) had to stop shorting (selling) Silvers futures contracts, or else they would have to pull Silver from their vault and actually deliver it to buyers.  JPM can only pull so much physical out of their vault, before they have none.  What you are seeing is Banks slowly unwinding their shorts which is price positive as Silver tries to find a new \"natural\" level compared to gold.  I would expect something like a 40:1 silver/gold ratio initially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Fed is printing by the billions. This causes is inflation.  The Federal Reserve has already said they are going to let inflation run for a bit, and cap interest rates around 2% - we are near record lows for home mortgages again.  This means, that lets say inflation is 3%, well if the bond market is only earning 2%, then the REAL effective interest rate is -1%.  This is MASSIVELY price positive for metals. Metals are 0% assets, you can't eat your pet rock - but it doesn't go at -1% either.  One thing to watch is $TIP - as it goes higher, metals will follow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo with all the economic worry of the Fed printing money, and negative REAL interest rates, people are seeking a safe haven for a foundational asset.  This is causing a MASSIVE run on metals - and people can take physical delivery from the COMEX.  Last month, a record # of people are standing for physical delivery at COMEX, and I expect this to continue.

I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 ‚Äì which was no small change at that time in my life ‚Äì but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat‚Äôs still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*‚Äú7% YoY in the market!‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúIf you hold for the long term, you don‚Äôt have to worry about volatility!‚Äù*\n\nHere‚Äôs the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the ‚Äú[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)‚Äù, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization brought on, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman‚Äôs tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend‚Äôs dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream ‚Äì marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment.\n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI‚Äôve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so.\n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I‚Äôve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - are never coming back.\n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don‚Äôt they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It‚Äôs fucking up the game for the rest of us!\n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: ‚ÄúI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.‚Äù\n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn‚Äôt have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! ‚Äì so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade.\n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I‚Äôve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I‚Äôm a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I‚Äôve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I‚Äôve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I‚Äôve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily.\n\nI am still prepared ‚Äì waiting, even ‚Äì for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It‚Äôs all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: ‚Äúcould I pay this month‚Äôs phone bill with my gains?‚Äù With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service ‚Äúfree‚Äù?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that‚Äôs been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed ‚Äì you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes ‚Äì* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real.\n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a ‚ÄúS.M.A.R.T.‚Äù goal ‚Äì small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you‚Äôve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you ‚Äúmost day traders lose money!‚Äù First, ‚Äúday trader‚Äù is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere.\n\nThis is not an appeal to ‚Äúnot be average‚Äù nor to keep ‚Äúchasing bad money with good‚Äù - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I‚Äôm old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR;** To Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn‚Äôt the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain‚Äôt gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right ‚Äì the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.\n\nEDIT: \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling people to day trade their retirement funds!‚Äù First, though I trade daily, I‚Äôm not technically a ‚ÄòDay Trader‚Äô. Second, obviously don‚Äôt spend what you can‚Äôt afford to lose. But yes, I think saving money in this ever more volatile market is just as much of a risk as day trading. When you see 1/3 of it - all assets, not just stocks - evaporate in the course of 2 weeks, I think you should too.\n\n‚ÄúYou just got lucky, you‚Äôre not a sage!‚Äù As I said, I fully expect it to go tits up. I‚Äòve pulled my initial investment out now, and once I‚Äôve recovered my April losses, it will be ‚Äòhouse money‚Äô. I don‚Äôt claim to have ‚Äòcracked the code‚Äô. I just found a way to make it work that fits my personality. \n\n‚ÄúDay trading isn‚Äôt the answer.‚Äù Maybe not. But wages haven‚Äôt gone up for 20 years while the cost of the education to maintain them has skyrocketed. Do you see the job market getting better for the next few years? I don‚Äôt. So whatever the answer is, it‚Äôs not going to be ‚Äústeady job for 30 years and collect a pension.‚Äù I advise every single working stiff to try to find a way out of working for someone else and saving into a psychopathic market, and that starts by figuring out how to cover today‚Äôs expenses.\n\n‚ÄúOptions are a zero sum game.‚Äù This is true, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the chain of it‚Äôs life didn‚Äôt generate profit. A covered call that gets assigned is a win for both parties. \n\nYou will not learn about trading like this in school, and unless you work at a firm, you won‚Äôt learn it on the job either.
