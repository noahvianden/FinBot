I don't think most people still understand what the hell Tesla is really about, even though Elon keeps saying it.\n\n[\"Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy\"](https://www.tesla.com/about)\n\nThe overall goal of Tesla really has nothing to do with cars. Cars is just something they use as a business model to reach that goal, fuck the cars really, that's not the point of Tesla. The goal is to build a world where nearly energy comes from solar and batteries, all forms of transportation, cars, air travel, train and eventually ship are all fully electric.\n\nThis sounded really insane in 2019 (last year), when most people just thought that Tesla made luxury cars at a loss. If Tesla can become the world's 11th largest company, become a clear market leader in batteries and EV industry, fuck, maybe all that other stuff is also possible?\n\nIt's really the same deal with Neuralink and SpaceX, nobody takes Neuralink seriously now, and nobody took SpaceX seriously in 2016-ish when all they did was run supply missions to the international space station. This random startup who got lucky and won some NASA resupply missions say they want to have a self-sustaining colony on Mars with a population over 1 million? No way.\n\nToday they're the only US entity who can launch astronauts into orbit, they have total dominance of the launch service provider industry, they're the only entity in the world, private or government who has reusable orbital rockets, they control around 25% of all operational satellites in orbit. They say they want to create a self-sustaining colony on Mars? Fuck, maybe they can do it...\n\nI guess most useful point from this as an investor is the ability to separate out the \"Goal\", from \"Sustainable business model\". Elon will talk big about both and kinda half-assedly mix actual achievable goals part of the business model with long term goals of the company. They really have no idea how exactly you achieve those long terms goals, but it should be possible on a first principle basis, and you just should be able to get there one day as the business grows.\n\n2 TWh battery production, self driving taxi, electric jet, cold gas thrusters on a roadster. This is all long term goal stuff they're trying to get to, but can't, or don't know how to build today.\n\nTesla hatchback, single casting machine, Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, plaid powertrain, HW4.

{"title": "How Tesla and Apple have Primed the Slingshot : A Theory on Stock Splits", "selftext": "\n\nI. Background \n\nIf you follow the markets or watch CNBC you will quickly notice hosts and professional investors refer to day traders or “Robinhood traders”. This is a frequent trope that they will roll out whenever someone bring up the current record highs and overextended valuations. Cramer has said he has not seen a group of bullish traders like this since the 80’s whose battle cry is “Stocks Only Go Up”. \n\nNow in your daily life you may have ran across numerous people who have never even once cared an inkling about the market. But now these same non participants are looking to buy the dip and “stocks are cheap due to the pandemic.” The markets have more broad retail participation than ever before, and members here are quick to mention cousins,aunts,moms,dads, social media people who are giving stock tips. These people have never been in the market nor cared for it before. \n\nII. The Evolution of Trading \n\nWe joke about Robinhood being a game and the money not being real. How it’s addictive like a video game and you can keep buying as long as you purchase DLC, micro transactions.\nBut all these things are true Robinhood is incredibly addicting and it’s interface is simple and intuitive, enough so that practically anyone can start trading complex financial instruments: options, spreads, condors, straddles. The best part is it’s all “FREE” no commissions and all done from your phone. \n\nCall Options are a leveraged product for a finite amount of money one can have infinite gains and trade 100 shares for a fraction of the cost. The way the market makers hedge themselves against selling call options is by buying up the stock, so that they don’t lose their shirt in case those same options start hitting.\n\nIII. WEAPONIZED AUTISM \n\nI believe the smart people at Apple/Tesla have realized the changing dynamics in the market. More retail trading with more options CAN in fact influence the market! They’ve realized a positive feedback loop of retail buying call options and forcing MM to buy shares is in fact DRIVING PRICES HIGHER. So how do they keep this train rolling? Well their stocks have ran so high that premiums even on a weekly is around $1k for Apple and 5k+ for TSLA, so they announce a split. Now weeklies/monthlies are going to be a few hundred bucks each. With options more cost accessible I expect new buyers to rush in, but their not rushing in buying shares; there rushing in leveraged to the tits with 100x options. \n\nEdit: Many of you autistics have a hard time comprehended things, so I’ve decided to to compress my thesis. Stocks are sold in the open market and the ONLY thing and I mean ONLY thing that determines the price is what someone is willing to pay for it. Everything else you know or think should DETERMINE price doesn’t, it’s used to JUSTIFY the price. This is why pump n dumps happen, this is why some random tickets like Kodak can 25x in value in 2 trading days. Nothing else matters except people were willing to pay more for it. So now that Apple and Tesla are actually materially CHEAPER,  more people will buy it, and stats show that more people will use leveraged instruments to buy it, such as call options. \n\nTLDR: APPLE $250 Jan 2021 Tesla $1000 Jan 2021", "id": "ij4tyb", "created_utc": 1598753139.0, "score": 308, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "Apple never hitting $250.

You pay your ISP, they pay their ISP, and both your ISPs pay the Tier II ISP.

{"title": "DD:SE is an absolute growth monster. Don't miss out on what could be the AMZN of Southeast Asia", "selftext": "First time doing one of these, but personally aiming to go all in on this company, and you should too. With the tech boom we're currently in, SE has the potential to be an absolute monster and (continue to) dominate in these times. Imagine investing in AMZN, SQ, BABA, ATVI: combined, and you have this monstrosity. But don't take my words for it; let's look at this numbers\n\n\n\nSE | Q2 2020 Adjusted Revenue Amount (Millions) and Growth (YOY)\n---|---\nDigital Entertainment | $716.2 (61.6%)\nE-commerce | $510.6 (187.8%)\nDigital Payments | $11.9 (325%)\nOther | $48.5 (15.5%)\nTotal | $1,287.2 (93.4%)\n\nThis bad boy has a impressive **94%** year over year growth. Moreover, during their last Q2 earnings, they reported a revenue beat of over 20%, which means they are demolishing earnings expectations, and poised to grow even faster than expected. \n\nNow let's look at each individual sector a little bit deeper. For reference, SE's current market capitalization is $70 billion. This is absolutely undervalued, and you'll see why in a moment\n\n--- \n\n**Digital Entertainment**\n\nGaming has gotten a boost thanks to this pandemic. Their number one game Free Fire just crossed over 100 million active users as it's peak, and is currently the number 1 game in SE Asia and Latin America. They’re very active in making their game interesting and constantly evolving, hosting tournaments, including season passes, etc. Personally, I see it as the South East Asian Fortnite, and we all know how much cash Epic is printing \n\n\n[Let's look at how fast they're growing (Source: Q2 Earnings Presentation)](https://imgur.com/a/zUTxFeC)\n\n\n\nSE's revenue growth absolutely demolishes some of the big players such as Activision (38.4% YOY), EA (20.7% YOY), and TTWO (54% YOY). Their revenue is admittedly lower (384 million for their Garena gaming segment alone), but one can easily see how poised for growth they are here.\n\nATVI currently makes almost $2 billion and grows 38.4% YOY. Looking at their numbers and their market cap of 70 billion, I believe we can justify a market cap of **$25 billion** for SE's gaming division\n\n---\n\n**E-Commerce** \n\nThis is what makes SE the powerhouse that it is. Don’t take my word for it. Let’s look at their web traffic compared to the some of it’s competitors, including the BABA-backed competitor Lazada\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lJc7N2N\n\nTheir QOQ growth is absolutely absurd, and absolutely demolishing the competition. They currently have a QOQ growth of **33%**, demolishing Lazada’s 5% by miles. They also have the highest average monthly active users and time in app on android in the shopping category compared to any other app on the market AND #1 in downloads.\n\n\nAt this rate, they have has potential to be the BABA of Southeast Asia, which currently has a **$750,000,000,000** market cap. Considering the GDP of southeast asia is about a quarter of the GDP as China, if SE can get the same penetrance as BABA, that would justify a market cap of $175 billion. Currently, I’d give it a market cap of **$90 billion**\n\n\n---\n\n**Digital Payments**\n\nJust look at SQ and this part will be a no brainer. They’re making pennies right now ($11.5 million), but they’re growing at an absolutely absurd **325%**. It’s way too early to be making any sure-thing judgment calls right now at such a low revenue, but seeing how they started to pick up and dominate the other markets, it wouldn’t surprise me if this growth is sustained as well. Staying at this rate for the next 4 years can turn that measly 11.5 million into **$1.3 billion**. (11.5 million * 3.25^4)\n\nConsidering SQ’s market cap of 70 billion, I think **$10 billion** is a completely fair evaluation, with that number being much higher if SE continued to show outrageous levels of growth like in this sector \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSE is an absolute growth monster. These numbers are just my estimates based on the performance I’ve already seen of seen. With the justifications above, I believe SE should currently be worth over $125 billion, implying another **80%** upside *right now*. However, with 94% revenue growth YOY, that number will quickly balloon as SE continues to dominate the Southeast Asian market. In my opinion, this is an absolutely brain-dead easy opportunity to hop in on the next Amazon before it’s too late\n\nHalf of my account is currently in 9/18 160c.
