{"title": "I'm about to inherit $200K and I want $200K to produce income for me using options", "selftext": "To preface this post, I have over 2 years experience trading options. I've successfully grown my $20K account to $65K over two years using a mix of buying and holding shares and doing relatively low risk options trades (LEAPs, PMCC, Short Puts). Now I'm about to inherit $200K and I intend to use the $200K strictly to produce income by managing low risk options trades such as the wheel strategy.\n\nI absolutely love leverage which is why I'm eager to go with the PMCC approach. Let's take $AMD for example, a company I'm bullish on. You can purchase **50** x $50 calls expiring 1/21/2022 @ $39.50 with a delta of .86 which will take up $197,500 initial capital. Then I can sell **50** x 30 DTE calls between .30 delta and .45 delta for $235 or $400, respectively. Depending on what I anticipate coming up, I may either **not** sell a call until volatility blows over (earnings reports) or I would choose a higher probability trade to coincide with analyst price target changes or I would choose a lower probability if the stock is is consolidating. I have a possibility of producing monthly income ranging between $10,000 to $20,000.\n\nIf I go strictly with the standard wheel strategy, I would sell **25** x 30 DTE $80 puts with delta at .35 and close to 69% probability for a credit of $8,625. So we're looking at approximately $8,000 a month, give or take. If I get assigned, I would just flip and sell calls using the same guideline as above.\n\nI would not mind getting assigned in either cases. My primary objective is to gain on premium, not so much on the underlying (although with LEAPs being leveraged by giving me 50 contracts to begin with, it'll give me a nice boost to profits).\n\nWhat would you do in this case? Do you disagree with this approach? Other than the risk of being assigned, is there anything else I should be aware of before taking on this strategy? If you say diversify, then can you recommend a hedge or alt stock to trade on on a semi-active pattern?\n\nCheers.\n\n**Edit:** the wide variety of opinions and suggestions I've gotten is deeply appreciated. Given the risky state of this market today, I'm considering a more diversified approach across multiple tickers and as well as real estate. I haven't decided what the plan would look like but once I go for it, I think I'll update /r/options with another post with results.\n\nEdit 2: Jesus, this post blew up.

These things are never easy, and while the money can be helpful for you in building a long-term future, it doesn't replace the people we lose.\n\nWithout knowing your whole investment picture, here are a few things I would start with.\n\n1. How much debt do you have, other than your house, and at what interest rates? Anything high interest, pay it down or off. (Some people would recommend putting some of this money towards your mortgage. Unless you are near the end of it somehow, I would personally NOT do this)\n2. Do you have any tax-advantaged accounts, such as an HSA or an IRA/Roth IRA? If you do not have an IRA or Roth IRA, set one up (you can set up both but it's the same maximum to one or to the mix, so for example if the limit is $6,000 you can only put $3,000 in each, or some mix...). You can make a $12,000 contribution for this year and next year, and dollar-cost average into a few low-cost mutual funds. However you may want to consult with a tax professional on this, because if the inheritance counts as taxable income you may NOT be able to contribute to a Roth IRA and/or IRA. What you may consider is putting the money in something like a money market account until 2021 and then making the deposits then for 2021 and 2022. And keep in mind you can only contribute based off \"earned income,\" I am assuming you have a regular job but you may not. Be sure to read up on all these different accounts/concepts.\n3. You already have an options portfolio, I would definitely take some capital and put some of it in there. I personally do a lot of short puts, covered calls, i.e. \"the wheel.\" This is a good way to try to get alpha when done on great companies. Leverage is powerful but always remember it cuts both ways. So be cautious. Don't get too attached to one stock or one strategy because the market is a fickle mistress and what works today may not work tomorrow.\n4. The people suggesting real estate, I have considered this but I am not sure right now is the best time to be looking into landlording, unless you're wanting to do a project that involves rehabbing a home, because it'll give you plenty of time to do the work. Renting to people in COVID-19 is kind of a legal minefield, you could end up buying your first rental property and having the person lose their job and not pay the rent, without any ability to go over the money due to greater-than-normal rental protections (not saying it's bad to protect people from eviction. Just saying it's a risk right now). What you could do is invest this capital and in a year or two take some of the profits and use that for your first rental property. A bank would absolutely adore the opportunity to lend you money for a house if you have $250,000+ in the bank in investments, cash, etc.\n\nMost importantly, don't get out over your skis in any one thing. $200,000 is not as much money as it used to be or as much money as it sounds like.

First, the FED has stated that they will be printing unlimited money to help anchor the economy. However, I foresee that being having a wall at the end. Printing can only do so much without damaging the reputation of the Dollar. Since  monetary policy can only do so much we had to bring in fiscal policy. This resulted in a large stimulus bill which helped businesses and individuals stay afloat. This also can only do so much without putting a burden on the US, which is a part of the reason why they are treading on legislating a new stimulus deal. Keep in mind, the economy and stock market are not directly correlated. The stock market is doing “well” but the economy is still in a recession. A part of the influx in demand for high grade stocks come from many individuals that are out of work and have been trading but that is not the only driver. These policies are driving these inflated prices in the market and causing them do drastically rise. Economically, we are not doing well. Consumers are still spending less than, continuing to work from home and many are not working. Eventually, the market will begin to recognize a true problem and begin to correct. Bare in mind, that only a few stocks are pumping the S&P 500, while a lot of companies are still not performing as well.

I'm not sure what you were doing, but I sure was thinking of ways how to profit from this. And I imagine millions of others were doing the same.\n\nIn 2008, trading was quite difficult. You needed to call your stock broker on the phone to give him the instructions. Maybe there was a clunky website. They sure charged a lot of money for each transaction. The point is not a lot of people were doing day trading and no one traded options. This changed after the Great Recession. Since the reason for the crash had to do with specific financial instruments, many people studied it. Movies were made about it. The public became more engaged and the internet made it all easier for ordinary people to trade and exchange knowledge how to trade.\n\nSo now we're in March 2020 and the market is crashing, what are you going to do? How about buying some puts? The puts have the effect that even if a stock price falls, some guy will be forced to buy 100 of them at a given price, pulling the share price back up. It even works with bankrupt companies, as long as you have put options, you're guaranteed to make money as long as the stock goes down.\n\nAs a consequence, the prices start to go back up. What do you do now? You won't buy puts anymore because it's obvious the market is in recovery mode, so maybe just buy some stocks now that there's been a 50% discount. Perhaps buy a few calls too. [On June 8th CBOE](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_indicators:put_call_ratio) had the largest discrepancy in its history between the number of puts and calls traded, it was at 0.37 meaning there were 3 times as many calls traded as puts. If there are so many calls, it must mean the market is doing great, right? So many people can't be wrong, right? This reinforces the sentiment, causing people to buy more and more.\n\nThen there was a correction in mid June where all you had to do is buy a couple puts and you could make a lot of money.\n\nMy point is, there were *many* people waiting for this crash to happen. They all studied 2008 and knew what to do if it happens again. Because of the wide array of instruments available they can profit no matter which direction the market takes. Couple that with lots of free time due to canceled vacations, no sports events, some extra money that we have since we're not spending it since we can't... and it seems understandable why the market is not crashing.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy gold on dips.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The terms \"Melt up\" and \"Irrational Exuberance\" apply here.

I’d say I have around 22 stocks.\n- Income: very fortunate to be in the $250-$300K range\n\nUp until now, I’ve been fairly safe with my investments and haven’t made any big bets on any singular stocks, largest position would be about $7-8K (not including ETFs). My returns have been modest, 60% in the past 2.5-3 years. However, when I look at my top performing stocks, which were the ones I had the most confidence in buying, I didn’t make a big purchase and some are +100% all the way up to +700%. Turning 1-2K into 5-10K is nice, but I’m feeling like I want to *try* and accelerate my net worth faster.\n\nThe TLDR is that I’m able to save/invest between $60-80K / yr and at this point in my life, if I were to take a $100K position in a single stock that dropped by say, 80%, my life would largely be unaffected (other than slowing my eventual retirement down a bit).

Trading at nearly 33x forward earnings with Azure growth now under 50% means that they will likely need to identify a new leg of growth to keep commanding such a premium valuation. Azure has been the main driver of the margin and EPS expansion story the past 3-4 years, so as it matures to AWS type growth (30s %), it will be tough for MSFT to keep up the same level of relative outperformance as we have seen. \n\nI would also say it’s a wait-and-see as far as the TikTok acquisition (or not). Nadella did a great job overseeing the LinkedIn integration and allowing the site to maintain autonomy and therefore brand strength. TikTok at a $50bn valuation could be a high risk-high reward play. Yes, it’s currently the platform of choice for Gen Z. But even still, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger all have higher DAUs. And Instagram is seeming to get some folks to try out the copycat Reels feature. If they can hijack users from TikTok as they did with Snapchat, it’s hard to see TikTok as a highly monetized business in the future. It could still work, but I think tracking Instagram Reels is key. \n\nGaming grew over 60% last quarter, and I do like the focus on a subscription gaming model. Certainly the long-term demand for enterprise SaaS offerings is something that will continue to provide growth. LinkedIn and Surface are both healthy. But should overall revenue growth start to head towards low teens/high single digits, that multiple could contract. \n\nIf Microsoft can become more competitive in edge computing, prove out its AR/VR solutions, or find another rabbit up its sleeve, there’s no reason they can’t join Apple in the $2tn club. I personally would feel better buying after a correction, but Nadella is hard to bet against. With the antitrust dynamics, I continue to feel more confident near-term in MSFT than Amazon and Apple (especially). I think Facebook has plenty of room to run long-term for what it’s worth.
