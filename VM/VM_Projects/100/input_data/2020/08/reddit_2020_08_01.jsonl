Go to hell!\n\nYou post a lot of great comments, and I agree with most of your comments on COVID-19, with some notable exceptions. But you really blew a fuse on this comment. Reminds me of the Steve Martin character in the classic comedy film \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\" - normally a reasonable person, but totally freaks out whenever he hears the phrase [\"cleaning woman\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1oFnWHDPg0). Looks like your trigger phrase is \"THINK OF THE CHILDREN\" - see, I didn't even use that phrase and you reacted as if I had!\n\nNope, not going to stop caring about people. As wonderful as our beautiful TSLA stocks are, people are important too. Caring about other people is a group survival trait, and has greatly enhanced the success of our species. But as a favor to you, you may select as my comment one of the following cynical and calculating reasons that it's good policy to publicly show sympathy toward COVID-19 victims, without any need to THINK OF THE CHILDREN:\n\n1) Other people do care about others, and expect you to do the same, to the extent that it's a social custom. There's a reason that the funeral home director looks somber at the ceremony, instead of rubbing his hands and laughing about all the money he's making. If people think you don't care, they may treat you differently, which could be inconvenient.\n\n2) Many of us made quite a bit of money buying TSLA during the COVID-19 dip. The way I think of it, we were supporting the company and the cause, by taking a risk and keeping the stock from going down even further. The money we made was a reasonable reward for taking the risk and providing support. But some people on one extreme end of the political spectrum have been chastising those who made money while others were sick / dying / going broke, and have been publicly calling for confiscation or high taxation of \"unearned gain\". If TSLA investors are dancing in the streets without at least occasionally acknowledging that it's unfortunate that others have had it hard, then these extremists can use these words to strengthen their case, and perhaps get more public attention. Putting in an occasional good word for the unfortunate is a very small price to pay (hedge) for improving the probability that we get to keep our money even in extreme possible scenarios.\n\n3) Those of us who support Tesla with our investment have been getting significant benefit by publicly portraying ourselves as the \"good guys\", and TSLAQ as the \"bad guys\". And we have been criticizing TSLAQ as heartless for cheering on COVID-19 when they thought it would hurt Tesla. But if we now are thought by others to be cheering on COVID-19 because we think COVID-19 is helping Tesla (for example by impacting Tesla's competitors more than Tesla, or by otherwise directing the flow of investments), then they could perceive us as hypocritical, which again could cause them to treat us differently, which again could be inconvenient. Being a little careful with the wording to point out that we're just observing the effect, not cheering on the virus, could again be a useful hedge in maintaining our public image.\n\nThere - three useful reasons that careful wording can be profitable, with the mushy \"caring\" stuff taken out. Though as I said, I actually do care about people, so I don't have to use these versions.\n\n> Upvoteme is caring and compassionate jokester. He is at least 95% not serious, which is good enough for me.\n\nYou're standing up for your friend - fine. And he already replied with a clarification.

That‚Äôs fairly easy to do in Argentina and quite easy to do in the high, arid plateau in Chile. In Bolivia, in contrast, the main lithium formations are on lower, wetter ground. That means that evaporation takes a lot longer than in any of its neighbors‚Äîwhich adds greatly to the cost of production.\n\nBolivia faces two other obstacles. Its salt flats have low concentrations of lithium, which means it takes more investment to get the same amount of mineral out of the ground.\n\nA bigger problem is the extremely high concentration of magnesium‚Äîabout 20 times as much as in Argentina, and three times as much as in Chile. Current technology requires miners to get rid of magnesium salts by using lime, but that adds to the cost of extraction.

I reverse-engineered the app, and feel confident in stating that I have a very strong understanding for how the app operates (or at least operated as of a few months ago).\n\nTikTok is a data collection service that is thinly-veiled as a social network. If there is an API to get information on you, your contacts, or your device... well, they're using it.\n\n* Phone hardware (cpu type, number of course, hardware ids, screen dimensions, dpi, memory usage, disk space, etc)\n\n* Other apps you have installed (I've even seen some I've deleted show up in their analytics payload - maybe using as cached value?)\n\n* Everything network-related (ip, local ip, router mac, your mac, wifi access point name)\n\n* Whether or not you're rooted/jailbroken\n\n* Some variants of the app had GPS pinging enabled at the time, roughly once every 30 seconds - this is enabled by default if you ever location-tag a post IIRC\n\n* They set up a local proxy server on your device for \"transcoding media\", but that can be abused very easily as it has zero authentication\n\nThe scariest part of all of this is that much of the logging they're doing is remotely configurable, and unless you reverse every single one of their native libraries (have fun reading all of that assembly, assuming you can get past their customized fork of OLLVM!!!) and manually inspect every single obfuscated function. They have several different protections in place to prevent you from reversing or debugging the app as well. App behavior changes slightly if they know you're trying to figure out what they're doing. There's also a few snippets of code on the Android version that allows for the downloading of a remote zip file, unzipping it, and executing said binary. There is zero reason a mobile app would need this functionality legitimately.\n\n... Here's the thing though.. they don't want you to know how much information they're collecting on you, and the security implications of all of that data in one place, en masse, are fucking huge. They encrypt all of the analytics requests with an algorithm that changes with every update (at the very least the keys change) just so you can't see what they're doing.

I almost doubled. Went to 75k. My biggest  1 day was swinging 2 Tesla calls over weekend and Tesla opened at 1700 on July 13th. I raked in 28k in that morning. It was a time where I guess Tesla earnings was coming so it was a build up. Telsa kept going up and up everyday. Anyways that same day i had the biggest loss. I went back in after lunch and thought it was a Tesla dip and kept chasing it. Lost 47k.\n\nThen the following 2 weeks i lost another 40k.\n\nSo in total i borrowed 80k from my hard working parents. I'm down to my last 20k. The reason I am down so much after the initial 47k loss is because I was emotionally trading and revenge trading. Trying to make up the loss.\n\nNow I am left with 20k. Changing my stragedy. I want to somehow be able to flip it back to 80k and get the fk out. I dont wanna work for next 2 years to pay back that 60k (at this time).\n\nI got too confident and high from having lost value in money. Now I'm stuck. Im not sure what to do. But i feeel like betting all in on 1 good run.\n\nLets say Tesla call option is worth 5k. If i buy it at its lowest point which it looks like it is now at 1425 and it rallies one day from 1425 to 1550 or even 1600. Thats roughly 10k profit on 1 option. So if I had 4 call options for 20k. I could stand to make 40k profit on a good run. Which would only make me 20k in hole versus 60k.\n\nThats the toughest part. Being able to catch that $100 rally. \n\nOn friday was amazing. spy and apple rallied the fk. If i went all in on that i could've made some good gains. But I changed my stragedy to lower risk. I made some gains but i started the day with a 4k loss. So i only made back  3k. So still at a loss but not at a 5k loss or 17k loss i had the day before when i was trying to catch SPY rally going all in with 150 call options (worth 35k). That day SPY was going up and down, up and down. Not a rally. If only I caught SPY rally like it was on friday with 150 call options.

{"title": "PPL, $4,875 risk - $43,875 reward + an introduction", "selftext": "# Happy Saturday r/wallstreetbets\n\n**Introduction**: This is my first options trade. I know that none of you know who I am here yet, but you can check my post history if you need to see credentials. I started trading with my friend from gifted class back in the day and we found PPL due to my pennystocks screener that i expanded the price parameters on. My friend is very talented at fundamental analysis, so we'll start with him first. I also want to say thank you to this sub, I have learned how to trade options in about a month, and I appreciate all of you autistic traders who have helped me out. Some of you have recognized me in the webull comments of the S&P500 as I've started trading those weeklies. I use an algorithmic prediction based on 140,000+ analysts filtered through machine learning. But I might start making posts on Sunday Evenings for that soon, after i have proof of its efficacy.\n\nEDIT: thank you for pointing out the discrepancies. there are things that seem to be inaccurate here. ive tried to strike through stuff thats wrong or doesnt matter\n\n*I assume no responsibility if this becomes a losing trade, and you agree to hold harmless if you decide to take any trades based off of any info contained within this post. These are not recommendations to buy or sell anything.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PPL DD from the bro\n\nIm still looking at PPL, but so far: Gas and Electric utility company with 10 million customers and 7B+ in revenue. ~~Quick reference, \\[ \\] is at \\~$32/share with 300mil in income. PPL is $26 with 500mil in income.They have~~ **~~9 seperate filings of insider buys~~** ~~on~~ *~~July 2nd~~*~~. Also on~~ *~~April 3rd~~*~~,~~ *~~Feb 18th~~*~~,~~ *~~Jan 18th~~* ~~and~~ *~~Jan 2nd~~*~~. I havent yet verified if they were all the same people every time. Again, still looking~~.\n\nThey promoted a new President in the last couple months, amd the outgoing President ALSO placed an insider buy on his way out.Financials look good. They have plenty of capital, were barely affected by coronavirus from what it looks like, but that will be confirmed on Aug 10th, when they report 2nd Q earnings.Overall it looks strong. Looks weird to most the fundamental research ive done because of the amount of insider buys. \n\nIt looks like they had some small share dilution since 2q 2019 but I havent found it yet. Suffice to say it wasnt much, as it only dropped earnings/share a couple pennies Q over Q. Im not sure what to make of it other than ~~the company's executives are buying more and more at every opportunity, their share price is less than \\[ \\]'s, while all financial indicators say it should be higher. Even pre-covid levels are lower than \\[ \\]'s pre-covid levels~~.It is a utility company, so they arent known for volatility in share price. It did jump up to $30 briefly in June. It was on a nice rise before the covid collapse\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack to me, trevandezz. They also have earnings August 10. Someone told me one time that when analysts raise their price targets before earnings, its a good sign. Idk how valid it is lol, but I saw this on the News tab of Webull. If you can explain the other stuff in here please do:  [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How to Trade These Options\n\nPlease understand that I started learning how to trade options about a month ago, if I have screwed up any info, let me know. This is the part, where if you can't read charts you're gonna have a bad time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Firstly, here is a key for my charts*\n\n[Also, red candles are bearish, white are bullish](https://preview.redd.it/lw1cfbgbobe51.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcea744bf8a5a2406ad598629beacf2734201e36)\n\nHere is the monthly chart for PPL. The end of the month is always a great time to check the monthly chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dq992a1qbe51.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=9236cec3dd70cb980c29a4f79ed37c45dba6eb78\n\nFrom the Monthly chart, it looks like the bearish trend has reversed, as the June candle didn't engulf the previous candle, and July just completed a bullish hammer reversal candle. When we use the fibonacci tool to measure this current bullish trend, we can see that this retracement dipped into the 50% fib area (pink box), which is cool for me. The 127 fibonacci extension gives us a monthly (long term) target of $33.58, which is also confluence with weekly resistance in that area. And honestly that seems like a better valuation of this company. The price was actually at $36 in January before the beer flu hit. Do with that info what you will\n\n# As we zoom into the weekly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u04dmef1sbe51.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7ed380244876e84428f6f1302bda78e4a99989c\n\nThe weekly chart has broken out of this range that it's been trading in. Great sign. The daily chart is basically the same info, if it can break through this next resistance, our short term target is $27.20\n\nNow, on to the options.\n\nI don't know how you bros do it, but I always just assume the contract will expire worthless and use that as my risk for the trade. You only want to lose $5,000 on this trade if we're wrong? Buy qty 75: 27c 8/21 [Options Profit Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)\n\nThe price has to drop $3.67 for these contracts to be worthless next week before earnings. If the price moves in the upwards direction $3.67, your contracts are worth $18,000. If the price hits our final target of $33.58, you'll have $43,875. To me, I think we could hit $30.79 this upcoming week. Previous weeks have spiked in that same percentage, putting those contracts value at $25,200.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe IV charts look dope too, it's below the 252MA which is a buy sign to me. You never want to buy options when IV is over extended, pretty sure that's how people get IV crushed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1c3dg2zwbe51.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc1111b5a5c7906101478718aaa2285714bb46f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheta is literally $1.50 per day on each contract. Delta is $33, which is good right? Heres the option chart. Notice how these contracts hold their value quite perfectly til expiration. Hitting our target at $33.58 is a $43,000 profit. YUH\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwgsthg9xbe51.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=b220ce8a9a8c641e6d8f58a46735cc4130f4990c\n\nCheers bois", "id": "i1t1c2", "created_utc": 1596291993.0, "score": 205, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Gentlemen, you had my curiosity but now you have my attention.", "score": 146, "replies": [{"body": "Welcome aboard Mr. Candi", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Don‚Äôt say his name three times", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "K", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "And my boner!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Not sure where you're seeing any insider buying.\n\nThere is none.\n\nAll those 7/2 filings are stock grant awards.

This means traditional correlations are being meaningfully changed\n\n3) weak dollar and QE correlations aren't high. EU could shit the bed tomorrow and even with the unlimited QE the dollar could strengthen. The volatility in exchange rates has been pretty crazy and not a signal of a robust and healthy financial market so expect unexpected currency moves because traditional logic is useless now.\n\n4) the fact that the global economy is weak is going to cause bond prices to go up further because US bonds aren't negative yet, borrowing costs are record low, and spreads are still bigly wide. A big chunk of European IG is negative while my IG bonds are still yielding 3%. The spread between Treasuries and US IG is still wide because of default risk but I suspect big money is going to reduce their default risk because where else are they going to put it? Already seen inflows from Europe and Japan who are borrowing USD to buy US IG bonds. I think this could accelerate as earnings in Q2 2020 showed investors whether/which companies have changed credit profiles and some US borrowers are looking fairly resilient.\n\nAll I'm saying is traditional correlations (ie logic) has broken down and this is an unprecedented situation where the Fed is distorting and supporting the market to save pension and investment funds, stock and bond market bubble be damned.\n\nRegarding the credit spreads between IG and Treasury - last year and before, my borrowing costs were equal to IG yields. So essentially if I levered up on IG, all my yield would be used to pay off my borrowing costs. Now I get 1.5% and my borrowing costs are probably 2x the big boys since I borrow at 1.5% now. They've already piled into the muni market and I don't see IG credit yields declining. I think IG yields will go from the current 3% to 1% in the next 12 months. \n\nI'm highly levered in IG bonds and have been since April. I have HY bonds too but they haven't performed nearly as well. I was going to start exiting IG bonds a week ago until JPow stopped me by saying they weren't going to raise rates even if the Fed's inflation target is met. He knows that everyone wants to front run other IG bond holders so we aren't left holding bags like we were in March.\n\nRegardless what happens in other areas of the market, as soon as IG bonds start to tumble I suspect there will be a massive sell off to preserve capital. I'm sure the Fed is aware of this too. So they're just going to keep pumping the bond market regardless of how other assets move - so I don't think correlations will return until the Fed is satisfied with the economy which will be a few years post covid recovery. Initially they expected 5 years but given what we know now they might begin to buy 10 year IG bonds in a few months.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "So, I'm sorry for the late answer.  \n\n\nThank you for your insightful comment. It adds a lot of value to the discussion.  \nThe Fed has indeed changed the game in the corporate bond market. If I see this correctly we're in the weird situation that treasury yields are at record lows while corporate bond yields (thanks to the Fed) are relatively low - one of those markets is indicating that something is wrong and the other market is inviting you to welcome risk.  \n\n\nYou're right that currency exchange rates can be volatile. That's true. I wanted to present my own opinion on why the Euro has been so strong in the last two weeks. My explanation may not be enough to give a final answer but I think it's a start. Also I thought it was important to point out that emerging market currencies are still weak.  \n\n\nIt's probably true that the Fed will try everything they can (which isn't much I believe) to prevent corporate bond yields from skyrocketing but I don't think it changes much regarding the scenario I'm predicting. There's a global dollar system (\"Eurodollar\" indeed is an official term) over which the Fed doesn't have any control.

I do not fault them for that and nobody should expect some moral obligation to society from banks.  You shouldn't expect that from anyone much less a group of people whose sole purpose is to make money from money.  For the most part, It's a cesspool of predators looking to fuck over the world, basically politicians.\n\nAlso, the govt should have let banks fail during the GFC.  There has been 0 accountability for it and nobody learned shit, most of all consumers.  All anyone learned was that they can take more risk than before apparently.  I mean consumer credit is way higher now than 2008.  We'd have seen banks, the Fed, and consumers act more prudently today if shit actually blew up. The short term pain may have been worse, but the long term effects of bailing them out have and will cause significantly more damage...and this one doesn't really have a fix unless you want to dig a deeper hole.\n\nWe need Glass-Steagall (actually enforced in its original form).  \nWe need higher reserve requirements.  \nWe need the Fed to focus only on maintaining the money supply, ie keeping it the same.  They should only be printing to maintain the amount of currency that has been lost/destroyed.  I don't know why controlling the unemployment rate became some responsibility for them.  They don't fucking hire anyone and have no first person insight into labor markets other than these massively aggregated data sets that certainly shouldn't be relied on, much less used to steer the fucking world economy.  None of these fuckers even know what a loaf of bread costs.  Seriously when is the last time JPow went to a grocery store.\nLet interest rates find a market rate.

But here's my answer:\n\nanyone who has a big long exposure to the stock market right now needs to get their view validated by the other components of the financial system. especially treasury yields.\n\nIf you look at treasury yields and stock prices they're pretty much positively correlated. Yields go up, then stocks go up. Yields go down (like in March), then stocks go down.\n\nWhat hedge funds are doing is extremely risky but then again, \"hedge funds\" is just a name and the hedgies are known for doing extremely risky stuff. They're shorting the 30 year bond because they needs 30y yields to go UP to validate their long positions in the equity market. 30y yields going up means that people are welcoming risk again, taking on debt, spending in the economy.\n\nMilton Friedman labeled this the \"interest rate fallacy\". People usually think that low interest rates mean \"easy money\" but it's the opposite. Low interest rates mean that money is really tight and hard to get.\nRising interest rates on the other hand signal an economic recovery, an increase in economic recovery.\n\nSo hedge funds try to fight the Fed - the Fed is buying the 30 year bonds! - to try to validate their stock market positions.\nThey also short VIX futures to do the same thing. Equity bulls don't want to see VIX higher than 15. \nThey're also short the dollar because it would also validate their position: if the economic recovery happens and the global US dollar cycle gets restored then it will be easy to get dollars and the USD will continue to go down.\n\nThen again, they're also fighting against the Fed in this situation because QE and the USD are correlated in my opinion.\n\nAnother Redditor told me that people who shorted Japanese government bonds completely blew up because the Japanese central bank bought the bonds and the \"widow maker trade\" was born:\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/widow-maker.asp\n\nHope this answers your question.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "i think you got it the other way around the hedgies are buying the short term bonds and letting the fed buy the long end of the curve.\nbanks are the ones who are going to cause the crash not the fed\n\nshort end- banks\nlong end - fed\n\noverall causes yields to drop and your stock crash thesis then comes out and everyone makes the money they are supposed to flipping to the fed if necessary on their reduced purchasing schedule (the schedule which is causing the yields to drop from bond purchases)\n\nbasically fed was buying the whole curve but banks told them to fuck off and leave the short term bills hence why you see fed spending more on their qe purchases on 30 year etc compared to lower years where banks pick up the \"slack\"\n\ntldr long bonds (no position too poor 190 or 150 calls)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "How do I know this isn‚Äôt going to be like that sep var kid and you‚Äôre not selling us useless puts?

With the fed injecting so much liquidity into the bond market we see yields get driven down, which is also what your trade is relying on. This in turn makes it significantly easier for cooperations and even individuals to borrow money at much lower rates, as anything and everything that still provides yield becomes more attractive. Theres many institutions and people that need a certain yield, particularly pension funds, and as no significant yield can be found in bonds anymore it causes a rotation into more risky and higher yielding assets, like stocks. Furthermore, because institutions like pension funds have target allocations, as the fed continues buying bonds causing the underlying value to increase, they have to sell off bonds and reinvest the returns somewhere else. There are more factors at play here, and I certainly do not understand even a fraction of them, but from what I understand so far I have to conclude that QE can most definitely cause asset price inflation which in turn cause \"inflation hedge\" assets like gold to rise", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for that.

In ‚Äònormal‚Äô circumstances, neither ‚Äôthe government‚Äô nor the central bank (CB) create new money in the economy. New money is created - out of thin air - by a commercial bank (CMB) when a new loan is issued. The same money is extinguished‚Äô when the loan is repaid.\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, a CMB will not create new loans unless it feels there is a reasonable certainty of the loan being repaid. Plus interest to cover the costs of administering the loan and the CMB‚Äôs profit.So typically, CMBs create lots of new loans when times are good, the economy is expanding and everyone feels prosperous. This process can get overheated, with too many easy loans being issued, which leads to inflation. The central bank controls this by raising interests rates to ‚ÄòDamp things down‚Äô.\n\nSo, in the modern economy, the government and CB do not directly control the creation of new money: they control the RATE of new money creation (or extinguishing) by controlling the INTEREST rate. Governments and CBs cut interest rates when economies are stalling to ‚Äòstimulate‚Äô new CMB loans.\n\nWhat however, if things are now quite desperate and interest rates are near zero? Now we get to QE.\n\nQE is also known as asset purchasing. See here\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing)\n\nThe central bank (in the US the Fed) buys - well it decides what it buys and how much. It could buy tomato paste and pasta, classic cars, fine art, as ridiculous examples but in the case of QE the CB chooses to buy government bonds, sometimes known as Treasuries, (government debt), corporate bonds (company debt), mortgage backed securities (MBS) or - less regularly - stocks themselves.The point here is the CB can buy anything it likes, but usually chooses liquid assets in its own financial jurisdiction. ‚ÄòResponsible‚Äò things.\n\nIn all cases, the HOPE is that the exchange of completely new, out of thin air ‚Äòmoney‚Äò will cause the seller of the asset purchased to spend this new money in the economy, so  ‚Äòstimulating‚Äò it. I.e. the CB is expecting the new money injected to ‚Äòtrickle down‚Äô.\n\nThe PROBLEM arises when the seller of the asset reallocates the ‚Äòmoney‚Äô handed out by the CB in a perverse way: instead of creating new loans, the commercial banks (CMB) pay out a dividend, buy stocks of any kind in any market anywhere in the world, or buy securities of any kind anywhere in the world.  Anything but lend it out. Why? Well, if the situation that caused the CB to start QE is a REALLY bad economy, the CMB will not want to risk lending money that may never be paid back! Things may be so bad no one WANTS to borrow the money at any rate. Either way, the new CB money given to the CMB ends up anywhere but the real economy.\n\nSame sort of thing for all the other CB ‚ÄòQE‚Äô purchases: it ends up inflating assets NOT owned by the majority of the citizenry: high end property, stocks, classic cars, fine art, yachts etc.\n\nThe problem with QE is that it benefits primarily those nearest the spigot. It is welfare for the wealthy.\n\nSo why is it done at all? Because the government of the day refuses to make the very difficult choices or take the actions that should be implemented to put things right. Mostly firing parasitic civil servants or cutting their pensions.\n\nWhy are we not seeing high inflation from Fed and CB money printing: because it is not entering the real economy. Money in the real economy is drying up and the velocity at which it ‚Äòflows‚Äò is dramatically down. What we have now is stagflation.\n\nWe never fixed the problems that caused the GFC of 2008/9. One of which is that the US has been outrageously living beyond its means for decades and has got away with it solely by issuing the worlds reserve currency. ‚ÄòExhorbitant privilege‚Äô.  The US is the ONLY country in the world that does not have to balance its books. The US simply issues more dollars as Treasuries (US government debt) and this is regularly lapped up both domestically and abroad because there is no alternative. Not because the books balance. Nixon abandoned the gold standard in 1971, rather than balance the books\n\nSlowly and cautiously almost with some guilt, each President since has increased the total debt. When nobody seemed to squeal and there were no political repercussions,  they went at it further and more boldly than ever. Now the debt IS a problem: the rest of the world, for the first time, is beginning to seriously doubt the US‚Äôs ability to repay. \n\nThe USD is the basis for over 86% of all international money transfers. Globally, almost everything is priced eventually, in USD.\n\nIt gets worse: we know the figures for US govt and Fed debt. We do not know for sure the level of PRIVATE US debt across the globe.\n\nSummary:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings cannot continue the way they are: we were in trouble before corona and are now in deep shit.

First, a better analogy would be that I (the fed) am going to buy $100 worth of your shitty ass beanie babies because you can't sell them but they'll become valuable someday (sure) and I (the fed) put them in my beanie baby vault.  Then I'm going to give you $100 to go buy pokemon cards with because there is an actual market for that.\n\nThe bank gets $100 of reserves in the bank's account with the federal reserve.  This is not money that just sits there.  The more reserves a bank has the more money a bank can lend out.  So for every $100 more that exists in reserves there is $1000 (or whatever) more money being lent out to the general public.\n\nSo yes, QE absolutely does increase the money supply.\n\nAlso, you point out that all the M2 money is going into savings accounts.  That is because it is M2 you dumbass, it is savings accounts and non-liquid money.  You know what this $3 trillion in savings accounts really is?  It is bailout money going to corporations and people investing in the stock market.  If you throw $3 trillion into the stock market then I don't know what the fuck else you can call it other than inflationary.\n\nYou also miss the fact that M1 has increased by $1 trillion or over 20 fucking percent.  When arguing inflation I think omitting the fact the amount of actual dollars and money in checking accounts has increased by 20 fucking percent is kind of important.\n\nThen you claim that interest payments are creating money out of thin air?  What?  No.  Not at all.  Interest payments come from the people that took out the loan.  That's how money works.  Interest payments have no effect on the money supply except to probably move some money out of M1 and into M2.  They don't create or destroy money.  People paying interest to banks is neither inflationary or deflationary.\n\nThe crash of 2008 wasn't caused by interest payments.  It was caused by banks lending out $1,000 for every $100 of reserves they have and then individuals using that money to buy shitty properties (beanie babies).  Banks couldn't lend any more money (because they didn't have more reserves).  Hence liquidity trap.\n\nThe federal reserve then bought up all their fucking beanie babies and put them in the beanie baby vault and gave the banks more in reserves so they could go lend money again.\n\nYou are right that the banks changed.  The shock of the beanie baby meltdown led them to be too scared to invest in anything [right up until about 2015 when they started to trust again](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS).

June 2020 also was a pretty bad month for stock bulls. \n\nThe actual power of the Fed is highly overestimated. It's still a free market. But in a free market psychology is important. As long as market participants are positive it won't crash. Also market participants are a lot of retail traders nowadays and their effect is amplified by high frequency trading. Retail has it easy to sell and can be desperate for money. \n\nYou're seeing in Japan what happens when the central bank messes around too much in the markets. Nikkei hasn't done anything in the last decades. \n\nBy the way the first QE in the USA happened in 1932. The concept isn't anything new. Bernanke simply copied it from 1932 and the Japanese. Did stocks go up then? No. The government even bought Gold additionally to the Fed buying treasuries. It needed a catastrophic World War to get the economy back on track and overcome the Depression.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Bottom line: My point is that the current QE IS A CATALYST to markets going up, I dont give a shit about the technicalities because the end result is the same...1932 was a whole different ballgame, this scenario is completely different with different forces involved.

It's the psychology behind QE. That effect is amplified by JPow going on live TV and saying those things while they're not true. \n\nThere's no correlation between QE and stock prices going up. March this year, March 2009 - first the Fed announced and did QE and then the markets crashed. The Fed has maneuvered itself into the dilemma that QE doesn't do anything for stocks by design but people think it does so every time they try to reduce their balance sheet the markets will throw a tantrum. \n\nIt's also simple to explain the big rally throughout 2019. Stock buybacks. Nearly every company did them. The biggest buyers of stocks in 2019 were the accompanying corporations and they're insensitive towards the price they're paying for their shares. They don't care which prices they're paying. \n\nYou can overlay the SP500 over the Fed balance sheet yourself on fred.stlouisfed.org and even zoom into certain time frames.

Only few things are mentioned like the apparent readiness of the Fed to let inflation run beyond 2% if it ever gets there. The last words are the key. The Fed itself doesn't have the monetary tools to increase inflation - sources for that are the Federal Reserve Act and the actions the Fed has taken beyond their legal rights granted by the Federal Reserve Act (like buying corporate bonds via SPVs). \n\nPowell isn't stupid, but he's trapped in the paradigm left behind by Bernanke and Greenspan and others. He knows that the Fed itself can't print money. But he sells the QE program as \"printing money\" - while it's just a printing of bank reserves and an exchange of collateral (treasuries and MBS swapped with bank reserves) as I've tried to explain in my post. \n\nA short addition, money needs to be three things: a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. The bank reserves \"printed\" as a result of the QE program fail to fulfill these three characteristics. Those bank reserves can NOT be viewed as a medium of exchange. The banks cannot take those reserves and buy something with them. \n\nPowell already pulled all the levers of monetary policy at once and did even more than that. Then he used a tactic commonly used by central bankers - jawboning. The most popular example is his interview at 60 minutes where he talked about how he flooded the world with dollars (well, as I pointed out in my post, look at emerging market currencies vs the USD - where is the flood?) by printing them digitally. \n\nHis jawboning kinda worked. The stock market is up, NASDAQ and SP500 to record highs. Who cares about small caps anyways?\n\nThe important thing to acknowledge here though is that treasury yields and stocks went up in the beginning of June due to the reopening. Jobs came back due to the reopening. But still the US is sitting at 14+ million continuing jobless claims, 1.1 million initial jobless claims last week and over 20 million people who were protected by PUA (pandemic unemployment assistance). \n\nPowell can't print jobs, he can't print storage for oil barrels and he can't print money if you view money correctly. \n\nHe fired all his shots at once and now he's desperate to do anything so he resorted to \"look if, a BIG IF, inflation will go over 2% we won't raise the Fed funds rate. So PLEASE go out and take loans NOW or you'll regret it when interest rates are higher!\". \nBut then the H.8 data is laughing at him because it only shows the credit market further contracting every week. \n\nI suspect that anyone who expects a significant announcement to happen on Thursday will be greatly disappointed. It will be the usual jawboning. I know that people who said \"the Fed fired all of its bullets\" in March or April have been burnt badly when they bought puts with that reasoning but technically it's true. The Fed doesn't have any ammunition left. \n\nThe only thing left to do is to rewrite the Federal Reserve Act so that the liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet actually become money. That means that US citizens would receive money directly from the Fed. Then the Fed would be in the money printing business. But you'll see Hyperinflation very fast and why should anyone work, take risks or invest into financial assets like stocks and bonds when the Fed can just pay all the bills? The whole money system would collapse. \n\nIf you have some spare time I also recommend listening to Dr. Lacy Hunt speaking about the Fed and inflation on Grant Williams' podcast. \nhttps://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkLnBvZGJlYW4uY29tL3R0bXlnaC9mZWVkLnhtbA&ep=14&episode=dHRteWdoLnBvZGJlYW4uY29tLzMwOTE1Mjg0LTZmOTMtMzg5Yy04NDIwLTVhODJmM2I1MjlkOQ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "So calls eem copy!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well my TLT 171c blew up because I hoped it would try to breach 172 again before going down but then it only went down down down due to the treasury auctions and MSM inflation hype.

If I said \"this while thing will collapse due to a malfunctioning dollar system and huge stress in the financial system\" then I'd be 100% right. But saying \"ok listen here within the next 3 months the market will drop 50%\" there's always a significant non-zero chance of being wrong. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things multiple things need to happen for me to admit that something else will happen. Since this approach is also driven by data, things to look at are treasury yields and the credit market in the US (H.8 data). I don't care about these fake breakouts in treasury yields which happened in June and few weeks ago. The smart money (big banks for example) is in the bond market. If the big banks decide to get rid of all of their treasuries (the often predicted \"bond rout\") I'll stop and think about my point of view. But the spikes in yields needed would be very big. \n\nNext are the balance sheets of banks. If they expand their balance sheets again (issue loans -> create new deposits and therefore new \"money\") the system will go back to working - to some extent. This is the reason for the H.8 data being relevant. If you want to be 100% sure that a debt based economy is recovering you see it in the H.8 data. Consumers need to borrow to consume, businesses need to borrow to invest in their business. \n\nOf course we saw a big increase in loans in March/April but that was because businesses pulled their revolvers (credit lines) just to stay afloat. There wasn't any investment made into the future. Also the PPP loans. The problems just got pushed into the future. And since the virus hasn't disappeared it's still a very uncertain future with more risks to the downside. \n\nThis is the reason why I'm also not concerned about government stimulus provided by running huge fiscal deficits. It's been proven from time to time again that \"stimulus\" is merely a reaction which offsets a deflationary shock only for the deflation to hit harder later. The government can suppress deflation for a while but it does so by borrowing from the future and therefore limiting the possibilities in the future. Just think about this: if you had monthly revenue of 100 bucks and monthly obligations of 80 bucks but now the government increases its deficit and you'll probably pay more taxes in the future to offset that deficit, would you be inclined to take on more debt of your own to expand your business? No, you'd try to lower your expenses to make room for future cash commitments so that you don't go bankrupt in the future thanks to the huge government deficits. \n\nThe reasoning behind fiscal stimulus is that consumers spend and businesses invest so that the private sector gets going again. The real economy is very strongly tied to the financial system so expansion of debt and flow of money are essential for the economy to recover. \nHowever right now consumers are saving, paying down credit cards, millions of them just trying to survive while businesses also just try to survive. No growth, only stagnation at best. \n\nSo again, the government can only push deflation into the future by providing fiscal stimulus, however despite all the media coverage the government can't just flip a switch and get the economy running again. Why? There is no such switch. \n\nBoth consumers and businesses still have the same cash commitments in the future which are limiting their future actions. Due to deferred loans and similar things many people are underestimating how much they'll pay in the future. \n\nThis has already been quite long so I won't write about the global dollar system malfunctioning except for one thing. There's a dollar in the US and a dollar in the rest of the world. The Fed isn't central to the dollar in the rest of the world. Nobody in the Fed really understands how this offshore dollar system (Eurodollar) works. And sadly I have to assume that they don't even care about the Eurodollar system.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "please tell me you've been buying more and more TLT calls", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Cool crash, bro", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Circling back on this. How do you feel about your forecast now? Have any fundamentals changed?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hello there. \nWell, of course I lost some money but I don't feel too bad about the whole thing. \n\nIt was interesting to see the market's reaction to news like the vaccine and Dems winning the Senate. Both stocks and yields spiked, however after the vaccine news both stocks and yields eased temporarily. \n\nIt's clear that a lot of events are just sucked up by Algos. \n\nOf course one might argue \"bonds took a beating\" but I will counter that bond prices are still significantly higher than pre-crisis. So the market has seen an easing from the insanely high deflationary pressures we saw in early 2020 but on the other hand the market doesn't buy into the inflation hysteria and recovery of the real economy at all. \n\nIf you look at the DXY it also fell quite a bit however I advocated for the usage of the trade weighted index calculated by the Fed itself. That index is still pretty high. \n\nAt least for me, fundamentally nothing has changed. We see the actions of traditional banks in the weekly H.8 data. No growth in the credit market (I mean coronavirus crisis has started almost one year ago) while banks love to accumulate government protected securities like MBS and treasuries.\n\nRegarding the actions of shadow banks (the ones which caused all the mania up until 2007), it's hard to look into that system. I can just vaguely assume that nothing has changed there because the Fed refuses to acknowledge that system as an offshore dollar system. The Fed is stubborn regarding its role as a US bank regulator. \n\nIn that regard it was interesting to see what China thinks, mainly Xi Jinping. He repeated his idea of \"quality before quantity\" and made a new 5 year plan which is actually a 15 year plan. Of course there's always interpretation of words included but I think that even Xi himself doesn't believe in infinite growth and globally synchronized growth anymore. \n\nFundamentally it's also important to acknowledge the weakness of stock markets every three months and this has been empirically hinted at many times, up until 2008. I couldn't get behind the true reason for this seasonality but the origins of this weakness are of historical nature (farmers leaving the big cities and coming back after a few months, taking their money with them). It's easy to see this in the SPY chart. \n\nSpeaking of the SPY chart, if you look at March/June/September/December violent moves downwards aren't unusual, it's actually the opposite, they became the norm. We just focus on March 2020 because SPY went all the way down in that month. But pretty big drops happened in June 2020, September 2020, August 2019 (repo market crisis), May 2019, December 2018 (trade war? As you can see with coronavirus, money markets don't really care about these things, they only care about the money), October 2018, March 2018, February 2018.\nOn the other hand the best months to be long (hypothetically) would be the months after the quarter ends. January, April, July and October. \nFunnily a friend of mine asked me in the end of December whether he should sell some of his stocks like Nio but I said to hold because January will probably be great for stocks even though I have a bearish bias. Well until now I'm right. \n\nWhy are the moves so violent? One hypothesis which I agree with is that active value investors are getting crowded out by passive investors. \nActive investors have always set an outside spread for assets. They're the people who say \"ok if SPY drops 20% I will buy as much as I can because the fundamentals will be good then\".\nHowever as more and more people are flocking to passive investing via index funds the market has shifted. In normal times the constant and price-insensitive buying via index funds has propped up prices but in times of crisis the money inflows can't keep up with the selling pressure in those times.\nIf we compare 2020 to 2008 we see that after Lehman Brothers failed the drop in SPY wasn't even as severe as it was in March 2020 (where nothing - on the surface at least - failed). You would have thought that the world was doomed in 2008 but the stock market reacted way harder in March 2020.\nYou can draw your own conclusions from this. For me it's both the sign of a sick system and how passive investing has been undermining the mechanics of a true market for decades now.\n\nWell that's enough for now.\n\nTake care!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Man, that was a long book that I didn't read\n\nSPY 325c 8/3", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "How do you word salad so much but understand basic social science so little.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Something tells me you're not a golfer", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The Fed and domestic funds are the biggest buyers of US treasury.
