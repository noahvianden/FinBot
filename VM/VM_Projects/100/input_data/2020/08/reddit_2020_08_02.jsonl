If that is more than you are able to put into an account right away, you can look at opening an account with a brokerage firm like Vanguard or Fidelity. I use Fidelity, and there is no minimum amount to start an account.\n\nEssentially, when you put money into a Roth IRA, you do not receive a tax deduction in the years that you contribute to it, like you would with a traditional IRA. The benefit comes in your later years (once you turn 59 1/2). Any and all gains that you have in your Roth, as you withdraw them in retirement, will be completely tax free! That is why many people will contribute as much as they can to their Roth IRA’s before contributing to any other type of investment accounts.\n\nAs to your question about being a contractor, the only relevance, I believe, is that you make at least $6,000 in the year, to be allowed to contribute the maximum to a Roth account (which is $6,000). And to your question about adding more to your Roth, there should be an option to transfer funds from a regular bank checking account to your Roth IRA once it’s opened. With Fidelity, I have my bank account linked to my Roth IRA, and I am able to transfer the money at any time. It usually takes a day or two to register in my account.\n\nNow, another important thing to consider with a Roth (or a traditional) IRA is that there can be penalties for withdrawing money from those accounts earlier than necessary (unless the withdrawals meet certain criteria, which you can look up more about). This might explain what the Bank of America Roth options mean by not being able to take/add. I can’t see why they would prevent you from adding funds, but I could see why some might prevent you from withdrawing (to help you avoid penalties for early withdrawal).\n\nHope this helps! If you’re interested in learning more, there are a lot of great videos on Youtube, and also good articles. \n\nIf you do decide to open a Roth IRA and aren’t interested in actively managing your trades; there are a variety of choices to invest in that diversify for you without you having to do the choosing of the stocks! There are ETF’s (exchange-traded funds) and index funds that capture different aspects of the market and take your investment dollars and spread them over a bunch of different companies. As I move forward, I’ll be looking into a few different index funds mainly for my Roth IRA. I am interested in the market, but I don’t think I will have enough time in the future to really research enough companies to be able to hand pick them. So that’s why I’m leaning more towards index funds or ETF’s. \n\nAnyways, this was quite a bit of writing, but I hope it helped. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!

If you make 100,000 a year and max out your 401k, your taxable income drops from 100k a year to 81k reducing your tax bill for the current year.

This is a great question, retirement accounts (and finance in general) are finicky things. I know someone posted a long answer that probably got you what you needed, but just in case here's an ELI5 (sorry, it's a little long but I'll out the TL;DR at the top)\n\nTL;DR  Roth means you pay taxes now on anything you put in, but don't pay any taxes when you pull out the money in retirement. (Yada yada yada, caveats and stuff)\n\nFirst, What are retirement accounts? They let you save money that you can use when you get old enough (currently at least 59 and a half). Because you have to wait to use them, they come with special benefits (but you lose them and get penalized if you break the rules by pulling the money out too early).\n\nWhat are these special benefits? In short Taxes. There are two general kinds of retirement accounts, normal and Roth. Normal let's you put in money before you pay any taxes on it (but you have to pay taxes when you take them out) and Roth which let's you pay taxes on the money now (but you get to take all the money out tax free)\n\nLet's take an example. You said your 29, so let's pretend you're retiring in 30 years, and let's say you make 50k per year (close to the us median, the principal applies regardless nof income, with a caveat I'll explain below). Also we'll call your total tax rate 20%.\n\nSay you had $1000 that you wanted to put towards retirement, you could put it in a normal retirement account which would mean that instead of paying taxes on 50k this year, you would you could deduct that from your taxes and only have to pay taxes on 49k, essentially saving you $200 (woo!) But you would have to pay taxes on the gains when you pull it out at 59 and a half (boo)\n\nInstead, you could put it into a Roth, that means you pay the taxes upfront, $200 in our case (boo). But would not have to pay any taxes when you pull it out (woo!)\n\nSo why do people make such a big deal about them. Let's say over 30 years that 1,000 grows to 10,000 (major woo!). If you had a normal retirement account you would have to pay taxes on the full 10k when you pulled it out (call it $2,000). In the Roth you wouldn't have to pay taxes on any of the $10,000.\n\nSo why would you ever not do a Roth? This is kind of complex but in general the overall goal is maximize your money by minimizing your taxes. Typically the more you make now and the older you are the more likely it's better for you to do a normal retirement account rather than a Roth and vice versa (younger and less money means Roth is better). If you want I can give more specific examples of this.\n\n(Money caveat mentioned above) Roth's have an income restriction on them, I would need to Google the specifics but essentially if you make something like more than 140k as a single person or 200k married, you can't do Roths.\n\nHope this helps, happy to answer any other questions.

If you have a feeling something is undervalued, or about to go up, invest in it. It sounds like you have a good knack for this. Some people might think that seems superstitious, but I really feel that some market trends can be predicted just by being aware of what's going on in the world and following trends.  \nFor example, I invested a substantial amount in Amazon when it was about $300 a share in 2013. Why did I do this? Because I liked Amazon, knew that online shopping was the future, and felt that everything would eventually move that direction. I don't need to tell you how that's worked out for me now along with my picks in Google, Tesla, Netflix, and Apple (all for similar reasons).\n2. Be prepared to lose every trade you make.  If you can honestly say that you'll be ok if you never see your precious <INSERT TRADE AMOUNT HERE> dollars again, then you should be good to trade. If you feel that a trade is going to bankrupt you or take every dollar you made, then you probably don't have enough savings. Luckily, you are 15 so your risk of losing your housing is relatively low. Take this time to both aggressively save AND invest.\n3. You are the most valuable investment you can make. Anyone can put money in the market and watch it grow. But how much money you are able to invest depends a lot on your wage and income. You could have the world's greatest trade picks but if you have no money to invest, it won't matter. Work hard in school and at work. Always be networking.

{"title": "The rare TRIPLE EARNINGS PLAY - $1k > $10k this week guaranteed", "selftext": "Once in a lifetime, when the stars align correctly, there comes an opportunity for what some have called \"The Retards Solar Eclipse\". What am I referring to? The rare TRIPLE EARNINGS WEEK. Ladies and gentlemen, let me show you a guaranteed $1k>$10k play this week that as safe as going all in with deuce seven off suite. \n\nThis week, there are three earnings plays that I believe will all crush. Disagree? Fine I dont care. But dont downvote me until I'm red you retards. Until then follow me to Valhalla. \n\nI will be starting with $1k slightly OTM calls. Going all on Chegg calls first thing in the morning. Chegg will run up all day, then destroy earnings just like they have the past two times because any retard can see this is the perfect scenario for them.\n\nThe next day, I will be taking my gains (probably about 2.3k)  and putting it in UPWK calls slightly OTM. They went off this past eanings and will continue to. With everything moving to work from home and so many unemployed, their platform will flourish and they are still way off of their ATH. \n\nFinally, Wednesday I will put my now 5k of gains into WIX. Wix will destroy just like they did last time, because their platform is fantastic and easy for retards like you and me. They have been growing and with more businesses seeing the need for online platforms, they will go to the moon. This will leave me Friday with about 10k of gains on the rare triple earnings play.\n\n\nOnce I get this right and call my shot, I would like my flair to be \"The Babe Ruth of WSB\". \n\nThank you and enjoy the tendies.\n\nEdit 1: so it appears the run up was obviously pricing in great earnings. Lol. Gonna be tough for CHEGG (and UPWK for that matter) to go up after ER after such hard run ups. With that being said, I got in early enough on Chegg that even if it goes red this morning, I'll probably still just about break even because it gained so much yesterday. Whatever I have left I'll be pumping right into UPWK. I'll be selling pretty early this morning to change positions, as I do expect UPWK to have an early pump that I want to catch.\n\nEdit 2: I sold my Chegg position for only a 35% loss this morning and then immediately bought $640 worth of UPWK $17c for 8/21. So I'm behind but I can still make it up with a huge beat from Upwork lol. Obviously with these run ups, if I was playing with big money, i would for sure be pulling out EOD. But YOLO here we go with attempt #2 on UPWK!", "id": "i23b2k", "created_utc": 1596329443.0, "score": 476, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 280, "comments": [{"body": "So basically, you're gonna get calls on all the hyped remote work or school tech.

{"title": "$3M from PRPL and Has It Memed Yet?", "selftext": "Well, I've officially made my first, second, and third million from PRPL (I called it [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/) two months ago).   My net liquidity in PRPL as of Friday close is $2,622,131,72.   That, along with the $380k I've taken out, I'm at just over $3M.   At this point, when you take into account all the stupid moves I made when I first found this sub, I'm now playing with house money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Has PRPL Memed Yet?\n\nNo.   It hasn't.   Not yet.\n\nI'm kind of getting tired of answering this in PMs, so please don't ask me if it is too late to invest.   This hasn't memed and I believe we will be in the $25-27 range easily after earnings just by fundamentals alone (assuming the previous low visibility on the stock).   As visibility increases, I think the valuation multiple increases, and not past fundamentals.   We will see higher if this becomes a no longer under-the-radar stock.\n\nThis isn't a meme yet, and it is no where close.\n\nHow do we know?   Let's look at the ultimate source of truth on the subject:  [Robintrack](https://robintrack.net/symbol/PRPL).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzr2qdg4kne51.png?width=1889&format=png&auto=webp&s=46997d3050986a77c318c7c9e17ceb39cf8b7f91\n\nAs you can see, we've seen a significant influx of Robinhood tards in the last few days, but this isn't memeing, yet.\n\nIf you check the [Robintrack popularity changes](https://robintrack.net/popularity_changes?hoursAgo=168) over the last week, PRPL comes in at #113 most popular in terms of user growth.    That isn't very high at all.   It's surrounded by other stocks you've never heard of.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2376iielne51.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ea7b7afb1b7de17dd2f36d4bde3f5f17c0ebf5d\n\nThis is hardly meme worthy yet.   Compare this to KODK:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u62x1fgdmne51.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b16c21e2b56c23818b6a48c97ee0410c12047a\n\nWe should also compare PRPL to two recents meme stocks:  SPCE and DKNG.   As a side note, all three of these stocks came from SPACs BTW, hence the warrants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ne6lwwnvpne51.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97dba747dc51ec779ef8a8a5640f72257313798\n\nSPCE shot up to about 92,000 Robintards very quickly, which drove the price up.   When the rate of Robintard increases declined and flattened out, the stock dropped.   There are now 150k Robintards holding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xndxysxpne51.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4db5e52718775e5b30ffe74d59784f34395600c\n\nDKNG shot up to about 100,000 Robintards investing on the meme run up, and still has about 120k still in.  The meme drop off is less pronounced on DKNG because, unlike SPCE, they have this thing called \"Revenue\".\n\nKODK, SPCE, and DKNG all had run ups to about 100k Robintards driving the meme up in price way over fundamentals.   PRPL only has 6,600 Robintards, and the current price is fully supported by fundamentals (see some of my previous posts and u/dhsmatt2's previous posts if you want support on that statement).\n\nSo, no, it isn't a meme.   Keep tabs on this though as Robintard entry could definitely cause this to meme up (and we may very well be in the early stages of this right now).   Buy calls now and sell when we start getting close to 100k Robintards.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nI think u/dhsmatt2 did a pretty good job [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/?sort=new).   My only two comments are:  1)  I think his revenue estimate is low (mine:  $244m, his $225M), and 2)  the warrant liability accrual won't be recurring at the same level (we will see one big bang this quarter and then a wimper going forward until the warrants are gone--so his forward EPS estimate should be higher on his math).\n\nMy revenue estimates:\n\n||Q2 Total|June|May|April|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)|*205.0*|*80.0*|**71.0**|**54.0**|\n|Wholesale Partner|*39.0*|*19.0*|**17.3**|*2.7*|\n||||||\n|Total|*244.0 M*|*99.0*|**88.3**|*56.7*|\n\nThe bold numbers are known for sure as they were disclosed.   The italicized are my estimates.\n\nI'm putting June DTC as an acceleration over May because of the following:\n\n1. The website still showed significant delays in delivery, which means they were still selling every mattress they make.\n2. Extra manufacturing capacity came online at the beginning of June.\n3. Purple discontinued its lower end models, which would cause a mix shift up in revenue per unit when selling at capacity.\n\nI may be underestimating this as well.\n\nI placed wholesale where it was at because it is still recovering and Joe Megibow [said in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&feature=youtu.be) that they were almost flat of wholesale year over year at this point.\n\n# Valuations\n\nI'm copying this [from a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hig038/i_bought_six_prpl_mattresses_today_you_should_buy/), even though the data is slightly dated now after TPX and SNBR had their releases.\n\n**Enterprice Value / Revenue**\n\n|Ticker|As of 6/28/20|2020 Q1|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PRPL|2.01|2.52|3.94|3.61|3.73|3.09|\n|TPX|1.71|4.84|7.39|7.34|8.07|6.88|\n|SNBR|0.98|2.36|4.40|3.79|4.97|3.78|\n|CSPR|0.53|0.91|||||\n\nBased upon the chart, I don't see a 2x multiple on revenue as unreasonable at all for PRPL, and arguably, it should be higher due to the acceleration in growth rate.\n\nThe Q2 revenue pattern will continue into Q3 and beyond (they are still backed up on delivery on several products).   Additionally, they will be bringing substantial capacity online in the next year to support sales.   I see PRPL producing $800M-$1,200M in revenue over the next year as we see continued capacity growth, shift into higher end mattresses, and continued expansion on both DTC and wholesale doors.\n\nClearly, it is easy to justify the $1.32B valuation as of close Friday, and arguably, much higher.\n\n# Positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kza0j31utne51.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb053f5300205be309cdf19b4fbc23a7a6df276\n\nA bunch of warrants and call debit spreads.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nI don't have any recommendations.   Go talk to your investment advisor as this isn't investment advice.   What am I looking at right now?   Debit spreads.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hv4gez1une51.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8bdb7c9ecd0ae6730e95732434687b2ecc56a11\n\nIf you took the ask, you can pick up a 20/22.5c debit spread for only $1.70.   It pays out $2.50 as long as the stock stays above $22.50 after earnings (likelihood is extremely high as the stock is currently at $24.37).\n\nFor those of you who are asking what to do or wondering if it is too late to make money:   that is an example conservative position to take even if you think the stock will be flat from here on out till earnings (it won't be).\n\nMy bet is that it continues to grow each day on a run up.   I'll be watching Robintrack very closely on the run up.    My plan is to hold through earnings, unless we meme up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PRPL GANG FTW!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# EDIT:\n\nI've gotten several PMs worried about call premiums and IV crush.\n\nBuy PRPLW warrants if you are concerned.  The warrants closed at $6.52.  The stock closed at $24.37.   That means the warrants have $6.435 in intrinsic value.   THERE'S 8.5 CENTS OF THETA ON THOSE.\n\nYes, we will see a callback on the warrants as the stock stays above $24, but that won't happen until AFTER the stock stays above $24 for 20/30 consecutive trading days AND the 30-day notice expires.    \n\nYou are doing it to play earnings anyways.

Stock goes down to $20, I lose $18,000.\n\nScenario B: I buy $100,000 PRPL 8/21 $25 C. They cost $2.75 a piece. I own $360 calls. If PRPL goes to $27.50, I break even. Each call is worth the $2.75 I paid for it (depending how far out you are, you'll get some theta). If stock goes is below $25, I lose it all. Of course, if stock goes to $30, I just about double up.\n\nScenario C: Hybrid approach. I buy $100,000 8/21 17.50 C. They cost $7.20 a piece. Mind you, PRPL closed at $24.37. So the break even on these options is only $24.70. I own 138 of these contracts with my $100,000. PRPL goes to $25, I make $4,000. PRPL goes to $27.50, I make $38,640 (much better than the straight stock purchase). PRPL goes to $30, and I make $72,500, which isn't too far off buying the $25 C. \n\nThis is why the deep ITM calls are conservative. If PRPL goes to $20, I still have $34,500 of value left. If PRPL goes to $23, I still have $76k. With Scenario B, I would have a total loss of capital.
