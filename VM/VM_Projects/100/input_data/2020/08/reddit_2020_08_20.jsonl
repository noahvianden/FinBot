{"title": "Butterflies: Great Gains in Low Risk", "selftext": "\nButterflies are a great way to play some more expensive stocks for cheaper! 1950/2000/2050 strikes, bought on Monday for Friday expiration! Max gains of ~5k if TSLA closes at 1999 tomorrow. Had two, sold one today to lock in profits and cover this second one.\n\nThey consist of:\n\n1 long upper strike, 2 middle short strikes, and 1 long lower strike.\n\nYou can view them as a debit spread and credit spread combined. The bulk of the profits come from the lower strike, but as long as the stock is traveling in the right direction you’ll be profitable. Once the lower leg is in the money is when the $$$ really comes. They’re a pretty cheap way to play with huge upside.\n\nHere is my TSLA from this week. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mFkbF2D.jpg\n\nPosition:\n\n1 BTO $1950c 8/21\n\n2 STO $2000c 8/21\n\n1 BTO $2050c 8/21\n\nNow, while they can be used as “YOLOs,” I advise against that. They’re great when combined with company fundamentals, TA, and momentum/big news (TSLA split).\n\nThis is just a small little FYI because it wasn’t until a few weeks ago that I learned about butterflies and have been using them ever since with great success! Happy to answer any questions\n\nAlso: if you ever do play one of these, always close all the legs at the same time otherwise you are opening yourself to a lot of liability", "id": "idkyry", "created_utc": 1597964408.0, "score": 372, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 186, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 209, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit let me write this down", "score": 98, "replies": [{"body": "Here's another. \n\n> buy high, sell low\n\n...

{"title": "Forbes: U.S. Stock Market Hits Record 77% Overvalued", "selftext": "[U.S. Stock Market Hits Record 77% Overvalued](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2020/08/18/us-stock-market-hits-record-77-overvalued/amp/)\n\nSome extracts:\n\nAccording to the popular *market cap to GDP ratio*, the U.S. stock market, collectively, is about 77.0% overvalued. Despite the worst economic backdrop since the Great Depression, stocks have held up reasonably well since the March 23 bottom. While it’s true that the stock market has disconnected from the underlying economy, it has also done so in the past. With such an extreme level of overvaluation, it does beg the question, “Are we witnessing the formation of another bubble?”\n\n**Stock Valuation-How it Works**\n\nOne of the more popular methods used to determine if U.S. stocks are undervalued or overvalued is the *market cap to GDP ratio*. This ratio compares the total market cap of all U.S. publicly traded stocks with GDP. More specifically, it calculates the total value of the outstanding shares of all U.S. domiciled, publicly traded companies (the numerator), and divides that number by total GDP. For example, if total market cap was $20 trillion and GDP was the same, stocks would be considered fairly valued (eg; $20 trillion / $20 trillion = 1 {ie; 100%}). During this pandemic, GDP has fallen while stocks (and market cap) have risen, creating the highest level of overvaluation since the ratio began in January 1971. This is another way of saying that stocks are extremely overbought.\n\nIt’s important to note that stocks can remain overvalued for an extended period. However, at some point, stocks will fall (or GDP will rise), and the ratio will decline. While there is no way to be absolutely certain when this will occur, the ratio does offer insight.\n\nCurrently, the degree of overvaluation is around 77.6% (177.6% – 100% = 77.6%). The previous record high was 49.3% on January 26, 2018. Prior to that, the highest reading was 49.0% overvalued in March 2000, just as the Tech Bubble burst.\n\nWhy was the ratio so low during the 1980s when stocks soared? Although stocks rose mightily during the decade, GDP was strong, which kept valuations from rising too much. Plus, when Reagan took office, stocks were more than 50% *undervalued*. While getting inflation down to a manageable level, Reagan began to deregulate various industries and embarked on a series of tax cuts, all of which created a boom period for the economy and the stock market.\n\n**What About Today?**\n\nA cursory glance at the far right of the chart will reveal a massive 32.9% drop in GDP (bottom graph) and a rising stock market (middle graph). The combination of the two have created the record overvaluation. Though we know the economy is improving, we do not know if the improvement will be enough to bring the ratio down to a more comfortable level.\n\nThere are other factors contributing to the record overvaluation. Very few investment categories offer a good alternative to the stock market. Cash is paying next to nothing and bond yields are at historic lows. You could invest in gold and silver and some high-flying tech stocks but buying these after such an increase could prove risky. With a lack of alternatives, you might say stocks are the only game in town. Moreover, suppressing interest rates helps to “steer” investors into stocks – a technique known as financial repression. Financial repression was first used by smaller, emerging economies when its debt became elevated. When an abundance of money flows into stocks, it tends to push stock prices higher, which in turn makes investors *feel* wealthier. This is known as the “wealth effect.” Low interest rates also make it easier to repay debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?", "id": "id93jx", "created_utc": 1597925489.0, "score": 857, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "This metric has big flaws.

For simplicity, I'll use round numbers instead of Apple's actual stock prices at the time.\n\nLet's say that Apple had traded for $700 per share at the market's close on June 8, the day before the split went into effect. For investors who already owned Apple stock and who held through at least June 9, the process was pretty straightforward. For every share of Apple they had in their brokerage account on June 8, which was worth $700, six more shares of Apple appeared in their brokerage account before trading began on June 9. Each of the seven shares was worth $100 immediately after the split went into effect.\n\nHere's where the corporate accounting concept of a record date comes in.

I only buy stocks and hold.\n\n[Here are my percent gains](https://imgur.com/R5Ryk0Y). Certainly nothing to brag about! But it's a good visualization of how diversifying is actually bringing down my gains from TSLA. \n\nThe question you have to ask is if your money could do better elsewhere. If so, jump on that.\n\nARKK is actively managed, they eke out more green days than red. It's filled with stocks like TSLA that are ready to break out. I think it's important to hold some ARKK in case it breaks out, and I don't have the time or interest to research everything in their portfolio. Cathie seems like a goddamn genius and I trust her decisions. I'm only 15% ARKK, the rest TSLA.\n\nMy mentor (a retired stock broker of 40+ years) says a rotation is happening/about to happen from tech sectors to recovery sectors. He mentioned airlines, since they are cheap right now, and will likely come back. I think it's a sure bet, but it will take too much time for too little reward. TSLA could 3x-6x by the time the airlines reach pre-pandemic levels. I dunno.\n\nWarren Buffett only invests in what he understands. I think you are doing that, and it's a good thing. He also prepares for more than one disaster hitting at a time, though. I'm not sure how you can reduce risk like that without sacrificing at least some profitability.\n\nThe challenge for me is how much cash to hold, especially as the stock price increases.

I think ARKK is def. a good deal, better than QQQ and SPY as it is more innovate and disruptive to the industries. \n  \nAnd interesting insight on the rotation out of tech sector to services sector. i can def see that happening but im just more comfortable with putting my money in tech regardless of rotations. I thikn my move is pretty risky in that TSLA fails, i lose all my money but im willing to bet they outperform and stay relevant. I apoglogize if my financial thoughts aren't the most analytical as I'm not a very good businessman but i know a good company when i see one. \n\nand on ur last question: i think buying each week is an awesome idea. On dips, just buy more. I'm just doing a mix of lump sum and DCA. Aggressive DCA i suppose; split my purchases in different days all within a week. Lump sum wins like 60% of the time according to this Vanguard article i read.

I would buy more if the longer term story is still intact. \n\n- your dissatisfaction with the stock price is directly proportional to how frequently you check the price. so you can be happier if you just let go and let TSLA do its thing and let it run for 10 years, rather than checking it obsessively every 5 minutes. \n\n- here’s a good story: \n\n“Ken is a sharp-tongued New York investor who tells you exactly what he thinks, good and bad. He runs a small hedge fund in Connecticut. And made a lot of money in the 1980s and 90s riding stocks like Home Depot and Wal-Mart. But his best investment ever wasn’t in stocks…\n\nIn 1999, Ken bought an acrylic painting by Ed Ruscha “Sunset to Pico” for $150,000. His wife thought he was nuts. She pointed out they could have bought a few nice cars with that money. Nonetheless Ken was fond of the painting. \n\nSunset to Pico shows nine parallel lines running diagonally across the canvas, as if seen from a bird’seye view. Below each line is an upside down street name – the nine most recognizable east-west thoroughfares in Los Angeles. Ken hung it in his home and mostly forgot about it. He simply enjoyed having the piece. Fast forward to 2015. He’s older now. He’s thinking he might sell some art and pay off his mortgage.\n\nHe knows the value of the Ruscha painting has gone up over time, but he has no idea how much. He gets Sotheby’s to appraise it. They say they can sell it for $1 million to $1.5 million.\n\nAt the high end of that range, it’s a ten-bagger… Remember, he paid $150,000.\n\nSo Ken decides to put it up for auction. He puts a reserve on it of $850,000. Meaning, he won’t sell it for less than that. Bidding starts at $500,000.\n\nOn the day of the auction, Ken arrives with his wife and daughter. It’s a big event with high expectations… like having a horse in the Kentucky Derby. They settle in and the bidding starts. It doesn’t take long for the bidding to hit $850,000.\n\nKen breathes a sigh of relief. He’s sold the painting. Bidding climbs higher. It hits $1 million. Ken’s ecstatic. He takes a picture of the million-dollar bid. He thinks to himself: “Wow, I’ve sold a painting for a million dollars.”\n\nBut the bidding keeps climbing higher… and higher.\n\nIt hits $1.5 million. Then the bidding stalls. The auctioneer is working the room and ready to hit the gavel, but another bid comes… $1.6 million… and they keep coming. $1.7 million… $1.8 million…\n\nWhen the gavel finally falls, Ken sells his Ruscha for $2.3 million.\n\nEven if you never buy a painting in your life, there’s a lot to learn from this story…\n\nI recommend buying a great asset and forgetting about it.\n\nOne of the first things I said to Ken after he finished his story was: “You’d never ride a stock that long.” \n\nDo you think Ken would’ve been able to hold on to that art piece if he had the price of the painting blinking on his computer screen every day for 16 years?\n\nThere would’ve been times when it soared. There would’ve been times when the price dived. There would’ve been long stretches where it did nothing, or maybe drifted lower. He might’ve sold it out of\nboredom to get something that seemed to be moving.\n\nIf it were a stock, he might’ve sold it after it doubled. Those blinking prices on your computer screen are like little siren calls to action.\n\nThis is why I tell people not to watch stock prices. Otherwise, you’ll surely get scared out of even the best stocks.\n\nI did a study of all the stocks that returned 100-to-1 from 1962 to 2014. The ups and downs of these stocks are incredible.\n\nFrom the time it went public in 1980 through 2012, Apple was a 225-bagger. A $10,000 investment in turned into $2.25 million. But you had to suffer through two 80% declines and several 40%-plus drops. Netflix was a 60-bagger from 2002 to 2014. Yet it lost 25% of its value in a single day on four different occasions. There was also a four-month stretch where it fell 80%.\n\nSometimes it’s not the decline that will cause you to sell, but the sheer boredom of nothing happening…\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has earned a compounded annual return of 20.8% over the past 42 years. But if you bought it in 1997, for example, you had to sit with it for five years before you saw any positive return on the stock. Odds are – if you’re watching stock prices and not paying attention to the business – you’ll probably dump it for something more exciting.\n\nTo enjoy really big, life-altering gains in the stock market, you have to learn to sit on your hands. “\n\nSource: \nhttps://www.valuewalk.com/2016/11/chris-mayer-story/", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "This might be the best response I've read here.

Tesl's \"leading technology\" is leading no more : Tesla's vehicles are getting clobbered , botht ehhigh end by the upcoming Lucid Air, which beats the pants off of Tesla's premier $100,000 plus \"long raange\" model, which gets 125 miles driving range LESS than the Lucid Air (at 527 miles) , and gets bested by a fats charging capability of real world 300 miles per 20 minutes. The Lucid Air is also a massively more attractive vehicle than anything Tesla is putting on the road and the interior is actually luxurious with remarkable reclining rear seats. It aklso has steller performance and a higher top speed than any Tesla. It is the EV that Tesla should have built, rather than the one they sell, which aims for high profits fro Elon Musk. At the lower end, Tesla's vehicles are likewise getting bested by new EVs, XPENG P7 being the most superior to Tesla's snub nosed Model 3. You would think that an auto stock analyst would be aware of the massive competition that has already arrived and the enormous number of EVs that will show up in the next few years, making Tesla's current monopolistic situation a fadingmemory. The Lucid Air's impressive drivetrain technology is 20% more efficinet than Tesla's, and its battery placement allows for far superior passenger comfort. No sane person would ever buy a high dollar Tesla when they can own a Lucid Air. More bad news - Lucid has a protoype SUV in testing and will also build low priced EVs and also pickup trucks.

Neuralink was setup initially to address brain machine interfaces and to gather voluminous amounts of data to understand brain function and assist in recovery of lost functionality due to genetic disease, accident or injury; and ultimately to bridge the gap between man and machine before the advent of AI potentially kills us all.\n\nEvery single company short of Neuralink is interconnected with each other for *off-world application.*\n\nRadiation shielding?

It's his life goal and legacy, and he's wholly committed to that.\n\nStarlink allows for high bandwidth and low latency ISP provision across the entire globe. Tesla's get OTA updates for their vehicles. If you have 12k sats in LEO, you can connect them with tens of millions of Tesla cars, trucks, and Semi, to make a large scale context aware fleet network.

{"title": "Macro DD, since no one has posted the correct take yet.", "selftext": "So, what's the deal with the market? Why does nothing make sense? Why is Jim Cramer losing his mind every day?\n\n\nWell, Jim Cramer is wrong about the market this time. Here's why. \n\n\n**In 2008**, the sky fell because the banks took the hit directly when consumer prosperity faltered. In the legendary video of Cramer losing his mind about the fed policy back in 2007, he gives us a clue about why the situation in 2020 is different. (For the uninitiated, here's a link, turn down sound lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVXh4xM-Ww&t=91s )\n\n\n**What's different now?** This time, the fed is funneling infinite liquidity through the economy to the banks, and to the corporations who were above junk bond rating in March. Back in 2007, the hit went right to the top, but this time, all of the large caps and big banks are being treated as 'too big to fail', so only the small cap stuff, individuals, mom and pop shops, and the rest take the hit. All of this extra money being pumped into the economy through jobless peoples' bank accounts into cash registers, and these 'un-failable' institutions, is playing a game of musical chairs where the *only places* they have left to sit are in rich, still employed, peoples' pockets.\n\n\n**How it used to work pre-corona.** The big guys have, for years, dominated several markets that are walled off from us mortals to get consistent returns, without having to stick their neck out. Namely, the safe municipal bond markets, with their 5-10% returns, which can pretty much only be bought via bloomberg terminal chat, and secondly, corporate bonds. Both of these markets, in addition to treasuries and interest bearing accounts, are completely up in smoke at this point. Cities and towns are broke, and if the fed is having to buy the big corp bonds, what do you think the prospects are on non-prime firms' bonds?\n\n\n**So what's left?** The big guys have all of this fresh liquidity pouring in from JPow's printer, but their old stand-bys are gone.\n\n\n**There are three main routes left** that can still net them the gains they demand: equity in the companies on JPow's list, companies with large holdings by influential VC firms, and property.\n\n\n**1. The too-big-to-fail crowd.** Here's the official list of firms whose paper JPow is eating up: [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalreserve.gov%2Fpublications%2Ffiles%2Fsmccf-transaction-specific-disclosures-8-10-20.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalreserve.gov%2Fpublications%2Ffiles%2Fsmccf-transaction-specific-disclosures-8-10-20.xlsx)\n\n\nEver heard of any of them? lol\n\n\n**2. VC backed firms.** Uber posts $2B losses every quarter and lost its license in its homestate, and is *still* sitting pretty with its massive market cap. I mean, just look at snapchat. These firms with heavy VC investment in them basically have their own little Fed made out of silicon valley billionaires.\n\n\n**3. And finally, the last option for the big guys: property.** We don't want to look at homebuyer sentiment here. You and me know that everyone outside of the while collar crowd and tradesmen are losing their shirts rn. What we want to look at is home *building* sentiment, which is sky high. People with a bunch of cash that they're looking to do something with are the ones who *build* homes, and snatch existing properties with cash, or with secured lines of credit. Back in 2008, everybody was losing their homes, mom and pop landlords were losing their minds, so how did the mess get cleaned up? Per NYTimes: \n> \"Before 2010, institutional landlords didn’t exist in the single-family-rental market; now there are 25 to 30 of them, according to Amherst Capital, a real estate investment firm. From 2007 to 2011, 4.7 million households lost homes to foreclosure, and a million more to short sale. Private-equity firms developed new ways to secure credit, enabling them to leverage their equity and acquire an astonishing number of homes.\" \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/magazine/wall-street-landlords.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/magazine/wall-street-landlords.html)\n\n\nSo what does this mean? Long construction materials producers, suppliers, and whatever else this construction money runs through, like HD, LOW, ANGI, MAS. Look at HD and LOW earnings, they absolutely *crushed* the estimates. Angie's list, even with the jobsites closed for a couple of months saw revenue up, and marketplace growth. Now that coronavirus is somewhat figured out, regarding what people can and can't do to prevent contagion, cities and states will *never* stop issuing building permits like they did during early 2Q.\n\n\nSo to recap, the places to buy are: JPow's list of too big to fail firms, VC held techie firms, and construction/real estate firms.\n\n\n**TLDR:** If you couldn't read all of that, here's the tl;dr of what's going on.

This will be causing more pressure as time goes on in the markets as the need for cash will force some people to start liquidating assets. This will also reduce company cash flow as consumers will have to become more stingy in what they use their money on, driving a decrease in revenue for companies and a reduction in workforce.\n\nThis isn't even considered what would happen if PPP was depleted/ending.\n\nI know we meme and joke about our yolos hoping to get rich. However as a former stockbroker myself, I know some people destroy their life savings in a matter of seconds off of random things they believe on the internet. I am talking to them primarily, as your future livelihood (that you've spent years to accumulate) shouldn't be determined by a contract that expires in weeks/days. \n\nMost of ya'll won't need this reminder (you can yolo to your hearts content), but I am reaching out to those that might make a hasty decision in the heat of the moment that could devastate their financial future.\n\nTLDR: Just a friendly reminder about market conditions and cautioning those that might make a hasty decision that could jeopardize their life savings that they accumulated over the years.

Believing this is an absolutely certain way to remain poor. Why would you ever be successful if you equate success with arrogance?

Here's a little chunk of a previous post I wrote:\n\nI would say, yes, the ARK valuation is more than justified and in fact is probably on the low side. Their bear case was based on a market share decline, that did not happen. They are building three of the near-largest factories that the world has ever seen simultaneously. They are already planning four after those ones. They have, in all likelihood, dry cell battery technology that they're going into production with to make their own batteries -- that means that their manufacturing speed will dramatically increase and their square footage to manufacture will be dramatically reduced compared to all other manufacturers. IOW, they're going to corner the battery market.\n\nWell let's ignore vehicles and just assume that the supposition about battery day is correct -- and it's a reasonable supposition. What percentage of the vehicle battery market can Tesla get? I believe LG's goal was to get to 170GWh of battery production -- in a few YEARS. Tesla will have 1000GWh and fairly soon. And since they're faster to make [since they're dry cell], they'll be cheaper. GM is building a plant with LG to make 30GWh of batteries. That's a joke.\n\nSo forget cars, Tesla would potentially have 80% of the battery market. And that ignores their other business segments. Since all cars sold will be EV's, that's like building car engines for 80% of the cars in the world. Let's say $4k a car for the battery, and there are 60 million units sold worldwide, that's $192 billion gross per year for Tesla. And that's if they never produced another car, never got to self-driving, never sold insurance based on automated metrics that insurance companies cannot compete with, never sold another solar panel.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "lmao", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I'm torn.

{"title": "TSLA red tomorrow as options pushing stock up expire", "selftext": "**Unusual Tesla Option Trades Pushing Stock Higher And Higher\nToday 1:31 PM ET (Benzinga) Print**\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) once again traded sharply higher by 6.2% on Thursday, briefly touching the $2,000 level, despite no major news from the company.\n\nTesla shares are now up 77% in the past year as the company has made a profit in four straight quarters, and some say strange option trading activity could be driving the recent gains.\n\nThe Trades: On Thursday, Tesla’s sharp intraday rise coincided with large trading volume in some significantly out-of-the-money Tesla call options expiring on Friday.\n\n“Actually… someone is buying a LOT of 8/21 $2,100 call options,” GLJ Research founder Gordon Johnson told Benzinga. “This has been going on a LOT (i.e., someone buying way out of the money short-dated call options, which forces the person writing these options to buy stock), which has pushed the stock up consistently.”\n\nOn Thursday morning, there were 55,616 contracts worth of volume in Tesla $2,000 call options expiring Friday and 22,892 contracts worth of volume on Friday $2,100 call options. The $2,000 strike price contracts and the $2,100 contracts have open interests of 14,798 and 5,091, respectively.\n\nUpward Spiral: Stanphyl Capital Partners portfolio manager and Tesla short seller Mark Spiegel has also recently noticed the strange trading activity in the Tesla option market.\n\n“Some entity — I don’t know who — was executing a strategy of buying massive quantities of out-of-the-money call options,” Spiegel said of Tesla’s huge run in 2020.\n\nThis strategy forced call option sellers to buy Tesla shares to cover their positions, according to Spiegel.\n\n“This thing just kind of spiraled its way up,” he said.\n\nTSLA 3100 calls expiring tomorrow bid pic.twitter.com/7Xl2ci3g52\n\n— zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 20, 2020\n\nBenzinga’s Take: There are plenty of explanations for Tesla’s insane run in 2020, including strange option trading, short squeezes, profits from regulatory credit sales, a spike in inexperienced Robinhood retail traders and the stock's inclusion in the S&P 500. However, the ultimate metrics that will define Tesla’s success or failure in the long-term are auto sales and earnings growth.", "id": "idf0js", "created_utc": 1597945485.0, "score": 147, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\"Some entity\" = WSB", "score": 232, "replies": [{"body": "“Spiraled it’s way up”\n\nSpiral entity confirmed", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "It's always spirals\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/gallery/y6mqS\n\nI hope you slept already.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "That’s was really weird", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "So buy calls tomorrow to get jacked to the tits in tendies?

The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.\n\n\nIf you own shares of TSLA before the market open on Aug. 31 you will own five shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fifth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of TSLA trading at $1,500 per share, after the split you will own 500 shares valued at $300 per share. Likewise, if you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.\n\n\nIf you sell TSLA shares after the record date of Aug. 21 for TSLA but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading TSLA, Aug. 28 you sell 100 TSLA shares for a pre-split market price of $1,500 per share you will receive $150,000. You will not receive any split shares.\n\n\nIf you buy TSLA shares after the record dates but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $1,500 per share, you will pay $150,000.

{"title": "Spread the Love", "selftext": "It only takes ten 100% investments to get from $1000 to $1,000,000\n\nI see a lot of people posting calls on here. Calls are the types of posts that do well on this site. WSB is all about %1000 trades, and a %100 trade likely isn't gonna get much attention. Consistent 100% trades will get you rich just the same. A poll from a while back showed that a lot of the users on here have been trading for less than 6 months, and likely don't know much about spreads. I'm also pretty new to this. \n\n\nA 2000c 9/11 costs $14,000. Can't afford a Tesla call? A 2000/2100 9/11 spread costs $4000 and can make you $6000. \n\n\nTake AAPL, what are the odds that apple goes up $5 on any given month? I mean it's not guaranteed of course, but it's pretty fucking likely.\n\nIt currently trades for 469. A 470/475 spread for September 4th costs $205 right now. Plug this spread into optionsprofitcalculator.com, and you'll see that if AAPL is 475 or higher at the end of the day on September 4th, you'll make a 144% profit.\n\n$205 is accessible to just about anyone, and you can always buy more spreads if you can afford to. I get that there is a stock split, and apple will likely go up by more than just $5 by September 4th, but you can do this $5 spread over and over for a ~likely~ 144% gain everytime.\n\nA $475 call for Sept 4 by itself costs about $1200. You could buy 6 spreads with the same amount. %144 of 1200 is $1728. In order to make that same amount of money with a call, AAPL would have to go up by at least $15. The beauty of the spread is that you're only betting AAPL will go up by $5. \n\nAs long as you pick a stock with relatively consistent small growth you can make a killing with lots of trades betting on small swings.\n\n\nTLDR: debit call spreads make more money than you think. Buy AAPL 470c 9/4, sell AAPL 480c 9/4. 144% return (almost) guaranteed. Rinse and repeat just $5 otm. Can double your money every 3 weeks.\n\nEdit: I'm not advocating that you put all of your money in one stock over and over again until you get to $1,000,000. Debit spreads cost less than a call, so small accounts can actually use this strategy to diversify more.

Most of what we do requires basic knowledge of black-scholez (or however you spell it im not gonna google that right now on my phone for reddit upvotes) and 101 statistics, or like honestly just knowing some basic principles like law of large numbers, bankroll management, and expected value.\n\nI can say with certainty as someone who trades options who used to play poker, that poker is much harder than trading options. So if you understand the basic mechanics of the stock market and direction options and nothing else then you have a basis then you got 80% of it down.\n\nBy \"rolling up\" i mean once you get to 50% profitability you move your strikes up higher. What this does is you not only have the chance to make more money but also since you already pocketed that money you reduce your risk (as long as you don't increase the size of your position as it goes up, that's always an idiots way to lose money, dont do that)\n\nSo with Tsla this week as it went up and my spreads achieved 50% profitability before the date of expiration because of how much tsla mooned. So let's say for the sake of simplicity (yes I know the numbers are wrong I'm using easier numbers to explain it better) TSLA started at 1000$ this week and I sold the 970-975 weekly put credit spread. Generally I allocate 50% of my bankroll to options plays and i find that if you do kelly's creterion that means that your looking at positions with a 75%-80% chance of profitability. \n\nSo lets say it mooned to 1010  the next day and I've achieved that 50% mark. I'll move it up to the next 75% chance of profitability spot which let's say in our hypothetical is the 980-985 put credit spread. \n\nWhat this has done is I get 150% if it expires profitabily AND since I didn't increase the amount of spreads, I'm doing I actually decrease my risk because at least I'm pocketing that money I already made and If it starts going bad I have whatever my other profit was plus whatever I salvaged.\n\nIf you are not being a degen with your spreads and you give yourself a nice margin of error then you'll proabably notice that it's not that 1% dip that hurts you, that's fine. What hurts you is the moronic thing that causes a 4-8% dip in a day. Nothing can really protect you from that even having a lower strike price with higher delta (probability of profit) because remember the less credit we get per trade the more money we are risking. So doing those measley 1% return spreads that they boast about on r/thetagang won't protect you from a bad elon musk tweet and instead of losing half the spread you'll lose way more money since you needed more collateral for that hyper low risk play.

So if I'm risking 1-2% of my account per trade (I know, I know this is WSB) then over time using only debit spreads I'm going to statistically result in a net loss due to capping my upside unless I'm rocking an excellent strike rate. Whereas I can risk 1-2% on FDs, be complete shit about hitting direction/timing and manage to lose 9/10 trades but nail one 20 bagger and still be net positive by \\~11% over the course of those 10 trades.

{"title": "Cornering Silver Market", "selftext": "Would you like to entertain yourself with a story about one of the greatest schemes in the history and, maybe, learn a few plays? This story is about three brave autistic brothers, who almost cornered the entire commodity and how one (not so brave, but shrewd) bank did it without anyone noticing. As in any good fable – there’s a moral and a strategy that you could draw from it.\n\nThe year is 1971. Nixon temporarily abolishes gold standard. And every temporary government program is never reversed, as you know. Trading price of gold went sky high: from 270s to 800s in two years or so. Enter Hunt brothers, sons of H. L. Hunt, oil tycoon, one of, if not the, richest man in the world at that time. Hunt family was, what one might describe as, right-wing libertarian and anti-globalist. They believed that Keynesian economics and the US shift to the left in the 60s will lead to the debasement of the US dollar and monetary collapse. Thus, return to the gold or silver standard was the way, as they thought. Allegedly, Hunts also had a feud with Rothschild family and other financial speculators, and were resentful towards the US government for doing nothing to protect their oil assets in Libya, confiscated by Gaddafi. So they started their move against America, alpha-silver bug style.\n\nIn 1973 Hunts began buying all the silver they could. And, instead of just speculating futures contracts, they actually took delivery. Initial price was $1.5/oz. Silver was shipped to Switzerland in secretive and costly operations and stored in vaults (brothers feared confiscations – remember, private citizens were still prohibited from owning gold in the US).\n\nThe following events are quite vivid and include the efforts to create a cartel similar to OPEC, talks with Iran and Saudi monarchs, pump and dump publicity and large scale purchases of miners. But we will spare the details, except one: Hunts even tried to corner the soy market at the same time. Reminds you how WSB slv gang quickly switched to corn gang. But the soy scheme didn't fly and they focused on silver only. Their efforts pumped the price to almost $50/oz by early 1980. At some point Hunts controlled around 230 million oz of silver and the majority of what was traded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hunt brothers laughing at your pump&dump effort](https://preview.redd.it/sywtej0at8i51.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=2df6d38a1c447e4bcd40b99cb71771be688f53c6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, when you are such a smart ass, you become a target. Chicago exchange officials became very concerned citizens by 1979. They started issuing numerous regulations limiting the amount of market share one can accumulate in one hands. As all American concerned citizens, they had financial incentive to do so: Hunts managed to prove that Chicago exchange board members had short positions against silver. Finally, CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) issued a ruling that basically forced Hunts to liquidate part of their portfolio by February 1980. This sent silver prices down dramatically and brothers started to get margin calls which they could not cover. And so their story ended with bankruptcies and heavy fines for the family. Shortly after, Reagan and Volcker raised interest rates and silver price never recovered to $50/oz ever since.\n\nWe skip to the year 2008. Global financial crisis is in full swing. Bear Stearns is royally fucked, as due to all bears. Before the music was over, they mastered paper speculation of futures contracts like no one else. Bear Stearns accumulated world biggest naked short position on silver. What could go wrong? Stonks go up, silver goes down. Until it reversed and silver skyrocketed from $11 to $21. This became one of the margin calls to screw Bear Stearns. JP Morgan is asked by the FED and co. to buy out BS and to save the entire market. Since BS's shorts are now deeply down - JPM gets the whole bank with pennies on a dollar.\n\nBut the problem is that JPM themselves have massive naked short position on silver. Combined with BS it will exceed anything permitted by the CFTC. Since Obama administration was in a rush, they push CFTC to grant JPM basically a carte blanche to accumulate any position over the limit for a period of time. Period of time comes due and turns out that JPM not only didn’t trim the shorts significantly – they even bought more shorts at some point. Even with all the fines, it went very much their way, because in 2009 silver dropped. So they pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBut come 2011 and silver spiked again, dramatically. JPM, now bleeding cash on shorts, could close short positions, like any of us would do, right? Nope, fuckyall says JPM and starts hedging short futures positions with… physical silver. 'But wouldn’t that be even more control over the commodity?' - you might ask. See, nothing in the rules of CFTC says you can’t do that, because to help cronies speculate with paper futures contracts, made of thin air, CFTC basically started treating physical silver and futures as two different instruments (it’s, actually, even more complicated than that: google difference between physical, eligible, registered and so on).\n\nIn the next 9 years JPM becomes the world biggest holder of both short contracts and physical silver. The later they 'loaned' to SLV trust, of which they are custodian. This way upkeep of physical silver, which otherwise would be a liability for hedging, becomes an asset, because we, retards, who own SLV pay the maintenance. People are often confused here, because SLV is issued by Black Rock, not JPM. Well, there is a difference between being an operator of a financial instrument and being a custodian providing backing. Now, to confuse you even more – JPM is one of the major holders of Black Rock itself with 1.6% or sth like that.\n\nBy estimates of Theodore Butler, JPM acquired 900 million oz of physical silver since 2011. That’s 4 times more than what Hunts owned. Just shows you, that banks can get a pass with something that even the richest individuals can not. And you have to give it to JPM - their play was very clever. Instead of risking it all on a margin call, they make money on every turn.\n\nAs of 2020, JPM still holds both shitton of physical silver and short COMEX contracts. You can call this the most epic straddle of all time. With such mass they can swing prices in any directions and profit from this on any given day. Latest example you’ve seen on the August 11th.\n\nWhy am I bothering your poor gambling soul with this wall of text, you might ask? Market makers manipulate the market as they please, what’s new about that? Well, here we come to the conclusions and a strategy. How can a small retard replicate what the big boys are doing?\n\nConclusions:\n\n1. There will not be a linear up or down with silver and the swings might be dramatic. The reason being not only the sentiment of investors, but the ease of manipulation that is eligible to big players.\n2. If we believe that speculation will throw the price of silver in all directions – it is unwise to go only long or short on silver, especially on a short term;\n\nWhat shall we do?\n\na) Only long expiration dates and calls; no weekly expiration, not even monthly. Ideally – at least half year options;\n\nb) Go long on certain silver stocks. Maybe I’ll do a write up on good silver stocks to buy;\n\nc) Sell covered calls on long positions;\n\nd) Buy 1-3 month puts on your long positions as a hedge;\n\nNow, day trade with those positions: on red days sell your puts and buy back covered calls. On green days – reload puts and sell calls. Repeat until lambo.\n\nP. S.: I gathered these facts from the open sources, since these events were of interest to me.

{"title": "All the cool kids are using LEAPS", "selftext": "You might be absolute ass at choosing stocks. You might constantly buy the top and sell the bottom. That's okay- most people do suck at trading. Fortunately, those who trade like shit can use LEAPS to make money without having to worry about buying at the wrong time or try inversing themselves. But what is a LEAPS, and why are the cool kids buying them?\n\n*tl;dr: LEAPS are long-dated calls that can help you leverage yourself without the usual risks of leveraging yourself. Use LEAPS if you are not good at trading.*\n\nPositions: *Long SPY 12/21/2022 $250c for about $9,980.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFor those who actually want to learn something, let's talk about LEAPS.\n\n**Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities**, or LEAPS, are the antithesis of most options plays. LEAPS are call options that do not expire for many months, usually more than a year. Often, certain stocks offer LEAPS that don't expire for 2+ years. These call contracts are very versatile. Here's what they can do for you:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Leveraging yourself to your personal risk tolerance:** LEAPS offer the investor an opportunity to leverage himself into any optionable stock. If a trader wants to take a large position in PRU with the belief that the stock will rise gradually for the next 2 years, then buying shares would be a good way to profit. With a $5,000 portfolio, the investor could buy about 80 shares. Alternatively, the investor could instead buy 5x 1/21/2022 $60 LEAPS for $1,200 each. These LEAPS have a delta of 0.675, so owning 5 LEAPS is the equivalent of owning about 337 shares. With a smaller portfolio, the trader has effectively more than quadrupled his exposure to PRU.\n\n**Stock Replacement:** Similar to the above, the investor can use LEAPS to take positions in contracts that are similar to owning shares, but at a lower cost. If the investor could find a LEAPS with a delta of 1.000, then the call would follow the underlying stock to the penny. However, LEAPS tend to cap out between 0.900 and 0.950. Buying a 0.950 delta is usually close enough to owning shares to satisfy the investor. So rather than spend $5,600 to own 100 shares of AMD, the investor can buy a 1/22/2022 $40 LEAPS for $2,100. That contract has a delta of 0.900, so for $2,100, the trader has effectively purchased 90 shares. This leaves the $5,000 account investor with $2,900 for other plays. Using LEAPS can help diversify one’s portfolio by spreading a smaller amount of capital across many positions.\n\n**Stock Replacement with Leverage:** Big brain time. You can sell deep ITM puts with deltas above 0.900 to take a position virtually identical to if you had bought 90 shares. But in the case of selling puts, you don’t have to spend any money. In fact, you get paid a nice premium for selling ITM put LEAPS, and depending on your broker, you might only need to hold 10% of the collateral in cash. In theory, you could sell a handful of 0.900 delta put LEAPS for a hefty premium, which you can then turn around and use to buy call LEAPS. If you are correct and the stock takes a boat to the moon, you will benefit doubly. The short put LEAPS will lose value causing a gain, and the long call LEAPS will increase in value. Be careful, because you can wreck yourself if you’re wrong about the underlying.\n\n**Speculation:** LEAPS do not have to be ITM. If you thought back in April 2020 that TSLA would fly above $1,000 by sometime before September 2022, you could have bought the 9/21/2022 $1,000 call strike for about $500 at the time. Today, that contract is worth over $120,000. A $6,000 investment into TSLA LEAPS would be worth about $2,400,000 today. And unlike an FD, you don’t have to time the purchase perfectly; you’ve got a few years.\n\n**Poor Man’s Covered Calls:** Poor Man’s Covered Calls (PMCCs) use LEAPS as collateral to write covered calls instead of blocks of 100 shares. It is not my preferred method of trading covered calls (I prefer the wheel), but PMCCs can be very effective in smaller accounts. I am not going to write up on PMCCs here but they're all over the internet.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn other words, buy LEAPS when you want to take a larger position than you can normally afford for your risk tolerance and when you want to get rich slowly instead of getting poor quickly.", "id": "idjt0e", "created_utc": 1597960520.0, "score": 349, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|415|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rt14u3/cash_in_on_pelosi_and_the_chips_and_fabs_acts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rt16lu/cash_in_on_pelosi_and_the_chips_and_fabs_acts/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=idjt0e)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=idjt0e)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Please don't ever tell me about a 500$ leap being worth 120k.
