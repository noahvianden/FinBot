The call has .5 delta and .1 gamma, the put has -.5 delta and .1 gamma.\n\nXYZ moves to $99.\n\nYour call is now worth 10 - (0.5+0.4)/2 = 9.55\n\nYour put is now worth 10 - (-0.5-0.6)/2 = 10.55\n\nYour new delta for the overall position is 0.4 - 0.6 = -0.2\n\nSo you went from delta neutral to delta negative because your put delta is moving toward -1, while your call delta is moving toward 0.  The opposite is true for when the underlying price increases.  Gamma is also curved, so the amount of change in delta decreases as the underlying moves further from the strike price, but for short moves the above works as a decent approximation.\n\nIf you want to see one of the ways the big boys make money, do a search for \"gamma scalping\", which takes advantage of this phenomenon in a very capital intensive way.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Awesome!

Well, no, it reflects the earnings of the companies that are part of the stock market. The vast majority of businesses in America are not publicly traded. They're not in the Dow 30; they're not even in the S&P 500 or the Wilshire 5000. They're privately held companies, so they're not part of it.  \n>  \n>So, if you look at the makeup of the publicly traded companies especially on a market cap basis, which companies are doing the best? Amazon, Netflix, those type of companies. \\[...\\] What's happening today is heavily impacting smaller companies, mom-and-pop type companies. These are the ones that are struggling, and so, since these big companies now have less competition from smaller companies, that benefits the stock market.  \n>  \n>So to say, oh look, the stock market is booming, that means we have a strong economy. We don't. It is the weakness in the economy that is benefiting the stock market, and the weaker the economy gets, the better it's going to be for the stock market. Because what happens when the economy is weak? The Fed prints even more money, we get bigger stimulus. It does nothing for Main Street, it *sedates* Main Street, but it continues to pump air into the stock market bubble.\n\n**TL;DR** Most companies are not listed on any major stock exchange. When you see the S&P 500 up on the year, it's not the economy that's roaring. It's the mega cap FANG stocks, large-cap multinational retailers like Walmart and Target, big pharma, fintech, etc. None of the stock indexes reflect small businesses or even the overall economy.

Since we aren't central planned (for good reason) we handled it worse. But as americans, unlike other developed nations, we value liberty and our rights more than our safety. Now that's an attitude that's changing (I think for the worse, but I understand the counter argument), but half the country at least still feels this way. Also we're fat and old and have a lot of nursing homes. 94% of all covid deaths had 2.6 co-morbities. So only 6% of covid deaths were just healthy people randomly dying of covid. That's a pretty small number when we compare covid to all cause mortalities and things like driving which is a right we'd never give up for safety.

I know, Theta will be a negative number, delta will be positive, but talking sheer size aka distance from 0. If your delta is .2 and theta is .07, that's fine, but delta .2 and theta .45 would be not so great. Any time theta is larger, that means your call is so far OTM for it's expiration date that the stock will have to ride by a minimum amount every day that passes just for the call to break even. Same rule goes for puts. \n\n\n 2) There are literally positions where the Greek profile will change drastically across a straight movement in price of a stock. Given you are asking this question: aside from the delta/theta relationship to watch out for as stated above, I think the best things for someone at your stage of learning to focus on are (a) liquidity (bid/ask spread, open interest/volume)  (b)  Implied Volatitily and (c) break-even points.\n\n\nRarely will it be part of a sound strategy to open an option position with a large difference between the bid and ask prices. Generally, the more an option is being trades, the smaller the \"spread\" will be between the bid and ask price. This is one of the most important aspects that can make a winning play, as you'll be able to enter and exit the position much more easily, and at fairer order fills. \n\n\n\nOne way to look for the strikes with the smallest spreads are to look for high Open Interest and Volume figures.\n\n\n\nRegarding Imp Vol, just make sure that is it seems high (over 35, 40% or so) to make sure the option you're buying isn't experiencing highr than usual premium due to high IV. You could end up losing money even if the stock moves the right direction if volatitily falls and option premiums alone with it.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If it's answered in the thread all nubs can benefit.   😇", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Think he means the accepted value of Greeks with a higher probability of success.

These same industries have been transitioning employees from in-office working conditions to virtual and work-from-home arrangements. Slack killed it in Q1, seeing over 12,000 new customers, $201.7 million total, and 50% revenue growth year-over-year.   \n\nSlack released guidance during their Q1 call, expecting total revenue of $206 million to $209 million, representing year-over-year growth of 42% to 44%, respectively.  \n\nMore importantly, Slack is growing away from just IRC and into corporate directory business. On July 8th, Slack announced that it is acquiring Rimeto, a startup that provides customers with more detailed employee directories and profiles. Additionally, Slack is adding several hundred employees to its workforce, with over 100 career openings as of the writing of this post.  \n\nNow, let's get to the stonks.  \n\nSlack announced earnings for September 8th, which is 5 business days from now. Investors expect a run-up, as we finally broke through the trading wedge on August 25th: (https://imgur.com/jWmDSgl). Slack saw weak movement from July 31st through August 25th, clocking an aggregate 3.3% loss down to $28. However, since August 25th, Slack is up 12% to $32.\n\nDuring Q1's earning run-up for the same 5-day run-up period from May 28th to June 3rd we saw a 22% increase in the stock price, from $32.5 to $39. We have already seen a 12% run-up since August 25th, with more room to go. Based on trend forecasts, we could see a run-up to $38.90 again, just like last earnings season.  \n\nGoing forward, Slack has a LOT of potential as the go-to IRC-style chatroom, with room to innovate in the work-from-home world.

Teams is also significantly worse to use. My coworkers constantly have their laptops freeze while using the video calling and have to turn off incoming video or restart the program for it to work. The chat rooms are a mess with terrible organization and it’s hard to discover new groups.\n\nFeel free to assume Microsoft will win every battle.

Microsoft Teams always shows large gains for the same keywords, one spike during the lockdowns and then another beginning in summer and continuing to now.\n\nOne exception as you can see is \"Slack login\", which has seen a large and consistent steady growth. \n\nI think what you could interpret this as people all installed Slack in April, or that there has been a steady-state amount of new people installing Slack, but that active users have continued to accumulate (as evidenced by more people googling for the login). So that does point to user growth even if trends results for \"download\" don't suggest much. Basically a steady state level of new people are downloading (flat line for \"download slack\"), and then that adds to the total number of users googling \"login\" over time. So people are sticking with it.\n\nSo could this be bullish for Slack stickiness in orgs and people possibly upgrading to the paid models as they accumulate a message history/user base etc.?

I’m thinking that by Q2 2021, when forbearance ends, it will be extended another 6-12 months to avoid evicting Americans en masse when 1.) the pandemic will probably still be ongoing, 2.) the jobs lost from the evisceration of small businesses will not have returned to give these people a chance to gain new income. \n\nIf forbearance extension doesn’t will occur, I can see homeowners taking out reverse mortgages. They begin losing equity in their homes, effectively selling it back to the bank one month at a time. Then, once the reverse mortgage runs out, they begin renting their former home from the bank (through social security for older boomers; and by which time jobs will have returned for non-boomers who had to resort to a reverse mortgage).", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, I really appreciate the compliment :)\n\nAs far as what will happen with residential housing, I have a few ideas.\n\nFirst, the cities with insanely inflated prices are going to drop, and those will be a mess. The suburbs though... those will likely be fine.\n\nThe key to understanding what will happen with all of this non-payment that will be going on for a long time, is to ignore the clamor in the news and understand: the US government will not let more than 10% of people get evicted from their homes. They simply can't. Once you get up to around 30m people unemployed, homeless, hungry people roaming the streets, you reach the 'critical mass' of when bad stuff happens, and it becomes real to everyone, and the economy/society/etc. tank because of consumer sentiment and the rest. (The same goes for corona-- once everyone knows someone who dies, the tone will change.)\n\nSo, since they are rational actors, with the ability to do a lot of crazy things, they will do some of those things, and they'll keep trying stuff until the problem is fixed.\n\nIf you look at Texas, the Republican government down there has been implementing a plan that focuses on bailing out the landlords, in hopes that they'll stop evictions, and solve the problem long-term for the unemployed tenets. This plan is failing less than the 'do nothing' plan, but it's not much better. But it is important to note that this will be the main thrust of whatever plan that gets implemented in the long term.\n\nIn places like Massachusetts, the landlords are getting nothing, and evictions are forbidden. Now, this plan \\_can\\_ work, and we could see a greater shift toward asset management company ownership of housing, like we saw after the Great Recession, however, this crisis is likely to be larger than the Great Recession's housing crisis.\n\nSo, since this calamity is truly massive, what will likely happen is a moritorium on evictions that will creep through the states from most liberal to most conservative. Now, if you look at the Fed Balance sheet, the fed never stopped holding the absolutely massive mountain of mortgage backed security debt that it started piling up, so the next move greatly depends on how these large landlords have financed their properties, and how they operate as investment units. I'd imagine they'll get some sort of bailout, though I'm not sure quite what it will be, but, we can assume it will prevent these large asset management companies from losing all of their properties to the banks.\n\nAt the end of the day, we're still going to have massive numbers of people unwilling or unable to pay rent. In July, I believe this number was something like 60% of renters, so you can extrapolate from that just how many people that is-- it's \\_a\\_ \\_lot\\_.\n\nPotential ways out of that are kind of few and far between, but basically it's government subsidized housing for the vast majority of the country, shoehorned into the current capitalist system of housing we have. The long term effects will be insane, and I would imagine the next big debate after medicare for all will revolve around the 'right to housing'. However, in the short term, the properties stay solvent. The small land lords do get royally fucked though, unless they own outright, which many do.\n\nAs far as the reverse mortgage scenario you mention, I think the situation for people who can't do a reverse mortgage may get bad enough fast enough that there will be systems put into place to bail them out long before their reverse mortgages run out. There will be lots of transfers of homes to asset management companies in any scenario though. The real question basically involves what keeps them in business though, since they have the political leverage.\n\nHome prices will drop considerably, but they won't truly crater. A lot of money will be fleeing into these asset management companies, and they will probably be competing to re-home investors cash from various other collapsed parts of the economy. I even heard an ad on NPR the other day for a company that is offering this sort of investment to retail investors like you and I, so the gears are already turning on how to rev that market up.\n\nIt's a highly volatile and unpredictable situation though, and since there is no precedent from a time when the federal government \\*actually would\\* step into the middle of a situation like this and solve it, I can't clearly see how this all will turn out. The key is just not to let you or anyone you know be in that first 10-20% of people that will go homeless before the bailout sweeps in.

SnapChat is worth billions of dollar, and has never, and will never turn a profit. It has been around for years. Any firm at least a brain cell smarter than SnapChat can figure out how to keep afloat in this money tornado we live in.\n\nThe thing you have to understand is that the efficient market hypothesis was always bullshit, but because people *believed* it was true, asset prices often tracked with the standard way of valuing these things. In reality, the only way these equities have anything to do with the companies they represent is if they pay a dividend. Which very few still do. So, essentially, each publicly traded company is a money pit, where, when someone likes that company, they throw money into that pit, and when they don't they grab some back out. No one will ever throw enough in so that everyone can take out what they originally put in all out though. They're Ponzi schemes with enough levels of abstraction that people can still pretend they aren't. They're ponzi schemes that are using an old system that used to be used to distribute profits, and now they are just used to brand a giant hole in the ground with a shiny corporate logo.\n\nSo, perhaps a run on this money pit system would be a problem? Well... no. It isn't. There isn't enough cash to withdraw value out of these equities to ever empty the pits. They need to take some out of pit A, and then throw it into pit B.

Cars cost as much as Houses did in the 1960s, income wise, and houses are unattainable for the 60% (and increasing) of the country who currently rents. Even stuff that should be considered basic like college and medical care cost so much as to lead people into financial bankruptcy and lifelong stress, and only healthcare is achievable if people manage to hold down a high quality job throughout their life.\n\nThe rate of inflation doesn't take any of this into account. This is proven most stunningly in the stock market. Those who are able to invest a large portion of their capital into the stock market in the past 50 years have achieved such staggering wealth that all of the thing I listed above are easily attainable. In fact, they are practically oversights.\n\nTIPS are a good idea, as long as everyone decides that is the best option for their investments. However, I believe greed will win the day, and peoples' ingrained, addict-like impulse to accumulate wealth will continue to propel capital into the stock market.\n\nPerhaps capitalism has been so effective as to crush the paradox of thrift. As long as people don't have to taste the poorhouse en-masse, which the federal government will almost certainly ensure, the paradox of thrift will remain a vanquished relic of the past.\n\nEdit: tl;dr, check out the meme link at the bottom of my write up over here: [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/id8fqf/macro\\_dd\\_since\\_no\\_one\\_has\\_posted\\_the\\_correct\\_take/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/id8fqf/macro_dd_since_no_one_has_posted_the_correct_take/)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Also, nice meme lol", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I plan to move back towards a more traditional portfolio through next year", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Keep in mind, I'm no guru.

But the thing is, even when things were shit, it was still a bubble then. This has been the case ever since the majority of stocks stopped paying dividends. Stocks are just money pits. The market is a consensus machine, its value is based on what people agree it is valued at. Historically, this was done by analyzing earnings and whatnot to see what the potential dividend profits would be. However now, since that is gone, this system of valuation is meaningless. It simply perpetuates itself because all of the market makers make their plays as though this was still true.\n\nThe difference in the present is that there are no longer safe assets to retreat to from the stock market, so the bubble has some serious armor. Traditionally big money would pull out of the market, and invest in safe things like bonds, munis, etc., but those are up in smoke. Additionally, money would be pulled out by big money to repay debts incurred, if they lacked the liquidity to pay out of pocket. In the present, the fed is supplying infinite liquidity to not only the big banks, but also many of the largest firms in the country. No meaningful debt will ever be called in as long as the current monetary policy is continued. And as a result, there isn't really any reason for the bubble to burst.\n\nFed policy is to put armor on the bubble indefinitely. The only thing that might change things is if Biden gets elected, and the Fed reverses course.\n\nThe efficient market hypothesis was always bunk, but now it has been disproven.

Rather than a single call or single put, which has no cap on profits, spreads provide a range of profitability so you don't have to pay down tens of thousands of dollars. You can, if you really want to gamble. But in most cases stocks trade in a given range. So if MSFT is expected to go no higher than say $50 this week, you would be better off creating a $50 spread which is cheaper, instead of buying a single call.\n\nYou might need a higher level of options trading to trade spreads.
