{"title": "Thanks, random $SPY calls person! I owe you a beer.", "selftext": "So here I was, earning maybe 10\\~15% every two days on SPY spreads, thinking I was making a smart play when I read a random comment that said something to the effect of:\n\n*I noticed that SPY tends to earn about $10 per month, so I buy a +$10 call for SPY a month out and sell when it hits 1K.  I've made 3K the last three weeks.*\n\nSo I tried it out, more cautiously, by buying a +$5 call a month out to be conservative.  And I've already gained $300 (%80%) in two days, and switched all my spreads to these.   Whoever you are, thank you, and I'll venmo you a pizza if I ever find you :-D\n\nEDIT:  Just so that people understand something here - not only does this position have a higher margin of profitability for less overall risk than my original positions (already a huge plus), it also means that the SPY downturn that occurred today (ironically right after I wrote this) didn't hurt my investment much at all, whereas my original investments in SPY would been in heavy negatives right now.\n\nEDIT 2:  I do actually sleep, so if I stop responding, I'll do my best to answer any questions when I next see them :-D  For everyone who appreciated this post, happy to help :-D and feel free to DM.  I'm also trying to start writing articles for newbie traders since a lot of people seem to be elitist and rude in the trading subs.\n\nEdit 3:  So to make sure people understand what I meant, when I say +$5 call, I mean ***a call with a strike price five dollars above what the current price is.***  When I say +$10 call, I mean ***a call with a strike price ten dollars above what the current price is.***\n\nFINAL EDIT : So two things - If I didn't answer a question, please just PM me.  I've answered at least two hundred or more between PMs and this thread, and I may have mistakenly thought I answered you and I didn't.  If so, my bad, and PM me and I'll answer you as I can (day job notwithstanding).  Second thing, if you liked my writing or my answers and want to read more, feel free to hit my Medium blog ([https://medium.com/@patrykbg](https://medium.com/@patrykbg)).  I'm starting a blog for beginner investors since so many people were rude, dismissive or obnoxious when I was first starting out, and I wanted there to be a spot where that wouldn't happen.  **New post up just today!**\n\nFinal Edit 2: The Return :: Sorry, one last update, just so that people following don't need to scroll down to find out **the status of this play -**\n\nSOLD - ~~1x SPY 9/28 350C~~ \\- ~~the +$5 play that started it all~~ \\- ***+$397*** *overall profit, went with the 2x because I wanted to get in on some sweet Tesla and Apple action as well.  Mighta even had a 3X but hey, Apple was calling my name, and I had to heed the call.*\n\nSOLD x1, still 2x SPY 9/28 360C - the play that this post recommends - ***+500*** *overall profit as of 9/2 @ 1:40PM, 111% total profit and the sold one I just bought a replacement one with and banked the profit :-D*\n\n2x SPY 9/30 370C - bullish test just to see what happens - ***+$300*** *overall profit as of 9/2, 300% profit, I 3X'ed this biotch!  WOOOO!*\n\n*So to all you haters insisting this wouldn't work, was bad advice, and was more dangerous than using butterknives in a toaster to get bread, where are you now?  I like how a lot of you deleted your comments because you didn't want people to see how wrong you were, I guess?*   ***To everyone else:  Good luck with your trades :-D  Consider this episode closed - I think we can all see how well this went.  PM me if you want, but I won't be updating this section after today, as 3X was my exit strategy :-D  Still keeping a few to see if I can go higher ;-D***", "id": "ihmong", "created_utc": 1598540789.0, "score": 755, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 473, "comments": [{"body": "It works until it doesn't", "score": 789, "replies": [{"body": "Oh, I know.

This tells me that it is significantly more volatile. More volatility = more room for profit but also more risk.\n\nThe theta of the call is also lower. This tells me that it’s like a hot potato. The longer I hold it, the more it decays. If the underlying or volatility moves against me and I have to hold it for a few weeks, I’m going to lose money. Inversely look at the theta of the spread. I’m actually making money just by holding no matter what the stock does.\n\nLet’s look at volatility. Vix is an ok indicator for SPY. Volatility has been increasing all week so that means the price of premium has been going up. This benefits buyers of premium. Buy low sell high, but has hurt premium sellers. But, what’s causing it to go up and what’s it going to do to my option what volatility starts to eventually go down.\n\nSo the play worked because you have a high delta and the stock moved in your favor.

The purpose of the post was to find the person who commented on someone else's thread with a random tidbit of information that I found particularly helpful in my investments.\n\nObviously, since I understand that telling someone a position or even just naming a stock could potentially change someone's mind about that stock or cause them to invest, I have also taken the time to answer any and all questions about what I did, why I did it, and how it worked out for me.  In no way was I claiming any of the things people have ascribed to my post- I did NOT say to buy or sell, I did not say any version of \"everyone should be doing this\", and I definitely did not suggest that people should do exactly what I am doing.\n\nHowever, this begs the question - do all of these haters jump on to every gain post that lists positions?

I hope I'm right about that, but you actually took the time to explain, so you're already miles ahead of a number of other people.

You also assumed that I didn't know certain things or that they mattered to my decisions.

It's just as likely to go up than it is to go down. Now, historically if you look at mean returns, SPY gains around 1.04%/month, with of course a large degree of variance.

If you believe in the historical returns, then as long as you keep relatively consistent bet sizing, you'll be right more than you'll be wrong and make long term profits.\n\nBut before you answer which do you trust more, math or historical averages, think about this: if stocks did always go up in the long term, why doesn't every person just buy calls and everyone makes money in the long run? Wouldn't you just borrow against the interest rates, collect a ton of money, and then spend that on calls each month and basically take advantage of this arbitrage? I mean, 1%/month is better than interest rates right!\n\nThe fact is regardless of historical averages, you just cant assume the mean returns of the stock market is anything but 0.\n\nNot even regarding all the other factors such as paying more theta than you would collect from gamma/delta, vol crash, etc; long term this strat wont make you money.\n\nWith that being said, if you've been lucky with timing and selling before expiration, that's great, keep up the good work, but don't confuse lucky timing with a profitable long term strategy.\n\nStudy up on some black scholes and understand how options price in skew of returns and volatility, it may clarify some things.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You already lost me at \"stocks are a random walk with a mean of zero\".

I find people harder to deal with than stocks.  I simply don't understand real estate as much as I understand stocks.  If you're not a real estate person, that's not going to work for you.  If it's for you, then great.  Pursue it and make money and I respect you for that.  EDIT:  You can also flip houses but that's not for me either.\n\nSo while there's other less common investments, stocks are the only game in town for me.  I think a lot of people are like me and I think there's more investors than ever with Robinhood and partial shares so I think stocks deserve a higher multiple than ever. \n\nSo what else am I going to do?\n\nIf you never invest at all time high, you're basically never investing in it.  You would have spent from 2011 to 2020 waiting, still bought at a higher price AND lost out on any dividends.  Inflation alone drives the market to higher prices.  EDIT:  not necessarily all time highs like I said but when the market is up, people get scared and the market went up that whole time.\n\nAlso, if stocks run up 10% and then crash 20%, you didn't lose as much as it sounds.  And if stocks crash, usually other assets are hurting too so it's not like you chose a loser.  Those stocks will also recover so what are we talking about?\n\nRegarding a potential crash, I don't understand the fear.  A boat in the harbor is safe but you don't build boats to leave them in the harbor (I slaughtered that quote lol).

The response will be strongly US market inflationary.\n\nIn any event, volatility seems a high probability. Currency management the biggest concern.\n\nIf inflation rises then bonds depress, this is a major problem for the Fed’s policies.  They’re in liquidity trap. Inflation is the only way out, and will likely be as understated as they can manage in order to prevent a full rout of the bond market. Yield curve control is the policy that’s expected to be implemented next.  The more they inflate away the debts, the harder it is to hold down yields. It’s a real mess. \n\nThere’s a reason the Basel agreements (international banking) added gold as a tier 1 asset, why CBs are buying gold, why Buffet is buying gold, why Bridgewater is buying gold, and why gold price is rising (yet not in a straight line). It’s a stability haven and rises when rates run negative. \n\nEdit: It should be said these are my highest probabilities. Not predictions.\n\nAlso rising USD would be negative gold short term, then positive as stability becomes a concern. I am making not a goldbug argument.  Gold will likely sell-off significantly once the dust settles and interest rates can turn positive.  It’s just the system breaks (bond market, followed by derivatives, etc. all tank) if that’s done anytime soon or fast.

{"title": "Tesla Is Now Worth $400 Billion", "selftext": "The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.\n\nTesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.\n\nTesla passed Johnson & Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.\n\nThere is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.\n\nIt’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.\n\nIt’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.\n\nYou could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).\n\nIt’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.\n\nWith $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.\n\nIf you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "ihc9q7", "created_utc": 1598493253.0, "score": 1484, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 497, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 444, "replies": [{"body": "He's probably on an anonymous brokerage account buying and selling to try to get it to exactly 2103.45 by close on Friday.", "score": 267, "replies": [{"body": "ah yes, the weed.sex number", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "benis in bagina :DDD", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "420.69", "score": 30, "replies": []}, {"body": "That would be illegal as CEO.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "So is tweeting \"the share price is too high\", but that hasn't stopped Daddy Elon before.", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Hes just thinkin out loud", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "That was telegraphing the split actually.....", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"Funding secured\"\n\"420\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wouldn't that have been the deal of the century for private equity?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Because he's never done anything illegal.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "r/whoosh", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'll make it legal.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Do you remember when Elon had told $700 was too high in his opinion!??", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Too high.

But even in ideal places on Earth they're not 100% solar yet, and they really should be. In the Arab Emirats they started building solar for 1.35 cents per kWh. Compared to around 9-10 cents for nuclear, 6 cents for natural gas and 3-5 cents for hydro/wind. \n\nRight now you kinda want to make solar everything, because it's just so cheap. Doesn't work at night though, so you kinda need batteries. \n\nIf you look at the Hornsdale Power Reserve where Tesla made big news about building a battery in south Australia. They recently expanded it by 64.5 MWh capacity for A$71 million. \n\nTesla has said their battery packs will last for 1 million miles, at 400 miles per charge that's 2500 cycles. That's usually for around 80-90% capacity. Since the grid batteries are all stationary and much more controlled usage you could probably get 5000 cycles out of them. \n\nThat puts the cost of the battery power at [15.9 cents per kWh](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28A%2471+million%2F64.5+MWh+%2F5000%29+in+%24%2FkWh) \n\nSince solar is only 1.35 cents and you only need batteries at night that gets right around to nuclear's cost. It's getting to be quite price competitive with traditional power generation. Now, A$71 million/64.5 MWh is $790/kWh capacity, meanwhile Tesla manufacturers the batteries for around $120/kWh. There's a power inverter that make costs $60/kWh, but it can also be shared with a nearby solar farm. Otherwise it's just sticking batteries in a container, shipping them out and connecting the positive and negative wires. I'd say margins will be pretty good. \n\nBatteries are about to be in ridiculously high demand. Once you cross that threshold of nuclear, coal, natural gas, that's when every single power plant in the world will be throwing money hand over fist to buy your batteries. Tesla could be making 70% margin on their batteries, utility companies don't really care, they're saying money shutting down their coal plants anyway, they're happy.\n\nTesla is already the biggest battery consumer in the world by capacity, they're getting into battery manufacturing, that would make Tesla the largest battery manufacturer in the world by market cap.

{"title": "The Amazon of Pets - Chewy", "selftext": "E-commerce and pets. These two areas garnered unprecedented attention during the pandemic. When people think of pet products, they think of PetSmart. However,  PetSmart isn’t publicly traded. Chewy, an e-commerce platform focused on everything pets, is. As an added bonus, Chewy was acquired by PetSmart in May 2017.\n\nThe US pet supply industry comes up to about $100 billion, with Chewy taking a nice chunk out of that. Chewy has approximately 13 million active customers, 100 million orders shipped (since 2011), and net sales of $4.85 billion for 2019. Its customer base is gradually growing by the day and the pandemic has only made it more lucrative. \n\nAccording to 24PetWatch, a tracker of 1500 animal shelters in the US, 46% fewer dogs and 49% fewer cats entered animal shelters between March-May 2020 compared to the same period last year. Foster home adoptions have increased as well as domestic adoptions (by as much as 90% in major cities such as NYC, Dallas, and LA).\n\nAs you can see, this is a simple multipart cause and effect. First the Covid, then the pandemic, then the lockdowns. People were in need of new companions and not necessarily human ones. Chewy has taken advantage of this, and has offered a service called Autoship, which is a subscription-based service that replenishes pet food supplies. The sales from this service totaled $3.3 billion in 2019, a 45% increase from the prior year. \n\nIn sum, Chewy, AKA the Amazon for Pets, has placed itself in an industry that keeps on growing, especially during a pandemic. People consider pets to be a part of their family and will spend accordingly. Earnings are coming up on September 10th, and I believe that Chewy will destroy them. I’m playing the before, during, and after of the earnings and wanted to let you guys know.

{"title": "TSLA Study: Weekly Options Theta Decay during Hard Pullbacks.", "selftext": "Hi faggots. I'm tired of hearing noobs complain about \"well TSLA went back to $2240 after dipping down to $2160. Why is my $2400 call option expiring this week so far down even though it reclaimed $2240?\" I'm using TSLA becuase of its high IV and accelerated theta decay.\n\nI've decided to show you retards using visual aids what theta gang doesn't want you to know.\n\nFirst graphic is TSLA's intraday 1 minute line chart on the left, TSLA 08/28/20 $2300 Strike Call Option 1 minute line chart in the middle and TSLA 08/28/20 $2400 Strike Call Option 1 minute line chart on the right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8pesg7btlj51.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=7815fa27cd4e0fdf9a73bd788de64e1cadafb65e\n\nAs you can see, the line chart of the two call options contracts on the right are very similar to the underlying TSLA stock line chart. However upon TSLA's first minor pullback near the HOD you can see the call options taking a deep hit. After TSLA takes a huge dump mid-trading day, it proceeds to retrace and make higher highs as indicated by the crayon line. Unfortunately for those \"diamond hands\" dumbasses, their OTM call options make lower lows going into market close. The further OTM such at the $2400 strike call options take the hardest hit, even though TSLA stock is making higher highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext graphic I'm using ITM call option strikes 2100 and 2200 in the middle and right respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q4cqohaulj51.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=676f200f1788edf921cb821a67e80170fe3c9d1d\n\nAs you can see, because the $2100 call option has instrinsic value, the option line chart is almost identical to the underlying stock. Theta decay, even though the option expires tomorrow, doesn't affect the option premium as much as deep OTM contracts. On the right you see a $2200 strike call contract that is showing signs of premium attrition even though it came back into the money.\n\nWell there you have it. I just spilled the secret that theta gang and the market makers didn't want you to know about how stupid \"diamond hands\" and deep OTM FD's are.\n\nJust doing my job to educate and hope I saved somebody's portfolio.", "id": "ihsz53", "created_utc": 1598560432.0, "score": 302, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "Theta gang sent me to tell you take this post down immediately", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "Get him before he reveals more of our secrets!

As a large cap stock drops hard the probability of it dropping further intraday decreases IMO. Just look at TSLA and its strong support near 2140 defended by a giant green dildo. As long as you play a reasonable strike price, keep a small position size with a wider stop loss it was a high probability profit play. On the other hand I would be careful trying to short a large spike up because meme stocks actually have a higher probability of going up than down. If you must short, then just reduce your position size.\n\nRegarding not holding long enough, you should scale out (sell fractions of your position as you hit 30%, 60%) and trail a mental stop.
