You could invest in a quality stock while you accumulate the cash to buy a higher price stock you have researched and expect to go up. Another opportunity would be to invest in options via simple calls. Options allow you too leverage a smaller amount of cash to control the right not obligation to buy shares at a future date. For example, if you think $AMZN will continue to increase in price you can buy a call option 3-4 months from now with a higher strike price or price you think it could be at. 1 contract controls 100 shares. If $AMZN rises the value of your option also rises. You can then sell it back.

Let me preface this with the fact that I oppose monopolies and I am about as hardcore liberal as one can get but Amazon warehouses specifically are not the real issue. \n\nDue to politics and our wonderful capitalist's society competition is natural and needed for progress. The amount of technology that Amazon alone has created since January is unfathomable and almost all of this technology will positively impact some aspect of life. We need to transform our thinking to understand that not all big business is bad, just that politicians need to promote the little guy to force competition for the bigger guys.\n\n The problem with capitalism being controlled by politics is that politics is as much a competition as owning a business. Each city in the U.S. has to compete with it's own neighbors for federal funding, residency, and much more to provide the best services for its citizens and businesses. Unfortunately to be competitive nowadays you have to cut corners or go against ethics. This happens in the chicken industry where the quality of the chicken must be lowered to increase the usable meat when slaughtering them and lower the price of raising them. Politicians know that Amazon may affect local small businesses (many have not been able to compete for years so its not completely Amazons fault usually) but they want to provide better services and lower taxes to attract more residents(or just pay themselves more).  \n\nIts unfortunate but Amazon does make sense for almost all of us vs brick and mortar shopping. Its priced competitively for our benefit (for now) and consolidates a lot of manufacturing and retail allowing for more specialty businesses or more technology-based work and less minimum wage/unskilled labor. Many of our qualified high-skilled workers don't have enough job opportunities but every day my indeed is flooded with minimum-wage jobs.  We are a country filled with smart or at least brave people willing to do more than just the generic cashiering job for 11/hr. I think we need companies like amazon and google and fb to make way for more tech based work and work that our citizens deserve. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAndover has actually increased its employment AND its annual income per person. So we have more jobs and they are paying better on average. Clearly that still means some people could have been hurt and many businesses are now gone. But more businesses (and probably more successful) businesses will reopen in their spot with new ideas and innovations and services to better provide for the community.

{"title": "Oil stocks - the time is now", "selftext": "Hello there\n\nI posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they’ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings). Hope you hopped on. Now I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges\n\nThere are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:\n\n* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU’s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range\n* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)\n* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)\n* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)\n* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down\n\nWhich all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes’ rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:\n\n* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th\n* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter\n* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st\n* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th \n* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.\n* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring\n\nThe last several EIA reports have been good in general – drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. \n\nWhat’s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over and it seems we're about halfway recovered. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving\n\nRight now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth’s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well\n\nWorried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it’s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It’s weird that big tech has been climbing – companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a ‘tax bill fear’ from the Dem’s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven’t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors. Environmental regulations should be, however\n\nHowever, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)\n\nWhat am I looking at in particular?\n\nRight now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX>VLO>MPC at this point for value.\n\n* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61\n* VLO target price: ~$71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50\n\nFrom a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it’s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It’s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I’m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it’s at the low of the range it’s been confined in and wouldn’t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren’t bad pickups either\n\nPS – stay away from OXY. It’s very clear they’re going to continue to issue shares until they’re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it’s still viewed, just stay away\n\nTLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets\n\nDisclosure: I have a large position in PSX calls", "id": "iexyez", "created_utc": 1598161412.0, "score": 2177, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 487, "comments": [{"body": "I traded oil for too many years (mostly unsuccessful).

The oil market is fundamentally very weak and will be for some time, at least until there’s a vaccine. All that oil off the market and the price is only at $40. OPEC are likely to cap the price to make sure all of those barrels go to their producers on the rebound. Although that inflection point on price might come sooner than we expect, I think we’re at least a year out. \n\n2. Investors have been so badly burned by the sector over the last decade that they will need to see strong evidence of real profitability and cash flow generation before they come back. Add to that the concerns about ESG and stranded assets and that presents a real headwind for oil stocks even if the price recovers. \n\n3. Even with cash flow generation, pretty much every oil producer and service company in the industry will be putting free cash flow towards repairing their balance sheets instead of putting the money into the ground. Very few exceptions to this. \n\n4. I believe rising oil prices, if they happen will spur real political will for action on climate change that simply can’t exist today. At $40 oil, policy makers can’t levy a carbon tax high enough to make a material difference to oil demand.

Grass-fed demand so much land that would be impossible to make that change:\n\r\n\r\"Nationwide shift to grass-fed beef requires larger\rcattle population\"\r\n\r\n\"Another recently released study found that a switch to entirely grass-fed beef in America would require 30 percent more cattle to meet current demand. And, because pasture-raised cattle require more space to forage, the switch would devour even more land. Existing pastureland could only support 27 percent of the current beef supply in a grass-fed system.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prior studies have considered market and infrastruc-ture barriers to scaling grass-fed beef production [14].However, biological and physical limits may inhibitthe expansion of US grass-finished beef, includingadditional land for increased pasture and forage feedrequirements.\"\r\n\r\n\"However, due to grain feed’s\rhigher nutrient density relative to grass, it requires sig-\rnificantly less land and generates less methane per unit\rof meat produced\"\r\n\r\n\"Grass-finished cat-tle have lower average daily weight gain (ADG) andfinished weights than their grain-finished counter-parts, because cattle eating grass have less efficientfeed conversion ratios (FCR).\"\r\n\r\n\"Changes in cattle population and management would also create an even higher land and methaneenvironmental footprint for beef. \"\r\n\r\n\"Other impacts such\ras fresh water eutrophication, soil erosion and native\rvegetation suppression from overgrazing, and nitrous\roxide emissions are likely to create additional environ-\rmental burdens, but must be more precisely quantified.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aad401/pdf\r\n\n  And \"current demand\" is an essential term here, with a growing population and people being raised out of poverty that demand would keep soaring. There is nowhere near enough land to make this exchange in the US and in other parts of the word this is just a fantasy.

If you genuinely think that we couldn't come up with any usage for a given \"material\" besides feeding to animals I just don't know what to say to you. \n\n There are virtually no livestock on earth living exclusively of grass I'll just say that before dealing with your actual point because it already makes your point absurd. Your premise here is that if we don't use grass as feed it's just a waste but THE VAST majority of grass being used for livestock comes from the deforestation of the rainforest and other environmentally important lands of the planet that were not originally pastures. The amount of damage caused by grass-fed livestock is probably one of the most environmentally disruptive things to ever happen to the planet and you're using that as good point for your argument.\n\n\"cattle ranching predominates in deforested areas\" \r\n\r\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/26267941?seq=15#metadata_info_tab_contents\r\n\r\n\"Around 15% of the Amazon forest has been replaced and around 80% of the deforested areas have been covered by pastures\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fao.org/3/xii/0568-b1.htm\r\r\r\n\r\n\"rampant deforestation of Amazon driven by global greed for meat\" \r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/02/revealed-amazon-deforestation-driven-global-greed-meat-brazil\r\n\r\n\"Cattle ranching is the largest driver of deforestation in every Amazon country, accounting for 80% of current deforestation rates.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching\r\n\r\n\"Study links most Amazon deforestation to 128 slaughterhouses\" \r\n\r\nhttps://news.mongabay.com/2017/07/study-links-most-amazon-deforestation-to-128-slaughterhouses/\r\n\r\nhttp://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/758171468768828889/pdf/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf\n\n>more than 60% of agricultural land globally is pasture and rangeland that is too rocky, steep and/or arid to support cultivate agriculture, yet this land can support cattle and protein upcycling\n\n Again, you make almost the exact same point. It's not that those lands can't be used if not for livestock it's that because those lands are often used by livestock we don't use them for anything else. The general term used for these kinds of lands (often used by livestock but not for other economic activities) is not \"range land\" but \"marginal lands\", \"rangeland\" is one type of marginal land that are often used by livestock but there are hundreds of other economic uses for those. People who support livestock repeatedly lie about these kinds of lands being useful only for livestock:\n\n\"Marginal land is not always unusable for human purposes. It can serve as grazing grounds for certain free-roaming livestock, for example. Some have suggested using marginal lands to produce biofuel, since it could be used to produce biomass without pushing out traditional crops and competing with farmland. Plants that could be used for this purpose include switchgrass, shrub willow and giant miscanthus. Land that has been set aside for reasons not having to do with productivity generally does not fall under the category of marginal land. Examples of this sort of land include state and national parks.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginal-land.asp\n\n\"There are also some plants that can be grown in land that would be considered marginal for most agricultural uses. For example, cucurbita foetidissima, the buffalo gourd, is well adapted to marginal agricultural lands such as sandy loam soils which have to be well-drained.[6][7] Land that is marginal for conventional row-crop production is often well-suited to perennial crops,[8] including low-input crops grown as bioenergy or bioproduct feedtocks such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), shrub willow (Salix spp.), and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), allowing production of these crops without inducing competition for prime farmlands\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_land\r\n\n And it's so disingenuous to pretend that this system is sustainable in scale, with growing demand the actual result of using rangeland for livestock was widespread desertification like it happened in Saudi Arabia:\n\n\"Rangeland degradation and desertification represent a major challenge to forests and trees. In some countries, forests have been converted to rangeland or used for livestock grazing, mainly as a result of rangeland degradation, overpopulation of livestock and the lack of \r\nregulations and management for both rangelands and forests. Forests and rangelands are also \r\nfacing the challenge of conversion to other types of land for tourism or urban development.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/pdf/010/k1652e/k1652e03.pdf\n\n>intensive plant agriculture can result in soil nutrient depletion, grazing animals play an important role in fertilizing\n\n You just suggested that livestock can't cause soil depletion, you can't be serious.... BTW The vast majority of monocultures that cause soil depletion are used as livestock feed and generate the byproducts that you were referring to in your first claim. It's amazing. \n\n>carbon sequestration\n\nThis again. It's amazing how this Alan Savory myth just don't die.

While it's not uncommon to see discussions about topics not directly related to investing in Tesla, I think this one is a first, lol.\nBut since nobody except you is probably gonna read this, I'll answer.\n\nFirst, before you consider doing it, you have to be sure that you are done having kids. While it can be reversed, success is not guaranteed. Know a guy who had another kid with his 2nd wife though after undoing it.\n\nThe procedure itself is easy and low risk. You get a local anesthesia, a little cut in the skin, then they remove a short piece of the vas deference(?) and make sure the ends stay apart because there is a chance of them growing together again. Repeat on the other side. It's not painful, but not fun either. I remember feeling the mussels in the belly contract, which felt similar to being kicked in the balls. But this is only during a few minutes. I'd describe it as uncomfortable, not painful. After that, you'll walk very carefully for maybe two days, then it's getting back to normal. After a month or so you have to provide a sperm sample which they test for still living sperms. In my case I had to do this twice because the first time they still found little kiddies.\n\nSex is exactly as before, 100%. Most of the cum is not sperms anyways, so there is no noticeable difference in that either.\n\nTo sum it up, it's the ideal contraception method for a couple who doesn't want any more kids or for single men who never want to find themselves paying for a kid they didn't want. By comparison, sterilizing a woman is way more risky (full anesthesia, infection risk), complex and expensive, so for me it was a no brainer to have my own lines cut.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks so much for your response.

Visible through a peephole in the machine about the diameter of a silver dollar, the gas-application process is a purple haze. Everything about it is intricate and finicky: the composition of the gases; the pressure and temperature at which they’re shot in; the speed at which the substrate moves along the conveyor belt inside the machine.  \n>  \n>Once the anode material comes out of the machine, in a double-sided roll that’s battleship gray, it packs about 200,000 silicon nanowires per square centimeter per side. It’s cut and sent into a series of small lab rooms, where workers in white coats and blue surgical masks assemble batteries essentially by hand. Amprius says the best of these batteries have an energy density about 60% higher than that of conventional lithium-ion batteries. One downside is that they don’t withstand as many discharges and charges as conventional batteries—something Amprius is working to improve.\n\n[https://fortune.com/longform/race-build-better-battery/](https://fortune.com/longform/race-build-better-battery/)\n\nIf you know how to edit CSS then this bypasses the blur effect:\n\n`figure,p,img,a {`\n\n`filter: none !important;`\n\n`user-select: text !important;`\n\n`}`\n\n/u/Giesige", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Saw some comments about this earlier.

High volatility is not good for points 2 and 3 \n\nI have a similar investment approach to you, as I would  be ‘leaving money on the table’ from my perspective if I only held 10% Tesla, but I don’t have to worry about my fiduciary duty to thousands of clients and how they might ‘run for the hills’ on a Tesla pull back.

I'm claiming that ARK is not optimizing their own goals well with the 10% limit according to their own beliefs about Tesla. That is, that 10% is too low and 15 or 20 or more is better.\n\nI think you and endless rainbows are assuming a more obvious argument. I'm talking about the specific number and I think 10% is obviously too low even given all you said and their own goals. \n\nAdmittedly I haven't put this in any formal proof but neither is the opposite position. The problem is this is mathematically obvious to me. If you limit your top stock to 10% you force yourself to have 10 stocks. More likely you are forcing 20+. At that point you very quickly merge performance with generic indexes because n=? Doesn't have to be very large for that to happen..  good luck picking 20 stocks and outperforming consistently..\n\nAnother way to put it is if they made tsla 20% they would still satisfy the criteria you believe (and I agree) matters above.\n\nAnd now that tsla actually did what they hoped the evidence is now even firmer that the intuition was correct. If their limit was 20% rather than 10% a 10x performance would be 3x rather than 2x!\n\nThe principal argument against what I'm saying is that I'm claiming only hindsight facts but I deny it. I think in general all funds should put their highest pick above 10%. If they aim to have 10 stocks the top might even still be 30%. Less than that is honestly just generic mutual fund BS.. maybe you want to justify that because it is typical but why!?\n\nAnd so the point of this is that i actually believe 10% is incompetently low. I think intelligent investors should think less of them that they can be this doggedly bullish about a stock and still blow it this bad on capitalizing on it... I am less inclined to throw any nmn passive funds I might have their way and that's the impression I think others should have --  put x% in tsla and the rest in qqq.\n\nAlright too much about this.

I studied intelligent systems, not just neural networks, but many different systems. I would say I am a professional. I dont know everything, true, but I had lots of exposure to the math behind these systems and their application in my day job. It seems counter intuitive, but more data sometimes isnt the deciding factor to produce better results. It can reinforce you into a local optimum among other things. Much more relevant is the approach to the problem. You can easily make simple mistakes that lead you to a bad result and you dont know why. For example you train a NN on too many nodes. Then the NN becomes overadabted to the training data and looses generality. If the data is good, this can be fixed to some extend with more data, but the data requirements grow exponentially with the complexity of the NN in any case. In other words, if you add one more (output) neuron, or increase the number of connections between neurons by one, you suddenly need twice as much data as before. Its not quite that ratio but it often is an exponential function. You can easily scale the complexity of the network beyond its training capabilities without noticing it for quite some time.\n\nI dont think that Tesla will do this specific mistake, they are professionals too, but there are many other fallpits and slippery slopes and you dont always see them coming. Its entirely possible that a different company, whether with a camera based or LIDAR based system, can surpass Tesla with a better network and 1/1000th the training data. I agree that its unlikely that this happens, but its not impossible.\n\nSo, in summary, please dont dismiss other peoples capabilities off hand like that.

Especially with the remark that data requirements increase exponentially with network size. \n\nA scenario in which more data is not beneficial is when your network is too small and can’t model the whole complexity of whatever task it’s trying to learn (underfitting). In this case you should work on increasing network size instead of collecting more data. HW3 massively increasing compute is an indication that this has happened before and HW4 will come too, being able to increase size even further. \n\nAnother scenario/issue, which I’m not sure you’re addressing here, is that of imbalanced data sets. Is that correct?\nIf that’s the case, I think they have enough data to discard or reduce the weight of whatever is taking up the majority of the data. \n\nIs there another scenario in which more data is not beneficial?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, after reading again what I wrote, I realize I didnt do a good job of presenting my point. Yes, more data is almost always better than less data. But more data doesnt automatically lead to better results. One issue is, as you said and that I faced repeatedly is that the number of different corner cases rises exponentially with problem complexity. Say you model problem complexity with the number of open parameters, lets call it n. Then a data object of that model is a vector with n elements, each representing an independent variable, usually bound between a min and a max value. This defines a hyper-cubus in n-dimensional space. This hyper-cubus has 2^n corners, and the likelihood that at least one of the parameters is close to one of the extremes approaches 1. i.e. the likelihood that a data point sits on one of the faces of the cube approaches 1. So you always get a very disjoint data set and normal methods to find groups (or in terms of the NN, training cases that are similar) break down.\nAn example: Lets say we are adding some mundane information to autopilot, like the outside temperature for instance. This may lead to the need of waaaay more data points because suddenly data that was similar before is not similar any more. Simply because some cases were done on a cold day while others were done on a hot day.\n\nThe solution is to cut away unimportant information. But how do you know what is important and what is not? How does the NN know that? More training cases! Of course. Many, many more training cases.\n\nThese are problems that ALL auto pilot systems face. Not just Tesla. My point is, that you can gain more traction on the problem by having a smart cut on the data, or a smart reduction of the data volume and complexity than by brute force more data in general. Of course, the NN has to consider all relevant information, otherwise its too simplistic. The trick is to get that right. Its more an art than a science. I think this is part of what Dojo is about. To generate the test data for the NN to prime it for the complexity it needs to face in reality. And for the developers to find the relevant information. Once they know where the cut is, once they know what is truly relevant, they have a better handle.\n\nCan Tesla do it with their current approach? Absolutely yes. Will they be the first? I dont know.

You can even have di-directional movements be profitable, such as the stock could go up, or sideways and you'd still profit if you utilize spreads correctly.\n\nETFs are essentially, you only profit if whatever its tracking goes up, or down if its a short ETF, its a mono-directional win scenario, while with options you can have a tri-situation win scenario, leveraged up all you want, or down, with your risk defined. For example, I could make a 400 dollar play, that S&P goes up 1% in the next month, i would receive 100 dollars if im right. If im wrong, i lose 400 dollars. Risks are defined, im leveraged up 25x, but my risk is rather low and defined. the S&P goes up 1% on average. I could crank it down to 10% return on my capital risked, for .5% increase, giving it some wiggle room.  You could make a similar play, but with a higher risk of capital, and lower return, around 15%, for a play that says S&P will stay the same, or go up within the next month, from this date to that date, if its below the strike that you entered the spread at on expiration, you lose a defined amount. You gave up a % of return on your investment, but you're 2x likely to profit now, because you have 2/3 the movements spy could make on the monthly chart working for you. If you can do this consistently and not lose, it can be amazing returns, 15-25% consistent returns can compound quite quickly, but dont forget, you can get blown up doing this if you're not paying attention, hedging and cutting your losses. S&P could be in that winning condition for that spread all the way up to the last day on your spread, than tank on you. Good bye your progress. \n\nyou can also just use options to buy LEAPS on an ETF your bullish on, and capture similar gains to if you had X amount of shares, but your risk is significantly less.

Now keep in mind that the closer that the share price rises to your call - the less Vega value plays a part to strike price and is eclipsed by the Delta value.\n\nIf you think the market volatility will increase for your 3X OTM calls MORE than the share price will increase for your 1 ATM/ITM call - then go with the FDs. If not, go for the single ATM/ITM call as it will gain the most value due to a moon/run up.\n\nIf you are trying to use your FDs to generate profit in order to roll into an ATM/ITM call - you need high initial volatility to sell FDs at a profit in addition to a dip to purchase the ATM/ITM at a cheaper price followed by a runup/moon to make the most profit off of the ATM/ITM call.... so essentially A moon, a dip, and another bigger moon.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Great answer.
