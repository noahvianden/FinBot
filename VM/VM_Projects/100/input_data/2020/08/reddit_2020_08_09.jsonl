But to put it simply, you'd get a lot less argument if you just said, \"I think it's very unlikely...\".\n\nFor anyone that does continuous research into this market (I showed you those sales sources above) it's certainly easy to imagine a future possibility where Tesla could have 50% market share of all US vehicles sold for some period of time, even to the point that of vehicles actively driven on the road they have 50% market share.  NOTE: I am not saying this is PROBABLE.  I'm saying it is a reasonable possibility based on their apparent lead in mass production of EVs.  The US and European auto manufacturers seem absolutely lost when it comes to real EV manufacturing.  Yes they've made and shown some prototypes but mass producing a vehicle that competes with Tesla in cost and features is going to be really tough for them.  The old manufactures have waited on the sidelines for too many years thinking EVs wouldn't take off anytime soon. Meanwhile Tesla has spent 12+ years and tens of billions of dollars getting the incredible lead they have today.  Existing ICE manufacturers can't transition to an mass EV producer without a lot of time and investment.  The vehicle doesn't have to just be designed to please the consumer it has to be designed to be mass producible at a reasonable cost.  There's a lot of tech and IP that goes into batteries, drivetrains, motors and software that the old ICE companies just do not have.\n\nThe Chinese have the biggest chance of competing with Tesla (in my opinion because their government lets them reverse engineer and steal IP freely, but that's a different subject) but I'm not sure they'll be able to compete in the US market when you take brand/style/quality/features/cost into the equation.\n\n> This would only work if the chargers could work for other electric cars.\n\nWhy?  Even if Tesla was just the most popular brand with say 10% market share and has the best option they'll probably go with this Tesla offering as a means to attract customers.  This is already happening today.  Two restaurants in my little mountain town have two or three Tesla specific chargers and then they have 1 that works for \"everything else\".", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I agree that in places where there is currently a diverse offering of high quality EVs on the marker from a variety of manufacturers, it wouldn't make sense for a business owner to install a Tesla specific charger right now.\n\nHowever, the majority of small and medium sized business owners in the United States think Tesla when they think \"electric vehicle\" because no other automaker is advertising EVs for sale today. The media (partially legacy auto's fault) has done a great job of making sure the public perception of Tesla owners as tech savvy, white collar people with disposable income to spare... Exactly the kind of customers businesses want to attract. The fact that other EVs exist that the business owner isn't aware of won't factor into their decision at all. \n\nI think this will have a major positive impact on the probability that other automakers join Teslas charging network vs the other way around... As more of these chargers are installed in more places, the public perception (remember, the vast majority of the public knows nothing about Tesla or EVs) will be that there are TESLA chargers everywhere, and that will either make them wait to make the transition to EVs until they can afford a Tesla, or until they hear that the new 2023 Bolt can use the Tesla network.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What do you mean when you say no other automaker is advertising EVs?

Also, he enacted a payroll tax cut that will be come a grant IF he becomes re-elected. So inflation will continue to rise, oh and the Fed is capping interest rates on bonds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Metals compete DIRECTLY with REAL (inflation adjusted) interest rates. As a foundational bedrock investment of  Pensions, Mutual Funds, and general portfolios - people have traditionally held long term bonds.  Metals are a 0% thing, you can't eat them and they are basically a pet rock - but they are stable at 0% forever, as metals were the ORIGINAL money.  If you take the current bond rate, and subtract the inflation rate, you get -1.1%.  This is causing MASSIVE moves in the market as people leave bonds and crowd into metals, as 0% beats the hell out of negative REAL rates.  Currently Gold is at 2100, if we go to -2% REAL rates, Gold will be 2500.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Learn about Rehypothecation here ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:\\~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.)).  For obvious reasons, this is why housing blew up in 2008.  The exact same thing is happening in Silver, but inversely.  Silver has been abused for so long, but it REALLY started in 2011. The \"classic\" (meaning the mined ratio, or the ratio at which they pull this shit out of the ground) is around 16:1.  In 2005, the ratio was 60:1.  On Friday's close, the Silver/Gold ratio was 79:1.  Silver has a LONG way to catch-up.  At CURRENT levels, Silver SHOULD be (assuming a 60:1 ratio) \\~ 35ish.  So when you look at the fact that Silver has been abused for so long that its undervalued, coupled with the Massive run on metals due to negative REAL rates, Silver has massive upside. The amount of fund inflows into Silver ETF's is another leg up on silver as well - they eventually are going to have to officially re-value silver to reflect fund inflows and sentiment.  Who knows what the new Silver/Gold ratio could end up as...but I'm betting its a LOT lower than 60:1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short, and the world blew up in their face.  HSBC lost $200M in a single day, and closed their industrial metals business around 6 weeks ago ( [https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html) ).  Soctiabank also closed down its metals trading desk around 4 months ago ( [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.) )  This means the ONLY one left is JPM, and they are still trying to fight us, but are losing and continuing to wind down shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4b) The $1.5 drop we saw Thursday night was exactly this - banks reloading shorts to try and fight us, but there is a big difference. An ALL TIME RECORD amount of shorts were opened on the Comex on Thursday, around 350k contracts....a RECORD amount...and all it did was $1.50 in damage....so that should tell you where sentiment and price action is.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&t=1s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) Silver is about to go parabolic and nothing is in it's way.  The fed is printing money (driving inflation), people are already crowding metals, banks are unwinding their short positions (or closing their metals trading desk all together), and there are HISTORIC inflows into Silver - which will eventually cause a revaluation to the upside.  I'm an EE and I love Technical Analysis, but this is 100% fundamental driven.\n\nA retired energy trader once told me \"Fundamentals will tell you why something is happening, TA will tell you when\".  TA is broken on metals right now and all its doing is making algos and morons try to load shorts.  Multinational global banks are literally leaving the idea of shorting metals, so maybe follow suit?  These are some of the smartest people on earth and I hate bankers, but they aren't dumb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a great week.", "id": "i6l0o2", "created_utc": 1596986290.0, "score": 455, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 412, "comments": [{"body": "So instead of paying my 4K credit card debt this coming commissions check, I should open up a new card, do a balance transfer, and put 6K into calls.
