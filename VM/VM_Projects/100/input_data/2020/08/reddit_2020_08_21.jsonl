The economy and the stock market are not the same thing. Rational behavior is predictable. The market is composed of nothing more than buyers and sellers and so really I'm only saying that the behavior of buyers and sellers would become predictable if it were rational. Unexpected macro events would cause rational buyers and sellers to change their behavior in reaction. And it would be a predictable change because it would conform to rational principles. Sellers would sell if the macro event caused economic harm that would cause buyers and holders of stock to lose interest in buying and holding and vice versa. But rational behavior is like chess at a certain point or even mathematics... there is a rationally optimal or logically deducible action. This action is calculable and therefore predictable. Conversely, irrational behavior is generally not predictable.  \n\n\nLastly, there can be degrees of predictability. If you can reduce possibilities down to a minimum of outcomes then it is 'more' predictable. I actually don't know if perfectly rational market participants would be perfectly predictable but they certainly would be more predictable. The economy, since it is the origin of things, will always introduce novelty - or newness - and novelty is unpredictable (like the weather) mostly. Game theory could predict the behavior of perfectly rational actors responding to a novel economy pretty well... but this is my speculation as I don't work with game theory much. Thanks for replying. Sorry if I wrote too much - 3 years in grad school had me writing a lot lol.\n\nEdit: About the risk: So when a company underperforms expectations or when companies change due to unexpected macro events would you know how rational buyers and sellers would respond to the realities as they occur? If you would then they are predictable and you could probably avoid much of the risk of loss if you knew how they would respond... Maybe a stock market composed of perfectly rational buyers and sellers wouldn't be perfectly predictable and therefore zero risk but the risk would be much, much lower than what we have. The risk-free interest rate refers to the interest rate on US treasuries bills. Lending money to the US government in effect is considered risk free. The US government could default in principle though. We call it risk free because that has always just been so improbable. So when I said the stock market would become risk-free I didn't mean it in an absolute sense. It would be much lower risk like government bonds though. For the most part, the low risk of govt bonds is a big reason (but not the only one) that they are low reward.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "no, the stock market being rational would not make it predictable. only its reactions would be predictable.

The people who already owned the stock would benefit, and a small amount of the very first people to respond to the new information would benefit in decreasing amounts until it found its new price.

In my eyes, the future is completely unpredictable. Who knows if Apple or Tesla will still be here in 20-40 years. The real risk to me is not being in the market right now.

Yes, the point of investing is to make money - i agree. It really depends on your own financial situation... \n\nI am only 19 but have around $10k in ETFs and stocks as of now. So to me personally, I decided that investing in companies that I personally can see sticking around in the future. I would much rather pay a steeper price to be involved for a short margin of gain, than to not be in it at all. I like Tesla and Apple specifically, because the future is in energy and technology. Tesla  is, if not already, the dominant brand within it's own sector and have a clear vision of what they want to bring within the next couple years. You can watch podcasts online and hear some if you are interested. I especially like them because they aren't just a car company. It's interest in space and renewable energy is intriguing to me. Apple on the other hand is not going anywhere soon. Competition is still there, but think about all the people you know who own at least one of it's products. Apple consistently produces the best technologies and I can not see them going away anytime soon. I think the company needs to improve its marketing, because I haven't seen an effective Apple ad or billboard in years. I think many people might say they have become so big that they don't need help advertising anymore, but I think some people are becoming aware of that, therefore losing some humane feeling of knowing that they will continue to purchase Apple products without knowing what is new from the previous product.\n\nAs an example, I recently bought an iPhone 11, but I had done no prior research on the key differences between the iPhone 10 (my previous phone) compared to the iPhone 11. I had an upgrade through my carrier, but to me, there was no significant marketing skill to make me think why I should be getting the iPhone 11 compared to any other Apple product or Samsung, Android, etc. \n\nThe biggest takeaway is that I am willing to pay whatever now than later because my financial situation has provided an opportunity for me to invest the money I currently have earned and saved and put them into a worthy investment that will hopefully reap the benefits in 10-20 years. \n\nSuper long rant, but I hope that helps you or at least gives you some insight.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I promised I wasn't going to respond to responses but I have to ask - you keep talking about the future - what about big food companies?

Everyone has access to a computer via public library, friends, family, etc. \n\nAll of these industries you could argue will be stable over time. IMO the food industry is the only one where I don't personally invest in, I haven't considered looking into Indexes or ETFs however. \n\nI also can see your point - why would someone buy TSLA when it just increased 10x? Everyone hears \"buy low, sell high.\" The future is unpredictable. I can very well be wrong and maybe some of these industires might take a hit or soar. However, again, I rather BE in the market than regretting not to be in the market at all. It also really depends on your financial situtation. I am only 19 years old. I have quite some time to accumulate gains/losses over the next 10-15 years. I'm not saying that you need to be younger to invest in these companies in particular, but for me personally, I have the TIME to wait. I am also very hopeful for what these two companies can bring to the table in the \"future.\" I've done my own research (however that isn't justifiable) and believe that these companies can really innovate and change how humans will percieve the world down the road.

I said fuck it and doubled down and sold a lot of my other positions and dumped into TSLA. It doubled again from there. It's currently 50% of my portfolio. I genuinely believe it will go higher. I'm not just talking within a year. I'm talking about a 6-10 year horizon. I honestly believe they are going to be the biggest company in the world. They will 1T sooner than later and at a quicker rate than Apple. After looking at what they can offer in their energy department and what the current market and competitors look like, I have no doubt Tesla is going to stranglehold the energy sector. Most of the top 10 companies of the world are energy companies. If Tesla can grow and get market share with their power grid, the implications are almost unfathomable. If Elon believes their energy department is going to be even bigger than their auto department, I believe him. It is the early days of them really putting a dent into energy. That's the real play with this stock. Auto is just a side play.\n\nAlso, if you want to ride TSLA short term you can. There is a lot of money going to be made in the next 4-6 months. This is because of the S&P500 inclusion. A lot of people are misinformed about how this works. Most companies go into the S&P400 first and they see a jump of stock price (eventually cools but still). When they transition to the 500, the jump isn't as drastic. TSLA is not in the S&P 500 and because of their market cap they will skip past the 400 and go straight to the 500. This is going to do 2 massive things. \n\n1. Fund managers are going to have to buy a lot of TSLA very quickly. Within 2 weeks typically of the inclusion announcement to balance their funds. That's a lot. This is going to kick the price up big time.\n\n2. There WILL be another short squeeze because of what happened in #1. This is going to cause a feedback loop and kick the price up even more. \n\nThis may be the biggest jump we've ever seen, in the markets history.

I posted a while back that Tesla was worth every penny and why!

But along with Tesla, ZM, and Penn, I’m mad, because I have sold over 60 Penn at 49, with 80 remaining at 15 a pop (median). I have purchased 11 Tesla’s shares in total, and have sold 5 for a loss! Bought them between 1,000.00 and 1,585.00. Then sold 5 and each time I sold one at a time, it was for a loss! Got nervous when it dipped a few times, due to it being so volatile in the past, and took a loss of around 400.00 total when I chose to sell my most expensive shares. The remaining 6 I have left, and I’m up almost 8k. Zoom hurts because my kids were using zoom for school, and I was amped! Purchased 25 of them at 120, and sold them at 135.00 which was after they had some kind of security breach yahoo finance was talking about. They ended up dipping below the 130 mark I was shook, due to being a fuckin noob. Then once they hit 135, I ended up selling all 25 for peanuts! That shit more than doubled up last time I checked! In March the opportunity was there for so many stocks! I’m happy with my earnings thus far don’t get me wrong, I’m up almost 25% after deploying more and more cash little by little. At this point I do major research, still have found some gems, but obviously looking back there are some no brainers I missed! Like I said I shouldn’t complain at least I have something to show for it although my realized gains are trash in comparison to to my unrealized gains that are obviously up there. Wish I wasn’t a noob back in March, but if I wasn’t a noob, I would have been petrified during the sell off, would have probably sold most of my shares anyways. so maybe I wouldn’t have much to show for if it didn’t happen this way.

HLT, WYNN, BA (in at 120.00 long haul I think they bounce back) JETZS, CZR (had ERI, before merger and MGM) low ass median worth the risk, and largest casino chain in the states.

It will take longer than most think to accomplish this. But even with CO, PA, who are officially in the party, and MA possibly joining the party this year, it’s a matter of when not if, for the majority of the remaining states!

After a stock split, you would have 0.5 of a share that is still worth $150.\n\nRobinhood is one such brokerage.

Opinions are irrelevant. Hate speech is hate, there is no ability to confuse it with something else.

For an Irishman it would me mick or Mickey. You can see where I am going with this, every culture has their own words of hate. Hatespeech consists of specific words or phrases that pertain to a culture and carry with them a derogatory form of hate. \n\nFor example one can say “fuck you” all you want and it is a swear but not hate. But when one says “fuck you you *insert slur here*” that becomes hatespeech. \n\nThe decision is common sense. We should be able to look at a phrase and come to the same conclusion as to whether or not it is truly hateful. It is not up to opinions. Opinions are how hate is allowed to integrate itself into society, like what we saw with segregation and the racial fissure it has caused.

It began as a slur for Africans, and continues to be a slur for Africans today. It was always a term of belittlement designed to place the speaker above those they spoke to (negros) and it still holds that design today. People may have been raised to call Africans negros because they were told it was endearing in 1950, but that doesn’t make them correct and doesn’t make the word endearing at all. They may think so, but it is hard to see the cracks in the foundation one builds themselves up upon, so why would they bother to change how they think if they think it is right? When you shatter peoples worlds and what they’ve built themselves up upon from childhood, sometimes they just can’t put themselves back together. It is why bigoted old racists tend to die bigoted old racists instead of having a revelation in their old age. \n\nThe correct term was never negro, just as the correct term was never wop. The correct term was always African. The correct term was always Italian. The problem became they didn’t see Africans as people from Africa, they saw them as animals from Africa. And so they developed a few names to call this animal from Africa, and those names are the hatespeech we see today. \n\nWhen an African refers to an African as my negro, it is almost a jab at the slave owners of the previous centuries. They are joking to be the “owner” of one another and see it as such. Regardless of the joking nature of it, it is still hate. The words still carry hate with them, but instead of letting them break them down they wear them as armor. Using hatespeech as armor is mainly seen with Africans because of the 200 some odd years they were broken down by it in America when they only had one another. That can be a hard differentiation to see, when hatespeech is used as protection and not a weapon, but it is always clear when one observes it with a balanced unbiased mind.\n\nThat would require global unity and the ability to recognize and snuff out hate. Much like how the nazi symbol was a symbol of global presence north east south and west, and became a symbol of antisemitism.

You can google the history of the word, and all the discussions state that part of the controversy is that there was a long period of time where it was used respectfully, as the standard word that both black and white people would use. Tons of civil rights pioneers used the word in a plain context, not the ironic one you describe. The word didn't start a trajectory to its current connotation until the 60s, and is still present in the names of several prominent organizations. Much in the way the NAACP wasn't using \"colored people\" ironically or offensively, but because it was the standard, respectful word at the time. I remember the 2010 census story where people were upset that the word was included alongside \"black\" and \"african american\" because of the modern context, and the reason given is that some portion of the older black people in the country still identify with it.\n\nAnyways, I've put in too much time to this, it's significantly detracted from my ability to lose money today, which is the whole point of this sub", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Come on.

{"title": "RKT: The Next 10 Bagger MEME Stock 🚀", "selftext": "You might want to say: \"Retard, there have been at least a dozen posts about RKT already.\" Well, there is some itsy bitsy tiny bit of new information...\n\n# Hold on to your butts 🚀\n\nYes, you might have seen the stock price climb to \\~$26 after IPO and fall back to $19 and not listened to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i8g3bq/buying_the_rkt_dip_is_an_absolute_nobrainer/) brilliant retard telling you not to sell the GODDAM stock. Maybe because you have read the \"sEeKinG alPhA aNaLysT\" giving it a \"meh\" rating.\n\nWell, in an effort to give you another chance on those sweet tendies, Rocket announced pre-earnings numbers, before the actual earnings date of September 2. This is what it looks like:\n\n* Quarterly earnings are up by 125% from the previous year with quarterly revenue of $5.31 billion. On an adjusted basis revenue is up by 300% over last year. The full report is [here](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rocket-comapanies-nyse-rkt-tries-to-lift-off-after-earnings-update/).\n* Adjusted net income is  $2.8 billion, which is an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the first quarter of 2020 and $2.6 billion compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the accountants among you, the full set of numbers are [here](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Rocket+Companies+%28RKT%29+Reports+Prelim.+Q2+Revenue+of+%245+Billion/17243861.html).\n* To put numbers into perspective this is a company with $2.4 billion float according to Google.\n* The stock was up 11.22% today and trading at around $23.8 at market close.\n\n# What does this all mean?\n\n* This is the parent company of Quicken Loans, it is essentially a FinTec company for mortgage refinancing, etc. Some argue that it is actually a tech company. They handle pretty much everything electronically via their website and app. This is important because of COVID-19. According to online [reviews](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/mortgages/rocket-mortgage), they have one of the best-streamlined and user-friendly interfaces.  You can do pretty much everything regarding financing your home without having to sit in a crowded office in your facemask.\n* Because of how user-friendly their apps are, they have sweet sweet margins: \"Who is going to do DD on home mortgages when you can do everything on an app. Am I right?\"\n* Interest rates are extremely low due to Fed intervention and it is to remain low for a very long while. Remember the famous [quote](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/fed-chairman-were-not-even-thinking-about-thinking-about-raising-rates-202006151341) from our lord and savior JPow: \"We're not thinking about raising rates, we're not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.\" For this reason, everyone and their mum are doing refinancing, buying homes, etc.\n* With a float of $2.4 billion, the company can have VERY significant price changes in a short time.\n* RKT is the ultimate meme ticker. \"RKT to the moon 🚀\" and \"REKT 🔥\" memes will keep us entertained for years to come while providing free advertisement for the company.\n* This is basically TurboTax of mortgages which is a [multi-trillion dollar market](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/u-s-mortgage-market-statistics-2019/).\n\n# FAQ for 🌈🐻\n\nQ: But what if the interest rates go back up tomorrow?\n\nA: It won't, as that would collapse the S&P 500 overnight. They have to keep interest rates low so that the money stays in the stock market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: This sounds like the next subprime mortgage crisis. What if people start defaulting on their mortgages?\n\nA: They are not the ones lending the money, so they don't care. They package the mortgages and hand it to someone else. They keep mortgages for only 3 weeks on average during the process, then they are off the hook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: Aren't there other mortgage companies with online services?\n\nA: Yes, but nothing this streamlined and easy to use. And they have very good brand recognition with the Rocket brand and Quicken Loans. Again, it is like TurboTax: yes there is other tax software out there, but who cares?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: But the stock price does not reflect the fundamentals. Didn't it crash last week and then stall?\n\nA: Yes there was some price discovery after IPO and you would have been right up until Monday of this week. But since the pre-earnings announcement, the stock price is picking up some serious steam. Once the mainstream media catches on and price exceeds the ATH (probably tomorrow), this will go to the moon.

I love it, if you can get used to the complicated UI, I think IBKR is better by a mile. This is what some of the pro daytraders and small-to-medium-sized funds use. The margin rates are so low that, you can gain leverage on anything for a long time without paying options premiums, they also give a lot of margin if you have a portfolio account. Other benefits are full extended hours trading 4:00 AM to 8:00 PM. On many occasions, after a major news event I go and grab some stocks at 4 AM. I am on the west coast so it is only 1 AM for me. They also do not sell the order flow to HFT and their order execution is top-notch (great prices when you buy and sell). Also one of the best brokerage rates for futures and options. One downside will be if you do not trade often, they charge you a monthly fee for data, which will vary between 5-25 USD depending on trade frequency and account size, etc. The other downside is that, there are no margin calls, if the account loses a lot of value and you are leveraged to the teeth, they will start liquidating positions. To me this is not a negative thing, I see it as a safety net against retardation (you can't lose more than what you own this way). I think they have a referral system, PM me if you want a link.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "what do you mean extended hours 4am to 8pm? Are you saying you can buy a stock at an after hour price?

Are you saying for IBKR, you can lock in a price? So if you put in the order for Apple immediately after the market closes at lets say $500 and then it opens up at $550, you get the $500 price? If so, that is crazy, I didn't know any brokerage allows that.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No, what you are referring to is buy at market open. Trading actually continues during these extended hours, i.e. there are actual buy and sell orders and price fluctuation.

For example Etrade allows it but it is only 7am to 8pm, I think RH offers only 9 AM to 6 PM. It is not meant for regular trading cause the volume is a fraction of the day volume, volatility is huge, even a small purchases move the price a lot.

{"title": "Love you guys - more than you will ever know - hence the warning. The market is dying.", "selftext": "# \"This Is NOT Normal\": A Stunned Morgan Stanley Says Volumes Are \"Way Beyond Just Low\"\n\nWhile stocks have soared to new all time highs, there has been one aspect about this latest meltup that suggests the rally is built on nothing but hot air (and trillions in Fed liquidity injections of course): the complete lack of volume, prompting some to wonder if the Fed has finally succeeded in 'killing' the market. And sure enough, as Morgan Stanley's Rob Cronin writes in an overnight note, \"**this is NOT a typical August lull in liquidity.\"** \n\n### The Market Has Died\n\nThe MS team points out that **volumes across almost all products are way below historic seasonal averages.** Which is bizarre because this is on the back of the highest volume Jan-to-July we have seen since 2010 (except single name options where volumes were the worst Jan-July since 2010). As the bank explains, the exaggerated August drop in liquidity (leading to higher impact costs) is driven by:\n\n1. large amounts of trading behind us in 2020\n2. spot level in equities \\~65% recovered\n3. in options, vol levels are still too high for many directional funds.\n\nThe exception is cash equities where volumes are only slightly below August norms, bid/offer spreads are not wide and data shows more intraday trading vs. closing auction use than normal - indicative of more active trading in single names, which in turn suggests that retail trading remains solid. The rest of August is likely to remain subdued as seasonally volumes are unlikely to pick up until the first week of September.\n\n*Below we republish key excerpts from the MS note:*\n\nWe look at liquidity across 6 products and compare average volumes traded from Aug 1st to 18th from 2010 to now.\n\n* Over the last 10Y, SX5E futures would typically have traded an average \\~$41bn a day so far in August. This year it’s just $29bn (-**28% lower than normal August levels**).\n* SX5E index options traded an average of just 639k contracts/day so far in August, -**48% below normal levels.** 20d volumes this low were last seen in 2013.\n* From 1st to 18th August 2019, SX5E dividend futures traded $380m/day – this year it’s just $84m **(-62% vs. normal Aug levels).**\n\nCash equities stands out as being more ‘normal’, registering volumes that are only slightly below historic norms for this time of year. SX5E traded on average $12bn/day in August (-10% below seasonal norms) and SXXP traded $39bn (-4% below seasonal norms).\n\nChart on the left breaks out SX5E futs vs. cash volumes (the cash volumes include data across all execution venues). We can see the drop in futures volumes is more pronounced as cash. Chart on the right shows the volume difference from Aug 1st to 18th of 2020 vs. the average of the same period of the last 10Y. The actual ADV for this year is marked on each bar. Again, you can see here the relatively better cash volumes vs. other products for this timeWith the exception of dividend futures (where notional traded is typically <0.5% of equity futs), **the biggest seasonal drop in volumes has come in SX5E index options where 20d MA volumes just hit levels last seen in 2013** (left chart below). In the last 5 days, we traded $5bn of combined put/call delta per day vs. \\~$12bn/day 5Y average. Over-writing programs appear as active as ever, but non-directional volatility selling strategies (var sellers) and directional option users are less active.\n\nSingle name options had the WORST Jan-July of volumes since 2010 – totally at odds with other asset classes. In March, the ratio of notional SX5E index option notional volume traded vs. notional traded in SX5E single names reached 37x – a 10Y high (we have adjusted the SX5E single name basket to allow for index rebals through time). The ratio has since fallen to 15x (right chart below) driven by the drop in index. Both SNO and index option volumes are <1st %-ile vs. 2010.\n\nSeparately, MS also notes that in Q1 2020, **bid offer spreads in cash hit new highs.** The average SX5E name traded \\~12bps wide at their worst (vs. Jan 1st level of 3bps) while the Small Cap SCXP index names traded as high as 32bps wide (vs. Jan 1st level of 12bps). The good news is that spreads have tightened by \\~80% since with the indices now trading 4bps and 15bps wide respectively, which is a \"sign of normality in cash\", at least until the next time the market goes bidless.\n\nFinally, at the SX5E/SXXP level, use of the closing auction has fallen sharply in the last month. It’s likely that those trading cash equities are more active/intraday players. This is supported further by the fact that key cyclical sectors are seeing the least use of the auction over the last week (Banks use is just 13%, 1st percentile vs. 2012).  \n\n\nSummary - The ‘market’ is an illusion. Lots of option trading but no one buying stonks with cash. I.e. putting their dicks on the table. Prices being driven up daily to fantastic new highs. No one is selling. Part is FOMO paralysis, but much is institutional investors whose behaviour is formulaic, not knowing what the hell to do. So doing nothing.   \n\n\nLook, a ‘normal, healthy‘  market has bulls and gay bears. Ying and Yang. Real money going in to buy and hold, real money flowing out to other things. Right now is a terribly easy market to pump and dump. No depth. A purple market. A corn market. Corn!!!?   \n\n\nThe market right now is vapour. The Fed IS the market. Do you trust the Fed? Sure, the merry go round could continue for some time. Who knows?   \n\n\nTLDR: The party is over. Like many I lost the window of opportunity between March and July. Could kick myself.

I've seen many others say that most of the time you should sell the options contract rather than exercising it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Correct, you would just sell the options contract to the open market. It will get exercised eventually, by the institution or person who is holding it, if it is in the money enough for it to be profitable. The only reason you may not make as much by selling the contract is if the underlying stock keeps going up after you sold. So if you had a call expiring Friday, that is currently in the money and you sold it to the market at a profit at 3:50pm, the stock could surge up at 3:55 and you missed out on those profits. But it’s a good idea to sell and get out of the position. \n\nIf you had a call that was ITM that expires on Friday, and you forgot to sell before market close, your broker would probably auto-exercise the contract after hours before the contract officially expires. So let’s say you had a 35C contract expiring Friday and the stock closed at 40 on Friday. If you still hold the contract, your broker will auto exercise meaning you will pay $3500 and gain possession of 100 shares of the company. Even if you don’t have $3500 cash in your account, they could exercise it and put you in the negative. Then on Monday you could sell the 100 shares for $4000 and you would reimburse the $3500 in the negative your account was. \n\nBut what if something happens over the weekend and that stock opened Monday morning at $20 a share? You would have paid $3500 for shares Friday that are now only worth $2000. It’s safer to sell the contract to the open market. Of course, on the flip side, the stock could open up at $50 on Monday and you’ll be glad you exercised and didn’t sell the contract off. I wouldn’t recommend exercising a contract if you don’t have the capital to pay for the shares, because you’re still on the hook for the exercise price no matter what the shares do by Monday.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOf course, if you’re long term bullish on the company anyways, and you’re okay buying at $35 by exercising, and you have the capital available, you could exercise and hold onto those 100 shares as long as you want to. If you sold the option back to the market the day of expiration, you locked in your profits, and limited any risk/reward associated with the stock going forward. If you had $3500 available and exercised the option, and held those shares, you are staying invested in the price action of that stock, but in this case it would become a basic equity investment.\n\nIf we are to ignore this strategy, there is no circumstance where exercising an option and immediately selling the shares on the open market would be **more** or **less** profitable than selling the contract off. If it momentarily became more profitable to exercise, then trading algorithms would immediately detect an arbitrage opportunity, and would buy contracts on the open market, instantaneously exercising them and selling the shares at a profit. This action itself would drive the option’s price up and would eliminate the arbitrage opportunity.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "ahh ok this is all really helpful, so the only cost would be the premium in beginning which in this case is 100 times the bid price?

I just found somebody willing to pay for the contract I’m holding, and it offset the premium I paid that I will never get back.

They could buy the option from you, and 2 seconds later it drops below $40 and becomes worthless. Why would a trader take on this risk for the potential return of 2 cents? So nobody would buy it necessarily. The theta value (value of the option associated with the time left till exp) overpowered the small intrinsic value of the ITM option.\n\nIn this case, you would be holding the 40C until it expires.
