{"title": "Developed a Tool that Analyzes Options Flow to make Predictions | BABA, MSFT, SPCE, AAL, JPM", "selftext": "A data scientist here. Recently developed a tool that analyzes options flow from the entire day to make short term predictions of 1-5 days. Wanted to share some of the alerts for the next week with you folks. Please let me know if this is something that everyone likes here and if I should continue it.\n\nThe tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes. Happy to talk more about how the tool works.\n\nBullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the  current  close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means  the stock is expected to stay the same or go low in the next few  days. The definitions are a bit loose but the stock usually makes a decent amount in reality.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$BABA**   \\- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving   average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).\n\n**$CHWY**   \\- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if   it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))\n\n**$MSFT** \\- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.\n\n**$TWLO**   \\- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it  stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool  is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$SPCE**   \\- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a   week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can   break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))\n\n**$AAL** \\- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**   with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it   breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance   level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))\n\n**$SRNE**   \\- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool   and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to   follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down   at some time.\n\n**$JPM** \\- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))\n\n**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.** \n\nHappy to chat more about how everything works. Please do let me know if this is something folks here would want on daily basis.

Currently have around 40 gb of data, would love some ideas on how to put it to use.\n\nEDIT: the system runs daily, ingesting a max of around 1.25 gb of data depending on volume of that particular day. I am trying to improve it every day and am building a nice web dashboard that shows me everything going on. Next step is real-time which is slightly more challenging as it involves getting some kind of live websockets feed from a set of brokers to get a diverse dataset. I am mostly looking at weekly strategies these days so the real-time aspect is not a huge focus, but it will be in the coming months. Also collecting the time-series dataset of all the underliers to have some mechanism to compare the derivs to the underliers. Lastly, I collect around 5 GB of news data every day. All of this stuff is useful for backtesting, but having a reactive system to trade on is much more useful.

My understanding is that when I sell a put, I get paid a premium (credit) when someone buys it.  Does that premium go immediately into my account's available cash?  Or is it somehow tied up in the position?  For example, if I sell a put contract at $1, do I immediately get $100 cash deposited in my account?\n\n2. Then my next point of confusion is after I sold the put, my broker shows that I have a position of -1, and the position appears to be worth some dollar amount based on the contract's current price.  What the heck is this?  Why is this position worth some value?  For example, if my -1 position shows it is now worth $50, if I were to close the position, would I make another $50 (ignoring fees)?  And how does that $50 relate to the premium I got when I sold the put?  Is the $50 added to the premium I got when selling it, making my total profit $150 ($100 premium + $50 when closing the position)?  Can this position value ever exceed the premium?  Can it ever go negative?  If it can go negative and went way negative, could it exceed the premium I got, resulting in a net loss when the position is closed?\n\n3. Next, why do I even have to \"close\" this position at all?  I already got my $100 premium, right?  Can't I just forget about the contract, let it expire and move on?  I realize that I'm on the hook to buy 100 shares if the buyer exercises it, but if it expires, what happens to the value of the position (discussed in question 2 above)?  Does the broker just keep it or something?  Would I still keep the premium?\n\n4. Last, let's take a hypothetical situation where there are only 2 people in the universe.  I sell one put contract to the other person and collect my premium.  I now have a -1 position on my broker.  Next, before the contract either expires or is exercised, I decide to close the position.  Would it even be possible?  I would have to buy 1 put to get back to 0, but remember that there is only 1 other person in this universe, and we already have a contract and he doesn't want to give it up.

There might be higher profit potential in better bid-ask but where does it add value to the long naked option contract?\n\nA narrow spread is more cost efficient. Compare a $1.00/$1.02 spread to a $1.00/$2.00 spread.  If you buy at the asking price and immediately turn around and sell at the bid, you lose more money with the wider spread. No one actually does this in practice, but it illustrates why a wider spread is detrimental. \n\nIn practice, the further the bid and ask are from your ideal price, the longer it will take to get a fill, because there is less competitive pressure to make better offers. The guy asking for $2 doesn't have to worry about being underbid by someone who wants the trade more.\n\nWhen you are closing a trade, let's say $1.50 or higher is profitable vs. the $1/$2 spread. That's a pretty big $0.50 gap to for buyers to leap and you may wait a long time to make a profitable close.\n\nPricing models like BSM influence the market, but ultimately it's the market who makes the final determination on price. If there are only 3 orders out there defining prices (very low volume), it's not going to resemble the BSM or other pricing model very closely.\n\n> 2) Just checking again: Also for monthly long options, the volume one month before exp might be low but I can expect this volume to increase as it gets closer to exp right?\n\nVolume is more strongly related to moneyness than expiration, though beyond 60 days it does fall off for all strikes. The ATM strike for a popular underlying will have good volume all the way out to 60 days and beyond.\n\n> 3) Is there a way to normalize IV with vega or some other option metric? So instead of using IV tank or percentile, is there a way get a number from IV, vega, and the premium that I can use to compare with other options?\n\nWell, maybe. Vega is highest ATM and furthest from expiration (declines as you approach expiration). The charts in this PDF help visualize how vega works: http://people.math.gatech.edu/~shenk/OptionsClub/vegaTalk.pdf\n\nJust like for theta, the impact of IV and vega declines as the extrinsic value declines, so if you take the same delta strike across the comparison -- that's critically important, since moneyness is a key factor for vega and IV -- and compare extrinsic value/|vega|, that might give you a somewhat useful comparison.

One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.\n\nFor Chinese companies—such as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.—that want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm “with comparable resources and experience” that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.\n\nThe new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.\n\nDetails of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6. This responds to a June 4 memorandum by President Trump directing the PWG to come up with plans to address the problem.\n\n\n\n[Thomson Reuters Tax & Accounting  ](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/trump-administration-seeks-to-delist-u-s-listed-chinese-companies-for-blocking-audit-inspections/)\n\n-I just saw this right now, just to add to the conversation.

{"title": "The technical background to Intel's problems.", "selftext": " \n\nSince its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future.\n\n**Lithography techniques**\n\nLithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [\\[1\\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).\n\nOver time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\\[2\\]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.\\[3\\] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. \\[4\\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice…\n\nOther terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together)\n\n**The problems with 10nm**\n\nBack in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. \\[5\\] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. \n\n(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)  \n\n\nSince you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build.\n\nOf course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that \n\n1) they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS\n\n2) The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. \n\nThese are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.\n\nWhen you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture \\[6\\], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm \\[7\\] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.\\[8\\] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken.\n\n**7nm and beyond**\n\nSo now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. \n\nThere’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.\\[9\\] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays).\n\nThe second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. \\[10\\] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \\[11\\] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. \n\n\\[12\\] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.\n\nBeyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/) As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] [http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html) \n\n\\[2\\][Dennard,  R., Gaensslen, F., Hwa-Nien Yu, Rideout, V., Bassous, E. and Leblanc,  A., 1999.

Same thing happened to AMD when they spun off Global Foundries.\n\nThere's also a big issue with executives thinking they can hire their way to innovation and fire their way to profitability.  It's an open secret in the tech industry that the more senior you become, the more likely you are to be fired due to the salary you command.  The way the bean counters see it is \"Hey, these senior folks are costing us a lot of money, lets bring on a bunch of cheap interns, train them with the seniors, and then fire the seniors.\"\n\nThe problem?  It takes YEARS to gain the experience needed to approach what (some) senior tech people are providing in value.  Further, people aren't fungible like bean counters think they are.

Now this might all sound a bit pedantic, but the reason I bring it up is that it means that moving from tri-gate to GaaFET is actually much less of a technological leap than going from FinFET to GaaFET, which is already much less of a leap than going from a classical MOSFET to FinFET. Moving forward it's really anyone's guess if any nodes further than 7nm will actually be possible, we're approaching some serious fundamental physical limits with Si and so it will be exciting to see where the industry goes. I'm not sure where the transistor industry is with the adoption of wide bandgap semiconductors but if scaling picks up with those we could eventually see considerably smaller devices in the future. The other billion dollar engineering problem is heat management, processors have been stuck at or around the 4 GHz mark for years now due to the inability of Si to dissipate heat at higher frequencies. Whether this is achieved through new materials (once again wide bandgap SCs like SiC do this much better) or exotic materials processing (thermal bandgap materials are an interesting new area of research) I think building transistors that can operate faster may be the path the tech development takes in the future.\n\nAnyways I'm rambling, I don't get to talk this stuff too often and thought you might appreciate these thoughts.

The current challenge with thermal bandgap materials is that materials often have several different phonon wavelengths that can exist in the material, so if you make a film with thickness equal to one phonon wavelength it won't likely block phonons with a different wavelength.

AMDs advantage in power and efficiency doesn't matter much when folks are plugged in....And in a year they will be able to use all that profit to get to 5-7nm working.  This cycle has been typical for intel, as why spend more money if you dont have to.  Let others spend the R&D getting 5-7nm working, buy the tech from the equipment manufacturers when it's ironed out and cheaper....then dominate the market without the overhead AMD has to pay TSMC....i've been slowly swapping my AMD stocks i bought several years ago for INTC since the drop, ez money in a couple years...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "BTW, TSMC is building 3 more 7nm/5nm fabs right now(2021 online), and 2 more under planning(2022/23).

Anyone who makes their products at TSMC has to share it's profits with TSMC, and the more volume and faster you want your hot product the more you have to share.  Good luck out spending Apple for fab capacity.  Waiting 6months to a year to implement a technology node is actually a huge cost savings for intel's bulk products as they dont have to pay for the development and the equipment cost come way down.  Also note there are significantly diminishing returns at each node and exponentially increasing costs to implement them, because of this there most likely will not be a \"3nm or below\" for a very long time.  Intel could drop the price of their chips below what AMD could be profitable making theirs at TSMC anytime it wants, they dont do it because they know AMD wont be able to make chips in volume so they are no real threat and last time they did that(when AMD had fabs) they got in trouble for monopolistic practices....Intel had nothing to fear from AMD.

{"title": "Investing vs Trading: A reminder of tax implications", "selftext": "*TOP EDIT:* This post has gotten a lot more attention than I expected. Due to some critiques posted in this thread, let me preface this post with this statement: Please consult your own personal and trusted tax professional. Don't believe anything you read on the internet without verifying all the information yourself. Tax code in the US is complicated, and this post is primarily US focused. The information in here may be over simplified, but its meant to get people thinking about the implications of various trading activities on their taxable income. Its better to start now thinking about your 2020 tax burden rather than in December when you can't do anything about it.\n\n = = =\n\nWe've seen lots of posts recently from \"new\" investors freaking out over recent dips in the market and deciding whether they should get in or out. This is just a quick little post (and reminder) that anyone buying stocks should remind themselves about the impact of taxes on the trades their making.\n\nLets take the most recent meme stocks example: FSLY and NET\n\nLets assume you bought FSLY and NET on July 1 because you felt bullish going into the July 4th weekend. You would have bought Net at $37 and FSLY at $86.50.\n\nNow lets assume that you were smart enough to get out at the peak, which was August 4 for both stocks. FSLY would have sold for $116 and Net for $42.50. That means a 34% gain on FSLY and 15% gain on NET.\n\nBut here's something you should ALWAYS think about: if you sell you need to subtract 34% for the tax man since that holding was less than 1 year and it is taxed as income. So your 34% gain on FSLY is actually a 22% gain, and your 15% gain on NET is actually a 10% gain.\n\nNow lets do the numbers:\n\nIf you held FSLY for 1 year (until July 1, 2021), you only needed to get it to a price of $105 (not $116) to make the same money. For NET you had to hit a price of $40.70 (not $42.50).\n\nKeep all this in perspective when you look to \"take profits\" or \"should I keep holding my stock\".\n\nAlso, this DOES NOT take into effect the reallocation of capital. If you only have $100 to play with, and you bought FSLY at $86.50, holding for 1 year could be opportunity cost on other potential plays. In that case, you probably fucked up in timing your entry and exist. If you only have $100 to play, then what were your objectives on a stock that is already up 400% in 3 months? Did you expect another 100% movement after earnings because you prayed to JPow for more stimulus?\n\nBe realistic and critical about each move. These \"the stock is down, what should I do?\" posts are getting old. Here's a better question that should be posted to this sub: \"The stock is down to X, which is Y times the revenue to market cap ratio. I've done this research to indicate that the company can grow at this rate, which doesn't align to analysts. What are other people's opinion of my research so that I can more accurately assess my own personal price target for this stock I own, or am planning to own\" </rant>\n\n\n**Edit:** Based on some of the comments below, I think its important we clarify that America has a graduated tax system: https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/\n\nEffective tax rates for someone making $150,000 a year would be around 20% for federal income tax. Beyond that, I think its also important to know that long term capital gains tax is a graduated system where most people would be at 15% step: \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp\n\nIf you're single filing tax payer, and you're making $150,000 a year, then the difference between selling short term and long term is more like 5%. Sell now and realize the gains as income (ie. 20% effective tax rate) or hold and sell later to realize the gains as capital gains (ie. < 15% effective tax rate). The question is, can you reliably put up gains via trading that exceed that 5% buffer. If you cannot, then buy and hold. If you can, then trade!\n\n**Edit2:** In addition to taxes, I think to be a better trader, every person at the end of the year should do a comparison of what every stock they bought/sold would have netted them if they had just bought and held. Obviously, this assumes infinite capital since you can't do any reallocation. But it would be a good exercise! Spend a couple hours calculating how much money you made doing trading, then compare it to if you had just bought a couple of good movement stocks (ie. reliable like AAPL, MSFT, or more volatile like SHOP, SQ, TSLA) and just held them. Replaying trades is important, and understanding the tax implications of each strategy, and then weigh that against how much time and effort it took to trade. If the numbers don't add up, change up your strategy.", "id": "i782wm", "created_utc": 1597076900.0, "score": 613, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 559, "replies": [{"body": "This.

I've been following the market before the huge drop began last december, and it's so ridiculous now that there isn't really a point to stop limits when companies with a 25 billion dollar market cap go up or down 6% in a single day.\n\nOn my 1st month of paper trading I focused on the Materials sector:\n\nOn 5th of July 2020:\n\n1. Ecolab inc (ECL) - entry at $200.7, exit at $220.0\n2. Eastman Chemical (EMN) - entry at $69.9, exit at $77.00\n3. International Paper (IP) - entry at $35.35 , exit at $38.88\n4. Lyondellbasell industries (LYB) - entry at $66.96, exit at $73.64\n5. Nocor corp (NUE) - entry at $41.40, exit at $45.54\n6. Westrock corp (WRK) - entry at $28.2, exit at $31.02\n\n\\----\n\nI also look up the wikipedia page for each company, the P/E ratio, and the market cap, I also stay away from penny stocks. In my process of checking the companies I go 1 year back, 1 month, and 1 week. I believe that with the lowered taxes in my country, and with the proper stop losses and spread of companies (hopefully when things calm down a little and stocks stop moving 6% a day, I could pick 20 stocks a month instead of 6).\n\n\\---\n\nNow back to the 1st month of paper trading. on July 27th I \"sold\" all my shares with a 4.74% profit post taxes (of all the gains + losses averaged, considering I started at 100%, I was now at 104.74%).\n\nAnd I made a new portfolio straight away and \"sold\" all my shares today with a 5.38% post taxes profit.\n\n\\---\n\nLike I said I'm 17, so my top priority at the moment is getting a job, I found a fast food place that could give me $1200 a month at full time, I could get to $12,000 in 10 months, and then I will hopefully start investing after a year of paper trading. (And actually get $1580 a month from the job at this point, for 6 months before joining the army). And once I reach $24,000 my mother would give me $12,000 she saved for my education.\n\nSo all of what I just said paired with that average 6% a month is $330k by 21, and by 23 It's $1.3M dollars. And at that point I plan to quit and put it all in some index fund returning an average 7% a year (post taxes), re-invest 3.25% back to counter inflation, and live off 3.75% of $1.3M, or $4100 a month.\n\n\\----\n\nI really hope you put in the time to actually read this super long message, and my current average pace is 8.3% a month.

There has been a surge in interest in EV stocks, and evidence suggests that many people are looking to invest in \"the next Tesla\", the presumption being that they somehow missed out on TSLA. Even though Tesla continues to grow rapidly, to the many investors who don't understand the relationship of stock price, market cap, and growth, the high price for a share means TSLA is \"too expensive\". So using a share split to reduce the price per share means that many of these \"next Tesla\" investors will buy TSLA instead of the alternatives.\n\nTesla was likely thinking of a share split anyway, but the recent increase in reverse mergers /  IPOs and investor reaction to them likely encouraged Tesla to accelerate the timing of the split to take advantage of the opportunity and become more competitive relative to their rivals. That would follow a pattern of behavior for Tesla - for example, following the recent surge in interest in rival semi trucks and pickup trucks, Elon started sending out tweets that were viewed as increased emphasis on getting Tesla Semi and Cybertruck to market (and it's possible that the timing of the Gigafactory Austin announcement had a similar motivation).\n\nSteven Mark Ryan's [August 11 Solving the Money Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMnMx6kYlOE) discusses the possible bubble in \"next TSLA\" stocks.\n\nRob Maurer's [August 11 Tesla Daily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HWkZW5Pvo4) discusses many pros and a few cons of a stock split, including the psychological effects of share price especially among small investors, and a split as a statement of confidence by management.", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good point.
