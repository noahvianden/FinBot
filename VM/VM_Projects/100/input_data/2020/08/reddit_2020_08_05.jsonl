{"title": "Take advantage of the overreaction!", "selftext": "The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend.\n\nWhile Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. \n\nThere is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia’s Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia’s growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product’s architecture be. \n\nConcerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. \n\nFor investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny.\n\n**TLDR**: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price.

Intel chose this route as opposed to EUV, which TSMC chose (incidentally, Intel are trying to use EUV on their own 7nm, which should show you which decision was right). The structure of quad patterning means that it is inherently prone to lower yields. When you combine this with the monolithic structure of Intel's CPUs, it will be impossible for them to produce high core-count chips (i.e. server/TOTL desktop) in any volume with the margins that they've seen historically. No amount of +++++++ will change this fact. I said two years ago that 10nm would be a complete writeoff and I stand by that today.\n\nYour point about IP is very valid. In my models I forecast that AMD will have very little share in the datacentre GPUs (but AMD has their own raytracing implementation coming out with the new consoles; which imo will be more efficient than Nvidia's due to Microsoft writing DXR with AMD's hardware in mind), but their IP helps out massively in the CPU arena. It'll be very difficult for Intel to build a competitor to chiplets without infringing on patents - which is the only way 10nm could be viable.\n\nAs for taking people at face value:\n\n[https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017](https://www.eweek.com/pc-hardware/intel-confirms-delay-in-10nm-processors-to-2017)\n\nIntel have announced delays to 10nm by 'a year' for every year since 2016. I don't see anything that would suggest 7nm is anything different.\n\n[https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313343-rumor-tsmc-wont-build-new-capacity-for-intel-views-orders-as-temporary)\n\nTSMC views Intel and AMD completely differently. It's very much in their favour to help AMD out as much as possible with wafer supply, and limit Intel's own production. AMD's long term success ensures growth for TSMC; while Intel's long term success would mean they reclaim the process crown and constrict TSMC's market share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree that AMD is highly priced right now - they're above my valuation for the first time ever, while Intel is slightly underpriced. However, in the past few years AMD have consistently executed on their roadmaps, increasing their value while Intel has constantly screwed up, decreasing theirs. It's very possible that you buy into Intel now, while its' price> value, but then value decreases as they continue to fail and your price is never realised.\n\nTLDR: The big picture is that 10nm is a total writeoff, and 7nm is looking pretty shoddy as well. They bit off more than they could chew trying to get GaaFets to work. Intel's dominance and past price has been built on its process lead, and losing that lead and having to go to TSMC who will treat them poorly justifies a large drop in price.

Plenty of companies fail or have weak numbers at first and go on to become world leaders in their sector, and tons of companies start with a bang only to fail miserably in the long run. \n\nTik tok is a very strong platform with many users, but there are some glaring problems that people are ignoring. Aside from security issues and the whole debacle with the US government, the app just doesn’t have the longevity that people think it does. Yes, it is huge in China (hence the inflated numbers compared to social media apps popular in the US, most of which are banned there), but it relies heavily on a randomized algorithm and a demographic that is constantly moving onto the next thing that is better and more exciting. Look at what happened with Vine. I feel that in order for a social media platform to continue in the long run, it has to actively contribute in some way to society. People love content sure but the reason Facebook is such a powerhouse is it’s more than just an app to share things and talk to people nowadays. Instagram/Facebook are so successful and won’t fail is because they were able to transition themself to service businesses as well. Personally, I find a lot of my clients directly on Instagram (film + media industry). \n\nDo you honestly think Tik Tok will be able to transition in the same way?

Millennials back then were seen the same way as gen z now. Shit, every new generation that is in their teens- early twenties is considered the same exact way: no attention span and move on quickly to the next hot thing. \n\nThis wasn’t an argument between fb and tik tok. It’s an argument between Instagram before fb and tik tok now. Before FB bought out Instagram, instagram was basically the “tik tok” at the time and FB was the “Instagram” at the time. Facebook evolved into an advertising tool that small-large business use and less of a social media app, and Instagram was pushed as its main social media posting platform \n\nWhile vine and tik tok share many similarities in terms of their platform, the main difference is the sheer exposure and media attention tik tok has gained that vine never reached before. This in of itself attracts more sponsors and more advertisers. \n\nTik tok can easily transition into what Instagram does now. They really don’t need to revolutionize what they are doing. I think it’s unfair to say that this platform is just the next hot thing that attracts younger audiences  and will phase out in the short term (of course I agree that longevity is an issue now because of the banning issue.

Honestly their status as a startup doesn’t seem scammy at all. Milton does seem whacky but he’s basically the “personality” to NKLA. Strong twitter presence, social media, hype man, sales dude. They have a different guy as CEO, a Tesla/Toyota vet in charge of manufacturing, and a whole bunch of employees and engineers. They have contracts with Bosch, Iveco, and a new H2 supplier, Nel. They also are providing trucks to businesses that have already put in orders (Budweiser). \n\nSure, most of their stuff are renderings and intangible analyses (they do have working semis).

Probably not IMO, but right now it’s priced for future valuation which, to me, sounds like a pretty cool prospect. \n\nA lot of this stuff is the same stuff I heard when TSLA was first starting out.

The general premise of their business model is quite good. Big players like Daimler and Volvo are already developing FCEV semi-trucks. It could very well be the future for freighters. Personally I’m expecting fuel economy measures to increase for semi-trucks in particular big time. NKLA would be right in the middle of that.

While this might be good progress (not a battery expert), it doesn’t excite me as being something revolutionary. \n\nSo either they are sandbagging information or battery day is probably more about the speed at which they can manufacture batteries with project Roadrunner rather than some big breakthrough in battery density/cost.

Tesla is going to be announcing something new, otherwise they wouldn’t need a battery day. Project roadrunner has nothing to do with Panasonic. Tesla will continue purchasing Panasonic 2170 cells for Model 3/y\n3.\twhile I do believe that there will be significant density/cost improvements for roadrunner cells, as well as longevity (million mile battery, which in my opinion is the least exciting of the battery day announcements) the biggest deal will be the speed at which they can produce both the cells, and the new cell manufacturing lines, which will lead to significant cost reductions as well as eliminating their cell constraint.\n4.\tMy speculation on cost/density, is that they will be able to come in below $100/kWh at the pack level, which no one else in the industry is even close to. I think there is a 60%+ chance that they will announce that they are already there with the pilot line, and the remaining 40% chance is that they announce they will be there when they move to actual production lines. \n5.\tEven if battery day itself doesn’t rocket the stock (I think it will) it will enable the stock to rocket by enabling all of their future growth, way ahead of schedule.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Model 3&Y are the meat and potatoes though.

Low-cost batteries would certainly be required for CyberTruck and Semi coming in 2021.\n\nThey could use the current cell supply towards stationary energy storage, don’t have to give up on them.\n\nI just thought battery day was going to be earth shattering and we would see Tesla becoming the indisputable leader for the foreseeable future (they already are in many ways, but thought it would be evident to bears too). \n\nStill bullish AF on Tesla’s future, just not going to bet my house on battery day option calls is all I’m trying to say.

I bought it still, to provide Taylor with some liquidity to get himself an education. After he gets his education, I told him that he can buy his car back and I won’t even charge him interest or anything. \n\nAndy’s daughter, Sara, just turned 17 a few weeks ago. Big birthday party and everything. She wanted to treat herself to a new car. So I’m going to give Sara a loan to buy her brothers car from me while Taylor isn’t using it. I’ll charge her for the service I’m providing, but just a little bit. With only a $900(10%) down payment she’s getting a hell of a deal and she knows it. Because her father told her the interest rate I’m charging her is unheard of. \n\nEveryone’s happy. \n\nSara makes her payments. \n\nTaylor finishes school, gets a good job, and is now ready to give me my $9,000 back so he can continue his improved life. \n\nI ask Sara to sell her(Taylor’s) car back to me. But she can’t. Because while Taylor was in school, interest rates returned to normal, her car deprecated 15%. So if she sells the car back to me, she will be losing out on all of that low interest, and would still owe me $450. She will have to go out and buy another car at a higher interest rate, which she can’t afford. She actually can’t even afford to pay me the depreciated $450, because she was already maxed out on her D:I ratio. So I take the car back and put her in debt, freezing her ability to temporarily move forward with her life. Taylor buys his car back for $9000(without depreciation). I now charge him the increased interest rate, and once he officially purchases it, he will lose $450 on depreciation. He will do just fine, but his sister on the other hand, she has no money to spend on things that she wants because she has no money to even buy the things she needs. GDP will have everything needed to operate seamlessly, except for people with liquidity. The only way to liquidate the people at that point, is to reduce supply to match demand. \n\nAndy=USA\nTaylor=Banks/Corps\nSara=General Populous \nMe=JPow", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Go ahead and ban him already.

{"title": "🚨🚨🚨 Incoming rug pull and how to play it for maximum tendies.", "selftext": "Yes I know what you're thinking Autist, as you sit on your gaming chair sipping your choccy milk. \"I've seen all these 🐻 posts before and stonks kept going up, printer goes BRRRRRR\"\n\nFundamentals haven't mattered for months, and except for some sharp pullbacks, NQ and SPY have all been on an absolute tear being instabid on every dip.\n\nThat's all about the change.\n\nTldr - bond market/ PM pricing in no deal on stimulus.\n- Bifurcation of NQ and SPY reached major tipping points.\n- DXY likely to bounce back strongly on risk off sentiment and foreign central bank action.\n- macro long term positioning for Inflation playing out across asset class correlations ( RUSSELL and value stocks starting to gain traction )\n\n1.\nPriced In has become a retarded meme at this point but what does it actually mean? It means basically that the market, chiefly big 💰 / institutions are expecting a future outcome ( or probability of one) and have allocated money appropriately. Historically Fixed Income due to its relative size has been a fairly reliable indicator. Previous crashes this year such as Feb/March crash and the mini NQ/SPY crash in June and July were both foreshadowed by major/ high Vol shifts downwards in 10 year bond prices .\n\nCurrently 10 year are plumbing new lows at the bottom end of 0.50 percent ( discounting the March flash crash ). This coupled with the meteoric rise in GLD and SLV last night IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. The sharp changes occured directly after stimulus news. \n\nWhat this means is that Institutions are signalling a chance the package will not be passed on time or in its entirety . \n\nBUT BUT VIX IS DOWN AND EQUITIES ARE UPPIES!\nyes little autismo, they are but that doesn't mean what you think it does. it's a poorly kept secret that this market is being kept afloat by hedge funds , institutional buying and retail fomo. I don't have the crayons or time to explain it to you but just look at news releases, support level buying and virus/ trade talks pumps. Vix being low doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does either. To oversimplify VIX goes up when more people buy puts. This is typically done to hedge against market drops. \nBig players don't need to hedge if they SOLD all/ most of their equity holdings and moved it into Bonds/ Gold / Foreign equity. Hedge funds are also notorious for shorting VIX as part of the 'Fed Put \" trade . The fact that FI/PM are up while VIX is down makes me more certain of a drop not less as it means Big boys are trying to pass as many bags as they can to retail without spooking them.\n\n2. There's been a lot of articles on this already so I'll keep it short, you all know how to use Google. SPY since March lows has been split in two like a sociopathic Solomon. There is the big 5 tech and everything else. Currently Big 5 is sitting at 25 percent of all market cap with huge returns over the last few months. This coupled with the performance differential of the other 495 has surpassed levels not seen since the dot com boom. THIS IS NOT SIGN OF A HEALTHY BULL MARKET. Major Bifurcation is the second best signifier of a 🐻 after the technical 20 percent drop level ( which doesn't really mean much) . 🍏 Has now become the largest company in the world surpassing Saudi Aramco. THIS TECH BOOM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. Most of the apple gains have been from a one of WFH structural shift and Fiscal stimulus ( that now accounts for 25 percent of all disposable income ). If the stimulus bill doesn't pass, Apple is fucked. Just look at the AAPL gains from the last week, do you think this is sustainable?\n\nThe common retort on this sub is, \" we all know it's a bubble but it will pop in few months, I'm getting my TENDIES while they're hot! \"\n\nThis sentiment has been thrown around for months all through April to July. Well what if months later is now? What better catalyst for a bubble pop than a Stimulus not going through as planned? \n\n3. There's been a lot of posts about DXY dying and a lot of it is half true. Currencies are a hard thing to predict but I do want to point out two very key factors that are bullish for DXY. \n3a- The entire world, especially emerging markets rely on Dollar inflows from exports to fund imports for key goods, especially commodities (oil etc). Global trade fell off a cliff in March and has barely recovered so where are countries getting dollars? By buying bonds . This was the reason behind the DXY spike to over 100 in March and the reason why the FX central bank swap program was instituted by JPOW. So unless you see global trade rebounding strongly in the very near term ( pigs will fly ) bonds will continue to be bid extremely strongly at auction, supporting DXY. \n\n3b) DXY as has been pointed out is primarily dropping due to Euro strength ( which makes up about 65 percent of the Index). When DXY is compared to the Bloomberg trade weighted dollar index you'll see it hasn't dropped far at all and this makes sense (see 3a above). The Euro bullish trend, along with AUD/USD,GBP/USD and JPY/USD is unlikely to continue much further. Foreign central banks and governments for that matter will not allow the dollar to crater. We've already seen rumblings from the EU and JPY on this front as exports are already in a tenuous position. The last thing foreign companies need is a strong currency to hamper export sales. So I wouldn't bet against the FED, but I sure as shit wouldn't be getting against the ECB.\n\nSummary: I don't see this stimulus playing out on time or in full. Big money is pricing in either a delay or being scaled back substantially to meet Republican demands. I won't go into the specifics of the political theatre because quite frankly it doesn't matter. PM/ BONDS are are all the signalling device you need.\n\nHow I see this playing out: The stimulus bill will pass on few weeks after a substantial Rug pull, similar to the 2008 TARP fiasco. I would strongly recommend either holding cash or going long DXY while this plays out. Either buy the dip on GLD/SLV with leaps or go long TLT at like 180c.\n\nPositions : short MNQ 3 units at 10530 and 1 ES at 3220.

The market stabilized that summer in hopes of it passing, and when it didn't in September SPY dropped from like 125 to 90 - yikes! The rate of decline slowed once TARP was passed, and things turned around that winter.\n\nThe only issue with comparing today to TARP is the failure of TARP passing corresponded very closely with the Lehman brothers closing their doors. So everyone was jacked to the fucking tits on fear, and then TARP was delayed an epic rug pull followed. This was peak fear over a true financial collapse of the world's financial system.\n\nSo, I agree with you and I don't agree with you. I think a pull back will happen, but I don't think it will be significant enough to call it a rug pull. Maybe a 3-5% pull back max. Enough to make the new traders a little salty, but give us old folks a few chuckles. Peak fear and uncertainty passed in March for our current situation. The next hurdle to deal with is inflation once all this money that has been printed starts to circulate. Cash will not be king, and you had better find some assets to get your cash in to preserve your buying power.\n\nWith respect to your analysis of big tech and the comparison to the dot com bubble, that is blatantly false through and through. Big tech has the balance sheets to back up their valuations today. Because of covid, everyone flocked to them in droves to provide the technology and communication necessary to keep their businesses open. Amazon with a nation wide grocery delivery service ... I mean come on! Sure the PE ratios have inflated a little, but we aren't talking Yahoo at at a PE of 2500 in 1999. The rest of the economy will catch up once the gears start grinding, and this will happen in the fall after phase 3 vaccine data becomes available and a sense of future personal safety becomes more certain. \n\nIn terms of the dollar and swaps... I think you are completely correct in your analysis, but ignoring the effect of printing so much money. The dollar comes down to supply and demand and we are massively pumping up the supply right now, which means no matter how hard other governments try, the dollar is going to fall. As a side, since it's inception, the Euro was designed to be the world's financial standard, so of course the Euro is poised to look stronger than the dollar because they want to take the dollars place on the podium. This was the case in 08 too. The difference is once your currency is the world standard, it is your job to provide liquidity through swaps to prop up foreign central banks, and thus you are not only printing for yourself but you are also printing for others. All this is to say, the US dollar will continue to fall sharply as the economy starts running again and this huge glut of dollars floods the market. \n\nI do not think, however, the dollar is at risk of being replaced though. The euro sucks and the entire EU cannot take the place of the US economy or financial influence. The liquidity swaps and other burdens the US shoulders to keep foreign markets afloat ensures the dollar will remain the dominant currency into the next recession.\n\nFUUUUCK me I had a lot to say.
