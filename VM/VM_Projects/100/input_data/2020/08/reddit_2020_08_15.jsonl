I'm not specifically tracking it.  As a shareholder it's one of my main \"please do better\" concerns, right next to continuing to improve initial build quality and the overall customer service experience.\n\nIt is 1000% possible to safely allow third party repair without re-opening a black market in stolen Tesla assemblies.  They have the direct means right there in the cars: connectivity.  Each major part probably already has unique serial numbers.  Just go further with that, and send the set of all components to Tesla over connectivity from time to time.  Then, when a car is stolen, all those parts are immediately blacklisted until the car is recovered.  This is the age of digital signatures, it's downright easy for anyone competent to pull off... and you know they've got that in spades.\n\nThe whole \"but we can't be sure they've done the work right and it might be a hazard\" argument is near-complete crap.

Public ones, not Tesla-only NDA promise-not-to-do-stuff-we-don't-like restricted.  Basically, on an equal playing field to basically all other existing cars.\n\nThey'll eventually be forced into it.

Apple will only provide spare parts under and agreement that third party repair companies DO NOT repair a whole list of things and basically just offer a small set that usually involves complete replacement of motherboards, etc.  Basically, the same as what apple repair would offer anyway. \n\nDo one of the MANY water sensors spread around the iphone show even a hint of a color change?

I mean, lots of people think companies operate that way but Apple makes it VERY clear that is their main goal with repair.  Offer just enough repair to make it appear they're trying, without actually trying.  Beyond that, they actively work against the customer to prevent them getting repairs somewhere else.\n\nSo, the companies that try to repair things outside of Apple's bullshit contract get sued at one point or another.

There are apple logos internally on ALL KINDS of things.  They have to be scraped off.  It's incredibly difficult to find parts to repair apple products with.. which is insane given how many of them are out there.  It's an active campaign apple runs to prevent repair.\n\nThey send representatives or closely allied trade organization representatives to state and local hearings on \"right to repair\" all over the country to spout almost Trump-level lies to try to discourage right to repair legislation.  ipads bursting into flames on an airplane, that kind of imagery.\n\nIf apple actually cared about what they claim to care about, they'd relax 95% of the restrictions they place on authorized third party repair... but of course they're not remotely about to do that.

John Deere.  They've figure out that with the DCMA legally preventing access control methods, they've build unnecessary access control into many many aspects of their equipment.  So, it's literally illegal to repair nearly anything electronic on John Deere tractors, because you have to have codes to set everything up.  That's where right-to-repair really got a big push this time around, I think.\n\nRight to repair has typically attempted to require manufacturers to provide customers and third party repair sites with documentation required to repair their products, within reason...  instructions for changing batteries, etc.  The more ambitious ones want repair schematics for circuit boards... those exist in the wild for apple products for example...  some reverse engineered but also sometimes leaked from apple subcontractors in china.  (the latter becomes grey area and I can see the ethical problems with obtaining information from sources like that)\n\nCircuit schematics, as a curiosity, cannot be copyrighted.  They can only be perhaps claimed as trade secret.  Circuit schematics being secret does not really do much to prevent companies with the resources to clone hardware from doing so...  all it really does is prevent easy repair.

It works just as well, Imo it will be better, Nvidia will be able to deliver way higher compute performance than Tesla ever will.\n\nNvidia will be charging $10,000 per GPU instead of like the $300 in silicon + development costs, if Tesla made their own. But HW3 is already starting to get horribly outdated and and old.\n\nIt was neat when it came out in 2017, 36.86 TOPS Int16 compute is was really good for a laptop specced chip. The thing was on Samsung 14 nm, that got old in 2018.\n\nIf you buy a Galaxy S20 you get 8 TOPS of AI compute, and they just kinda slapped the Hexagon 698 on there to do some post processing on the camera to get better selfies.\n\nBuy an Nvidia A100 (they dropped the Tesla branding because of Tesla), you get 624 TOPS of compute for 250 Watt. The FSD now only getting 37 TOPS for 36 Watt is kinda crap, the Nvidia is chip is more than twice as power efficient and over 15x faster.\n\nIt's not really that strange. Samsung 14 nm to TSMC 10 nm is -35% power, 10 nm to 7nm is another 40% less power. Smartphones are already on TSMC 7nm EUV which is another 15% less power. Next month Apple will be moving to TSMC 5 nm, which is another 20% power reduction.\n\nOverall 5 nm compared to 14 nm should be 6x as many transistors and 1/4th the power for the same compute. In Next year there's N5P for another 15%, then 3nm at 30% less power.\n\nFor the chip that goes into their car I think it's fine to go with the cheap generic version. You can relatively get the compute you need for just inference (running the neural networks).\n\nTraining requires just way more raw compute, you're not limited by a car or power, you can do it in the cloud easily. Just rent Nvidia shit through AWS, they have the money. I really don't see why Tesla is so eager to get into the semiconductor race.\n\nNvidia spends $2.8 billion in R&D per year, all of Tesla spends $1.3 billion combined. Since start of 2019 Nvidia has increased their AI compute per chip from 125 TOPS int16 to 624 TOPS (5x). Tesla has gone from 37 TOPS to 37 TOPS, and now they're on a 4 year old logic node with plans to maybe start retrofitting upgrades in middle 2021.\n\nAlso to clarify, I think what Tesla is doing currently in FSD is great. Their FSD chip in cars is still good for price/performance and there's not a great alternative in that category. What they're doing currently just training their models through AWS in the cloud is also great. It's the trying to get into the rat race of high performance compute with the dojo that I don't get at all. They're probably realizing it's kinda shit idea, or it's harder than expected and that's why it's taking longer to do it. They would really need extreme scale to make it viable.\n\nEven AMD spends $1.8 billion per year in R&D, Nvidia $2.8 billion. How Tesla expects to compete with spending $1.3 billion in research for cars, energy, batteries, AND everything Nvidia does? That's beyond me.\n\nP.S before anyone says \"Nvidia makes gaming cards\", no they don't, look at their most recent earnings, they make half their revenue from data center and it's nearly all AI.

Everyone knows the Google Cloud TPUs and Amazon AI accelerators are a pain in the ass to work with, everyone prefers to work with Nvidia's stuff. \n\nYou seem to agree that training on Nvidia dgx and just compiling the trained network weights to fit on their FSD chips would work fine. Distracting themselves trying to vertically integrate when Nvidia already has superior performance, and is delivering 6x gains generation over generation, Nvidia is doing the job for them. Like if Tesla wanted to next start making their own silicon fabrication plants, and then their own EUV photolithography systems, it would just be ridiculous. Let ASML, TSMC and Nvidia do their thing. Even AMD spun off their fabs because they didn't want to deal with it and it benefited them immensely versus Intel who \"vertically integrated\" their fabs, and it's now burning them down from inside.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ya. I agree with you that making complete engine doesn’t make sense in short term. The fsd chip makes sense but building the hardware for ai engine doesn’t make sense because of lead time to functionality. OTOH if they need to load more data on the chip/engine than what is commercially available then it may make sense specifically to continue to receognize increasingly rare events. Dgx is largest available to my knowledge. With current tech you have to have memory on the node for the nn software and each block of data you are processing. For multiple videos in 4D this might be a huge problem. If they went this route, I think they would still use off the shelf parts to put it together like most super computers.  One could argue that the reason nvidia is more popular is the cuda software is generalized for most common nn jobs. But Tesla has software team where they might have something superior for their purpose and thus don’t need nvidia so could use less expensive chips. It is possible they could build something useful at very low cost I guess.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ehhh...this memory thing I've thought for a long time was a big problem, but I recently looked at a paper that kinda turned the idea on it's head,   [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) \n\nThis is in relation to transformers (natural language processing), and the number of parameters you can theoretical fit in a model given some memory. But the exact same thing should also apply to Tesla's applications. \n\nThey then also say if you properly partition Optimizer, Gradient, and Parameter you can basically reduce the memory requirements by 1/Nd, where Nd is number of GPUs connected over 10 gigabit Ethernet. Getting more GPUs sound easy, so all the memory problems really just seems like something software optimization and more GPUs can fix. \n\nHowever the problem turned out to be that, even if you can build a super gigantic model with only like 512 GPUs according to the scaling laws for transformers,  [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) \n\nYou would need around $8 billion in AWS credits to properly train the model. Given that Nvidia only sells like $1.15 billion in GPUs per year, compute seems to be the biggest bottle neck above everything else. \n\nMemory is kinda the first problem you run into trying to make things massive, but it seems mostly solvable with software optimization, if you start to go really crazy with size, compute is what will end up killing you. \n\nTesla still has a lot of architecture improvements they could make, but at least for solving natural language, they found that, whatever your architecture is, you can always just make the model way the hell bigger, and it will become better at its job. What limits how big it can get is really just compute. \n\nIf they just ride Nvidia's wave of improving compute, Tesla can focus on their architecture and like data handling, structure. Trying to speed up Moore's law just seems like a huge waste of time for Tesla, it will do it's job if you just wait.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes. The other consideration is that AWS compute is expensive to heavy users so it will make sense for Tesla to have their own dedicated data center. I don't think Tesla will have a data center business anytime soon.  Perhaps when starlink is ramped that infrastructure can be utilized to build a superior product where compute loads can be quickly transferred to parts of the world where the sun is shining (assuming it is all solar powered). If Tesla can solve the NN data loading problem (NLP is a much simpler problem than FSD IMO), that would be fairly crazy synergy between the SpaceX and Tesla  that I see coming down the pike. All of this would be massively valuable for many use cases and would dramatically reduce the cost of compute overtime because the cost of energy will approach zero over time once the infrastructure is built. AWS is not a differentiated product so can be disrupted very easily and Elon has a lot of Aces that make sense for hime to pursue with his businesses. We know that Elon and his engineers think about microprocessor design for many aspects of building to things (octavalve). Perhaps they have some ideas that can improve fabrications... The best thing about Tesla is that they have broad expertise.  It used to be that Google had this advantage but they started hiring entitled douchebags without talent and they have now taken over the higher ranks and made the company hapless. Tesla now will have the cash cow business to support these types of efforts and the culture seems to be more conducive to keeping truly talented people.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oh for sure they can build their own data center. That's just buying a bunch of NVIDIA DGX A100 servers and putting them in server racks and hiring some technicians to connect everything, keep things running.

With AWS you can just buy enough compute to get that shit trained, now. 23 hours of the day you might not use it at all. It's just a business calculation what makes most sense. \n\nReally, I don't think FSD is that hard once you nail down the right architecture and data structure. All this talk of building their own chip I think is mostly a distraction from the core problem. \n\nTime series forecasting (trying to predict where the car/cars will go), has kinda hit a snag in progress since 2018. Everyone got so hung up on transformers and natural language processing, many other areas in machine learning has been put on the back burner.

I know the TOPS numbers are conflicting between that and above comment, but it's mixing 16 bit-float/integer performance with 8 bit integer. Generally most hardware has the capability to do 2x Int8 operations or 1x Int16. In machine learning you can work with both, but 16-bit is just the preferred trade-off. Nvidia is going with TF32, which is 19 bit and handles like the default 32-bit floats used for everything. \n\nAnyway, 74 TOPS\t(Int8) for 36 Watt in the Tesla FSD chip, Vs 15 TOPS for 5 Watt in your Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 (Samsung Galaxy S20). That's 2.05 TOPS/Watt Vs 3 TOPS/Watt in a flagship smartphone. \n\nWhat really tipped my opinion is the NVIDIA A100 GPU released in May, \n\n [https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/a100/pdf/nvidia-a100-datasheet.pdf](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/a100/pdf/nvidia-a100-datasheet.pdf) \n\n1,248 TOPS (with sparsity, which you should be able to use in most neural networks), for 250 Watts. That's 4.99 TOPS/Watt. \n\nAll of these chips are Turing-complete, computation is computation, they can do any calculation, include those Tesla wants to do, for 60% less power it can do the exact same thing.
