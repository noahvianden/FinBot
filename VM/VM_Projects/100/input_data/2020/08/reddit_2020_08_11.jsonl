Thanks!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You've got it right: what you're talking about is called a \"reverse split\" (the first kind I mentioned is a \"forward split\")\n\nHere's the long answer:\n\nA company's board enacts a reverse-split to reduce the number of outstanding shares available, by a certain ratio, which likewise has the effect of increasing its share price. \n\nThe ratio factor might be, for example, 1-for-5 or 1-for-10 or even 1-for-20. \n\nAs you allude to, the shares are \"merged\" -- by dividing the number held by the split factor, with any fractions generally turned into cash; the price per share is likewise multiplied by that factor.\n\nThe worst one in recent memory was by Chesapeake Energy back in April, with a **1-for-200** reverse split.\n\nAlthough not obvious, a \"penny stock\" is generally any under $5 -- so I assume what you are asking about are those under a $1.\n\nThen yes, **the main reason** that a company may want (or need) to do a reverse split is to revalue its shares, so that they meet the listing requirements of the stock exchanges. \n\nThe Nasdaq and NYSE have \"minimum listing standards\" that require a company's share price be above $1, and only allow it to fall below that for a maximum of 30 consecutive trading days.\n\nIf the company's shares remain low, the exchange will send a deficiency notice to the company's board, and request that they get the stock price up, or risk being delisted.\n\nFor many companies, a reverse split is the most expedient way to get it done.\n\nBut, as might be obvious, investors *hate* reverse splits: they're a sign that the company isn't doing a good job getting its stock price up. And often after a reverse split, the stock continues to go down.\n\nI mentioned CHK's 1-for-200 split. That only briefly helped the company, as its price continued to plummet; until it eventually filed for bankruptcy and was delisted. It currently trades as $CHKAQ \"Over-The-Counter\" for around $7.\n\nHOWEVER: there are a few occasions when companies choose to do a reverse split, without the threat of delisting. If a company wants to get its price higher, in order to be more attractive to investors, for example; or to have access to a wider range of options.\n\nOne recent example (also an oil company) was Callon Petroleum ($CPE) which just had a 1-for-10 reverse split four days ago. Afterwards, it briefly went up, but has since settled to about $10.\n\nEdit: word", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so so much for this writeup and knowledge drop.

I also didn't invest in Netflix because I didn't subscribe to them or think much of their service.

How much the stock is expected to move, IV, how long until the option expires, and the price of the underlying stock. The later being the least interesting as it simply is what it is. \n\nThis makes intuitive sense. If I know for sure a stock will be the same price at expiry I am not going to pay anything at all for an option. If I think it might move a lot, setting a price is more valuable. Likewise I would pay more to set a price far in the future than I would tomorrow. These things also work together. A stock is likely to move less in a week than it would in a month. \n\nWith stocks like Tesla where you have a lot of price movement, people are willing to pay more options than they are more stable stocks. Effectively this means you can get a larger premium when you sell an option. Once you sell, you rely on that second variable, time to expiry. As expiry gets closer, the option will naturally decline in value aside from changes due to the change in the underlying stock price. As long as the option stays out of the money, meaning that exercising the option would not yield a profit, the option will expire as worthless. Even if it is exercised, you only lose money if the differences is in excess of your premium. But since we got a larger premium, we have more room to play with. \n\nSo, for an example, I could sell a put expiring on Sept 04 at a strike of 1300 for $54.35 a share at close today. Since options contracts are for 100 shares, that means I make $5435.00 for each contract. So long as Tesla closes about 1300 on Sept 04 the option will expire as worthless and I will simply pocket the premium. If it closes lower than that I still make money so long as it is about about 1245. \n\nThe risk, and it's a big one, is that it drops well below that. Let's say the extreme bears are right and Tesla is a huge bubble. If it pops and drops to 100 a share, I still have to buy it at $1200. That's going to cost me $120,000 and I could only recoup $10,000 so I'd be out $110,000. \n\nThere is a strategy called the wheel where you do the above until you do have to buy the shares. Then you sell calls to make premium. If those get exercised and you are forced to sell the shares, you go back to puts. \n\nThe problem with doing that with Tesla is that the high share price makes contracts super expensive. Most people can't afford to take six figure bets. So with the split the price will be lower, but IV shouldn't change much. That makes the per contract price much lower and more in line with what us normal traders are willing to do.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The greeks are dervided from those things and are ways to quantify them.\n\nAn option buyer can choose, but a seller cannot.

Tesla‚Äôs was more intense but it was also real for me as a new investor. I remember one quarter selling because all the expectations said they would sell 5% less iPhone and it was going to be bad. So I sell my shares, thinking I can time the market, Apple misses investor expectations and it goes up 5-9%. I feel like crap for 2 days and buy back in. Then it drops right back where i sold at.   Two lessons learned from that. Don‚Äôt try to time the market you will get burned and analysts are idiots. If you believe in the long term of a company like Apple, missing 5% one quarter in the long run is very insignificant. \n\nFriends and family thought Apple was risky and thought I was nuts to invest all into one company. Just look back at it now. If I stayed in I would of done great also. Way better than a diversified mutual fund. Diversified stocks also produce average returns. I feel like I can do better than average.  I‚Äôm still relatively young and I know I can take a calculated risk for a higher upside return. \n\nI also sold shares of Apple to pay for my wedding. I now know that you can borrow from your shares at low rates (2% M1 Fiance) and not need to sell your shares. It would of been great to have that money still working for me. (One of my favorite investor saying) ‚Äî>Time in the market is more valuable than timing the market. \n\nApple has been an amazing success story of a stock, I knew it was a great company, yet I still didn‚Äôt make that much money off them. When I was investing in them for 3 years it was around 2012-2015ish, and I remember Apple stock splitting yet afterwards it went down below 100 for some time. I didn‚Äôt really make much money off Apple as an investment because market was slamming Apple saying that they only make a profit off one product the iPhone. If that messes up they will crash and burn. I really believed in the company as an investment yet the market didn‚Äôt.\n \nI ended up selling my shares to put money down for a house. After a year or so of house hunting  I  decided TSLA was a better investment than a house. Then no real action for 3-3.5 years and in fact was down more than 100k during that big dip 9 or so months ago. But I remembered my lesson with Apple. I actually bought my lowest cost shares around 230. I told myself if they go out of business I‚Äôll buy 2 more model 3s. I also felt I didn‚Äôt miss anything on my investment thesis. I really dug deep seeing if I anything was wrong on my thinking about TSLA as an investment. Worse case scenario I could come up with, is it would take much longer for profitability But they would not fail. I drove the product myself and it was to good to fail, and other reasons.\n\nIf I didn‚Äôt have my previous lessons with Apple I don‚Äôt know if I would of been able to hold on to such a flat (initially for me) and controversial company like Telsa. \n\nI now have plans to never sell the stock. I‚Äôm learning of how in 5-6 years (TSLA more stable also) I‚Äôll leverage the investment to buy a house with cash using leverage on my stock account, and I won‚Äôt have to sell any shares. I can then back my stock from being margin called by taking equity from the house if the price were to ever dip significantly.  \nPeople do this all the time with houses as an asset.

I originally planned to sell some shares as needed for my first house purchase / down payment but now that I've learned I can borrow against my stock portfolio , use it as leverage, I won't need to do that until I maybe take some profits when I'm retiring or what not....

{"title": "A Secret Market Crash Indicator is Firing Red", "selftext": "**UPDATE 8/12 11pm:** I had a chance to go over how the original creator prefers to use this indicator. Let me be the first to say I butchered the explanation. In my defense, when I saw yesterday morning that shit looked like it was about to get real froggy real fast, I decided it was probably better to just get it out there even though I hadn't touched my notes for months. If it could mean potentially saving someone's calls I really don't mind shooting from the hip. So I've tried to edit the post the best I can for clarity. Also, a couple of you TA guys are sending me questions like I have \"The Crayola Kid\" tattooed on my ass. I like using TA/indicators but I don't live and die by the crayons. I think there's others here who could help more with that but I'm happy to help if I know the answer. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I did not invent this indicator or find this correlation. All credit goes to a very intelligent trader on Twitter named Kerberos007 who might be borderline obsessed with finding data-based crash indicators.\n\n**The Indicator:** Let me be clear. I am by no means a great trader. But I found this guy‚Äôs crash thesis and checked it against every SPY crash in recent history that I could. It's deadly accurate. I feel like a chimpanzee trying to explain the concept of why fire burns but if it saves some of you guys from not being able to afford the bubble wrap and capri-suns you love, maybe it‚Äôs worth it. If you graph the correlation between the daily value of the SPY and GLD (the ETF), you will see an interesting pattern emerge. In the period before a market crash, they will begin to have a higher correlation. At some point that correlation will become so positive that it crosses the threshold of 0.6. The original creator considers this a \"danger zone.\" From what I can see, how long it stays above 0.6 doesn‚Äôt really matter. The most important part is that when the correlation starts to break down you can usually expect significant red within 1-3 days. When it triggers, it doesn‚Äôt always mean Armageddon type SPY damage but it will almost always be a pullback. So the idea is that when you're in the \"danger zone\" and you see a peak on the indicator that is followed by a quickly descending slope, it could be a good idea to hedge.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwdan0oqapg51.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=b55d7f8d7d675bcddef3d012e686c0e8ded0770a\n\n**Where is it Now:** As of today 8/13 there's a peak forming but it hasn't decided if it's committing to a quick decline in slope yet. I‚Äôm not telling you guys to go all in on puts because putting all your faith in one indicator doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm just saying that when that when you see the golden peak over the 0.60 threshold, just make sure you are hedged effectively for at least the next 3 trading days. Maybe just a little more bearish than usual just in case things get froggy. Also, the original creator recommends trying to see if it coincides with a VIX spike for more accuracy. \n\n**How Can I Set it Up:** TD Ameritrade has a platform called Think or Swim. You can add \"Studies\" to your charts and one of them is called \"Correlation.\" \n\n**Step 1:** Click on the Flask icon at the top right corner of your chart and then hover to Edit Studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pe8q2cuvcpg51.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4822c16fa6edc9c2e8fcc0b74c7e9c4dfb103de\n\nStep 2: A new window will pop up. Type \"Correlation\" into the search bar on the left and add the study.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ciwtwaadpg51.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=8732f505dcf0047480ff3728f90dbda7bb3dc14e\n\nStep 3: Another window pops up and asks you to input settings. Put these in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lg756oojdpg51.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f5e90bc7582df0fc40049054f3cdcd000caf0ba\n\n**Step 4:** Double click anywhere on your new indicator and hover to \"Add a drawing.\" Go to the little dollar sign icon to basically set up a line. Set it to 0.60. Once it shows up, double click it and \"Extend to the left.\"\n\n**Why Did Your Picture Yesterday Look Different:** So if you backtest this indicator you will see that it's useful but it's far from perfect. When I originally set this up I wasn't completely satisfied with the \"trigger\" being a peak. Then I started to think that since gold miners historically react more drastically to changing market environments compared to GLD, maybe that reaction would be enough to speed up the correlation's breakdown and give me a clear hedge signal. One by one, I tested the popular miner tickers to see if any would give a better warning. GDX was terrible. For some reason though, Barrick Gold (GOLD) gave incredible hedge signals in March and June when it crossed the 0.60 threshold on the way down. But if you backtest it, GOLD didn't have the same ability to predict when compared to GLD. Here's the problem. My smooth-brained ass must've forgot to change my settings back to the original after experimenting and then forgot what parts of the indicator came from the original creator and what parts came from my half-baked theory. Now after reviewing my notes, I have both up because they both look like they're about to fire and I'm curious to see if one is triggered before the other. \n\n**TLDR:** Be prepared for a big red day once the correlation between GLD and SPX hits a peak and starts to fall. Good luck my brothers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. If someone has a great ticker to buy (very) cheap puts on when shit hits the fan, let me know.

This is due to gold being seen as a hedge against economic downturn.

Taking that a step further, the correlation reverting back to near zero would indicate that there was either a crash or the fears were unfounded.  \n\nCould this be a good indicator of a crash happening - yes.
