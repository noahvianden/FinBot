In my opinion tech was overvalued along with the entire market long before the pandemic. Profits of S&P companies have been flatlining since like 2012 yet the S&P index has been a rocket due to corporate buybacks and ZIRP artificially inflating stock prices. Very little of the growth (with exceptions of course) has been due to companies actually earning more money. It's been due partially to decreasing numbers of shares due to buybacks, partially due to consistent buying w/o regard to value in response to fed policy, and partially due to factors like zero commissions bringing in tens of millions of new unsophisticated investors who just buy companies they have heard of without any knowledge of whether or not the stock price reflects the current value of the company.

Just a shell of a company yet it has a 13 billion dollar valuation and is the #41 most popular stock held by robinhood investors with over 200k people holding it. \n\nTake a look at this article from dec 2017: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133714-4-calling-charts\n\nWe were overvalued then, and now we have a global pandemic w/ 30+ million people unemployed in the US, businesses shut down, unknown economic damage and yet we are leagues higher than we were back then.

Will it happen any time soon? Not without a catalyst. The pandemic would have been the catalyst needed to reset and bring value back into the market, but the fed chose to intervene and play god ... so here we are. The market is addicted to ZIRP like a heroine addict so you can bet the moment there is any hint of fed stimulus going away we will see the market take a massive dump and they will be forced to either let it die or back down and continue funding it with ZIRP. They can keep it up forever, theoretically, but there's always a loser. The longer the fed keeps propping up the market the more addicted to zero interest it will become, and the more violent the collapse will be when it finally goes away.

Previously video media was hard to support due to accessibility, now everyone has super computers in their pockets and high speed internet connections.  Everyone also lives busy lives to get by in our hectic modern world, and has been conditioned to have an ever-shortening attention span, so TikTok is just more accessible than Youtube in video media.

{"title": "INTC - Why you Should NOT hold Intel stock long term!", "selftext": "Alright guys so I'm one of the hosts on a YouTube channel named \"Max Tech\".  \nI previously did YouTube work for the channel \"Appleinsider\" since 2016, making videos on Apple products which include Mac computers with Intel chips. \n\nI also grew up playing video games and building custom PCs right when AMD started to release six-core and 8-core processors that were cheaper than Intel CPUs and targeted towards gamers.  \n\nEven though the Intel chips were better for gaming, I still bought AMD because they were cheaper. Intel maintained the lead for many years since games really only used 4 cores, and Intel chips gave more consistent frame rates for gaming.\n\nAt one point, it was clear to me and to everyone else that Intel was intentionally holding off from innovating and improving their performance because they already owned a bulk of the market share. They realized that they could make more profit by making small improvements every year, while AMD was busting their ass trying to figure out how they can compete. (it was ultimately the gaming and custom PC market) \n\nMeanwhile.. Apple was using Intel chips quite successfully in their Mac computers the like MacBooks and iMacs. And Apple was also using their XEON chips for their higher-end machines. And of course, Intel was killing it in the server market.\n\nNow in 2013, Intel announced that they were working on their new 10nm chip process and that it should be ready to launch in 2015, and they said their 7nm chips should launch in 2017. \n\nBack to Intel, over the new few years, Intel delayed 10nm to 2016... and then to 2017.. and then to late 2019... We are now in 2020 and Intel is still shipping 14+++++ nm chips for high-end machines like the 2020 5K Apple iMac that was just released yesterday. Only laptops are getting the actual 10nm chips right now. \n\nIn 2017, AMD shocked the world by announcing their new Ryzen chips, and then also their Threadripper chips, and ever since then, they've been quickly catching up to Intel in terms of both performance and price. \n\nBecause of this, Intel instantly started lowering the price of their chips, and in 2018, they finally made 6-core chips for the MacBook Pro. 8-core chips in 2019, and now 10-core chips in 2020. This is an obvious and desperate move to try and compete with AMD. \n\nBecause Intel's 10nm chips were not ready in 2015 or 2016, Apple's redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro which was thinner than ever before, had overheating issues. The overheating was severe in 2018 with the 6-core chips that Intel made in fear of AMD. \n\nThere were even leaked emails from Intel executives worried about AMD's price to performance beating out Intel. \n\nAnd right now, it is well known that AMD is making BETTER price-to-performance x86 chips. \n\nThe MOST important part of this discussion is that the tech community as a whole, including or YouTube and Reddit, are now convinced that AMD is the way to go. I've seen countless comments on my videos that are dissing on Intel chips and wishing that Apple would switch to using Intel. \n\nIf we make a build guide video using an Intel processor, we get shamed and called dumb for not using an AMD chip. Our Mac Pro videos got a ton of negative feedback because Apple is stupid for using Intel chips. Our 2020 MacBook Pro videos were getting comments dissing on Intel's 10th-gen chips. The entire community is starting to hate Intel and preferring AMD.  \n\nAMD stock has increased over 11x since they announced the first Ryzen chips in August of 2016.  \nIntel stock has only increased 38% since that same date. \n\nAnd looking towards the future.. Intel has recently delayed their 7nm chips until late 2022 or 2023. This caused their stock price to tank at they last earnings call. \n\nThere's even now a class-action lawsuit against Intel because of this delay. \n\nThis also caused their chief of chip engineering to resign, and they reorganized their entire chip team. \n\nThey've even discussed outsourcing their future 6nm, 5nm and 3nm chip production to their rival foundry TSMC because they've lost confidence in their own foundry. \n\nSo it's clear that Intel is getting killed by AMD with each passing year, and the tech community knows it. (Which is VERY important)   \n\n\nThis brings us into the Apple and TSMC portion of this DD.   \n\n\nBack in 2013, Apple announced their A7 chip for their iPhone 5s, the first 64 bit smartphone chip, and ever since then, there was a massive performance war between Apple and Qualcomm, fighting to create the fastest smartphone chips, in which Apple ultimately won. \n\n(The A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro is still much faster than the Snapdragon 865+ which was just recently released this year) \n\nStuck in the middle of this battle was TSMC, which has been the EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Apple Silicon chips for their iPhones and iPads since the A10 chip in 2016. \n\nAnd in 2018, Apple released their 11\" iPad Pro with the A12X chip manufactured by TSMC's 7nm process. This iPad from 2 years ago is so powerful that it still outperforms the new 2020 13\" MacBook Pro with Intel's 10th gen chip in both processor AND graphics performance. \n\nNow, Apple is about to announce their iPhone 12 in about a month that's gonna pack the A14 chip which is being built on TSMC's brand new 5nm process. \n\nAnd of course, the next iPad Pro will get a much improved A14X 5nm chip, and it's the same story for the Apple Silicon Mac chips that will start being released later this year in October/November. \n\nI'm of course, talking about Apple finally ditching Intel and moving forward with their own chips. This makes sense for Apple for various different reasons.\n\n1: They can run iPhone & iPad apps on their Macs.\n\n2: They control both the software and hardware for incredibly amounts of performance optimization.\n\n3: They can make sure every new Mac update gets a new chip with performance improvements instead of relying on Intel to release improved chips. \n\n4: This is of course, much cheaper for Apple since they don't have to pay Intel the high price of their chips. \n\n5: They don't have to deal with overheating issues since most Intel chips are still on 14nm technology, therefore running very hot and using a lot of power.   \n\n\nAnd there's a good chance that the very first Apple Silicon Mac chips are gonna outperform the current Intel chips, stay much cooler and give you much better battery life. \n\nJust to give you some perspective in terms of how Intel's 10nm compares to TSMC's 5nm..\n\nIntel 10nm transistor density: around 100 million transistors per square millimeter.\n\nTSMC 5nm transistor density: around 171 million transistors per square millimeter. \n\n  \nTSMC has already confirmed that they're working on risk production of their new 3nm process in 2021,  with those chips going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\nSo here's what the future looks like:\n\n  \nIntel 7nm in late 2022/2023 : 240 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nTSMC 3nm shipping in 2022 Apple products: 290 million transistors per square millimeter\n\nAnd apparently, TSMC is already working on plans for their 2nm process for 2024.   \n\n\nAnd due to Intel's past, there's a very good chance that Intel could delay 7nm even further, especially since they had to restructure their entire chip team, while TSMC has been on point.   \n\n\nSo the future isn't looking very bright for Intel's chip technology compared to TSMC. No wonder why they wanted to outsource their chips from them.   \n\n\nAnd one last bit on Apple's switch to their own chips built by TSMC. \n\nApple has already given developers their transition kit which is a Mac Mini with an A12Z chip from their iPad Pro. \n\nOne developer tweeted this: \"At this point, I think that the first gen Apple Silicon machines will be faster at running x86 code than an actual x86...\"  \n\n\nWhat he means is that Apple's new Rosetta 2 emulation software is so good that he thinks it'll outperform Intel chips even though it's not running natively for ARM. \n\nSo basically, Apple made the right choice by ditching Intel.   \n\n\nAnd if Apple proves everyone wrong by coming out with incredibly great Macs thanks to their switch to their own Apple Silicon ARM-based chips, then there's a VERY good chance that the rest of the market will follow them and start developing ARM-based chips for laptops.\n\nThis will force Windows to start heavily investing in their ARM-based Windows software. \n\nAnd if you didn't already know.. Intel is FAR behind in the ARM-based chip world.   \n\n\nNow, the most common argument I hear is this: Apple is only a tiny part of Intel's business, and while that may be true.. the MOST important thing is the public's view of Intel.  \n\n\nThe tech community is already starting to despise Intel as a brand name because of their overpriced processors and the fact that AMD is beginning to CRUSH them. \n\nJust wait until Apple Silicon Macs start getting released and people realize that ARM-chips have a ton of potential, and they'll start hating Intel even more. \n\nThis will cause Intel's brand recognition and reputation to get absolutely destroyed in favor of AMD and Apple Silicon. This alone will lead to less market share. And what will happen if Nvidia or Apple buy out ARM? \n\nAnd by the way, there are now more and more ARM-based servers popping up, so there's a good chance that Intel will start to lose market share on the server side if ARM-based servers prove themselves. (They use less power so this makes sense for server farms)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is that Intel just got ditched by Apple.. and they're getting killed by AMD and TSMC. ARM is coming VERY quickly and Intel is NOT ready. They have been plagued with delay after delay, and all of this drama will ruin the confidence of their staff, leading to lowered productivity. It's not looking good for Intel for the long-term.  \n\n\nAs of right now, Intel stock is very cheap, and you might make a few bucks if you trade short term.. but I wouldn't hold Intel stock long term.   \n\n\nIf you want more in-depth info with visuals and extra details, you can check out two videos I made on the Max Tech Youtube channel: \n\n\"How Intel Lost the CPU Race..\"\n\n\"Apple Silicon ARM Chips vs Intel x86 Processors for Mac?\"\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this DD.", "id": "i4mgq1", "created_utc": 1596694538.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 138, "comments": [{"body": "I wouldn't write Intel off.

Intel has P/E 9 which is ridiculously undervalued. Do I have to explain how insane that is, and how coiled the springs are, and how they're ready to uncoil if Lisa Su as much as sneezes?\n\nBut being meme-worthy doesn't directly reflect on the bottom line. AMD's revenue is 7% of Intel's. AMD's profit margin is about half of Intel's (because AMD outsources fab).\n\nSo you may indeed see a PERCEPTION that AMD is overtaking Intel but it's like how an ant seems giant next to an elephant in a forced perspective camera trick. AMD is highly preferred by a loud minority, and they love it dearly and talk about how sexy Lisa Su is and what not. AMD is not anywhere close to overtaking Intel. If Intel keeps sitting on its hands, it may happen in a some number of years. But they won't sit on their hands.\n\nIntel's three key benefits over AMD are:\n\n\\- Scale (due to existing market relationships, and internal fab). AMD simply can't make as many x86 chips now. TSMC has no capacity for that given all their other clients.\n\n\\- Margin. Intel can keep lowering their prices if they have to, until the point AMD is no longer profitable. But Intel will still be profitable.\n\n\\- Financial capabilities dwarfing AMD and a newly discovered need to improve after the last ER's embarrassment.\n\nIntel keeps delaying their process updates, sure. But their processes were originally scheduled way ahead of competition. They didn't meet their own aggressive schedule, and now they're a little behind. But since Intel's 10nm doesn't actually compare to TSMC 10nm, but is closer to TSMC's 6nm process, the difference isn't as huge as you paint it out to be.\n\nIntel's biggest weakness is mobile devices, where power usage is very sensitive. But for workstations none of this matters. Yet.\n\nOh also... if Apple's problem with Intel was just process, they would move to AMD, and save themselves a painful x86 to ARM transition.

The market did a very poor job of looking forward, I guess, then. As always.\n\n>No, because of yields. Intel doesn't have a good chiplet design for desktops. AMD can price lower.\n\nThis response didn't make sense. It's very simple: Intel has much larger profit margins on what they sell. Therefore they can drop the price further than AMD, without losing money. Yields are factored into the margin. So saying \"but yields\" is not an argument.\n\n>Why haven't they used those so far then?\n\nThey have over 25 billion cash on hand. If they have it, they obviously haven't \"used it\", have they? And they haven't used it so they can use it when they really have to. You know how you save money and don't just spend it immediately when you get it? But the real question is why should I answer basic questions like as if to a child who has never heard of how a company works before.\n\n>They are years and multiple generations behind.\n\nAs I just said in my previous comment, Intel's 10nm is equivalent to TSMC's 6nm process (well, something between their 7nm and 6nm processes).

Gold production grew \\~30% for the last 10 years and most of this increase was done exactly after 2008 crisis. Around 45% of gold produced goes into jewelry and industrial use, other gold goes into investment and other usage. Gold production usually increases when the price of gold goes up. The thing is that most gold sources on the planet can provide AISC (total cost of production) north of 1k USD / oz. Usually, that price won't allow you to build a successful mine. But if gold stays above 1500 for a year - expect big increase in supply. There will be a downside to that as well: many miners who were this optimistic in 2010-2011 went bust in 2013-2015. Generally, managers in the industry remember that freshly and if you listen to the conference calls - they all say that they will not expend so rapidly this time.   \n\n\nWhat moves gold: watch other central banks too. UK, Japan, China, EU - all move gold when they print. Also watch closely interest rates and forecasts from chairmen. When they say that they are 'not thinking about thinking about' increasing rates (quote Powell) - it means that bonds are nuked. Who can be dumb enough to hold bonds with 1-1.5% yearly interests when inflation hits 4-5%?   \n\n\nHow to be ahead of the curve? Watch budgets. and policies. It is hard to forecast when central banks will print exactly, but if you see that budget is WAY above what the treasury can reasonably provide - expect QE and printing. All this talk about raising taxes on billionaires is nothing more than talk. Even enacted it will not really provide to the treasury. Billionaires will either run like in France and Sweden, or keep all the wealth in stock and for cash use bank loans with stock as collateral. That's exactly what Musk, Bezos and others are doing.

{"title": "I work in the industry (RKT with reasons why Quicken is going to $69)", "selftext": " \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84eyss6qpef51.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed18d0b6b9c852e81358b5fec3156303e419f67c\n\nAlright peoples, I forgot the IPO was today so I marked the high so far.\n\nRKT/Quicken loans is just a money printer in the mortgage industry. Here are a few reasons.\n\n1. PUSH BUTTON GET MORTGAGE? This shit is fantasmic. Remember they intoduced it a few years ago, when the memories of the last recession was still kinda fresh. Everyone was being a virgin and going \"nooooooo you can't just give loans to anyone, it will cause another subprime problem.\" Bitch, they don't know how Quicken operates.\n2. Quicken only takes in conforming loans, meaning loans they can directly push to Freddie/Fannie. If you don't understand the US mortgage industry, basically they originate a loan, sell it for a few points over TBA (the standard baseline mortgage price) depending on loan characteristics, and get CASH from the government which they can reuse to originate another loan.\n3. Quicken loans are shit. We call them \"fast sellers\" or \"trash paper\" because most only last 2-3 months before the borrower finds a much better deal and refinance. That doesn't matter, because Quicken already made 1-3% on fees. Quicken is just a volume house, and they do that really well.\n4. Foreclosures? Bitch do you live in the ghetto? Since April I've seen houses in the suburbs being bid up 5-10% with multiple bidders. If you don't have a job, then you're fucked but if you have a job (and looking at a conforming loan), you can get a mortgage so damn easy.\n5. Forbearance? According to Ginnie/Freddie/Fannie, the 3 months of forbearance still need to get paid by the servicer of the loan. FHFA have sorta changed it so the payments are made by the GSEs. In any case, Quicken has tried to reduce its costs so much in the last few years they sell the mortgage servicing rights for straight CASH about a month after the origination. This means they have no forbearance risk like Cooper or Ocwen.\n\nI love this company because I know how quickly they make money.

[https://i.imgur.com/JkmLeBm.png](https://i.imgur.com/JkmLeBm.png) The target is a run up to $50-51 which would increase the calls by 200-300% minimum. Besides the target, why is this a great play? Because this stock DOES NOT MOVE, it's FLAT. This means that the options are priced INCREDIBLY cheap. Take a look at Aug 21 $52 calls, going for .22 & Aug 21 $53 calls going for .14. That's absolutely insane & if anyone remembers last ER season, $CSCO ran up and IV premiums spiked hard to give call holders profit. A great risk/reward set up, IMO the worst case is the stock continues flat/down & premiums barely spike and it leaves you with close to a break even or small loss but the best case can be a 8-10% run up into 500% returns BEFORE earnings are out. As you can see, I don't care about whether the actual ER will beat or not (it should) but I am only concerned with the run up, you cannot beat the market makers majority of time by holding through earnings.\n\nDisclosure: I own $CSCO $50 $51 $52 $53 calls Aug 21 expiry. Some of you may take Aug 14, but I would do Aug 21 because I think as we head closer, people will pay for TIME premium.", "id": "i52khc", "created_utc": 1596755710.0, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Fuck it I’m in.

I was about to post this today in the morning.\n\nWith earnings on August 12 after market, here's the CISCO earnings run-up play for you.\n\nCisco is the biggest network hardware provider of the world, but they've been heavily expanding into software and subscription based services (think continual revenue and high margin). Cisco primarly sells network hardware like those little white boxes (access points) you randomly see on the ceiling in schools. It's so hard to describe what Cisco does because its reach is too far and too wide, but here goes nothing.\n\n1. Networking hardware\n\nMost expensive hardware (network switches, access points, and even office phones). They're also the biggest brand. Competitors include Arista, Juniper, Extreme Networks. They all released earnings and beat expectations. Arista did go down after earnings, but it had a really nice run-up and this is a run-up play. \n\n2. Cisco Webex - Webconferencing\n\nProbably the biggest reason for growth is Cisco's Webex. While Zoom and to a lesser extent Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have taken over webconferencing, there's plenty of pie to go around and that's where Webex has come in. From what I researched, it's not particularly great, but it's better than nothing. They tripled growth in WebEx from February to April according to their last earnings report. It's the most related search topic that's trending for Cisco.\n\n3. Cisco Anyconnect - Connect to work network\n\nWith work from home still very much a thing, workers need a secure way to connect to the hospital, college, or business networks. That's where Cisco Anyconnect VPN comes in. I'd say Honestly, there's not really much competition in this area.\n\n4. Security - Cisco Duo and Umbrella\n\nCisco has MFA (multi-factor authentification) for password security. This is taking over more and more especially in universities as you've probably had to annoyingly authenticate logging in using your phone. Cisco Umbrella helps businesses filter websites that are known to have malware. You probably know it as filtering gambling and porn websites. \n\n5. Institutional Ownership\n\nDidn't dig too deep here but Raymond James and Associates are making a big bet on it.  Cisco is their second biggest bet of the quarter after Apple. In the previous quarter, they held a total of 14,069,764 shares (through shares and calls) and now have 15,048,139 (through shares and calls). Since they've bought it, the price has not increased much so they definitely seem to believe in the growth here.\n\n6. Pricing\n\nCisco is still trading slightly below its pre-covid price of 49. It did well last earnings with 0.79 EPS and now it's expected to do 0.74 EPS this quarter. Comparatively, most of its competitors have already seen pre-covid prices at some point or another. \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* 48C - Aug 21. Sell before earnings. (Hold through at your own risk.)\n\nDisclaimer: I am the furthest thing from a professional of any kind.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "the boost for WebEx has everything to do with privacy and legacy systems.
