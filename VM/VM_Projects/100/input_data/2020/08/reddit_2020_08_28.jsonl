{"title": "How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%", "selftext": "I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. \n\nI beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)\n\nI did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. \n\nI did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. \n\n#High level advice:\n=========================================\n\nI picked the 7 I agree with.\n\n1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.\n2. Never compromise on business quality\n3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever\n4. Diversification can be dangerous\n5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)\n8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)\n10. Only listen to those you know and trust \n\nI firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  \n\n#General mindset:\n================\n- Keep emotions out of the market\n- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.\n- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. \n- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. \n- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)\n- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. \n\n#Application:\n==================================================================\nI was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. \n\nAs a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. \n\nBased on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good \"feel\" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). \n\nI tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. \n\nPost COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.\n\nMy hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. \n\n1. eCommerce + AdTech \n2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)\n3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)\n\nThese are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:\n\n1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?\n2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?\n3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? \n4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?\n5. Who are their customers and target demographic?\n6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.\n\nIn March, I took what I believe to be an \"educated gamble\". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.\n\n*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. \n\nI have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.\n\nHere are the non FAANGs I chose.\n\n1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. \n\n2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.\n\n3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. \n\n4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.\n\n5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. \n\n6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.\n\n7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. \"Zoom parties\" and \"Zoom dates\" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.\n\n8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. \n\n10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.\n\n11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. \n\n12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. \n\n13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say \"Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?\" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.\n\n14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.\n\nMutual funds/ETFs\n1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. \n\n2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. \n\n3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... \n\nTitanvest:\nI was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.\n\n#Some things I do that that are against the grain:\n\n- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.\n\n- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.\n\n- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. \n\nOne example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. \n\nLastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. \n\nAlso, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence.

Additionally, the magnified losses mean that a bad enough drop in QQQ can wipe TQQQ out entirely and force it to liquidate, meaning you'll lose all the money you had invested in it, even if QQQ later recovers. This actually just happened a few months ago during the march recession to a number of leveraged funds that focus on things like real estate. Even if a bad drop doesn't wipe you out, it can irreparably harm the leveraged fund. For example, QQQ dropping 30% will be magnified to a 90% loss in TQQQ, which requires a 900% gain just to break even. In contrast, QQQ only needs a gain of 43% to get back to even, which would amount to paltry 129% gain in TQQQ, leaving you massively down. \n\nI'm not saying no one should ever hold it, but unless you're a financial professional and really understand the product it's probably better to stay away.

Pretty insightful though more focused on the seller side.   \n\nThat's a complex question as there are a myriad of reasons as to how each contract is priced(Volatility, Time, Strike, etc.). The Ask is typically what you buy something for, wheras the Bid is what you can close a contract for.  You typically want to be purchasing/selling Options with a small Bid/Ask spread.  Options are about leverage, speculation, and hedging.  If you know the price will go up, which is a very subjective opinion unless you're insider trading...an Options Call will allow you to control 100 shares per contract at a much smaller price than the actual share cost because you're borrowing them.  \n\nPuts are like borrowing 100 short shares of a stock in anticipation of the stock going down.  If you buy a Put on AAPL for 495 and it's currently at 500, you're hoping the shares drop at least 5 points by the expiration date of the contract you hold.  If say it goes down to 493, you've made a nice profit and all you have to do is close that contract.  There is a lot more to Options and they aren't near as easy as some people wish/claim they are.

The only time you’ll ever get assigned/buy the shares is if your contract goes to the number you want it to(In the money) and you don’t close it out before expiration.

By using the full book you'll be able to see every order that is made for each asset. This is where you will be looking,  outside of the box your broker is showing you.  You will need to be very detail oriented and pay close attention to the standing buy and sell orders.  Look at each one to determine if it's a retail or institutional investor. You'll be able to read this over time, but in general you will be looking for large volumes in each order and very exact prices that will almost always limit orders.  Once you find the institutional investors orders they will give you a good pricing point to start with. Use them compared to the aggressive retail investors and pick an entry point somewhere in between the two prices. Now we will go to the charts. The charts along with the price will dictate your trade.  On the charts you'll want to watch several different technical indicators. I like to use a combination of Volatility, RSI, MACD, ADX, DMI,VOL, ATR bands or Bollinger bands, along side my chart. I also use a supertrend indicator and darvas box on my chart along with a 20,50, and 200 day SMA lines. How you use use tools will be slightly different depending on your strategy for each trade. By watching these indicators you will be able to see the best timing for entry and exit points.  Obviously this could full an entire sub r  with a full explanation of each and every indicator and how to set it up, how to interpret the data, etc. In general for the buying side you'll want to watch for a dip in the RSI, a bullish cross in the MACD, followed by an increasing volume. That will help signal your entry point. For selling you'll want to see again a strong drop in the RSI and the +DI and a spike in the -DI. Timing the exit comes down to watching the volume and the +DI , -DI lines. This is where you alone are the deciding factor of when to exit. I always have a plan for each trade and stick to it and when I see my indicators hit my I exit point I close even if it's not at the very top of the rally. I am happy with a certain profit and don't try to ride a rally to exhaustion and get stuck gapping down on volume. Hopefully this gives you a good intro into using the book with the other charting tools, but it's far from a full explanation.\n\nAs for RTX typically a stock that's removed from the DOW does slightly better than the ones added to it in the first year after the swap.

Thanks.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "the fundamental difference is a futures position is more like a stock than an option. So a futures \"contract\" is simply holding the position. Futures do \"expire\" however, in that each month (or quarter for some contracts) the trading on said contract \"resolves.\" So for something like wheat futures, holding a contract until expiry will result in the delivery and payment of said wheat. Some futures are cash settled at expiry, including VIX futures, so these do not involve settlement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you wish to hold a position longer than expiry, you can simply sell the current contract and buy the next contract. This doesn't really cost you money in the traditional sense, as you gain/lose value as the underlying changes and the current maintenance cost of the contract (to hold open the position) is not tied to the underlying. There certainly can be a perceived cost to rolling though, depending on how the contract is settled. This can vary VASTLY depending on which future it is and the market situation for said future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe VIX contracts, denoted /vx, derive their value from cash settlement at the value of the VIX at expiration. The front month, denoted as /vx1, tends to have the highest volatility as it responds much faster to changed in the VIX compared to /vx2 or /vx3 (2 months and 3 months to expiration, respectively). VIX futures are currently in contango, meaning that the front month is cheaper than the later months (typical in a bull market). This usually means that over time, /vx will decrease. In this case he will lose a decent amount of money for holding a massive /vx1 long position. Rolling from /vx1 to /vx2 will also put him in a \"worse\" position as the value of /vx2 will be higher than /vx1 thus has less \"room\" to grow if VIX spikes. If VIX holds steady until expiration he will probably lose about $1000 per contract (if I'm reading this right, havn't traded /vx in a while)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much.

That also reminded me of how in my limited experiences with such things, a lyophilized compound is also generally sensitive to damage if reconstituted improperly (bac water added too quickly, or streamed in a jet directly into the dried compound as opposed to slowly flowing it down inside of the vial, etc).  So I imagine if the vaccine is as sensitive as described here, they probably wouldn’t leave reconstitution up to frantic nurses and pharmacists.  Once something is reconstituted, it doesn’t last as long (assuming it’s a sensitive compound in general) so that’s probably why it’s got the time frame it does.\n\nThat was confusing. Basically, it likely lasts longer as lyophilized form, but imperfect reconstitution could result in people being injected with ineffective substance and then assuming they’re vaccinated.
