ChromeOS is trash.  You went away to a bad OS designed for absolute minimalism and cheapness.\n\n\nMy preferred OS is MacOS, I think it's leaps and bounds better than Windows on most metrics. (Stability, RAM usage, required maintenance, safety, battery usage, consistency and polish in UI, multicore usage, etc.)   The only area Windows wins is gaming performance (by roughly 10-15%), but it's hard to tell how much of that is Metal vs DirectX 12 and how much of it is just better Windows drivers for GPUs.\n\nOnly problem with MacOS is being locked to Apple's hardware choice, and Apple doesn't always make the tradeoffs I want. (For example, you have to buy a Mac with a super high end CPU to get a midrange GPU, and while I'd rather reverse those, there's no option for that.)  But Macs are likely about to get a lot more competitive on price with the ARM switch.\n\n\nI'd like to see a MacOS-like general purpose OS hit the scene that can actually compete with Windows for desktops.  Right now, I don't think there is a great choice besides MacOS and that requires buying into a whole new ecosystem.  Linux is stable but just has clunky UI and difficult maintenance, ChromeOS is just too limited and underdeveloped.

So we're looking at $350-$400 in 5 years. This is all rough numbers. Trying to get uber precise with any of this is nonsense.\n\n$350 is a 10.5% CAGR, $400 is a 13.5% CAGR.\n\nSetting the stage.\n\nCurrent P/E is 37x on TTM EPS of $5.76. Since 2006, roughly speaking, Microsoft's P/E has ranged between 10x and 20x. There have been some outliers from write-offs and such, but that's the general range. So currently it's 17 points above the high end of the range. TTM net income is $44.281 billion with a margin of 31%. TTM EBITDA is around $65.5 billion with a margin of 46%. TTM revenue is $143.015 billion. Shares outstanding are 7.65 billion and Microsoft has had no material buybacks in recent years.\n\nLet's grow earnings 10.5% and 13.5% to match stock price growth. At 10.5%, EPS would be $9.50, at 13.5% it would be $10.85. That would put earnings at $72.7 billion to $83 billion. With constant margins that would mean revenue of $235 billion to $268 billion. This shouldn't be surprising, because the growth rates carry through all the numbers. The big assumption here is that a 37x P/E is maintained.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue CAGR from 2005 to 2016 was 7.8%. Since 2016 it's been 11.9%, which is in the range of your price growth forecast. For me 2016 is a defining year because Trump took office the next year and that's when the markets went crazy to the upside. Microsoft's stock price is up 3.4x since the beginning of 2017, $62.58 to $212.68 as I type this. Over that same period revenue is up 57% and net income is up 116%. So the stock price obviously has run ahead of fundamentals. Over those same periods, net income CAGR was 4.8% and 21.2%, respectively. Obviously the last 4 years have been much better than the 11 years before that.\n\nSo the question you have to ask yourself is do you think the P/E multiple (and other multiples) will remain constant? Obviously no one knows, we can only guess, hope, whatever. If the P/E multiple as a proxy remains constant at 37x, even though growth would be roughly one-third of that, then a $350-$400 price target doesn't seem out of line. But I question why anyone would put a 37x multiple on sub 15% growth. Or can the 20% net income growth over the last 4 years continue?\n\nIf we go back to its history, with a revenue CAGR of 7.8% and a P/E range of 10x-20x, we can do some scaling. Let's pick 15x average on a CAGR of 7.8%. 13.5 over 7.8 is +73%, 15 +73% is a 26x P/E ratio. This assumes some linear relationship between P/E and revenue growth.\n\nIf we put a 26x P/E on the same earnings we calculated earlier in 5 years, that'd put the stock price at $247 to $282, which would be about 30% below your target range given 26x is 30% below 37x.\n\nNow if we go back to a 20x P/E because maybe the exuberance calms down, then we'd be looking at a price target of $190 to $217, which is pretty much where it is today. At a 15x P/E, the long-term average, it'd be $143 to $163.\n\nSo I think in order for Microsoft to hit a $350 to $400 price in 5 years, the only way that can happen is either they somehow find extraordinary growth they've never before been able to achieve, at least not in the last 15 or so years, and/or price multiples remain where they are today. Personally I don't think that's a good assumption given the recent multiple expansion, but to each their own.\n\nWe can also look at it another way. Let's say it can grow earnings 20% a year for the next 5 years. That would put EPS at about $14. Of course that would also assume 20% revenue growth with constant margins, which is pretty stout given its size. $14 at a 37x P/E would be $518. At a 26x P/E $364. At a 20x P/E $280. At a 15x P/E $210. The CAGRs (rounding) on those prices from today are 20%, 11%, 6%, 0%, respectively. This compares to a CAGR of 41% over the last 3.5 years.\n\nI think a lot of people are expecting that 41% to continue. That's always what happens during run-ups like this. Personally, I would expect some multiple compression even if fundamentals do remain strong, just because they can't grow at the rate needed to justify a 37x P/E long-term. I think a realistic assumption is getting back to around a 15x-20x P/E, which would put us roughly in a range of $200-$250.\n\nOf course, we also have to assume we don't enter a bear market, the Fed keeps pumping, and all that fun stuff. Because if the market corrects again then everything drops.\n\nThis is the kind of thing I do for any company I am seriously looking at buying into. What are multiples now versus historical? What are growth rates versus multiples? Do they align? If not, why not? And if things have changed then why and is that sustainable long-term?\n\nI am not good at trend investing. My brain doesn't work that way. I have to have fundamentals to fall back on, something to ground me in the price expectation. When prices get out of line with what I think is a reasonable range, I can't help but think this isn't sustainable and things will correct at some point. I'm usually right, but timing can be a bitch.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "The way is see it is , if FB is gone from market , what will the world miss.

I only use the basic chart on yahoo finance, I think I could learn and extract more information to find better trades if I did, but I'm starting simple.  I just put it on full screen and set it to 1 minute intervals.  I also looked back at the historical data for the past 2 months and analyzed the patterns and how they relate to the current price & where they are at that time on the chart.  I believe that because this is so volatile, this small window of information is the most useful piece.\n\nI have about 55% of my portfolio in a no touchy account invested in Tesla.  The rest in addition to the margin on the rest is what I use to day trade.  I trade with the mentality of always trying to end my trades holding shares rather than sitting on the sidelines.  I'm more fearful of a spike rather than a dip.  So, my basic goal is to lower my cost basis of my margins and simply gain share count.\n\nI mainly trade in the first 10 minutes of the day.  The extreme volatility helps it swing in one direction then rubber band the other way if it's a \"normal\" \"sideways\" looking trading day.  I'm always in on my shares, the margin is what I use to take advantage of my ideas.  Only when it's an extreme case where I'm 99% sure will I utilize my actual shares in addition to go full margin.  \n\nMy profit basis is always compared the gains or losses from start to end of day, did I outperform what the stock naturally did.\n\nIt's quite simple.  In addition to factoring in a lot of little things, the big one I look for is the direction, weight, and momentum of the previous day's trade plus the premarket.  If yesterday was a deep red day and we closed 1430, with the last bit of trading being a downward fall, in addition to premarket being red, my confidence is extremely high that it'll continue down within the first time bracket (I think when it does a up then down or down then up they occur between 1-5 minutes for the first then 1-5 afterwards for the reverse)  In that situation I'd sell my options and my shares at opening price.  Thinking that it'll continue to fall through, I wait and watch usually 3 minutes in, it looks like a straight line down, but I buy back in with all shares & options.  \n\nI also think every day that passes, the floor in how fall it can drop on a no news basis comes up slightly because everyone anticipates s&p.  An upwards breakout seems more likely and more suppressed which will cause it to spring that much higher.  \n\nI know there are probably other ways to day trade that make more money and whatnot, but I like my style because I'm in and out in the first 10 minutes where I feel it's relatively safe because I have a move for every direction.

{"title": "$PTON - Why Peloton Is Going To The Moon Pt. 2", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\n[I posted my first deep dive here about why Peloton ($PTON) is going to the moon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hm22dp/pton_potential_to_be_the_next_big_company/) At the time, the stock was at \\~$55, we are now at $72. \n\n.Here are a few more reasons why this stock truly has the potential to become the new \"meme\" stock, the new PRPL stock, and the new stock to finally make you some fucking money.\n\n1. Traffic to Peloton's site continues to skyrocket to historic levels. Here's a snapshot of their August 2019 traffic numbers (<1M visitors per month). Now, they are projected to do (>2M visitors per month). This means that demand and traffic HAS NOT slowed in Q3 and they should continue to see meteoric growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[August 2019 Traffic](https://preview.redd.it/jlhscs5quwe51.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=9764264f71333e6afed4e218d86ecbe40e80515d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[August 2020 Traffic](https://preview.redd.it/d7hgcmoruwe51.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=a362ef14c955dc40bb5eed08c0cb37c2c22f6372)\n\n2. You'll also notice the paid traffic numbers in August 2019 vs. August 2020. No advertising means they can't supply all the bikes to customers fast enough. More importantly, it means Peloton is going to post absurdly profitable metrics when they report in Q2 and Q3. Even though Peloton has healthy gross margins (>60%), investors will begin to salivate once they see huge EBIDTA margins driven by a huge pull-back in advertising.\n\n3. As our good PRPL friends have been also talking about, job openings/postings have also been sky-rocketing. As evidenced by the chart below, their effective job openings (I'm going to assume much of that is manufacturing capability) has grown 2.5x YoY, matching winter capacity which is usually their biggest months. This means that they are forecasting Christmas like demand for the rest of the year in order to fulfill all the backlog of orders and future orders. This is a good sign of a company that has high confidence of sustained demand. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dd6xzwjdvwe51.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa0a87090c28319bca66bc35ec29f6d78ae9d82a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. When COVID hit, Peloton announced a free 90 day trial of their $12 digital fitness subscription (no bike required). They also publicly disclosed that 1,000,000 people signed up for that subscription. Prior to that, Peloton announced they had 850K subscribers (most through the bike). If they can maintain a good retention rate (TBD), Peloton could effectively double the # of subscribers in their customer base. Although these customers will be on the $12 plan, Wall Street will LOVE to see this progress as it pushes Peloton more into the tech/saas valuation vs. hardware valuation where multiples are much less attractive.\n\n5. If Peloton announces any sort of cheaper treadmill, bike, rower, or any new product developments in their next earnings report, the stock will soar. One of the biggest \"drawbacks\" of Peloton stock is the Total Addressable Market is too small. By introducing a low cost option, Peloton will not only increase their customer base, they will increase their effective margin per customer as more customers on the $40 subscription plan will increase LTV (lower CAC etc) and they can leverage their fixed costs more effectively.\n\n6. COVID. I don't know if you guys have been following the news, but COVID is still ravaging the country. Most of the tech-liberal elites refuse to go out  and not that this matters at all, I've personally met over 6 people in the last 2 weeks that have recently purchased a Peloton. At best case scenario, even if we get a vaccine by EOY, it would still take months to deploy the vaccine and then get people to actually take the vaccine. Factor in another few months for gyms to get back to full capacity and people still being scared and it could be another 12-18 months before people are back to \"normal.\" If Peloton is right at at-home fitness is here to stay for the long-run, they have the largest moat and are well positioned to dominate the market. \n\nWorst case scenario, they are a very attractive acquisition target for a Nike or even Apple. \n\nPosition: 1000 shares, $60c 1/21, $65c 1/21, $70c, 1/21.

A person who is motivated by more than money, an intrinsic drive. How do you find these people? Well, once upon a time the majority of people that went to college were intrinsically motivated, there was even a touch of a social stigma associated with it, especially in the sciences, that had the benefit of scaring off some of the extrinsically motivated. Then, people saw the correlation between going to college and higher incomes. Then it got sold to the general public as the path to a higher income. It stopped being a reliable indicator for intrinsic motivation years ago. So the only selective effect it has is distinguishing the pitifully extrinsically motivated from the mediocre and above. My experience interviewing dozens of college grads for entry level positions bears this out: the critical thinking skills of the average fresh college grad applicant was laughable. This makes sense given the fact that their entire life up to this point has been about them just needing to memorize the right thing to move on to the next level. If critical thinking was valuable, they would be advancing their fields before they even make it out of college.

{"title": "INTC BUY BUY BUY", "selftext": "Listen up fuckers.\n\n\nI’m not ludicrously experienced with options, but I can recognize some bullshit when I see it. This arcticle [(Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of an Era for U.S. Chip Sector)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-030711424.html) and a bunch of other 🌈🐻 news caused $INTC to drop off the face of the earth last week. \n\n\nI kinda fail to see the drama. Intel has always outsourced it's chips. Maybe it's doing it more now, but even 8 years ago when my brother and I built our first PC's. His chip was from Mexico, mine was from Taiwan. \n\n\nFurthermore, TSMC, the company this article says Intel should sell factories to, has been the heavyweight chip maker for a decade or more.\n\n\nNvidia and AMD for example, they are the two graphics card manufacturers. BOTH of them have their chips made by TSMC. These companies do all their designing, but in the end everything is made by TSMC anyway. At least, a lions share of it.\n\n\nNow, Intel definitely has struggled in the recent market, but that's because they've demolished AMD in the performance ~~chip~~ processor market for nearly two decades. There was no reason to keep pushing their envelope, spending billions on R&D for a better product. All they had to do was refine their Lake series processors and they'd continue to rake in a ton of profit. This profit was used to expand their market to the mobile industry. Particularly laptops. For a long time it was hard to get an Apple product with any kind of processor that wasn't Intel.\n\n\nThey're not going away. They're not crashing.\n\n\nThey're just finally seeing AMD pass them in one market. This has caused other markets to start to shift due to uncertainty about who the \"best\" chip manufacturer is, but trust me - **we will see Intel back with a fiery vengeance**. Whether that’s two months from now, or two years from now, INTC is gonna come back.\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Intel pops out some high core count chips that are pushing 5.0-5.5 all core clock count speeds. And then once they scale down their transistor size... Oof. It's going to be a Rottweiler back in the pit. Bears r fuk.\n\n\n\nTL;DR INTC $55c 09/18, but load up on whatever the hell you want, these contracts are CHEAP. Buy shares. Buy long calls.

Although it might be wiser to wait for actual light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nOn the other hand AMD will release the next generation Ryzen, this year, again on TSMC 7nm, which will definitely add a nice bit of performance.

{"title": "Silver and Gold are both going to go parabolic. Entry points and Exit points + Timeframe.", "selftext": "Silver (SLV) and Gold (GLD) have both had incredible rallies over the last three months. This has been driven mainly by uncertainty hedges and currency hedges (people worried about the world and people worried about the dollar). While the state of the world is definitely reason enough to jump into safe haven materials, Gold and Silver are both inexorably linked to the strength of the dollar. **AS LONG AS THE DOLLAR KEEPS CRASHING GOLD AND SILVER WILL RALLY.**\n\nFirst we need to talk about why the dollar will continue to crash and to what levels it will fall. The Dollar's strength is linked to (basically) two things: (1) Supply and (2) Demand. While other factors can move the dollar in the short-term, over long-term trends these two basic economic principles are responsible for the dollar's value.\n\n1. Supply: The Fed is printing shit ton of money. Like a shit ton of money. The Fed balance sheet has expanded to over $7 Trillion, and it's likely to go higher over the next year. This is because our economy is fueled by debt, and in order to pay back that debt, the Fed is forced to print more and purchase assets, so people/companies don't default on their obligations. This creates a sort of Zombie economy (kinda like what we had from 2008-2020) where the stock market soars, but the income gap gets larger. I don't want to get into any of that, but the point is the Fed is going to keep printing, because it's the only way to keep people from defaulting. If people are allowed to default on their obligations, we'll have a major financial crisis (like 2008).\n2. Consequences: The consequences of all this printing is that eventually it will devalue our currency. That being said, we're in no danger of inflation in the short-term. Because the economy is so in the shitter, we have massive deflationary forces, so printing money outright (increasing money supply) isn't going to devalue the dollar. Instead, the dollar will become devalued for reason number 2...\n3. Demand: The Fed is buying bonds and keeping interests rates at zero. This essentially guarantees the stock market wont crash and encourages people to borrow. It also means that fixed-income investments will basically yield nothing. So, where can people put their money?\n4. Consequences: The only real place is the stock market or futures market. With incredibly low marginal costs (borrowing money is cheap), the Fed has given the green light for people to speculate and buy equities. **This forces people out of Cash and into Stocks; therefore, demand for the dollar falls.**\n5. \\[Edit\\]: A smarter man than me made a point in the comments and I think it deserves a shout out. **A big reason the Dollar is falling is also because Europe and Asia are recovering better (economically) compared to the US. That strengthens their currencies relative to ours. That might change (lot of emphasis on \"might\") post election if Biden wins (big if), but until then we'll probably see more of the same economic policies coming out of the White House.**  \n6. Putting this all together: With the long-term fear that money printing will devalue the currency, and the short-term pressure to get out of cash and into the market (not to mention economic uncertainty, credit worthiness, pandemic fears, and election nonsense) we get a perfect storm of dollar weakness. So how does this all look:\n\nThis is a graph of the Dollar Index (DXY) over the last 3-months:\n\n[DXY Index](https://preview.redd.it/zm8v2a7b22f51.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=730be8b6938dc27ef6408d94f512785e1ed55e9e)\n\nThe dollar has depreciated nearly 7%. This has led to the meteoric rise in Gold and Silver over the same time frame.\n\nGLD:\n\n[GLD Index](https://preview.redd.it/um7rmu9r22f51.png?width=965&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c9876ab4439bd8b5ae8c8bdfdae0f914d85338)\n\nGLD has increased nearly 20%, breaking through its all time high of $185 (2011).\n\nSLV:\n\n[SLV Index](https://preview.redd.it/clxdj4vs22f51.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae01448381860e30c993b482714493e472b66d68)\n\nSLV has increased over 33% from its local high of $18 (2019).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile these movements might look crazy and might make you think you've missed the train, you're wrong. Gold and Silver (especially Silver) have a lot more room to run. This is because the dollar still has a long way to go down.\n\n[DXY Long-Term Look](https://preview.redd.it/rensqvn842f51.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=caad130adc90bf7d0f7e78ea259b2a76df8b610d)\n\nIn 2018 the DXY hit \\~$89 and currently it's sitting at $93.35, so in just the short-term it's likely to retest that low. That represents another \\~4.6% decline in the dollar. The 7% decline in the DXY so far has created a 20% rally in GLD and a 30%+ rally in SLV, so just off the likely movement of the Dollar, GLD and SLV should rally an additional \\~14% and \\~20% respectively (if they follow the same ratio of movement). However, in the medium-term, the Dollar will likely trend even lower. The next levels of support are $80 and $73 which get us into 2008/2011 territory. The amount of stimulus and printing being put into the market today is a lot bigger than it was back then, so I wouldn't be surprised if we went back down to those levels.\n\nFinally, how will Gold and Silver rally given this trend in the Dollar. Well, GLD already took out its ATH of $185 (2011). The Dollar still has a long way to go down, and people are just starting to pay attention to GLD again, so we might easily see GLD reaching $295 by end of 2021. In the last GLD rally the metal moved up 2.69 times in 3-years. Currently, we've only seen the metal rally 69% (heh) over the last \\~2-years. Based on the historical comparison, GLD should easily hit $220 by EOY. I have no doubt there could be a pullback, but given the fact that we're entering a pivotal election, I think GLD will rally at least until the election.\n\n[GLD 2008-2011](https://preview.redd.it/gsbe3vmj82f51.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd79832f785bf0406b169e75267be256ba3d0f1b)\n\n[GLD 2018-Today](https://preview.redd.it/efv3x2wl82f51.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3bc94e48eadd64159dd71435e2930d32a3202ea)\n\nSilver is even more exciting. Looking at historical charts of SLV we see that the metal hit a high of $48 in 2011. In the 1980's it went even higher, hitting a $118. The current price is $24, which means if it retests it's 2008 high's, you can still get a 100% gain from the current price. **I am willing to bet my mother's kidney's on the fact that SLV will hit $30 by EOY.** I'm also pretty confident that it will retest it's local high of $48 sometime in 2021. The best part is, the options on SLV are so fucking cheap it'll make you cream a river of tendies.\n\n[SLV 2008-Today](https://preview.redd.it/ufntjwg2a2f51.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9c70b130c17d7bbd4076e4e0c42d97361e93ec9)\n\nBoy's I cant stress this enough. Silver and Gold are only just beginning to rally, and there's a really really really good chance SLV goes parabolic. GLD is a much safer bet, but the upside potential of SLV is crazy good. Don't miss this shit. It's the easiest money you'll ever make outside of AMZN calls.\n\nKeep buying GLD until it hits around $295 (after that the historical move doesn't hold) and keep buying SLV until $50. For both SLV and GLD that could take between 6-months to 1-year.\n\nTL:DR\n\nGLD Vertical Spread 191/193 September 30th  Expiration.\n\nSLV Vertical Spread 27.5/29 October 16th Expiration.", "id": "i3td0s", "created_utc": 1596580290.0, "score": 312, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 214, "comments": [{"body": "Agreed.

Which is what QE is supposed to do in the first place, but doesn't do because of risk.\n\nI don't think this will be any different than 2008-2011, and if the economy ever recovers it will be the same as 2011-2019 as well.
