You got a couple of potential customers competing to buy the pie from you, for $120-$125. So, you are looking at making $20-$25 return on the $100 pie.\n\n2. Suppose you got a smart advisor who cuts up the pie into 5 pieces of $20 each. Now, you don't have more pie. The amount of pie is the same. The base value of the pie is still $100. This is where you are stuck and you have stopped thinking. But do read on...\n\n3. Fortunately for us, your advisor is a lot smarter. He knows there are lot more people who can and will buy this special, popular piece of pie at a much lesser price than $100. So, instead of just 2 rich guys bidding for your whole $100 pie, you have 20 not-so-rich guys PLUS the 2 rich guys bidding for 5 pieces of $20 each. Think about it, 22 guys, only 5 pieces. Classic demand and supply scenario. Your advisor sells the pieces for $30 - $35 each.\n\n4. NOW, let's get back to the arithmetic that you are so good at! By cutting up the same $100 pie into 5 pieces, getting 22 guys to bid on them and selling them for $30-$35, how much more money did your advisor make you? We shall leave that as a homework assignment.\n\nIf you are lucky, the two rich guys might FOMO and buy a couple of slices for around $50 each, while leaving the other 3 pieces to be sold for $30-$35.

{"title": "Buying the RKT Dip is an Absolute No-Brainer", "selftext": "All you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow & Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to >9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.", "id": "i8g3bq", "created_utc": 1597247197.0, "score": 533, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 348, "comments": [{"body": "Instructions unclear, YOLO'd Tesla puts", "score": 434, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -90, "replies": [{"body": "Ban", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Ban", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lololol if you're Elon Musk I'm King Theoden", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol, he's really butthurt.

{"title": "PRPL Q2 2020 Earnings Expectations", "selftext": "# tl;dr - Earnings is gonna be lit!\n\n[PRPL earnings is tomorrow, 8/13, after hours](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-to-Report-Second-Quarter-2020-Results-on-August-13-2020/default.aspx).   Any other date is wrong.  Robinhood is wrong (why are you using Robinhood still!?!).\n\nI'm going to take you through my earnings projections and reasoning as well the things to look for in the earnings release and the call that could make this moon even further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Earnings Estimates\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3qad4gb9ng51.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a88656a9867d0e40710736f61974a22b5f4a631\n\nI'm calling $244M Net Revenue with $39.75M in Net Income, which would be $0.75 Diluted EPS.  I'll walk you through how I got here\n\n# Total Net Revenue\n\nI make the assumption that Purple is still selling every mattress it can make (since that is what they said for April and May) and that this continued into June because the website was still delayed 7-14 days across all mattresses at the end of June.\n\n**May Revenue and April DTC:**  The numbers in purple were provided by Purple [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx) and [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx).\n\n**April Wholesale:**  My estimate of $2.7M for Wholesale sales in April comes from this statement from the Q1 earnings release:  \" *While wholesale sales were down 42.7% in April year-over-year, weekly wholesale orders have started to increase on a sequential basis.* \"  I divided Q2 2019's wholesale sales evenly between months and then went down 42.7%.\n\n**June DTC:**  This is my estimate based upon the fact that another Mattress Max machine went online June 1, thus increasing capacity, and the low end model was discontinued (raising revenue per unit).\n\n**June Wholesale:**  [Joe Megibow stated at Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&feature=emb_logo) on 7/30 that wholesale had returned to almost flat growth.  I'm going to assume he meant for the quarter, so I plugged the number here to finish out the quarter at $39.0M, just under $39.3M from a year ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Revenue Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/notxd6hhbng51.png?width=384&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa0453414f467aa6c5bf72ce8a8046c0ae6e62a5\n\nMy estimate of $244M comes in way over the high, let alone the consensus.   PRPL has effectively already disclosed \\~$145M for April/May, so these expectations are way off.  I'm more right than they are.\n\n# Gross Margins\n\nI used my estimates for Q3/Q4 2019 to guide margins in April/May as there were some one time events that occurred in Q1 depressing margins.   June has higher margin because of the shift away from the low end model (which is priced substantially lower than the high end model).   Higher priced models were given manufacturing priority.\n\n# Operating Expenses\n\n**Marketing and Sales**\n\nJoe mentioned in the [Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&feature=emb_logo) video that they were able to scale sales at a constant CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).   There's three ways of interpreting this:\n\n1. Overall customer acquisition cost was constant with previous quarters (assume $36M total, not $93.2M), which means you need to add another $57M to bottom line profit and $1.08 to EPS, or\n2. Customer Acquisition Costs on a unit basis were constant, which means I'm still overstating total marketing expense and understating EPS massively, or\n3. Customer Acquisition Costs on a revenue basis were constant, which is the most conservative approach and the one I took for my estimate.\n\nI straightlined the 2.2 ratio of DTC sales to Marketing costs from Q1.   I am undoubtably too high in my expense estimate here as PRPL saw marketing efficiencies and favorable revenue shifts during the quarter.  So, $93.2M\n\n**General and Administrative**\n\nA Purple HR rep [posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6691037138018017280/) about hiring 330 people in the quarter.   I'm going to assume that was relative to the pre-COVID furloughs, so I had June at that proportional amount to previous employees and adjusted April and May for furloughs and returns from furlough.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nI added just a little here and straight lined it.\n\n# Other Expenses\n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nStraightlined from previous quarters, although they may have tapped ABL lines and so forth, so this could be under.\n\n**One Time and Other**\n\nUnpredictable by nature.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI'm making some assumptions here.\n\n1. We know that the secondary offering event during Q2 from the Pearce brothers triggered the clause for the loan warrants (NOT the PRPLW warrants) to lower the strike price to $0.\n2. I can't think of a logical reason why the warrant holders wouldn't exercise at this point.\n3. Therefore there is no longer a warrant liability where the company may need to repurchase warrants back.\n4. The liability accrual of $7.989M needs to be reversed out for a gain.\n\nThis sucker is worth about $0.15 EPS on its own.\n\n# Earnings (EPS)\n\nI project $39.75M or $0.75 Diluted EPS (53M shares).  How does this hold up to the analysts?\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2i1dvk6hng51.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e63f7934d85393e1f7b87bf2e2066c28047202\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psu5rajfhng51.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=0612d43777c644789b14f8c5decbe36f41925f5e\n\nThese losers are way under.   Now you know why I am so optimistic about earnings.\n\nKeep in mind, these analysts are still giving $28-$30 price targets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What to Watch For During Earnings (aka Reasons Why This Moons More)\n\nAnalysts, Institutionals, and everyone else who uses math for investing is going to be listening for the following:\n\n* Margin Growth\n* Warrant Liability Accrual\n* Capacity Expansion Rate\n* CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)\n* New Product Categories\n* Cashless Exercise of PRPLW warrants\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Margin Growth**\n\nThis factor is HUGE.  If PRPL guides to higher margins due to better sales mix and continued DTC shift, then every analyst and investor is going to tweak their models up in a big way.   Thus far, management has been relatively cautious about this fortuitous shift to DTC continuing.   [If web traffic is any indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i7gjsn/prpl_q2_revenue_forecast_using_web_traffic/), it will, but we need management to tell us that.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI could be dead wrong on my assumptions above on this one.   If it stays, there will be questions about it due to the drop in exercise price.   It does impact GAAP earnings (although it shouldn't--stupid accountants).\n\n**Capacity Expansion Rate**\n\nThis is a BIG one as well.   As PRPL has been famously capacity constrained: their rate of manufacturing capacity expansion is their growth rate over the next year.  PRPL discontinued expansion at the beginning of COVID and then re-accelerated it to a faster pace than pre-COVID by hurrying the machines in-process out to the floor.   They also signed their [manufacturing space deal](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Expands-U.S.-Manufacturing-with-a-New-Facility-in-Georgia/default.aspx) which has nearly doubled manufacturing space a quarter early.   The REAL question is when the machines will start rolling out.   Previous guidance was end of the year at best.   If we get anything sooner than that, we are going to ratchet up.\n\n**CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)**\n\nSince DTC is the new game in town, we are all going to want to understand exactly where marketing expenses were this quarter and, more importantly, where management thinks they are going.   The magic words to listen for are \"marketing efficiencies\".   Those words means the stock goes up.  This is the next biggest line item on the P&L besides revenue and cost of goods sold.\n\n**New Product Categories**\n\nWe [heard the VP of Brand](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-authentic-influence-31157510/episode/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-67762598/) from Purple give us some touchy-feely vision of where the company is headed and that mattresses was just the revenue generating base to empower this.   I'm hoping we hear more about this.    This is what differentiated Amazon from Barnes and Noble:  Amazon's vision was more than just books.   Purple sees itself as more than just mattresses.   Hopefully we get some announced action behind that vision.   This multiplies the stock.\n\n**Cashless Exercise of PRPLW Warrants**\n\nI doubt this will be answered, even if the question is asked.   I bet they wait until the 20 out of 30 days is up and they deliver notice.   We could be pleasantly surprised.   If management informs us that they will opt for cashless exercise of the warrants, this is anti-dilutive to EPS.   It will reduce the number of outstanding shares and automatically cause an adjustment up in the stock price (remember kids, some people use math when investing).   I'm hopeful, but not expecting it.   The amount of the adjustment depends on the current price of the stock.    Also, I fully expect PRPL management to use their cashless exercise option at the end of the 20 out of 30 days as they are already spitting cash.\n\n# Positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tho65crvkng51.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=6241ff5e8b26744f9d7119ddef7da86f163c741d\n\nI'm not just holding, I added.\n\nPRPLW Warrants:  391,280\n\nPRPL Call Debit Spreads:   17.5c/25c 8/21 x90, 20c/25c 8/21 x247\n\nAlso, I bought some CSPR 7.5p 8/21 x200 for fun because I think that sucker is going to get shamed back down to $6 after a real mattress company shows what it can do.\n\n# UPDATES\n\nI've made some updates to the model, and produced two different models:\n\n1. Warrant Liability Accrual Goes to Zero\n2. Warrant Liability Accrual Goes to $47M\n\nI made the following adjustments generally:\n\n* I reduced marketing expenses signifanctly based upon comments made by Joe Megibox on 6/29 in [this CNBC video](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/06/29/purple-ceo-on-the-popularity-of-mattresses-as-americans-stay-at-home.html) to 30% of sales (thanks u/deepredsky).\n* I reduced June wholesale revenue to 12.6M to be conservative based upon another possible interpretation of Joe's comments in [this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&feature=emb_logo).   It is a hard pill to swallow that June wholesale sales would be less than May's.   The only reasoning I can think of is if May caused a large restock and then June tapered back off.   The previous number of $19.0M was still a retrenchment from the 40-50% YoY growth rate.   I'm going to keep the more conservative number (thanks again u/deepredsky).\n* I modified the number of outstanding shares used for EPS calculations from 53M (last quarters number used on the 10-Q) to almost 73M based upon the fact that all of the warrants and employee stock options are now in the money.   Math below. (thanks DS\\_CPA1 on Stocktwits for pointing this out)\n\n**Capital Structure for EPS Calculations**\n\nFrom the [recent S-3 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000119312520140451/d922462ds3a.htm#rom922462_11) for the May secondary, I pulled the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qw7awg8w7sg51.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=66c884682ddb8517939468ab1e6780742f55d427\n\nI diluted earnings by the above share count.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Model With Warrant Liability Going to Zero**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cz2ydomi4sg51.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=53cc457a3143cabb16bfff9a1503054a9a8c0fca\n\n**Model With Warrant Liability Going to $47M**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2hltrgf5sg51.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=41cbe73a7aa0894a86a09ccc9179b100e9d3372d\n\nA few people called me out on my assumption, that I also said could be wrong.   My favorite callout came from u/lawschoolbluesny who started all smug and condescending, and proceeded to tell me about June 31st, from which I couldn't stop laughing.   Stay in law school bud a bit longer...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dd4tcdue4sg51.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=d27f3ad40c702502ee62f106b6135f0db2c1e7be\n\nOne other comment he made needs an answer because WHY we are accruing MATTERS a lot!\n\n>Now that we have established that coliseum still has not exercised the options as of july 7, and that purple needs to record as a liability the fair value of the options as of june 31, we now need to determine what that fair value is. You state that since you believe that there is no logical reason that coliseum won't redeem their warrants \"there is no longer a warrant liability where the company may need to repurchase warrants back.\" While I'm not 100% certain your logic here, I can say for certain that whether or not a person will redeem their warrants does not dictate how prpl accounts for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe warrant liability accrual DOES NOT exist because the warrants simply exist.   The accrual exists because the warrants give the warrant holder the right to force the company to buy back the warrants for cash in the event of a fundamental transaction for Black Scholes value ($18 at the end of June--June 31st that is...).  And accruals are adjusted for the probability of a particular event happening, which I STILL argue is close to zero.\n\nA fundamental transaction did occur.   The Pearce brothers sold more than 10M shares of stock which is why the exercise price dropped to zero.   (Note for DS\\_CPA1 on Stocktwits:  there is some conflicting filings as to what the exercise price can drop to.   The [originally filed warrant draft](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000121390019003226/f8k022119ex10-2_purple.htm) says that the warrant exercise price cannot drop to zero, but a[subsequently filed S-3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000119312520140451/d922462ds3a.htm#rom922462_11), the exercise price is noted as being able to go to zero.  I'm going with the S-3.)\n\nNow, here is where it gets fun.   We know from from the [Schedule 13D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409751/000119312520188937/d871811dsc13da.htm) filed with a July 1, 2020 event date from Coliseum that Coliseum DID NOT force the company to buy back the warrants in the fundamental transaction triggered by the Pearce Brothers (although they undoubtably accepted the $0 exercise price).   THIS fundamental transaction was KNOWN to PRPL at the end Q4 and Q1 as secondary filings were made the day after earnings both times.   This drastically increased the probability of an event happening.\n\nWhere is the next fundamental transaction that could cause the redemption for cash?  It isn't there.  What does exist is a callback option if the stock trades above $24 for 20 out of 30 days, which we are already 8 out of 10 days into.\n\nBased upon the low probability of a fundamental transaction triggering a redemption, the accrual will stay very low.   Even the CFO disagrees with me and we get a full-blown accrual, I expect a full reversal of the accrual next quarter if the 20 out of 30 day call back is exercised by the company.\n\nI still don't understand why Coliseum would not have exercised these.\n\nRegardless, the Warrant Liability Accrual is very fake and will go away eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ONE MORE THING...\n\nSeriously, stop PMing me with stupid, simple questions like \"What are your thoughts on earnings?\", \"What are your thoughts on holding through earnings?\",  and \"What are your thoughts on PRPL?\".\n\nIt's here.

Instead of a nearly $8M gain that you're suggesting, I believe that the warrant accrual is actually going to cause a $39M+ loss for the quarter. \n\nTo start, we can determine that coliseum still had (and thus didn't exercuise) its incremental loan warrents as of July 1. If we look at the SC 13D/A filed on July 8th (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409751/000119312520188937/d871811dsc13da.htm)  we can see that, as of its previous filing,  Coliseum Capital Management, LLC has 16,956,602 shares accounting for 39.1% of the class A shares of prpl.  If you look at note 1, you will see that the 16,956,602 includes \"(d) 2,613,240 shares of Class A Stock that could be obtained upon conversion of 2,613,240 warrants received in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 26, 2019, by and among Purple Innovation, LLC, CCP, the Separate Account and COC (the “Incremental Loan Warrants”), with each Incremental Loan Warrant providing the right to purchase one share of the Class A Stock per Incremental Loan Warrant at a price of $5.74 per share.\"\n\nSince we know that coliseum has not exercised the options as of July, 7th, we know that prpl will need to account for these in some way in the q2 earnings. This is evident if you look at page 13 of their q1 earnings (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000121390020011641/f10q0320_purpleinnovation.htm). There they state that \"The liability for the warrants is subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date with changes in the fair value included in earnings\" and include the fair value of the options on december 31st, and march 31st. \n\nNow that we have established that coliseum still has not exercised the options as of july 7, and that purple needs to record as a liability the fair value of the options as of june 31, we now need to determine what that fair value is. You state that since you believe that there is no logical reason that coliseum won't redeem their warrants \"there is no longer a warrant liability where the company may need to repurchase warrants back.\" While I'm not 100% certain your logic here, I can say for certain that whether or not a person will redeem their warrants does not dictate how prpl  accounts for them. \n\n\nReturning to page 13 of their q1 earnings, we see that fair value is determined \"using a Monte Carlo Simulation of a Geometric Brownian Motion stock path model with the following assumptions.\" Basically this means that they find a likely share price and subtract the strike price of the warrant. However, there is a twist: the warrants can have their strike price reduced to zero in certain curcumstances, specifically if there is a fundamental transaction. While prpl incorporated the potential odds that a fundamental transaction would occur into their model of their fair value of the warrant, we do not have to as we know a fundamental transaction did in fact occur. In fact, we even know that the fundamental transaction has set the strike on these warrants permantely to 0. (see page 47 here where it states that the strike would be set at zero if a specific shareholder sold 10M+ shares - https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000119312520144150/d922462d424b1.htm - see this form where that very shareholder actually sells 10m+ shares - https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000121390020015578/xslF345X03/ownership.xml ) \n\nI'm getting super tired of writing this out so let me cut to the chase: prpl was trading at close to $18 on june 31, the date that is relevant for the q2 earnings. Becuase of what I said above, the strike for the warrants is now 0.00. Therefore, the absolute minimum worth of the warrants is $18 each, which totals $47,038,320. Currently, prpl only has $8m reserved so prpl will have atleast a $39,038,320 loss attributable to the increase in reserves. \nI hope im wrong and before anyone freaks out, even if im right, its very possible that analysts won't care as this is merely a paper loss, not a real one.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I assumed 35m accrual for warrants.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You nailed it.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Haha yeah give or take a milli.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I could be wrong but warrant accruals should only impact GAAP EPS right ?

I will have time to do a deep dive in the numbers later but they have an unhealthy debt balance (and a significant coupon) which is going to pull back their revenue.

But its entirely possible that the company uses their capital to continue to grow. Maybe in the future the share price hits $400. The person who bought at $200 and sold at $400 also made profit. And this may continue. Where do these profits come from? Wealth creation from the growth of the company. Everyone can profit in this model. \nNow lets look at options: you bought an options contract for $100 and sold for $200. You profited, but where did this profit come from? It came from someone else's pocket. And when you add up all the gains, and all the loses on options, it adds up to 0. Zero sum game - be the smartest and you can win.
