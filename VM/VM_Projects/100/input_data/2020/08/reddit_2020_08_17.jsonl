Sometimes, people want cash more than a reduced cost basis, so they will opt for Scenario 1.\n\nI think the financetrain article has it backwards. Put < Dividend - Cost looks right to me, for the scenario where the goal is to reduce the cost basis on a \"similar\" position.\n\nI'll add that long shares + long put may have a P/L chart similar to a long call, but that doesn't mean they are identical positions. There are two sides to the \"shares have *huge* downside risk to zero\" argument.

I see exiting trades as more of a skill and it takes considerable time to master it.\n\nI do have a day job and cannot devote as much time into active day trading but do like the options trading approach. The only way I can trade with options is if I take some LEAPS contracts that expire 6-9 months or more in the future. Particularly looking into AMZN as I'm bullish on its value in long term. I looked at the volume and open interest and it was concerning as the volume was a bit low - which caused the bid-ask spread to be way big ($10x100).

If you have a 401k, up to the match, and if you have an HCRA, at least twice the cash minimum. Equities are not inflated world wide, only in certain developed countries. If you use a global fund like VT or VXUS, you can get some exposure outside the US, while still getting market cap weighted exposure to the US as well, should it break out. You are at the beginning of your investment career and this is the time to take maximum advantage of tax-advantage accounts, to get 40+ years of re-investment and compounding. Equities may seem to be irrationally overpriced in a 3 year time frame, but not a 3 decade time frame.\n\nHere are two good guides: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics\n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio\n\n> I wanted to get some perspective on LEAPS options from the community. Is this a good investment strategy or am I not thinking right?\n\nExpirations greater than 60 days, whether LEAPS or not, need to have adequate justification for their high cost. You need a very good reason to invest in those expirations, and the reasons you list above are not, imo, good enough. You have much better alternatives.\n\nFor example, I trade a lot of vertical spreads with 30-45 DTE entries. Most are credit spreads, so that I can exploit time decay and relax, as they are low maintenance and, the way I enter them, low worry. It's not quite fire-and-forget, but it's close to that. Also, a vertical spread is a defined risk strategy. It effectively has a stop-loss built in.\n\nAnother strategy I use is The Wheel. It is also a credit strategy that is even lower maintenance and lower worry than vertical spreads. Done correctly, you don't need to realize a loss on a Wheel. You can defer a loss basically for as long as you want. So again, no need to for an SL.\n\nWheel guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/\n\nI've traded a handful of other types of positions, long calls, debit spreads, diagonals, Iron Condors, etc. Some of those require more attention and are sometimes riskier, so I keep these to a small number open at any given time.\n\nSince I use low maintenance trades, I can get by with GTC orders for exiting, which allows me to focus my small window of daily time on entries. Also, doing homework and prep research with what-if analysis during off-market hours helps me make the most of the limited daily time.\n\n**TL;DR**, options with expirations greater than 60 days are expensive and thus have limited optimal use cases.

Amazon is a bit better than average (correlation wise), still worse than Tencent, AMD and SQ though. Apple is similiar to Amazon, and it's a good stock in general.\n\nTL;DR if you want to diversify Tesla, look into Tencent, Square and AMD.

There will be a time in the future where it is mandatory, but I think it will take a long time for government regulations and market turnover to get to the point where airbags are now.

The company states that “reliably determining the origin [of raw materials] is a difficult task.”1 The use of cobalt in lithium-ion batteries poses human rights risks for Tesla. 60% of cobalt globally is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where child labor is pervasive.2 Cobalt mining is one of the worst forms of child labor. Children work in mines at risk of collapse, use sharp tools, and lack safety equipment. Tesla is among five companies facing a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of 14 children and parents from the DRC, which includes allegations of “aiding and abetting in the death and serious injury of children who claim they were working in cobalt mines in their supply chain.”3 While Tesla reports on cobalt sourcing procedures and indicates it is looking for ways to reduce the cobalt in its batteries, the company does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate its cobalt supply chain is free of child labor. Conflict minerals, steel, lithium, rubber, mica, and electronics may also present human rights risks for Tesla.\n\nIn Tesla's operations, a federal judge ruled in 2019 that Tesla violated labor laws on 12 different occasions for preventing employees from exercising their right to unionize, including disciplining and firing employees for union activity.\n\nWorking conditions and high injury rates in Tesla's factories may violate the human right to safe and healthy working conditions. From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont, CA plant had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as 10 major U.S. auto plants combined, resulting in fines.6 Insufficient safety trainings, noncompliant safety markings, exposure to toxins, and undercounting or mislabeling of injuries, which may falsely signal an improvement in conditions, have been documented at Tesla's plants.\n\nWhile Tesla has a Supplier Code of Conduct, a “Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy,” and says it commits to “only sourcing responsibly produced materials,” these guidelines only apply to suppliers. Tesla lacks a baseline commitment to respect human rights throughout its operations and its disclosure do not demonstrate that its due diligence effectively prevents, mitigates, or remediates adverse human rights impacts.\n\nResolved: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors prepare a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, on Tesla's processes for embedding respect for human rights within operations and through business relationships.”", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "With respect to the unionizing issue, your argument is more relevant to a revision of federal law, and it is a good argument.

If it's so complicated, why can every human do it?  The hardest parts of learning how to drive are getting used to how much pressure to put on the gas and break to make the drive comfortable.  How much gap is required to safely left turn across traffic, things like that. Most accidents aren't caused by an inability to drive properly, but by a lack of attention in the moment, or something happening where 1-2 drivers aren't currently looking.  Driving in general is pretty easy.  Roads are a REASONABLY controlled environment.\n\nYou can think of the randomness of driving and the weird rare actions as a brand new strategy in a game like Go, or Chess.  Brand new, out of the box, never seen before.  Yet the computer rolls with it and crushes the opponent anyway, because to a computer, it's only very very slightly different than normal, all it has to do is avoid the weirdness and continue on its merry way.\n\nFor now, the learning is supervised.  Keep in mind, humans drive Tesla's.  Even when their software is not driving, the software runs in shadow mode comparing itself to what the human driver does and learning from the differences.  I do something it doesn't expect or wouldn't have done, it immediately sends that to the mothership as an \"interesting\" occurrence, which can then be used to train for the situation.\n\nSoon(ish), self supervised learning will happen via Tesla's DOJO project.  Once NNs get to self-supervised learning is when they never lose to a human again in any context.  Up until that point, they will only win 99.9% of the time.  That's probably enough for level 5 driving.\n\nKeep in mind, humans are not even close to perfect drivers.  Even the level 2.5 stuff Tesla's do now is unquestionably safer on highway drives than a human driver.  Statistics show this very very clearly already.

{"title": "TD Ameritrade Almost Infinite Buying Power", "selftext": "Disclaimer: you really shouldn’t do this, especially if you are not 95% sure the direction the stock will go within a short timeframe\n\nI discovered this completely by accident but on think or swim, if you create an OCO (on cancel order) order with very little price incriminates, multiple orders can get filled regardless of whether or not you actually have the money in you’re account. You still need the money to cover the first order but in the event subsequent orders get filled before the system can cancel, the contracts are yours. For whatever reason, TD Ameritrade lets the trade play out despite the lack of funds which is somewhat impressive. One response I got was, you’re a grown up, it’s you’re account. If things go wrong it’s on you but if it works out, we won’t take you’re gains. \n\nFirst time \nI was trying to get rid of my spy call at open back in June. They were worth maybe $1200 according to the profit option calculator but I didn’t know for sure so I set sell orders for $12, $12.05, $12.10, etc up to maybe $12.30. $12 got filled, but I guess $12.05 got filled also so I was now naked the call despite my account not being approved for it. I called them up crying, begging to get out the trade, the agents like man calm down, you’re up $50 on the trade, leg up or down to create a spread and you’re guaranteed to win no matter what. \n\nSecond \nLam research a week before earnings. I had a good idea lam would beat but wasn’t willing to bet my life on it. My account balance got wiped out maybe 95% and only shot up after lam beat and the stock rose long enough for me to unload down some poor kids throat at the high. \n\nThird time\nNvda this Friday. Nvda will hit $500 and maybe $520. I had Oco to get $500c exp sep 4 ($932 each) I got filled multiple times against my account value. Unloaded this morning for 100% gain.... Kinda hoping the stock drops so I can get back in. The dumbest thing I did was hedge by selling $520c friday instead of manning up and waiting until Monday.\n\n\nThis usually happens to me on accident. But let’s say you are bullish and just know a stock will jump, theoretically you could max out you’re buying power with a single order, and hope you’re other orders get filled before the system can cancel them. \n\nIf you are wrong, god help you! You’ll be on the hook for a lot of money.\n\nIn the screenshot below you can see I was negative $1000 account balance.\n\n[screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/7GXVwiM)", "id": "ibg0ka", "created_utc": 1597677352.0, "score": 234, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|108|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ibg0ka)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ibg0ka)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Incoming policy change at TD Ameritrade in 3... 2... 1...", "score": 282, "replies": [{"body": "\"One response I got was, you’re a grown up, it’s you’re account.

{"title": "DD - RXT, Amazon and Microsoft's Service Provider (Long Play)", "selftext": "Alright, listen up retards - this is some potentially good shit that you may be ignoring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRackspace Technology (RXT) IPO'd August 5th at $16.85 to a lukewarm reception, mainly due to the fact that much more formidable companies were IPO'ing the same day or week (BIGC, RKT). Since then the shares have popped a bit - most likely closing today around 18.00.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is Rackspace?\n\nRackspace is a cloud computing service provider. Since most of you can barely use a keyboard, I'll explain further.\n\nTheir primary business comes from developing cloud solutions for clients utilizing third-party cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, etc.). In addition, Rackspace also provides long-term service for the systems that they develop. The industries that they are involved in is extremely diverse - from automotive maintenance to energy/government services.\n\nRackspace also maintains partnerships with almost all of the aforementioned major cloud computing providers present in the industry. This allows them to more effectively bargain with the providers whose platforms they are using - granting them a more advantageous price point than other competitors. These partnerships also help to retain their customer base as it allows for more complex solutions to be developed for changing circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ok, so what?\n\nI believe that the major mistake individual investors are making when it comes to evaluating RXT is that they believe that they are *competing* instead of *cooperating* with the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Rackspace's goal when it comes to dealing with these giants is to leverage their service's potential to obtain a better price point for their use of large provider's cloud platforms. This allows Rackspace to generate income not only on the service contracts they provide - but also on the margin that is created from the reduced costs of infrastructure.\n\nBecause Rackspace is good at what they do, managing cloud infrastructure, these larger cloud providers see the potential to offload a part of their managed services to them at a better price - saving the cloud providers money and providing Rackspace with additional revenue. The truth of the matter, however, is that the more managed cloud business that these providers handoff to decrease costs, the more leverage and bargaining power Rackspace gains - further allowing Rackspace to reduce costs for the infrastructure they build.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ok, fine. So what happens when Amazon and Microsoft start providing the service instead?\n\nFair question, you fucking retard.\n\nIn short, they won't. It's far too costly for the meager payoff that they would get from it. Also, because of the fact that Rackspace is generating revenue from the reduced costs to build their systems, it may not be economically feasible for a larger cloud provider to get into this market. Amazon AWS cannot create a leverageable position in the market by utilizing all platforms simultaneously as they can only provide AWS - the same goes for Microsoft Azure, etc.\n\nThe most likely way that one of these larger players would get into this market is buying out RXT, not forming a competitor from scratch. This seems likely as RXT is currently owned by Apollo Global Management (who took the company private in 2016). Apollo most likely took RXT public to recoup some of their initial investment, however, the company going public once again signals that the firm is willing to accept a buyout from another major player.\n\nAlso, an additional note, RXT's current market cap is low - about 3.7 billion. For a company like Microsoft or Amazon, this is a drop in the bucket. If Rackspace continues to do what they do well and there is growth in the market they exist in - one of these larger players will absolutely buy out the firm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions or ban faggot\n\nI suggest going long on shares for this one. I know you autists like options plays and have the long term horizons of an onlyfans e-girl, but there's far too much potential long-term on this one to miss out on getting shares when they're cheap. If you have some real balls you can look into February 2021 options (2/19 25c) but they're currently not trading normally due to options being introduced recently for the stock. If you can get them cheap it might be worth it, but I would suggest just dumping money into shares.\n\nMy suggestion would be to try to get in on shares at anywhere around 17.50 - 17.75, increasing position steadily up to 19.00 - 19.50. This stock has too much potential to ignore, and with only about 200M shares outstanding any good news / high profit will throw this thing to the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR ; Buy the dips on RXT and increase position over time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards you fucking idiots", "id": "iblsbp", "created_utc": 1597694890.0, "score": 82, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Does she have Rackspace though?

As you noted, they resell cloud solutions on AWS and Azure, but their big value to customers is that they provide value-added services that companies can't do themselves. If you're a medium-sized construction company and want to create a comprehensive cloud-based solution to manage supply, inventory, new sales, and customer relationship management, AWS or Azure won't build that for you -- they are mostly self-service. But Rackspace will. That's why they're so well-diversified across industries.\n\nRXT is not the only provider in this arena -- there's competition from everywhere, including other small CSPs as well as AWS, Azure, and Google themselves. Note that RXT is unlikely to land the biggest-of-the-biggest contracts because the hyperscalers will take those on directly as flagship/lighthouse direct deals that they can brag about (these are the huge, well-publicized cloud deals like JEDI, WMT, NFLX, etc.). But the small-to-medium/largeish deals are up for grabs and Rackspace has good positioning here.\n\nSmall disagreement with you -- I don't think RXT has substantially more negotiating power as compared to other CSPs.  I think they pay the same rates as everyone else, but those rates are already racing to the bottom because of competition between AWS, Azure, and Google (and other smaller players).
