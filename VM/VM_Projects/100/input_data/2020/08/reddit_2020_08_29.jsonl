They have many business problems that a lot of people don't talk about, and which get suppressed or downvoted in social media due to the cult love of the Netflix service.  \n\nOne is that they're insane when it comes to spending.  Studios normally live or die on a razor's edge of miserly budgeting and surgical decision making on which projects to approve, sometimes inching forward only a couple episodes or shoots at a time.\n\nMeanwhile Netflix approves anything and everything, tests nothing, doesn't negotiate, they just flood creators with lottery jackpots of money.  For content creators, it's been heaven, but it's not even close to sustainable.  You simply can't make money giving guys $60 million for 3 standup routines.  Any \"real\" studio that approved every pitch and outbid every distributor by 10x would be bankrupted in 3 seconds.  \n\nSo the obvious question: why isn't Netflix bankrupt? Well, technically, they sort of *are*.  Insolvency is when your debt obligations exceed your ability to pay them, and by Netflix's numbers, that's where they are currently.  Netflix has massive, massive debt, that's very unpopular to mention to fans, and also to Wall Street guys, because, as the top of this story states, Netflix is a darling of the stock market guys.\n\nContrary to popular misrepresentation, Netflix is NOT actually profitable.  How can it be?  They give people $100+ worth of entertainment for $10.  They push dozens of dollars worth of rich digital bits to you for far less than the raw data even costs to send.  \n\nTheir debt is so large, Forbes estimated that at current rates, they'd need 100 years to pay it off, but only if they stopped borrowing.  Except they're *not* ceasing to borrow.  They're taking on *more* debt.  \n\nSo why don't people realize this?  Well, they've been good at using funky accounting to downplay the debt and make it seem like some abstract future problem not to be worried about.  They claim to be technically \"profitable\" which is all the wall street guys want to hear.  They hope nobody notices the huge operational losses.  And people, especially fans and Wall Street, tend to hear what they want to hear.  (See also: Tesla)\n\nAnd unlike other businesses, Netflix can't just adopt regular price increases to slow those losses.  Whenever they try to raise prices, subscribers get skittish.  Last year they experimented in some test market with price hikes to see if it might slow growth.  But it was much worse.  It didn't just slow growth, it reversed it.  They lost customers, and they had to abandon the market trials.\n\nThey also have to stop spending insanely.  But now, they almost can't do that either, since they've created the false expectations with content creators.  And worse, they're now bidding against the richest and most evil companies on earth: Disney, Apple, Google, Amazon, AT&T, Facebook, China.  They did this to themselves.\n\nAnother issue is saturation.  Who do you know that doesn't have Netflix already?  The pat answer is \"what about other countries\", but the problem there is the price that other country markets will bear tends to be much lower, which works against Netflix.\n\nNetflix is basically in a race for survival.  They need to outlast the debt that's chasing them and they need to win the land grab of loyal subscribers, then sneak the price upward somehow.  I'd be more confident if they would have opened up a bigger head start back when there was no competition.  Like if they'd gotten closer to break even operations.  But the fact they're still far from true, organic profit and now they have lots of competitors who have bottomless pockets... that's not great for Netflix.\n\nAnother pat answer is \"advertising/freemium/premium\".  But again, they trained subscribers to be fickle.  They trained them to expect thousands of dollars worth of movie rentals for $7.  And having been trained, customers would freak out to see ads.  They already do rebel against trailers and previews.  If Netflix announced commercials, you'd see the mother of all cancel culture uprisings.\n\nAnd Netflix is still free-riding on other company's infrastructure, by virtue of the fact that we all use it over our data plans. If Netflix had to actually bear the true costs of their service  the price would be $15/month PLUS the cost of a high bandwidth account, say $75.  Other than a few token partnerships and squabbles, they've somehow managed to hitchhike by getting providers and consumers to not realize they're subsidizing most of Netflix's overhead.  They've also thus far ducked regulation that squeezes legacy tv providers.\n\nThe one advantage they have is they're still the most loved and respected streaming brand.  And sometimes that's enough.  Apple products have become increasingly overpriced and they cut back features and functions and support and product life constantly.  Still, because they're a beloved brand, they succeed.  That could happen for Netflix.  But they really need to stop overpaying for content and then dumping it in one day, squandering its value.  My guess is they can't win this race, but they'll end up merging with someone who can take the losses and find other ways to make it work.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "What's the problem with users paying for Netflix's data? That's how pretty much all services over the internet work, and it's basically an understanding that the consumer is paying for access to the internet on their end, while NFLX pays for their datacentres and access on the other. Both components add together to maintain the overall internet network.\n\n(I agree with most everything you've said, btw, but this perspective is a bit strange to me)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You have to consider the sheer scale of it.  Netflix uses 30-80% of most people's internet traffic, yet Netflix doesn't pay for that.  The other \"all services\" you reference, like your email or banking web site or whatever use one millionth of one percent.  It's not even close.\n\nUsing the analogy of a road, where individuals and corporations share the public access, it would be as if Netflix hogged every street by running 500 cars wide and you could barely get your bike in between.  Yet they pay nothing for piggishly taking advantage.  We let them.  The providers let them.  \n\nAnd how it's relevant is in the somewhat self-deluding mental gymnastics people use to justify their consumption choices.  \n\nBefore Netflix, movies and entertainment cost something.  Families would spend $20 a week renting a couple of movies or $40 a week visiting cinemas.   To put it in monthly terms, $90-$150/month.  That was sustainable.  Netflix giving 2000 movies for $7/month breaks that, and is not sustainable.  \n\nIt hasn't crumbled yet because of the loss leader land rush of mega corps and investors footing the losses.  But if it ever had to be justified, either the price of Netflix would have to skyrocket, or the quantity of what you get would have to be slashed.  \n\nIt's even more stark with Disney Plus, who are giving away 100 years worth of beloved valuable content for... $3/month.  That's ridiculously unsustainable.  They're pumping easily $20-$30 worth of data bits, let alone the added value of the intellectual property.  Worse, they're training a whole generation of customers that each Disney movie ever made is now worth about 10 cents.  Previously, they'd trained customers that Cinderella or The Lion King were these somehow scarce resources, kept in an imaginary vault, a vault that would only be opened every 12 years and \"giving\" those customers a chance to replace their $25 melted VHS with a $30 DVD, and then replace their $30  scratched DVD with a $35 bluray, and so on, multiplied by 70 films.  Today's kids will never value a Disney movie again, after bingeing them of $3 Disney Plus.\n\nCord cutters are too young and unaware of the current incongruency of it.  So they think getting everything for nothing is normal.  \n\nWhen they do price comparison, they look at a cable bill and say \"it's $100, what a ripoff!\"  They don't realize it's about 80/20 of broadband data to content.  \n\nThen they compare the $100 to Netflix at $7 or $14, conveniently forgetting that to use Netflix, they have to pay for a $75-100 data plan.  A more fair comparison would be to include the cost of a data plan, because Netflix without data is... nothing.  Instead, they fire Netflix as the hero and they hate the cable provider who is actually making it possible.

My understanding is that Netflix actually works with ISPs and providers to help reduce the cost as well - by providing geographically nearby servers, they reduce the amount of data that needs to cross over expensive, long interconnections. \n\nI can understand your viewpoint, but I think I disagree - Netflix is just another type of traffic using common infrastructure (rather like Amazon using the road network for it's deliveries). We pay for the infrastructure separately to the service itself, because it doesn't really make sense for them to be combined. To claim that people \"ignore\" the cost of data in the cost of Netflix is maybe justifiable, but this is a service people use anyway - Netflix is actually using up that capacity and requiring further infrastructure, of course, which may indirectly lead to higher costs, but that also benefits every other use of the internet for some purpose or another, not just Netflix.\n\n(link to Netflix working with ISPs to reduce unnecessary network utilisation)\nhttps://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/how-netflix-works-with-isps-around-the-globe-to-deliver-a-great-viewing-experience", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">  Moving data isn't that expensive in this day and age \n\nNot really.

Always wrong, and always with oblivious but misplaced confidence. \n\nMeanwhile, TV remains an unkillable cockroach. It rises and falls, but it persists.  It's the most addictive product ever invented.  Hell, people like you even said radio died 70 years ago. But guess, what?  There's 10 stations still pumping out junk in your city right now.  \n\n \n>  Hbo showing one episode of Lovecraft Country on Sunday night isn’t gonna cut it for the vast majority of people. \n\nAnd yet HBO is thriving.

The company is deliberately plowing every dollar into growing the company. If Tesla wasn't building 3 factories at the same time and expanding the other ones they'd show a much larger profit. I think the only reason they even bothered to show a profit at all was because they were trying to qualify for S&P 500 inclusion.\n\nI always use Amazon as an example of the same thing. For so many years people kept talking about how their P/E was too high, they weren't making any money. Look at them now. How many people missed out on one of the great investments because they were valuing it incorrectly? Jeff Bezos had better places for that cash flow than sending it to the bottom line as profit. As a bonus it saved them lots of money in taxes.\n\nTesla, IMHO, is one of the great growth stories of all time.

They want to change the world by transitioning it to a sustainable future. The Alien Dreadnought is coming online in China. GigaBerlin and Austin are making major progress. Tesla Semis and Cybertrucks aren't online yet.\n\nThey've had huge success with energy storage in Australia and have contracts for South Australia, UK, Dubai, and California. Their Autobidder software is printing them money. Their battery day is likely to either achieve ~400W/hr or come close to it. Supposedly, they're close to L5 autonomy and may be away from achieving it by at most another year.\n\nThey're production constricted for their power packs, because demand is greater than supply. They are selling every single car they're making and they made a profit in the middle of a black swan event despite having one of their core American plants shut down and then reduced to 30% capacity.\n\nAnd with the Chinese market just unlocked, their sales number in Q3 and Q4 will be quite enlightening via China.\n\nFinally, and *most* importantly. TSLA opened at 442.64 at 9:30a today, and closed at 514.75 by the end of extended hours. The stock went up 72 dollars in a day. A solid 16% gain, and people are going to be buying it in droves to get in on the next run up to 2-4k range per share.\n\nI suspect with all of the above, the stock will break 7-800 by battery day and reach or cross 1k by end of September. Ark investment thinks that their analysis of 7k/share (pre-split) is still valid and are holding on that. If TSLA achieves L5 by end of the year to mid year next, they'll go all in on RoboTaxis. Which is going to eat into Uber and Lyft's market considerably. If L5 autonomy is achieved, you won't need drivers for grubhub or Uber eats style businesses. Customers would be able to directly interact with food services with everything becoming seamless through the car.\n\nAs all these items come online, their stock is going to skyrocket higher and higher. 7k might end up becoming an *average* marker with beyond 7k becoming the next peak.\n\nBut fundamentally, once the stock crosses the ~3k boundary, it becomes out of reach but the biggest hedge funds and banks, which tend to want to short stock than hold them. Equally, 3k and beyond means individual investors can't get in. This means that TSLA will *have* to split their stock again and again and again.\n\nNormally, a company splitting their stock could be viewed negatively because of share dilution, but there's enough evidence to the contrary that with TSLA, it won't matter. The technology, science, software, and vertical integration advantage backed by a philosophy of reinvesting most of the money made back into company and r&d means that they'll become like Nvidia, where they are competing with themselves and not their competition in the market. Ark thinks TSLA's around 3-4 years ahead with their software stack from rest of the automakers, and their battery tech is around the same time scale too.\n\nAnd with the insane demand to be part of the company which is basically uprooting every market it enters via evolutionary changes, there's little that can stop their momentum.\n\nAnd in closing, Elon has said on Twitter that he's got ideas for an eVTOL already, that he *really* wants to do that, but his brain will melt if he tries. Between Tesla, SpaceX, Boring, OpenAI, and Neuralink he's pretty capped. He also said that they'll achieve 500W/kg in 3-4 years. Electric jets are only possible once battery tech crosses ~450W/kg. Tesla will very much likely enter that market 2025-2027, and their energy business will likely overtake their auto business.\n\nSo, they'll have to keep splitting their stock over time. 10 shares becomes 50, then 250, then 1250, then 6250. ***I AM ASSUMING A 5:1 SPLIT EACH TIME, I COULD BE WRONG BUT I'M ROLLING WITH IT.***\n\nPoint is, after just 3 more 5:1 splits, IF the stock still goes up to 5k a share because of all their staggering levels of disruption, you'd be sitting on a multi-million dollar investment. It becomes a long term golden egg. So don't sell your pre-split holdings. It's a 10 year lock and key stock. Only dip into it if you need money for life alerting events. Sell around it or expand it.\n\n*One other point. For *many* Tesla has become an idea of the future promised in the 90s that 2000 and 2010 would be. For *many*, they're now betting on that. You look at other ICE car makers and they're starting to put out EVs, but they're still token EVs. They're business decisions being made for them in a way that doesn't cannibalize their ICE supply chain. People don't want to perpetuate and oil and ICE future. They want an EV future with cars that drive themselves and to live in an era where in the next 10-25 years flying cars are a normality. The fact that Tesla can keep raising money despite burning **so much** of it constantly should tell you exactly how the market and people feel about the company.

They focused so much on generating ad revenue and putting crap in front of you instead of the information you actually wanted (kinda sounds like Google now...) that they lost out to the young upstart with a focused interface and a better business model. \n\nUnless Tesla starts selling ads on the center screen (dear god no!) and then some how realized they can make more money from that than from any other revenue stream, they have very little incentive to shit focus away from making great cars. \n\nBlackberry is more like Chrysler in this analogy. They know the market is shifting away from what they sell. But they are stuck in a classic innovators dilemma. Do i shift resources away and loose existing customers chasing new customers that I may never acquire, or do I continue to use my resources to make the product my current customers think they want.. until they don’t (and I’m screwed). Tesla is the Apple in this scenario. They are providing the innovative new product that is disrupting the incumbents position and putting them in the position of having to choose, a slow painful death or a risky bet the company change in direction. Most incumbents aren’t willing to gamble like that. See GE, AOL, Westinghouse, etc. \n\nI think we have a long time before we need to worry about Tesla being disrupted. They are the ones pushing the boundaries right now. I think musk canceling the standard range Y was a stake in the ground. No Tesla is going to have less than 300miles of range in the very near future, the standard 3 will probably get upgraded or replaced with the LR RWD at the same or close price point. All this from production cost reductions and efficiency improvements. No other company is going to compete for a very long time on total value. Just like no competed with the iPhone for a really long time in real value. Which is why I think 20-30% market share is not far fetched. Plus, if the Semi and truck gains large footholds in the heavy vehicle and construction industries, that could have ramifications on the automakers that people aren’t expecting. Those are major profit centers for automakers that could dry up. Ford, Chrysler, Mercedes, all could exit the heavy vehicle industry if the sales volume is cut by more than half.

But what’s going to be really interesting is if someone like LG Chem who is currently subcontracted by GM to make most of the Bolts drivetrain decided to copy Samsung and say they wanted to make the whole car. Maybe LG Chem launches a start up EV car company (or buys a struggling one) and becomes the vertically integrated competitor to Tesla overnight. Like Samsung became to Apple? \n\nThat’s where I’m looking for a real shake up. I’m not worried a bit by the legacies. History tells us they won’t survive. I think that’s why there’s been a new push by investors for GM to spin out its EV holdings into an independent company. So it can survive and let GM die.

So before someone loses their life savings buying $4500 October calls, let's get some facts straight:\n\n* **EPS fallacy**: either he's taking the current EPS (heavily influenced by sales of regulatory credits), then using it to estimate 2025's EPS, basing the multipliers on EV market growth - which is in direct contrast to Tesla continuing to get paid for regulatory credits; Or, if he excluded the credits - how did he arrive at $9.4 for 2020? the figures don't add up. And what are the growth multipliers based on? 2019's total revenue is about the same as TTM. I'm looking at the income statement and I don't see the amazing growth that everyone's talking about.\n* **Cherry-picking auto industry growth data**: The global auto industry market is expected to grow slightly, but US-specific data actually projects a likely decline in sales as less people need or want their own car. Guess where most of Tesla's growth is from? the US. Additional disruptive tech like rideshare & autonomous taxis are closer than we think. China's already running some test zones with AutoX and US regulators will be under pressure to cut red tape. **Tesla's addressable market size might actually be shrinking as we get closer to 2025, not growing.**\n* **EV market share of 20% is 50% speculation and 50% hubris:** Traditional manufacturers are ramping up EV production & new players are emerging (NIO, Nikola, Rivian, Li). Why think that Tesla can hold such a sizable market share? Based on what?\n   * Tesla has had years to build their business in uncharted territory before anyone else. They had virtually unlimited capital from VCs, and received $500M loan from the Department of Energy. They've had virtually no competition. Yet, their core business (sans regulatory credit sales) is still not profitable. Why do we still think Tesla is a well-run, top notch company?\n   * **Consumer loyalty/habits:** cars are not gadgets, Tesla's hype and sales in California mean nothing in the global market. There are customers who would literally never buy anything other than a Toyota, or an Audi (Renault, VW, Audi's EVs are highly popular in Europe, btw). And this intuition is not without merit.\n   * **Reliability concerns:** Tesla's reliability is disputed, with some rating it as the absolute worst. It's certainly a problem now (why anyone would buy a car with such rating is beyond me) - but it's also a potential time bomb: right now there aren't many 5 year old Teslas on the road (50k sales in 2015). What about a year from now? In short, there's a good reason to be worried about increasing reliability complaints (unless they significantly improved their manufacturing in recent years).\n   * **Misleading growth figures:** Cars aren't gadgets, yeah? I need one, not 7. So if an established company already reached strong global presence, and has a revenue of 300B, would we expect it to grow? On the flip side, of course a new player is gonna have nice growth, but it's optics - percentages are fun. If last year one customer bought a Tesla in South Dakota and now there are 5, that's a whopping 500% increase.

So, why would we think that the growth continue like that?Has anyone considered the possibility that Tesla might be exhibiting the early adopter syndrome? they have huge growth up to a certain saturation threshold, and then they go flat, like Blackberry a decade ago.\n* **2025 Horizon vs. present-time**: Even if the analysis was done differently and more reasonably, since when do you price a company by it's projected position in 5 years? \"I think $AZUL will be at $500, $CCL at $200, and $NVDA at $4000, $AMZN at $10k, ergo it's cheap now - buy them\". Hmm, poor reasoning. No, that's not the reason Tesla is priced that high; you're trying to rationalize your speculative investment by crying growth like the kid who cried wolf.I suggest you try to get some perspective by seeing which companies you can choose while staying under Tesla's market cap. For example, consider the following 3 random companies:\n   * **NVDA** is powering the AI & autonomous revolution of the decade, **3.39B net income** TTM, very strong & sure growth projected throughout 2020-2030 with not much competition\n   * **Honda** has strong global presence, reliability & brand name, bulletproof financials, **4.72B net income** TTM, lackluster growth because they're already market leader\n   * **VW** has strong EU presence, EV innovation (see ID.3) & EU EV market penetration, **5.7B net income** TTM, lackluster growth because they're already market leader\n   * All these companies are highly profitable -now-, and expected to continue being so. They have extremely strong global foothold which is not expected to shrink, robust fundamentals, and brand name. Yet you're telling me that it somehow makes sense for TSLA to be worth **more** than these 3 giants **\\*combined\\***? that Tesla which is running at a loss (minus reg. credits), exhibiting reliability issues, and expecting fierce competition? .... why? \"look, 2025!!\". smh\n* **TL;DR:** TSLA has enjoyed an extremely positive sentiment & hype which a lot of investment firms' algos are automatically picking up on. They're here to pump and dump, they're the wolves and you guys are the sheep. There's nothing fundamentally justified in the price. It's only a matter of time before big players come to a decision that TSLA cannot be taken higher without extreme risk, they'll take the profits and dump it. I don't see it crashing hard necessarily but it'll most likely plateau within half a year.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "That's a lot of words that I can't be bothered refuting, but I think you're wrong.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Do you still think I'm wrong? if not I'll check with you again when it goes down to $300.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hahaha!

And they have even more competition. \n\n3. Proven wrong? how so?\n\n4. Again: for a company valuation to make sense it needs to have either corresponding Value (net income, book value etc) and/or Growth. If it only has one then there's a greater burden of proof; Tesla needs to establish how exactly that growth is sustainable and at what point profit is expected (i.e. prove you can maintain or improve growth, and tell me when the margins are gonna be good enough to have profit). \n\nIf there is a 1% segment of the population which are early adopters and tree huggers, that bought Tesla - what happens after you saturate that segment? Again, there needs to be data, not speculation. Data can include public opinion polls, technical comparisons showing a competitive advantage, a market analysis, etc.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}

Currently making videos for the Max Tech YouTube channel. \n\nThis is going to be the most important positive change for Apple ever since I started. You literally have no idea. \n\n— The iPhone 12 is getting released with the A14 chip that will be so much more powerful than the Qualcomm chip in android phones that they won’t be able to catch up for years. (The new 865 plus is hardly faster than last year’s overpriced 865) \n\n— this will be achieved by using TSMC’s brand new 5nm technology which is gonna be more powerful and more power efficient than people are expecting. \n\n— TSMC is already working on their 3nm tech that will be going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\n— they are gonna implement 5G across their iPhone lineup without raising the prices crazy high like other brands like Samsung are forced to do right now. \n\n— leaks have shown that the iPhone 12 pro will come with the widely requested 120Hz display and insane camera recording features (4K at 240fps) \n\n— their Apple silicon chip Macs are gonna be so good and so powerful using TSMC’s 5nm tech that people’s minds will be blown. The new features and battery life are gonna be game changers. \n\n— the transition period to ARM-based chips will be much smoother than people are expecting. \n\n— these Macs will likely also have models with support for 5G cellular. \n\n— their new iPads are gonna start getting redesigned with a modern design for the first time in years. While the android tablets aren’t getting much better. Huge demand upswing. \n\n— the Apple Watch is gonna support more sensors and features than ever before, and they’re gonna release a brand new budget model for the first time. \n\n— Apple is gonna release their brand new services bundles which are gonna be very popular, and we all know that services are where the money is at. \n\n— Apple is gonna release a new Apple TV which will begin to get marketed as a gaming console. They’ll release a new gaming controller at the same time that will work across all of their Apple devices including the iPhone. \n\n— Apple will release a HomePod mini to better compete with the Amazon echo and push their Apple Music sales. \n\n— Apple is gonna begin to switch most of their devices to Mini-LED displays on their devices which will be almost as good as OLED without all of the drawbacks. \n\n— The stock split is gonna allow a bunch of new investors to get in after they realize all of this is happening. \n\nThose are just a few of the reasons why Apple has even more room to grow within the next year. -Vadim from the Max Tech channel on YouTube. \n\nPositions: wait for correction and dip after stock split.
