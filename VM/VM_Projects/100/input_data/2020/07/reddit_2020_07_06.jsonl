Originally I was just going to sell at expiration, but my worry now is that in order to do so, I am going to lose out on quite a bit of profit due to the wide bid/ask spread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So I just checked, Schwab says that the market value of LLNW is currently $7.78 per share. If you exercise then you get to buy 1600 shares of LLNW at a price of $4/share, which as you mentioned is $6400. \n\nThe profit you make is the difference between the $7.78 and $4/share, or $3.78/share, minus the cost you paid per contract (which it seems you said was $0.85 or something, can’t recall exactly and just going to plug it in there). $3.78 - $0.85 = $2.93 per share of profit. For your initial investment the profit is $2.93 * 1600, or $4688. By exercising the calls you must spend $6400 to buy 1600 shares, and you have already spent $1360 to buy 16 contracts at the price of $0.85 per call. However, those shares are currently worth $12,448 on the market and as such you are making quite a big profit because you’re entitled to buy shares at half of the market value, and of course you can instantly turn around and sell them at market value.\n\nCompared to the market value of the calls, of $3.70 (which is actually just the average of the current bid/ask that you posted, nobody is necessarily buying or selling for $3.70), you actually make more profit (in a world where time stops and stock prices never change) at the moment by exercising and instantly selling your stocks than you do by trying to sell the option. I’d recommend doing exactly what you’ve proposed and exercising the option.\n\nNow that the option is ITM and nearing expiry, you can think of it as having very little “time value”/volatility potential left. Part of the value of a long-dated option is its potential to keep going up. This means that, as you near expiry, the value of the option SHOULD reflect very closely the true value of exercising the option, and that a $2 gain in price on the stock will translate to a $2 gain in price on the option contract. \n\nIn other words, the time/volatility element made the contract a better deal to begin with when you bought it (because there was inherent risk that the stock wouldn’t break $4 before expiry - someone sold a call to you hoping that it wouldn’t, you bought it hoping that it would). Now that time/volatility aren’t much of factor anymore in the pricing of the option and the option is deep ITM, you shouldn’t going to see a big difference in change of value before expiry (i.e. your continued profit between now and expiry is not heavily impacted by holding contracts vs. holding shares, you will see very similar price action. Although a $2 gain on calls that each cost $3.70 is more than a 50% gain while the $2 gain on a $7.78 stock is ~25% gain, you already have the same number of calls as you’ll have shares, so from a price action perspective you aren’t better or worse off to continue holding calls at the moment). \n\nObviously the bid/ask is going to be a huge pain in the ass to work around. You’re correct on this. You have to find someone who will pay you the fair value of your contracts if they were redeemed instantly, and preferably someone who adds on a tiny bit more to reflect the period between now and expiry. However with such a large spread you’ll have a very hard time doing this. If you exercise the option you’ll have shares which (ostensibly) do not have the same problem  and which will see the same price action as the calls would have anyways.\n\nYou should exercise if you have the capital, and I’d recommend selling at least some of the stock as well to lock in profits, if not all of it.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The option value may increase to reflect that gap upon market open, so he should check the value at that point prior to exercising the contract.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You explained it to me like I am 5 and I thank you!

Is that accurate? I was originally thinking if the total market value of my call went above $6400, I could essentially just exercise and get the shares instead, but that appears to be wrong.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No. You still need $6400. You purchased the right to buy 1600 shares at $4/share until the date of 7/17. The purchase of that right cost you $1360. Now you must spend an additional $6400 to exercise that right.

The trouble with waiting longer is the time value of the contract decays, so if you choose to wait and see if the stock climbs further, the extrinsic value ($3.70) is likely to go down. On the other hand exercising them is definitely a loss for you, since you paid 16 \\* $0.85 \\* 100 for the right to buy at a higher price than you could get on the market.\n\nAlso volatility increases near earnings call events so that should help boost the extrinsic value of the calls too.

Over the last three months, I have had some good results so I'm thinking of moving some investments around to double the size of the options account.\n\nMy first question is how do I scale up an account and continue to use the same strategy that has worked so far?   Does doubling the account size mean buying 2 contracts instead of 1 for each trade?  I think it must be a matter of calculating the new 3%-5% of balance per position and staying inside that range. For example 10k x .03 = $300 max risk per position, 20k x .03 = $600 max risk per position. Is there more to it than that? I'm worrying about things like difficulty getting filled to close positions with multiple contracts.\n\nSecond question is about picking spreads with enough reward to balance the risk.

The computers discover them and close the gaps faster than I can.\n\nAnyway, looking for some advice on both questions.

There's no magic recipe that works for everyone. There are also as many opinions as there are traders.\n\nI'll give my quick opinion, but understand that you can find a dozen more that will differ in every detail: Decide on a split between you and your bankroll. Whether it is 0/100 or 10/90 or 50/50 or 90/10, that's up to you, but you should pay yourself (take money out of the account for other uses, like a vacation or a new car) and you should reinvest in your trading account. If you have consistent returns, you will eventually build your bankroll to the level you need for whatever additional trading you may want to do. And this is not overnight. It could be months or years to get to the next level.\n\nWhat happens if you lose a lot? You can stop paying yourself until your dig yourself out of the hole, or adjust the split to put more into the trading account, or you can add more money.\n\n> Does doubling the account size mean buying 2 contracts instead of 1 for each trade?\n\nI guess I should have asked first, what is your goal for scaling up? Usually it's to have more degrees of freedom of how to trade and what to trade. You can move up from a $50 underlying to $100, or from $100 to $500, etc. Or you can use more complex positions that have more contracts and more overhead. Or you can maintain at 5% max of account at risk per trade, but now you can buy 2 contracts instead of one. That's up to you.\n\n> I'm worrying about things like difficulty getting filled to close positions with multiple contracts.\n\nThat's independent of the size of your bankroll. Somebody with $2k can have a hard or easy time getting a fill, same as for $25k.\n\n> Second question is about picking spreads with enough reward to balance the risk. I'm hearing that I should stay anchored at 30 delta and the premium should be 1/3 the width of the spreads or a risk/reward of 1 to 0.3. I do find a few trades that qualify but only after spending a lot of time poking around, setting up the trades, looking at the details, then cancelling because most don't qualify.\n\nA lot to unpack here. First, the \"30 delta\" you \"hear\" about is based on backtesting. It's not just superstition, there's data to back it up. One example here: https://spintwig.com/spy-vertical-put-spread-strategy-performance/\n\nYou should not have to open and cancel a trade to figure out if it meets your criteria. You should be able to model the trade on your platform before having to commit money. If you can't, find a new platform. Power Etrade and TDA/tos let you plan a trade before spending any money. Worse case, use [Option Price Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/) to model the trade first.\n\nDebit spreads are going to have risk/rewards in the 2/1 to 10/1 range (or worse, but you should probably avoid worse than 10/1). Finding a spread with a specific ratio is one of those degrees of freedom things I mentioned above in scaling up. You are limited by what underlyings you can afford, right? If you had more money, you have more choices.\n\nThe flip side of that is to do exactly what you are doing: the less money you have, the more patience you need. You're absolutely right, you may have to wait days or weeks before you find a good opportunity. That's just what having a small account means. The temptation is to loosen up your entry criteria and gamble more. I'm sure you can figure out how that usually ends.\n\nI honestly don't think you are missing anything. You are coming to all the right conclusions. It really is as hard as it seems!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.  This is a very detailed answer. More than I expected.  I'll take each bit of your insight to heart.\n\nMy initial goal of option trading was to collect the funds for next year's Roth IRA ($6000 contribution).  I'm well on my way to doing that and  figured if I expand my option account size while still maintaining the same risk profile that has worked so far that I might be able to, as you said, pay myself, for other expenses using the premiums collected above the initial deposit amount.\n\nAs a starting goal of scaling up, it seems like finding a good risk/reward ratio and then opening 2 or 3 contracts rather than 1 while remaining under the maximum risk per trade (I use 3%-5%) is a good starting point.  I don't think I can manage a higher number of new positions than I already have while remaining risk balanced and still maintaining my 9-5 job. I spend a couple of hours each morning poking around in options chains looking for value.\n\nYes, the 30 delta makes sense for evening out the risk/reward ratio when using 70% PoP. I think the reason that we can get ahead is because the market usually overestimates volatility and thus we have the ability to hit those profit targets prior to expiration.\n\nI didn't mean to imply that I had to commit money in order to see the risk reward ratio. What I meant was opening a new trade ticket, picking the legs for the contract and then switching over to \"snapshot analysis\" for review and then backing out if the ratio isn't favorable. Maybe that's the normal way of doing it but the only metric that I know of as a starting point is high IV Rank. In this market, finding an IV Rank > 50% on a non speculative hard-to-borrow stock is tricky. The high end for more stable ETFs seems to be around IV Rank 30%-40%.\n\nThanks again for the response.

Until that extrinsic value is 0 for both legs, you don't get max profit. For example, if the long leg has $3 of extrinsic value and the short leg has $4, $3 - $4 = -$1, which would be subtracted from your max profit.\n\nYou can get close, though. Say TSLA is $3000. The long leg might have $100 of extrinsic value and the short $100.01. You're max profit would only be decreased by $0.01, so very close to max.\n\n> At expiration day, would I have to close out the position for max gain or will it automatically close for me?\n\nSee the Getting Started section at the top of this page.

For example, a VIX of 15 represents a 30-day, one standard deviation move that translates to 15% in annualized terms.\n\nOn the other hand, VIX futures (/VX) are simply futures contracts that are traded to express the anticipation of movement in implied volatility on the S&P 500. So, if traders believe volatility will rise in the future, they will buy VIX futures, and vice versa.\n\nThere are options on the VIX index, but they are slightly different than normal equity options. The difference is that VIX index options are priced to the corresponding /VX futures contract, and not the VIX index number. This is because on the day of the VIX settlement, the /VX futures contract and VIX will be the same.

Today, the energy side it's not a big part of the business yet but the company is clearly laying the ground work for huge growth in this area as both home-scale and grid-scale battery installation becomes increasingly attractive.\n\nIt's not honest to say that Tesla is only an auto-company and only sell cars; it's not really just an energy company either. Tesla doesn't really fit into a nice box for apples to applies comparison to any other company. It's your choice if you want to compare Tesla only to traditional auto OEMs but your picture of the company will become increasingly inaccurate in the next few years if you are not flexible enough to think of Tesla as anything but an auto company.\n\nA good deal of the price speculation on Tesla isn't on the successful roll out of an affordable and desirable EV; Tesla has already done that and they've won.

With a pedigree like that a bet that Tesla can succeed self driving cars, solar, and energy storage seems like a better bet than anything you can ever get at Las Vegas. The price swings on Tesla is a bet on what the company will be like in the future, not so much about how many car it produced yesterday. \n\nP.S.

Then you have the electricity savings.    So whether it is a good deal for you is really dependent on many factors.   \n\nEven where I am with cheap electricity prices it still is a pretty good deal.    I am just using your numbers but lets say the solar roof costs 50k.  And lets say you will have to do and asphalt roof twice for the 30 year timeline I am using.   And further lest say your electricity bill is about 2k a year.      \n\nAsphalt roof x 2 = 16k for 30 years (just going by what a typical asphalt roof will last for here might be longer if you live in a less hardh climate). \n\nElectricity bill - $2000 x 30 years - $60,000 (this is assuming electricity prices don't go up at all in 30 years).  \n\nSo 30 year cost for standard shingle roof and electricity - $76,000\n\nSolar roof - $50,000 - and lets say it is sized too provide all your electricity so that means you pay $0 per year.    So that is your total cost.   So over 30 years you would save $26k in costs based on those numbers.   \n\nSo if you do plan to be in your house long term where you will have to replace the roof multiple times then even with a asphalt shingle roof it can make sense.   If you are getting a premium roof to me it wouldn't make sense not to especially if you live somewhere where the electricity is fairly expensive.  California would be one example.   The only thing I woudl be hesitant on is the more long term issues with a new product but having come from standard solar panels i haven't touched the system at all in the over 6 years I've had it.

I am just learning so I'm not qualified to explain. If you search YouTube for various phrases like \"what are options\" or \"options explained\" and so on, there are loads of excellent tutorials. But the stripped-down version is: If you buy a call, you pay a certain price (called the premium, which varies widely based on complicated factors but basically represents what the market thinks is fair given what will *likely* happen in the future) to lock in the OPTION to buy 100 shares of the stock from your broker at a certain date in the future at a certain price. (Let's say, September 18th at $1000). If the shares are at $1500, you just made a buttload of money. (Because you now own $150,000 worth of shares but only have to pay $100,000 for them.) But most of the time, that doesn't happen so you let the option expire and the broker pockets the premium you paid. (And a lot of the time, if the stock price shoots up, you just go ahead and sell the option itself to some other risk-taker for a hefty profit before the magic due date, just to get out while the getting's good.) The premium is like the coin you put in the slot machine. You never lose more than the coin, but you can win a lot more. Most of the time, you lose and the house keeps your coin, so they come out ahead given the sheer number of players... but a few players are really good, or really lucky, and win a jackpot.

They can gain value to far surpass the SP or they can lose that value just as easily.\n\nMy last post last night was \"The premiums will be worth it.\"  We bought calls this morning and are, so far, doing really well with them, even though the SP at opening was higher.

Maybe long term charts of Price per Revenue can help (attached).\n\nProb is this still lags a quarter, todays P/S is todays share price over last quarters revenue (TTM, I assume).\n\nSo the coming  beat is not charted correctly in this link.  But we can look at this and see that prior to the model 3 it was at a P/S of 10 or higher.  In between that and this run it was avg around 5.  My guess is it SHOULD be above 10, but on 2Q revenue.  So what is 10x Q2 TTM sales?\n\nRight now our price per 1Q TTM sales is around 10, in lines with pre-model 3 numbers.  Killers 2Q margins should drive that higher too.  If we look at 1Q20, we had similar production, but 20% less deliveries.  We also did not have GF china, Model Y, or increase FSD margins.  I almost expect record margins.  Not sure if that will equal record profits.  All of the above could put us easily 20-25% above 1Q20 revenue.  Math that out to find P/S at 10x.\n\nLook at historical P/S and 13x P/S is not unreasonable for a high hype/FOMO cycle like today, with S&P approaching.  Assuming 2Q20  has record margins (due to high spread of deliveries vs production, etc) and therefore equals tsla best Q revenue, we are looking at equivalent to around $7.3B in revenue.  Annualize that and we see $29B in revenue.  At a $253B market cap that's a P/S of 8.7.  A 13x P/S would be $377B market cap, leading to a share price exceeding $2000.  With that $1800 doesn't seem so unreasonable now.\n\nToo tired to figure out the actual per share sales so used market cap and share price.

No wonder BOSCH won’t hesitate to sell their technology to anyone else.\n\nThe database that they may use for teaching and testing their AI autonomous driving system is indeed huge, and gives them a great advantage for now. But let’s see their sales numbers: they sold around 370k cars last year, which means 370k cars roaming the streets and recording video, radar (and ultrasonic, though not very important) signals for their database. In the same year, Daimler alone sold over 2,800k cars and trucks. Let’s say half of these very equipped with radars and cameras. That means that Daimler has four times the cars (from last year) recording data for them, i.e they build their database four times faster.

The big funds get a ~7 days head-start from the S&P index committee once they've made a decision to include Tesla - but Tesla has to report Q2 earnings before they can make such a decision.\n- S&P 500 index front-running is very real and has been well-known for decades, but it's still possible, due to a methodology mistake in the S&P 500's definition that was committed 60+ years ago and never corrected. In fact the assets managed by proprietary trading firms has decreased in the past couple of years (due to Dodd-Frank), so there's **less** index inclusion arbitrage these days, and the \"Index Effect\" is probably larger.\n- There's a positive feedback loop: never has a $200b+ valuation company been added to the S&P 500 while it skipped the S&P 400 midcap index - and every 1% increase in the TSLA price will increase its weight within the index - increasing the required buying power for funds to become equal-weight to the benchmark index. \n- S&P 500 inclusion only became a high probability event last Thursday, when Tesla reported surprise Q2 deliveries. The resulting upgrades by Wall Street have only started, and the price move has not nearly finished yet IMO.\n- **Secondly,** even if \"everyone\" expects it, up to 50%-80% of the free float of TSLA might be removed from circulation, drastically reducing the number of tradeable TSLA shares. This \"TSLA float contraction\" event has not happened yet and it's highly non-linear.  The famous 2008 short squeeze of Volkswagen, where it rose from €200 to €1,000 within two trading days primarily happened through a drastic reduction of the free float.\n- Daily TSLA trading volume is 10% of the float, which is an insanely high percentage - as a comparison AMZN's average daily volume is just 1.1% of the float (!). I.e. TSLA float contraction is likely underway already, and there's no meaningful pullback in the price, suggesting that there's \"trapped\" actors forced to buy at any price.\n- **Third,** Tesla short interest is at record levels (with around $19b of value at risk), with shorts over-leveraged and over-exposed to a short squeeze more than ever before. Just to compare, at the height of the dip to $180 last summer short interest was only around $10b...\n\nShort covering, just like S&P 500 inclusion, is anti-dilutive, these forces amount to a huge stock buyback program of around $80b...\n\nAnd no, this isn't a \"bandwagon\", these are simple facts or at minimum, probable upcoming events., not priced in yet, because the magnitude of this S&P 500 event and the resulting contraction of the TSLA free float is unprecedented.", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "I would give you gold but all my money is currently invested in TSLA stock and calls.\n\nEdit: my", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just tell me your price target, elon.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "No you fundamentally don’t understand what I’m saying.

The Model Y is a fair bit cheaper to make than the Model X was, due to improvements on cable runs and chassis stamping, and that was likely a 30% margin per unit. The Cybertruck may be cheaper still to make. Every battery improvement they make improves that margin. I think you're missing the mark on that one.\n\nThey do make some money off carbon credits, but they also make a good chunk of cash from combining their fleet with Fiat-Chrysler in the EU, which lets them average down their CO2 emissions.\n\nEmissions regulations are only going to get more stringent as global warming kicks in, and that's going to be a big challenge for ICE.
