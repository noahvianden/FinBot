With all the hype around Nikola etc. I cant help but want to share a company which I think will be much more successful in the near future, DynaCERT. The following is a write up I sent to a buddy of mine who asked for more information and why I like the company:\n\nDynaCERT, a green tech company which has developed a product that uses distilled water to inject hydrogen into diesel engines which cause them burn 60% more efficiently and reduces emissions by 50%.\n\nThey just did a sizeable deal with Day and Ross Logistics, I think this can snow-ball into several other deals across North America: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/day--ross-pilots-carbon-emission-reduction-technology-301045341.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/day--ross-pilots-carbon-emission-reduction-technology-301045341.html)\n\nThey also have large contracts for mining companies in Brazil and Logistics companies throughout Europe, mostly Germany. I feel like they are gaining serious momentum globally.\n\nI like DYA because I believe it is probably the best way to disrupt the logistics and major diesel power equipment there is and it's a green technology which I think will be massive in this decade. DYA has a patented product which is like 50lbs and connects to diesel engines. It uses distilled water to create and inject hydrogen molecules into diesel combustion engines at the perfect amount resulting in 60% more efficient burn rate and 50% less emissions released into the atmosphere. It is better than electric trucks because it requires far less resources and electric vehicles are only as clean as the electricity source, diesel at 50% less is cleaner than most electrical sources in the USA and globally. Also, diesel engines already exist, so they dont have to mine lithium/cobalt to build electric car batteries and the logistics companies love it because it makes their engines more efficient, resulting in better fuel economy and less money spent on fuel. Cheap fuel might be a good thing for DYA too as people will keep their diesel fleet but will look for cleaner more efficient ways to transport goods as the fight against climate change becomes more and more apparent. They attach to any diesel engine but arent really cost effective for anything smaller than a transport truck (used widely in mining industry as well), so doesnt really enter into the personal vehicle category, but whatever, there is big enough business with logistics, construction and mining industries. That gives them room to grow if they can come up with a more affordable and smaller unit which can work on retail consumer vehicles. Eric Sprott who is a major investor in Canada bought $14M of shares in November, the SP peaked at $1.20 CAD pre-covid. I can see it getting back there easily and then further as more news/deals are released. I think with more press this stock will start flying.\n\n[https://dynacert.com/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdynacert.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR08TnWs03K6BcKNNy14klUvDYWFl70z3s-ixYTAccSanYnsgkYgIe8zJUY&h=AT1IeM0V-Ep__YCJdn92SQQofoXvfDDDTjhhGqfy17fpaOTVEcyYGCW6VXDtPYd6SK1y_f3M_iUVgY8W0KCM08zGhOe9WPd2LqpSyCAWVP9Om3L0xu1TYC6GKPH97xeqp6A)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds awesome!

All of these investors lost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars each when Theranos folded.[79]\n\nOne of Holmes's first board members was George Shultz.[18][80] With Shultz's early involvement aiding Holmes's recruitment efforts, the 12-member Theranos board eventually included:[82] Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state; William Perry, a former secretary of defense; James Mattis, a future secretary of defense; Gary Roughead, a retired U.S. Navy admiral; Bill Frist, a former U.S. Senator (R-TN); Sam Nunn, a former U.S. Senator (D-GA); and former CEOs Dick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo and Riley Bechtel of Bechtel.”", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Okay we're pulling this thread, fine.

But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Good analysis, thx.

Visible light, radiowaves, x-rays, etc are some of the bands on the complete spectrum of frequencies.  \n   \n[There are ionising and non-ionising bands as per this chart.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/375/cpsprodpb/2682/production/_107885890_5ggraphic-nc.png)  \n  \nFor ionising radiation like x-rays we have to limit exposure because it is harming our cells' dna. For non-ionising radiation we have to limit exposure because body tissue heats up when it absorbs them.  \n  \nConsider sunlight, which is a broad band of EM. We can feel infrared heating us up but we can't feel the UV burning us.  \n  \nWell, [5G is going to use frequencies up to about 100GHz](https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30805-50906-An-illustration-of-the-areas-of-spectrum-5G-could-operate-within-via-Qualcomm-xl.jpg) which is much lower frequency band than sunlight and is not ionising radiation.  \n  \n5G is actually using microwaves so you know it can cook your flesh, except the power output of your phone's radio is kept well under the safe limits. The phone towers are a higher power output but the inverse square law means the receive level is quite low by the time it gets to you, and because of the number of mobile users, 5G towers and 4G towers are very close together transmitting on low power because that gives a cleaner signal and more data throughput.  \n  \nFinally I will quote the safe limit of 100GHz microwave output. [This NIH page mentions 10 Watts per square meter and 0.08 Watts per Kg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/) A 5G phone will never get anywhere near that and the tower signal will be received by the antenna at about 0.0000001 Watts  and I would guess that your body would absorb about 1 milliWatt max from the tower. \n  \nSo because we have blood and sweat cooling us down, the tiny bit of heat is no issue. We're talking milliwatts total, compared to   sunlight which is about 1000W of radiation per square meter and some of that is ionising, unlike 5G. And even sunlight isn't too bad in moderation but 5G is fine as a low level background signal. Actually if you look on a spectrum analyser... there is a noise floor at 100GHz with signals here and there anyway.  \n  \nI hope that puts it into perspective... 5G is basically low power warm radiation and doesn't modify DNA (doesn't cause cancer). And it can't cook you because the power output is low, like TV and FM signals.

If all you have to say is \"you can't just assume that\" then just fuck right off. I\"m more interested in other peoples' assumptions/intuitions of what is moving the SP right now and in the short term.  Let's face it, nobody knows what is going on right now and this bull run will be in the textbooks for future generations so until then, let's brainstorm.\n\nTo start off,I have never seen TSLA trade the way it did last week. I have been in Tesla since it went public. We were pinned to the teeth to $1,500. That is just too much of a round number for too long to call it just random market activity. That was concerted effort to keep the stock from flying. I see the same effort today and to a lesser extent yesterday. Why would they try to keep the price down?\n\nIf the point is to sell then i don't see why such an effort to keep the price low. Obviously, this is to keep the price relatively low in preparation for when it's time to buy more. The only entity capable of creating such a behavior is obviously big market movers and index funds. \n\nFor someone mostly trading in calls short/mid term, this is a very strong bullish indicator. The stock will shoot up on positive earnings from index funds loading up alone. The question now is will the upward price move continue until inclusion or will there be a huge drop from weak hands selling on Thursday? \n\nRobinhood average size being $2k and having 500k TSLA holders, let's assume  they all have 100% TSLA and each get 1.25 shares. For good measure let's double their size which brings the number of shares held by Robinhooders to 1.5M.  Also let's bundle in all other users from the top 9 other trading platforms and assume they're tend to 1.5M each (since robinhood is the most popular). That brings us to 15M shares being traded by potentially weak hands. \n\nI think that's minuscule compared to daily average trading size for tesla. Is that enough to move the stock? definitely.. for a day or two.. Not sure how to use this information to predict movement. However I can use this to predict that Index funds will start buying as soon as positive earnings are confirmed because they can't be squeezed when eventually small money sells off.\n\nThe main thing to realize tho is that the stock has been moving up on the RUMOR of S&P inclusion (among other good news but let's face it, this is a momentum stock right now). So once the rumor is confirmed, the stock should kick in second gear of the same momentum.  \n\n\nI don't mention TSLAQ rats because I think they're irrelevant for this cycle. They will get squeezed until S&P inclusion is behind us.\n\nEdit:\nOne more point: with shares locked either with longs or index funds after inclusion and so little float as a result, doesn't that more or less guarantee that the price  will stay in whatever level it hits in the next couple of months? If we reach 1700 for example, it will be the base and only fractionally move down or have huge upswings after..

A lot of people buy high and sell low -- it's just human nature early in investing, imho.  So, I don't think we can conclude much here.\n\nI hope that your next point is on target if I understand it correctly.  My hope is that the IV continues through inclusion and so on rather than just crash on Thursday.  But given that we've been relatively flat (correcting a bit back to 1500 today) we may be poised for a good jump.

Exploring the Mechanics of S&P 500 Inclusion (TSLA)\"](https://twitter.com/TeslaPodcast/status/1282932750543093760)\n\nOr another look at the float contraction caused by Tesla's S&P 500 inclusion:\n\n> [\"Tesla's S&P 500 Inclusion: Predicting TSLA's post-inclusion stock price\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/hsvqus/teslas_sp_500_inclusion_predicting_tslas/)\n\nWhat neither the video nor the post detailed sufficiently are the non-dilutive & float contraction effects of **options**, the delta hedging inventory in particular, which is somewhere around ~40m TSLA shares today, or 27% of the float - and which **goes up non-linearly as the TSLA price appreciates**.\n\nToday there's a near record amount of TSLA options open interest: 800,000 call contracts and 1,200,000 put contracts, representing a huge delta hedging range of +80m and -120m TSLA shares - but with a current bias for upward skewed TSLA price moves. A +$200 move in TSLA generates about 5,500,000 shares worth of TSLA buying by market makers. (-4% float contraction)\n\nAnd today a record value of TSLA shares are shorted (over $20b short interest VAR), with a short squeeze \"ongoing\" according to short squeeze experts S3 Partners, who called the early 2020 TSLA short squeeze:\n\n> [\"With the market rising there will be more short squeezes, such as $TSLA, as short sellers buy-to-cover as losses mount\"](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1285251199889965057)\n\nIf we add up the various TSLA shareholder categories who **must** or are strongly incentivized to hold TSLA, we get:\n\nShareholders | float taken out of circulation\n---|---\nPassive index funds |  26,000,000 shares\nActive funds benchmarked to the S&P 500 | 37,000,000 shares\nDelta-hedging at $1,500 | ~40,000,000 shares or more\nNon-S&P-500 indices already holding TSLA | ~20,000,000 shares\nShorts covering | up to ~5,000,000 shares (14m shares short today)\n | =\nSUM | = ~128,000,000 shares\ntotal free float | = ~147,000,000 shares\n\nMost of these entities **will be forced to buy TSLA at any price** and will take those shares out of circulation for a long time.\n\nThe next time the index funds will even consider selling some of their TSLA will be after the December reindexing, and because historically Tesla's Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters, there's a fair chance that the TSLA weight will further increase in December, triggering *more* accumulation.\n\nYeah, **over 85% of the float will be locked up by long-term holders** - or short covering which destroys virtual long shares anti-dilutively, which is recipe for a short squeeze + delta hedging positive feedback loop to drive an \"Infinity Squeeze\" to infinity and beyond. (In reality I think a trillion dollars valuation at $5,400 will probably be a limit to any spike.)\n\nFor the \"it's already priced in!\" crew: **it cannot be priced in** due to a design flaw in the S&P 500 methodology (which flaw modern indices do not have), despite everyone knowing about S&P 500 inclusion, the \"Index Effect\" is real and substantial, because $4.6t of passive S&P 500 index funds **cannot buy before inclusion**, and because the Tesla event is so fucking huge &  unprecedented.\n\nFor those who like to combine fundamental analysis with technical indicators and quant arguments, TSLA trading volume is already showing signs of 'float contraction':\n\n- Yesterday 17.7m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 12% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading day.\n- Last week over 105m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 70% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading week\n- Last month over 300m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 200% of the TSLA free float**\n\nAs a comparison: last week, when AAPL has hit new all-time highs, the turnover was just 4% of the float (!)...\n\nA TSLA infinity squeeze will be slower than the VW squeeze IMO, but with a more permanent price increase, and during what appears to be a bull market so far.\n\nTomorrow Tesla will report Q2 earnings, which Wall Street expectations are an EPS loss and a GAAP loss.\n\nIf Tesla beats expectations and posts a profit, no matter how small, it will become eligible for the S&P 500.\n\nTimeline of the addition: while the next S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs on September 18, **there's no such timetable to additions**, which can be announced as quickly as 1 week after the company reports results - or as late as 7 weeks after the ER. This is one of the reason why many funds cannot buy TSLA in advance.\n\nIf Tesla is added then big index funds will get a couple of days advance notice from the S&P 500 committee - but for that Tesla has to post profits first, which is uncertain.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not advice, I might be wrong & degenerate, trade on your own risk and gamble responsibly!\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** If this indeed happens (which it might not), then pretty much any TSLA call options post the S&P 500 announcement will go up in value.\n\nEven super deep out of the money $3,000 calls expiring this Friday quadrupled in value yesterday already...", "id": "hv41wq", "created_utc": 1595321987.0, "score": 819, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 271, "comments": [{"body": "lol “vag squeeze”", "score": 214, "replies": [{"body": "Guys literally only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting: an Infinity Squeeze.", "score": 258, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "that’s why you’re gay", "score": 35, "replies": []}, {"body": "Whose tank are you drilling?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Anyone that really needs it.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You can’t remove shorts covered from the float, unless shares shorted were included in the first place.

The VW hatch would have and I absolutely would have bought one but it’s only going to be available in Europe. The teaser prices on Tesla competitors seem to always climb before they actually get finalized. \n\nAnyways, staying long at these prices is only justifiable if you thing Tesla actually perfects self driving and can create a fleet of self driving taxis.
