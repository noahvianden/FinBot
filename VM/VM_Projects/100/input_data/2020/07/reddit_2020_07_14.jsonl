I had plenty of success going up and even success on the way down after the covid crash in March. I started out with about 7k in September. My  TOS account peaked a little over 90k by April 2020. That’s when I slowly started losing hard\n\nFast forward to July and now I’m down to $400 and the past day and weekend I’ve been sick mentally. Like I actually want to feel like throwing up. I want to know how can I cope with these losses mentally. Although my initial principle is money I was willing to lose, the idea of Kinda getting out the game and the fact that I lost 99% of my portfolio is hard to swallow.\n\nI’m not looking for sympathy because I knew the risk when I started. But I want to know how to mentally reset or ease myself.\n\nEdit: it’s 2022 now and I’ve learned a lot.

Sorry this has happened to you.\n2. 95% of all traders experience what you're feeling.\n3. This is Options Expiration week.  So yeah, \"over-traders\" get clobbered during every 3rd week of the month.  If you don't understand this, paper trade until you do.\n4. The reason you're feeling this way is you put too much in the trade.  You did not have a plan or you didn't follow it.  This is a mistake I've made several times.  Never put more than 10% of your account in a trade. (Easier said than done)  When you limit your exposure to 10% or less of your account, you eliminate the emotions that come with taking on too much risk.  Emotions are the ruin of most traders.  Be a Vulcan, trade small.  It adds up over time and you live to trade another day.  Trading small is the only way to success.  Over time, 10% of small amounts become 10% of large amounts. But you are always protected from blowing up your account if you follow this one rule.  10%\n5. Reset or ease yourself by promising yourself to never over-trade again.  Then, go get laid.  That helps a lot.\n\nOne more thing: Let the 400 ride.  You never know what's going to happen during Options Exp. week.\n\n\"He who trades, in a modest way, lives to trade another day.\"", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "First of all, I'm sorry this happened to you.\n\nI believe part of what you are currently experiencing is withdrawl syndromes brought on by the reality that you're running out of money. It's the same feeling that compulsive gamblers get when they realize they've spent their last dollar. No more action. I'm not saying you're addicted, but going from 7->90k in that short amount of time, and then all the action in between now and then, must have been a big high/rush. You're realizing that it's about to end, which makes you feel sick.\n\nMy only advice right now is to salvage your losing trades, and take some time off. I just started option trading this year, and have made a ton of mistakes. I'm down around 10k, and actually went down to my last $500 for trading last month. I took some time off, and I made a promise to myself that I was learning from my mistakes (and I have). No more FOMO, no more weeklies, just well thought out and executed trades.\n\nSince then, my account is currently just over 2k. Not impressive by any means number wise, but ever since I took that time off, I've developed some strategies that I do not sway from. They include:\n\n- Buying options with expiration dates a minimum of 2 months out.\n\n- Selling options a maximum of 3 weeks from expiration so theta doesn't steal profits.\n\n- Have an exit strategy before you enter any position.\n\n- Pick strike prices around 10% from current price that you think the stock has a very reasonable chance to hit during the time frame. You must back up your theory with a detailed explanation why.\n\n- Again, have an exit strategy in mind. However, don't be afraid to let your winners ride some more if they have momentum or a catalyst behind it. Set stop losses if you want to continue.\n\n- Exit your losers by hand. If your original story doesn't make sense anymore, it's time to sell. Double check with yourself on this and make sure it isn't irrational fear creeping in.\n\n- Most importantly (this one changed my mindset), treat your money like it's your soldiers going to war. You wouldn't blindly send real soldiers off on a hunch risking their lives would you? Do your research 3 times, treat money with respect, and you will command the army you deserve.\n\nAgain, the best thing you can do right now is take a week off. Do a ton of research on companies. Pay attention to the market trend. When you know you've found a winner, you'll know it in your gut. Take care of your soldiers and yourself and you'll make it back.\n\nOne last thing, have some sort of bankroll allocation. Never put your entire account into a single company/trade. I try to keep mine spread across at least 3 companies. Also, when you start to build up again, try to keep at least 50% cash reserves in case you find something you feel good about. Right now (even for me) with very little capital, having 50% cash on the side is hard (I'm at 20% currently). Have a plan before jumping back in is all I'm saying.

You feel like a failure and like the world is ending. So let me try and help: it’s not. You said it yourself, it was money you were ok losing. It’s gone man. Gotta accept that. Take your time to feel whatever you need to feel. Write it down. Cry it out. Do whatever you gotta do. Then take a fucking break man. Don’t look at a fucking chart, the markets, CNBC, or tweets from anyone you follow for financial takes. Remove yourself from the element entirely for a while. Let that heal. If you go in trying to revenge trade your way to 90k from 400, you’re going to end up throwing yourself off a building. Take that 400, and do something fun and relaxing you enjoy. Then, after you’ve gotten over this, get back into it. Slowly. Forget about your previous returns. Forget previous trades.

If the underlying rallies a few percent in a couple of minutes then often during those minutes the value of PUT contracts will plummet as traders sell their positions in fear the rally could continue higher.

Essentially, I keep removing risk from lower strike calls so i can ride them without worry about theta and IV. How much the $1,500 call will make me will be decided purely by stock price. Don't forget even your ITM calls have a lot of value in IV and theta right row.

You won't be able to get as many calls as you did when you bought the $1,000's, but you will still end up with more delta. Let's say we get to $2,500, then you can sell $5,000 calls against those $2,000's, so you can purchase $3,000's.\n\nThere's always a chance that stock price will \"stabilize\" and you will have to decide if you want to just sit on your calls at the risk of theta and IV decay or sell.

{"title": "Cheaters (Always) Prosper: Covenants in the Time of Corona", "selftext": "Hello, friends -\n\nIt's me, Fuzzy. Another beautiful day begins in the neighborhood, and what better place to spend it than here, with you poop-flinging retards?

I mean, Fuzzy wouldn't say no to a game of hide the banana with her - if you watch those old specials on the National Geographic Channel (a fixture of Casa de Fuzzy late-night programming) you'll see she's got a body that makes you want to climb it like an orangutan - but facts only, she definitely got misty with a gorilla or two in her day. Or was that [Diane Fossey](https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5cfab85e76711f7c887fe5fd/master/pass/sigourney-weaver-ghostbusters-2020.jpg)? Either way, with apologies to u/pokimane, I'd definitely hit that. ([PS - welcome back Gary Larson!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2mp43svgB1qeoyxwo1_400.jpg))\n\nAnyway, this post is a bit inside baseball, but it's my party and I'll do what I want. Today I am going to give you guys a lesson on one of the under-the-radar impacts that the pandemic-du-pangolin has had on the debt markets. Long-time readers know that I'm always banging on about the impact of the covenant-creep of high-yield style structures into traditional bank financings. It's a fact of life in 2020 that the docs governing most bank debt are a lot looser than they used to be (and it was that way before the virus, too), but unscrupulous borrowers and shitty bank lawyers asleep at the wheel during the pandemic have made it worse. The specter of the money-printer looms large, too - with the implicit support of a government hell-bent on keeping the money markets afloat with synthetic liquidity, people just have more appetite for risk in negotiations than they had 18 months ago (from a documentation standpoint). Anyway, one of the big ticket items on the agenda has been the rebirth of the so-called '*J. Crew*' issue - the ability of companies to send valuable shit out of the credit when things start going sideways, so the lenders can't get at them in an enforcement scenario. This can have a major impact on the creditworthiness and overall value of a corporate group and I've spent the last week having a major fight about it with a few idiots on the other side of a deal, so I figured why not take a break from clowning them and clue you guys in to what it is and why it matters.\n\nIt's been a while, so a reminder for the new readers and slow learners in the audience. I will answer any legitimate question I get asked about the post, no matter how stupid (as long as it is sincere or at least funny). Sometimes it takes me a couple of days but I get around to everybody eventually. I do this because getting flamed by someone who knows what they're talking about is the only way to learn - it's how I learned, and it works. **But remember - I don't give advice for free**. So please don't ask me what to buy (long $POPCORN), if your 95% OTM option is fucked (it is) or for a strike/exp (TSLA $6940C 4/20/21) because I'll just have to repeat that in the comments and you'll look like a big dummy.\n\nOK. Got it? Good. Here is what you are about to read:\n\n1. Subs Aren't Just For Doms: Why Corporate Groups Are More Than Just A Ticker\n2. Investment Covenants: How Companies Spend Their Tendies\n3. *J Crew* And You: Exploiting Loopholes For Fun And Profit\n\nIf you are interested in playing along at home, [here is J. Crew's credit agreement as it then existed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1051251/000156459014000667/jcg-ex10_201403057.htm), and [here is a copy of the relevant court filings](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=g3bQfywJstNqt/O3VUqiaw==&system=prod).\n\n**TL;DR**? Fuck you. I am large. I contain multitudes. If you can't handle that, that's on you. Bitch about it to your body-pillow. I just don't give a shit.\n\nLet's do this.\n\n1. **Subs Aren't Just For Doms: Why A Corporation Is More Than Just A Ticker**\n\nA long, long time ago on a tweedy, tea-soaked rock in the North Atlantic, some smart young autists with terrible teeth and a colonialism problem decided it would be a fun idea to YOLO their life savings into speculative investments involving the rape and/or pillage of various locations in the South Pacific and Asia. Unfortunately for them, at this time, you could only do this by either (i) commandeering a ship, sailing there, and raping and pillaging to your heart's delight or (ii) asking the monarch for a permission slip to let you do this without being personally liable for the consequences. Fortunately for these hungry young retards, the great and glorious Queen Libby I (she of the clown hair and white face paint) loved this idea. So she created 'chartered corporations' to facilitate these little excursions. See, back in the day, you needed her permission to make a corp. Anyway, 100 years, several hundred million pounds of profit and millions of dead Indians later, the idea had been so successful that the OG East India Companies formed by those retards were worth nearly a trillion dollars of today's money, and everybody else wanted to get in on the idea - so they did away with royal charters and the rest of the world quickly cottoned on to the idea that separating investors from the actions of the companies they bought into was a cool idea. Thus was born the doctrine of the separate legal entity and modern corporations law.\n\nForward-thinking legal eagles like yours truly then figured out that if it was cool to have one corporation separating investors from actions (and, therefore, liability), it would be *even* *cooler* to layer several corporations between them, making it harder to (i) see who actually owned the company and (ii) to take their shit if anything went wrong. So was born the concept of the modern 'corporate group' - companies that created their own subsidiaries, in which they owned 100% of the issued equity, who then created their own subsidiaries, in which they owned 100% of the issued equity, and so on down the ladder. All the profits can be sent straight up - but the liability (generally) stops at the immediate level of the actor. Awesome, right? Having cake and eating it too - if cake disgorged profits instead of carbs.\n\nIn 2020, pretty much every company that's not a Mom & Pop dry cleaning business works this way. Investors on top, 'name' company nearby (either directly underneath or with holding vehicles in-between, and lots and lots of subsidiaries sitting below the name. There are a bunch of tax reasons to structure this way but the liability shield and diversification of revenue streams is generally the key structural consideration.\n\nSo what happens when the name brand company wants to borrow money? Remember from our previous lessons that how much money you can borrow is directly related to the sort of security you can provide to the lenders - \"Look, I can give you this much dollar value in assets as collateral, and prove to you that my corporate group makes this much money over the course of a year\". Some back office nerds at the bank crunch the numbers (like EBITDA - [check out my primer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1xq3e/cookin_the_books_with_tsla_fuzzys_ebitda_explainer/)), and the computers spit out a number that the business guys fight about and ultimately gets settled, and hey presto, you've got a brand spanking new billion dollar term loan. Easy so far, right?\n\nHere's where it gets a little tricky. Not every subsidiary is treated the same way in calculating these numbers - because not every subsidiary is necessarily included in the credit support as a guarantor, pledgor, whatever you want to call them. Some get excluded because they're offshore and including them would have adverse tax consequences. Some get excluded because they have complicated ownership structures. Some get excluded because they're just not doing anything - shell corporations parked at some PO box in the Caribbean waiting for a purpose don't have much to contribute to the revenue calcs of the broader group. The distinction here is between what we call '**Restricted Subsidiaries**' - companies who are subject to the various rules and regulations of the credit docs (e.g., can't buy shit, can't borrow shit, can't spend money) - and '**Unrestricted Subsidiaries**' - companies who can do whatever they want because they're 'outside' of the credit, even though they're owned by companies who are inside the credit. The borrower can typically designate (and re-designate) subsidiaries as 'Restricted' or 'Unrestricted' by jumping through a few hoops - most commonly showing that an unrestricted subsidiary being designated restricted would otherwise be in compliance with the debt and liens covenants applicable to restricted subsidiaries. You might want to do this for a variety of reasons but normally its because sometimes there are rules about how you can move shit around inside your credit group; typically you can only move money and assets to companies that are subject to the rules the banks have agreed to ahead of time (not those sneaky unrestricted subs sitting off there away from where the banks can get at them). You can check out the definitions in the J. Crew credit agreement by ctrl+fing \"Restricted Subsidiary\" or \"Unrestricted Subsidiary\".\n\nAnyway, the punchline is that when you look at, say, $TSLA, there's a lot more under the hood than a ticker, a substandard engine and snuff pics of Elon getting pegged by Grimes. You're actually talking about hundreds of subs spread across a wide range of jurisdictions - the ticker is just the tip of the corporate iceberg.\n\n2. **Investment Covenants: How Companies Spend Their Tendies**\n\nAs you may know from my previous posts, [credit agreements have a lot of rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/). They mainly dictate what the borrower and guarantors can and can't do -  can't change shit about the company **except for shit that doesn't matter**, can't sell your shit without telling the banks **except for shit that's really cheap**, can't buy stuff **except for stuff you need**, etc. The big one for our purposes is called the Investments covenant.\n\nI know, I know. It's a word you recognize. Hooray! But slow down, little autist. In credit agreement land, 'Investment' doesn't mean 'investment'. It means whatever the definition in the document says it means. It's not what you use Robinhood for. Here, it means any 'loan, advance, or capital contribution to... another person'. If you want the unfiltered version, ctrl+f \"Investment\" in the J Crew credit agreement to see what I'm talking about. This formulation is broad enough that you can read it to encompass pretty much any transfer of assets you can think of to a subsidiary, so this little doohickey is how companies move money and other shit around their corporate group. Typically, you get a dedicated 'basket' in the negative covenants that allows you to make 'Investments' in subsidiaries up to a certain dollar figure.\n\n3. ***J Crew*** **And You: Exploiting Loopholes For Fun And Profit**\n\nSo, in 2016,  J. Crew was in bad shape. The company was at risk of going under. It was subject to a pretty strict credit agreement that severely limited its ability to incur new debt or repurpose its existing debt. The board was stressed that the company would default under the credit agreement and the lenders would come in and take their shit, limiting the ability of the company to bounce back after filing for bankruptcy. So, they decided to take a very risky gamble - what if they could manage to get the most valuable collateral out of the reach of the lenders? If shit gets moved out of a corporate group, generally there is a trigger that releases whatever liens the lenders have on it, so if they could pull it off, they would be home free.\n\nRemember, credit agreements are **expressly designed to prevent you from doing this**. Why would I lend you a billion dollars on the back of certain collateral if I knew there was a risk you could throw that shit out the window the minute I signed on the dotted line? So this was a ballsy move. Banks would be **pissed.** Here's how it went down.\n\nThe most valuable shit that J. Crew owned was not, surprisingly, shitty chinos and ill-fitting polo shirts. It was intellectual property. So that was what they needed to move.  Section 7.02(t) of the credit agreement allowed investments by non-loan party restricted subsidiaries in any other person (including in an unrestricted subsidiary) if the investment was initially “financed with the proceeds” of certain other permitted Investments. Here, these other permitted investments included the intercompany basket that allowed investments by loan parties in non-loan party restricted subsidiaries up to the greater of $150 million and 4% of total assets. In English, this meant that J. Crew could send shit out the door untouched by routing it through another restricted sub before posting it to the unrestricted subsidiary - 'laundering' the IP.  All it had to do was transfer the value of the IP to a non-guarantor restricted subsidiary prior to moving the IP to an unrestricted subsidiary and it had capacity to move collateral out of the group (up to the limit of the applicable basket). Now, this was **not** how things were intended to work - it was a loophole, and the smarties on the borrower side both spotted it and had the stones to try and drive $500 million worth of IP through it. Hats off to them.\n\nStill with me? This was a **big problem** for the J Crew lenders. And they kicked up a huge stink. So J Crew turned it up a notch and filed for a declatory judgment that what they did was legal. Ultimately the case was settled out of court and the credit agreement was amended to allow the transaction retroactively... which basically was the lenders admitting that J. Crew was right in their interpretations of the documents. So. The market quickly pivoted to prevent this happening by putting a hard cap on how much value could be transferred out of the credit to unrestricted subsidiaries - often called the 'J. Crew blocker'. This is in most credit agreements signed between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe bat-flu, though, has encouraged borrowers to start fighting this -  as distressed issuers look for ways to address their liquidity concerns and/or reorganized and optimize their capital structures. By my count there are at least five instances in the last three months of either proposed or consummated J. Crew moves. L Brands, Cirque du Soleil, DSG, Maclaren, and GAP are all on my personal shit list for this, but there are more in the pipeline.\n\nThe impact of pulling a J Crew on the value of the equity can be significant, as it is essentially (i) showing the market that you think the name brand of the equity is in financial difficulties (ii) moving value out of the core brands and (iii) damaging the creditworthiness of the business in the eyes of the market.\n\nAnyway. Here ends the lesson. This is something that is being actively negotiated across the market as many companies adjust to the new normal of precarious relationships with their financiers. Whether or not the market goes up or down is increasingly divorced from the true financial position of companies, but debt never lies and is - as my long time readers know - the best way to understanding the 'real' health of a company and how it is positioning itself for the future.\n\nBless up.\n\nFuzzy", "id": "hr5f9i", "created_utc": 1594746595.0, "score": 338, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 255, "comments": [{"body": "I’m still not sure what the tie-in to Jane Goodall is, so can you repost with nudes?

I'm on vacation this week and just proved to myself that I'd rather read about corporate finance than go outside so... here's what I'm thinking:\n\n\n1. I'm listening to a biography of Warren Buffet in my commute and the author just described how Buffet bought into American Express after its share prices dropped - and the share prices dropped because a subsidiary of Amex was left bagholding when a company that was supposed to be shipping vegetable oil (tanker gang losing money since the 1960s) turned out to be shipping ... seawater. \nThe author specifically said Amex could have divested itself of legal responsibility for this liability because it was the *parent* company and a subsidiary was bagholding. Anyway apparently the CEO issued a statement saying Amex felt a \"moral obligation\" to pay up for its subsidiary and said it would resolve whatever debt it could, which caused the share price to tank because nobody knew exactly how big the debt hole was, and Warren bought in as much because he thought the CEO was an honest/stand-up guy as because the stock was on \"discount.\" \nIs that the same kind of subsidiary you're talking about? And it sounds like the way things work is companies will now try to more actively shuffle liabilities to absolve themselves of illiquid or insolvent portions of their companies? \n\n2. Regarding subsidiaries, you said,\n\n> Not every subsidiary is treated the same way in calculating these numbers - because not every subsidiary is necessarily included in the credit support as a guarantor, pledgor\n\nSo you are basically *included* in the numbers if you are a **restricted** subsidiary, because you are \"playing by the rules\" of regular companies, so your finances can be included under the larger company's umbrella of corporate accounting, and if you're **unrestricted** then you don't play by the rules, and the larger company legally owns you for purposes of shenanigans, but you don't really contribute much and typically can't take on any risk because you are ... not playing by the rules?\n\n* Finally (not sure how to adjust formatting to make this #3), what J Crew did is basically... they knew they were going bankrupt and would get margin called/told to pony up collateral for their debts and seeing as they couldn't pay off those debts/recover anyway, their best move was to hide their collateral. So they exploited a loophole to move the \"J. Crew\" brand name rights to a subsidiary that *does* play \"by the rules,\" and then from there to a little Carribbean-offshore-equivalent sub that *does not* play \"by the rules\" because the one that doesn't play by the rules can't be legally obligated to cough up the J. Crew brand/intellectual property?\n\n\nOk, I realize these questions are basically restating what you said but I want to make sure I'm processing it correctly. Finally, the take-away I'm ending with is that if I watch for companies attempting shenanigans with their IP/brand names/debt, and specifically with subsidiaries, that's a canary in the coal mine that the company's financials may suck regardless of how nice everything else looks on the outside. I remember a robinhood stocks podcast (I know... I'm an idiot I know...) said Victoria's Secret (which is owned by L brands) was bought for $1B USD... which seemed like a very cheap price for the brand recognition that victoria's secret has around the world, plus all the actual merch that comes with said acquisition.

The only thing I could see that they could use this loophole for is to sell off (or threaten to) all of JCrew's IP, bypassing those covenants, using the proceeds to pay a massive dividend to shareholders, and then declaring bankruptcy leaving bondholders with nothing. But even in that case, wouldn't this be considered a fraudulent transfer and be reversible by a court via clawbacks during bankruptcy?

Dan puts the Ignite company logo on literally EVERYTHING: the jets, the mansions, the cars, the yachts, and yes, even the models that hang out with him (they are almost always wearing an Ignite branded bikini).  He then bills Ignite for all of these expenses saying that they are integral to the maintenance/ promotion of the brand image that the company promotes on heavily on instagram and other marketing materials.  Of course, this appears to be embezzlement as he's clearly using investor/company money to party, live lavishly,  and bang models ten at a time all over the globe.   \n\nAn article from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/07/07/dan-bilzerians-company-lost-50-million-last-year-will-likely-fail-auditor/#5d8ab7c5d745) reads:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Ignite “made” money in two ways last year.

{"title": "DDDD - Will We See A Second Great Lockdown?", "selftext": "In today's DDDD (data-driven DD), after a long hiatus due to less free time, we'll take another broad view of the current state of the United States economy and public health. We’ll be looking at some data to answer a few questions. Namely, what the state of the pandemic is globally and in the United States, whether or not we will have a second Great Lockdown (yes, historians are now calling this [the Great Lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession)), statistics on the resumption of economic activity, and the looming unemployment and eviction crisis, and how this all might affect the stock market.\n\n**COVID-19 Data**\n\nOn face value, we can see the number of confirmed cases rising exponentially again in the United States, after a flattening of new cases during the lockdown.\n\n[New cases by country](https://preview.redd.it/0ppbgmjkuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8364b49db7f55f39ec285f7aec731eda1b83f1d4)\n\nThis is in contrast to countries like New Zealand, which has been declared COVID-19 free for several weeks, and much of Europe which has significantly reduced new cases and has even reopened for tourism. Within the US, the previous epicenter, New York, has seen a drastic reduction in new cases and is moving towards re-opening.\n\n[NY New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/uww1vjlwuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df5aff508e31aa0450e33459a2a2790e5eb505b)\n\nOn the other hand, another exponential rise in confirmed cases have been seen in several other states that have fully reopened, including California, Texas, and Florida, the three largest states in the union.\n\n[California New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/969nv8hzuua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e227e2a481190f3e4d3a28e777a217b19e8ea256)\n\n[Texas New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/7kiy7rv0vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcdcc26e402e1456088cb1792a0b4d434522691)\n\n[Florida New Cases](https://preview.redd.it/khrmq322vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3f4efe562bcf5d5995747a8042e248d153e3dd)\n\nPart of the increase in new confirmed cases can be attributed to more widespread testing within these states, so we’ll have to look at confirmed deaths to really see if things are getting much worse. If deaths weren’t rising, then the increase in cases could even be considered good news because this implies excessive testing and a much lower case fatality rate than expected.\n\n[California New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/t6970z73vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=afc9073e0e402a6c1f6537478e09536c1bbba3df)\n\n[Texas New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/b7l6gke4vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=74f3dacdfd5f0e73967cb4e97bce3c80846b323d)\n\n[Florida New Deaths](https://preview.redd.it/ticc80p5vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1b829f5bf0ae83bde766042de8cc7fba5a615fb)\n\nIt looks like there is a true increase in cases within these states. Keep in mind that the new deaths statistics will lag behind the new infections rate by several weeks. The new deaths rate has just started increasing exponentially again at the beginning of July, and this will become even worse, even if governors impose new lockdowns and restrictions because of the delay.\n\n**Will a Second Lockdown Happen?**\n\nThe second question to ask is if there will be a second wave of lockdowns. California recently just announced a [rollback in the lifting of restrictions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/california-to-close-indoor-restaurants-movie-theaters-and-bars-statewide-as-coronavirus-cases-rise.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851411000&usg=AOvVaw2qxWTtCYwlbOxvW8cvVKT6) in response to the new increase in cases, setting a precedent for other states to follow suit. However, whether or not there will be a second wave of lockdowns in states is unclear, and depends on several key factors.\n\n*Mask Usage*\n\nDespite initial opposition from health officials telling the public masks do not work, there has been a reversal in messaging, and the government is now encouraging people to wear masks in public. [Even Trump is wearing one in public now](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/opinion/letters/coronavirus-trump-mask.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851412000&usg=AOvVaw0Yj5a4KXhVBc67mi8IEf5m), especially since there is no longer a shortage. The scientific consensus seems to be that surgical masks are effective in preventing the wearer from transmitting COVID-19 to others if they are sick, but not so effective from having the wearer catch it. This has worked in many other countries, especially in Asia, where people might be publicly shamed or shunned for not wearing a mask and potentially exposing others to COVID-19, which explains why places such as Japan and Taiwan have never seen real widespread transmission. However, in the US there is [significant opposition towards mask wearing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/health/california-lifts-mask-requirement-trnd/index.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851412000&usg=AOvVaw38DVurc7sTHBNetNmD_FO2), and wearing mandates may not be widely followed in some states. According to [one study](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.20096644v2&sa=D&ust=1594749851413000&usg=AOvVaw3k20celrv3_h--S1KA8gCR), the critical mask adoption rate is calculated to be approximately 73% for the epidemic to be contained. If states are able to successfully convince their population to start wearing masks in public, above that rate, then a second lockdown will not be needed. However, even with a [mask mandate](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/california-coronavirus-face-covering-order/index.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851413000&usg=AOvVaw3JdCcj0ul9-vtCuYeAPnS3) in California in all places where social distancing is not possible being enacted a month ago, it does not seem to have been widely followed enough to prevent a rise in new cases and deaths. My personal opinion is that most people are now desensitized to COVID-19 news, and no longer care enough to wear masks in public, and hence the 73% critical adoption rate will not be met in most states, even if there is a mandate implemented.\n\n*Political Opinion*\n\nEspecially important as it’s an election year, a new wave of lockdowns will likely be dependent on the political popularity of it. I wasn’t able to find any reliable recent polls about it, but based on media and political discourse, it looks like the concern right now is more with saving the economy, with the population desensitized towards COVID-19 deaths. A Single Death is a Tragedy; a Million Deaths is a Statistic. This famous quote can be applied to virtually every natural disaster and massacre. Nobody cared about COVID-19 until March when suddenly Tom Hanks and NBA players were diagnosed with it. Everyone then started panicking and raided their local grocery store to buy up all the toilet paper (for some reason). So what will make people care about the pandemic again?\n\n*ICU Beds*\n\nThis is probably the best indicator for when things will go crazy. Once enough hospitals run out of ICU beds to treat COVID-19 patients, they will start having to turn away patients and the case fatality rate will skyrocket. This will likely cause a media frenzy and re-instill widespread panic, shifting political opinion towards more lockdowns. How close are we to this? This statistic is much harder to collect data on and interpret because available ICU beds tend to be fragmented. Since it’ll be logistically difficult to relocate patients to the other side of a state if all the ICU beds in one county fills up, what matters isn’t necessarily how many beds are available in the state, but how many hospitals in each county have reached capacity. Since that’s much harder to interpret and find data on, we'll just look at the available ICU headroom, which does not include potential extra beds that may be created in response to COVID-19.\n\n[California ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/3sdx8la7vua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa5ec78a13e1f26ecf308fad9544bcec1bad0e32)\n\n[Texas ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/5l8h71vbvua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=796ed67e262d180aae0270e4db3bb64da28237a4)\n\n[Florida ICU Headroom](https://preview.redd.it/klgx21bevua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0c21f85eb21bcbb8b0e11394fde26a2c191851a)\n\nFrom this data, California’s pretty much safe, while Texas’ is close to running out of beds and Florida has pretty much reached capacity.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that it will be much more difficult to solve the lack of ICU beds in these states compared to New York. The vast majority of the state’s population live at or near New York City, which is densely populated (in case you’re geographically deficient). This means the problem can easily be solved by simply adding a bunch of beds in one central location, and sending a hospital ship to one place. This can’t really be done in more sparsely populated states like Texas and Florida. Based on this data, we’ll likely see some panic about COVID-19 again in the coming weeks with ICU beds running out in multiple states.\n\n**The Reopening, Oil, and Economic Activity**\n\n[The state of reopening](https://preview.redd.it/zdz0zq3hvua51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a47986120b693fc8dcd6b61cc30aac48cec595f)\n\nIn general, the north east, which was the hardest hit in March, is still in the process of rolling back restrictions, with most other states having already fully reopened. However, many of the new hot spots, like California, Florida, and Texas, are starting to impose new restrictions. The stock market is starting to realize this, with a selloff happening once California announced a complete rollback of re-opening, closing all indoor dining in the state, and there’s fears that the other hotspot states might follow suit.\n\n[New Jobless Claims](https://preview.redd.it/xlnulkljvua51.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f15416b73529866b809f98a43e10fb8295e88a)\n\nWith a few weeks of many states completely reopening we’re now able to see what the best case scenario for the economy would be. Although dramatically reduced from April highs, there’s still over 1 million new joblessness claims per week, way above pre-pandemic figures. Furthermore, these new joblessness claims have stopped decreasing and are starting to slowly rise back up again, and this is with most of the economy re-opened. Since full reopening in many states are still recent, we don’t have other economic indicators, such as personal savings rate and consumer confidence to see if people are actually re-engaged in the economy or people are still avoiding economic activity out of fear of COVID-19.\n\nAnother thing I’ve been keeping an eye on for a while is crude oil stocks. Despite a rally back up from the (negative) lows on the May contract, WTI has been struggling to break $40 and recover to pre-COVID levels, although being near it. While digging through some data [provided weekly by the EIA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/data.php&sa=D&ust=1594749851416000&usg=AOvVaw3bDA78iR9amTL3rriK4Wvl), I noticed something interesting with crude oil stocks - despite re-opening, it’s still increasing.\n\n[Crude Oil Stored \\(kbbl\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xdgrc3hlvua51.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f7694baf5c7b8143c091f38778b736530820382)\n\nExcept for one small dip in the middle of May, crude oil stocks have been slowly rising throughout this entire re-opening, despite many oil producers cutting back capacity. Worse yet, an OPEC meeting scheduled later this week is expected to [relax production cuts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/13/oil-markets-opec-in-focus.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851416000&usg=AOvVaw3uuF8qeo1DP2VKiGuOkdQg), putting even more crude oil into the supply. Excluding the SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve), the story looks slightly less scary for commercial producers.\n\n[Crude Oil Stored for Commercial Use \\(kbbl\\)](https://preview.redd.it/csen71vqvua51.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=485df51d36c9a6262d8c42156d68c81971ad0cd8)\n\nThis however does not mean we’re going to be seeing negative oil futures again, since producers have gotten smarter about avoiding a storage squeeze in Cushing.\n\n[Crude Oil Stored for Commercial Use @ Cushing \\(kbbl\\)](https://preview.redd.it/awlcjzcxvua51.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=275b43ecabc5521978002db198c099f8f1bf5b49)\n\nRefinery utilization, although steadily increasing, is still significantly below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n[Refinery Utilization Rate](https://preview.redd.it/s1l8rl40wua51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8926c8faf1baf3282c6b2dd530ece560ebe29e)\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from this is that oil-based economic activity (i.e. travel and energy usage), while increasing, is still well below what it was in February. Crude oil producers however, are still outproducing what refineries are taking in, and crude stocks have been steadily increasing throughout the entire reopening despite increasing oil prices.\n\n**The Looming Housing Crisis**\n\nAnother thing to mention is the ticking time bomb that is the expiration of the unemployment boost provided by the federal government on July 31, and the eviction crisis coming our way as eviction courts reopen and process them. Mortgage forbearances are also starting to expire, with around 8% of all [active mortgages in forbearance](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/coronavirus-mortgage-bailout-sees-biggest-one-week-decline-yet.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851418000&usg=AOvVaw2JRDx43Q0y7IYcupImyxDZ). According to [one source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/32-percent-of-us-households-missed-their-july-housing-payments.html&sa=D&ust=1594749851418000&usg=AOvVaw24JU1zP70LJmgOsUopIb3Q), 36% of renters and 30% of homeowners did not pay their full housing payment in time. This will probably take a few months to really see the effects of this, but it’s definitely something to consider.\n\n**How This Might Affect Stocks**\n\nWe’re already seeing the first waves of bankruptcies, mostly from companies that were already in a poor financial position like Hertz, JCPenny, and GNC. For the bull case, most of the rally for the past few months have mostly been concentrated in tech stocks, which are much less directly affected by the pandemic, with some companies like Amazon even benefitting from it. They’re usually very financially healthy, and can easily operate in a pandemic, if not benefitting from it. In fact, some stocks like AMZN, TSLA, ZM, and SHOP have gone parabolic in the past few weeks, which is usually not a good sign. On the bear case, most economists predict a prolonged U-shaped or L-shaped economic recovery, and a wave of bankruptcies for companies that couldn’t be rescued by the Fed. As mentioned above, I also believe we’re going to be seeing a second wave of lockdowns in the coming weeks as ICU beds start running out, making the economic situation even worse. Eventually, a shrinking economy, mass unemployment, and reduced spending will ultimately hurt the earnings of even the tech stocks. GOOG and FB earnings ultimately rely on businesses buying ads. AMZN and SHOP earnings rely on consumers buying things. Another argument for the bull side is that due to monetary policies such as QE and 0% treasury yields, along with the unattractiveness of emerging markets in the current economic climate, there is a [massive modern savings glut](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/straub/files/mss_richsavingglut.pdf&sa=D&ust=1594749851419000&usg=AOvVaw0ThBvbFFnJeTPQWxsBHFQQ) \\- money that has nowhere else to go. This by itself could take another essay to explain, so I might talk about this more in a future post.\n\n**My Positions**\n\nFor those that have been following me the past few months, my positions remain unchanged. After briefly joining the bulls for a few weeks, then 🦘gang, I've now converted back to a 🌈🐻. My only major position right now are VIX calls, with July, Aug, and Sept expiry, which I entered a few weeks ago when VIX was at 26. There's a few reasons for this - I still believe in my [long-term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) that the stock market is in a bubble, with the past few months accelerating the inflation of it, and my belief that the US will eventually mishandle the COVID-19 response, forcing the government to lockdown again once ICU beds run out.

So far, that has worked.  They're making more USD, but the USD's spending power has remained more or less unchanged.  Part of the reason is because every other country has been printing their asses off as well.  \n\nNow that Europe, UK, Australia, Canada, China, etc. are all seeing major reductions in cases, it can be assumed their economies will be bouncing back fairly strong by Q4.  Sure, the travel/tourism sector will be hurting a bit.  Part of that hurt will be absorbed by an increase in domestic travel.  \n\nEither way, these countries will no longer need to pump out the stimulus that was needed in lockdowns.  Restaurants will reopen, schools will reopen, and unemployment will drop and stay dropped so long as there is no major resurgence in cases.  So basically, the printing press will be turned off for the EUR, GBP, CNY, AUD, SGD, JPY (all other major currencies).\n\nThe only countries that are still proper fucked are Brazil, USA & India.  You can throw in some others like Colombia, South Africa, etc. but their economies are paltry in comparison.\n\nSo far, the USA has prevented major impacts from widespread unemployment by just giving everyone money.  Not just through stimulus and unemployment checks, but through mortgage forbearance, PPP loans and other business loans, which essentially are aiming to keep companies operational despite losing fistloads of money.\n\nThey were able to print this money largely without consequence, partly because everyone else was printing money too.  Basically every country out there had some sort of stimulus package for COVID.  But now most of those countries have COVID under control, and won't need to print anymore.\n\nThe US has been printing their asses off since March.  Unemployment is still high, and for many states, it's going to increase as they roll back reopening to confront the skyrocketing case load.  So the US is in a spot where they need to keep printing more and more USD.\n\nBut now they are going to be one of the only countries left printing at COVID levels.

The Fed then might print money to buy these Treasuries. The US, compared to most other countries like the ones in the EU and Canada haven't really done that much compared to them.\n\n3. QE, which is the Fed printing money to buy financial assets including corporate bonds. This was more to stabilize a liquidity crisis. There was also alot of problems with foreign currencies back in March, where everyone was exchanging money to USD, but the Fed swap lines fixed this.

But I am just gonna take a counter point to everything in this thread as I don't believe there will be a second great lock down:\n\n1. NYC still has some of the highest population density and they effectively curbed it within 100ish days.\n2. ICU beds capacity can be quickly scaled by Army Corps of Engineers as they did in NYC. Sure the mortality rate may increase vs maybe a hospital bed but so far we haven't had to scale capacity that NYC was supposed to when the virus broke out there. Go look at Greece's ICU capacity. How are they still a country?\n3. Mortality rate is falling as doctors know how to better treat serious infections. Sure there is a bit of lag in the numbers so obviously this can change however we are better equip to treat more seriously infections even without a permanent vaccine.\n4. Quite a bit of industries have managed to switch over (Restaurants take out only, curb side etc). There are still a number of the population with automobiles and ways to effectively social distance without public transportation vs every other nation.\n5. The amount of money for spending seems astronomical, but so was World War 2 when adjusted for inflation and we proved that was short term.\n6. We are in the lowest tax base in history and we have adjustments to that where it can scale up.\n7. We are more self sufficient to closed borders than Europe is. IE we can scale up domestic production for industries more quickly than any other country not China. Also we will be able to scale industries for a vaccine as the Defense proclamation was barely used for Ventilators. \n8. With 7 we are closer to a positive vaccine even if it is not long term and closer to being able to scale that up per population than India or China (estimated to have billion doses by mid 2021)\n9. With a dumb population that population and businesses are able to implement better PPE procedures than most businesses in 3rd world industrial nations. Our dumbest people are still able to follow work place PPE practices better than 3rd world nations without any plan. I will take shopping at Walmart right now vs the market places in China/India.\n10. CDC constantly readjusts statistics per demographics. ICU capacity and deaths differ by age demographics and a subset of our population not in the high risk demographics works and keeps the country running (under 65). Just look up the ICU facts:\n\n [https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19\\_5.html](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_5.html) \n\nThat is falling for the lower age groups", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "137 deaths last week out of 332,000,000 people.

It's a very compelling argument, and is well researched.  For the sake of balance, let me throw some cold water on this.\n\nLets start with your first premise: Walmart+ :\n>Walmart+ aims to provide: same-day delivery, discounts on fuel, and early access to Walmart deals.\n\nThe only tangible benefit I see is same-day delivery.*  More on that later.  The discount fuel space is already dominated by grocery stores, costco, Sam's club (wal-mart incidentally), and independent chain gas stations.  Discount gas stations don't generally drive revenue, although they could when tied with a subscription service.  Amazon's Prime subscription service offers way more than just free 2-day delivery.  It basically ties you in to the ever expanding amazon ecosystem of services, which I'm not going to list.  Wal-Mart+ would have a *lot* of groudn to cover to meet that.  Walmart deals would only be compelling if Wal-Mart can leverage better deals than Amazon.  This is the case for many items, but not all.*\n\n> Walmart's traditional brick and mortar locations all have the potential to become fulfillment centers.\n> Walmart has over 4,000 potential fulfillment centers.\n> Walmart also claims to have locations within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population.\n\n*Here's the crux of the problem.  More fulfillment centers is *not* necessarily a good thing, and it ties many issues together.  When it comes to fulfillment centers, more is not always better: bigger is.  Look around your wal-mart.  It has a lot of items, but not *everything*.  An amazon fulfillment center has *everything*.  I would say for 90% of shopping, wal-mart has something you need.  But for that last 10%.  That obscure item.  Nothing beats amazon/ebay/online.  This is of course completely overshadowed by the choice offered.  For example, Wal-Mart carries one brand of sandpaper.  Amazon carries all of them.  If it's something *really* obscure that amazon doesn't have directly, it's available within a week from a 3rd party seller.  Wal-Mart has no foreseeable platform to offer this diversity of products.  It is not and never has been their business model.\n\nMore than all of this though . Something that completely overshadows everything just mentioned: Wal-Mart isn't amazon.  It's not an online retailer.  It's not in their DNA, experience, or company culture.  Wal-Mart focuses on low-quality, low price, and high volume.  Amazon strives for high quality offerings in their products.  This allows the necessary margins to cover the overhead of packaging and shipping.  Wal-Marts model simply doesn't fit into this.  A retail store is not a fulfillment center and never will be.  They are two wholly different animals, and while wal-mart's advantage is their location, this plays no role for a fulfillment center.  It doesn't need to be parked in the middle of the city, it can be a couple miles outside the city.  It could conceivably work if a delicate balance is struck where a store can have more offerings by being a fulfillment center and the fulfillment could have the benefit of the location.  The two benefit off of one another, but very careful planning would be required.\n\nTl;DR: Wal-Mart isn't and never will be amazon", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "10 miles is 16.09 km", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This post was flaired as DD so it's on the DD list.
