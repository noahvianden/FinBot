However I believe that most people refer to actively managed funds when they use the term “mutual fund”. This means that they buy and sell assets in the effort to beat the market. Although a mutual fund typically identifies themselves with an index that they try to beat (the benchmark index) the gross return can vary a lot from the return of the index depending on how successful the fund manager is. Fees are generally a lot higher for actively managed funds which simply means that they will have to do very good in order to beat the index fund.\n\nIf you study the literature you will see that very few mutual funds succeed in this quest and most importantly those that do succeed are close to impossible to identify beforehand.

By holding a share of the MF, you are entitled to a share of the fund's assets.\n\nMutual funds can be actively or passively managed. Actively managed means that the fund's manager(s) decide what securities to include in the fund, based on whatever methodology the fund is designed for. Your choice, FSPTX, is an active fund. A passively managed fund, on the other hand, automatically picks its holdings.\n\nAn index fund is a shorthand for a fund — be it mutual fund or ETF — that is passively managed by tracking a benchmark index. The index is just a ranked, weighted list of stocks, and it typically gets updated quarterly. One of the most popular indexes is the S&P 500, which is the list of the top 500 US public companies by market capitalization.\n\nMost index funds are cap-weighted, meaning they use the stocks' market cap to decide the percentage to allocate towards each stock. For example, when you add together all of the stocks in the S&P 500, then MSFT's market cap is around 5% of the total. So an S&P 500 fund like VFIAX (mutual fund) or VOO (ETF) will have around 5% MSFT.\n\nPassively managed funds usually beat actively managed ones because it turns out humans, even professionals, aren't very good at picking stocks. Passively managed funds also have much lower fees because they don't need to pay for expensive fund managers, as their entire entire lifecycle can be automated.\n\nFor example, FSPTX has a net expense ratio of 0.71%. Vanguard's VGT, which is a passive fund (it tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index), has an ER of 0.1%. Fees add up over time and should be avoided.

Things like flooded underpasses, power lines down, blowing snows... These are conditions where people shouldn't be driving on that road.

{"title": "Intel DD - Dependant on AMD's 10-Q/K, It may be time to short.", "selftext": "Addendum at the top: $INTC may bounce back next week. I don't know. Maybe they take another dump. Again, no idea where it comes to short-term price action. This is some \"pre-DD\" for AMD's quarterly report which is going to be interesting. It's my thesis that if AMD picks up the market share which Intel claims to have lost in the desktop market due to COVID, that's a sign of a dramatic shift in the consumer processor market, which implies that consumers are moving to what can be considered the leader in both price and processing performance for most applications.\n\n*For anyone who reads SEC filings, this is a rehash.*\n\nTaking a look at Intel's released 10-Q, here's some quotes:\n\n>•We now expect an approximate six-month delay in our 7nm-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7nm manufacturing process, which based on recent data, is now trending approximately twelve months behind our internal target. We will continue to invest in our future process technology roadmap, but we will be pragmatic and objective in seeking to deploy the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies combined with our disaggregated architecture give us the flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, we now expect that our data center discrete GPU design, “Ponte Vecchio\", which was described in our 2019 Form 10-K, will be released in late 2021 or early 2022 utilizing external and internal process technologies combined with our advanced packaging technologies.\n\n>•We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm product, a client CPU, in late 2022 or early 2023. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process roadmap, including for holiday 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7nm data center CPU design in the first half of 2023.\n\n\n#They are going to be four years behind AMD ON 7nm production.\n\nI figured I was going to look into what kind of business consumer-grade Intel products were, compared to their server counterpart, and had to look up some specifics for Intel's internal nomenclature.\n\nHere's the results:\n\nIntel DCG (Data Center Group) consists of everything server related. Server processors, network infrastructure, that type of thing.\n\nIntel CCG (Client Computer Group) consists of all consumer stuff. Mobile, PCs, Laptops, etc. The CCG is all consumer-grade stuff for home use.\n\n\nDCG operating income was **$3.1 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared to **$1.8 billion** in **Q2 2019**. A rise of **+$1.3 billion.**\n\nCCG operating income was **$2.8 billion** for **Q2 2020**, compared with **$3.7 billion** for **Q2 2019**. A drop of **-$0.9 billion.**\n\n||Q2 2020 vs. Q2 2019 | | YTD 2020 vs. YTD 2019 | |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|| % change | $ Impact | % change | $ Impact |\n|Desktop platform volume |down\t(14)%|\t\t$\t(460)\t| \t\tdown\t(9)%\t|\t$\t(607)|\n|Desktop platform ASP |up\t3%\t|\t$ 61 \t| \t\tup\t3%\t|\t$ 162 \t \t\n|Notebook platform volume|up\t9%\t|$\t434 \t |\t\tup\t15%\t|\t$ 1,501 \t \t\n|Notebook platform ASP| up\t5%\t|$\t274 |\t \t\tup\t1%\t|$\t138 \t \t\n|Adjacent products and other||$ 346 ||\t\t\t$\t650 \t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t\n|**Total change in revenue**||\t\t\t\t\t$\t655 ||\t \t\t\t\t\t$ 1,844 \t  \n\nSo Intel's PC market is down from last year for both the quarter and the year. They claim it's because people are poor due to COVID, but seem to contradict themselves in their statement about why their notebook group is doing so well. I am supremely intrigued to compare AMD's notes on the topic.\n\nTo quote (emphasis mine):\n\n>Revenue in Q2 2020 was up 7% compared to Q2 2019, driven by strength in notebook platform demand, strong ASP and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales, partially offset by desktop demand. YTD 2020 up 11% compared to YTD 2019, **driven by strong demand for notebook platform products** and higher LTE modem and Wi-Fi sales. Strength in notebook platform products reflects the increased reliance on PCs as more people are working and learning from home due to COVID-19.\n**While we expect notebook strength in Q3 2020, desktop demand is expected to remain weak in the second half of 2020 as a result of weaker global economic conditions due to COVID-19.**\n\nI'm going to read this as \"When a consumer has the choice of building a desktop out of components, they are going to choose our competitor because they are better.\"\n\nThis is a play on Intel. I am intentionally ignoring AMD because I think Intel is going to become irrelevant in the processor market in the near future.\n\nHere's what I am suggesting: keep an eye on the portable/laptop markets. If AMD has their shit together, we will start to see a more competitive AMD/Intel split on laptops.

As far as I can tell, amd had already taped out zen3 in N7+ when tsmc conceived the 6nm node.  N7 designs can be taped directly to 6nm with no redesign, which isn't the case for N7+.\n\nNo doubt amd's strategy of marrying heterogeneous die in the same package has paid off.

You are comfortable selling at a specific price, so you sell a covered call contract out of the money. If your the option expires worthless because the strike price never hit, you made money on the option sale. If the option you sold goes in the money, you have to sell the stock at the option price to the individual who purchased your option.\n\nIf an option seller thinks that a stock is going to be worth $5 above the strike they want to sell at, they are going to be asking for more premium in the option contract to make that bet, because it would make more sense to not sell the option. Further, if there are hundreds of people attempting to purchase an option at a specific strike, the demand is going to cause the option seller to price the option at a higher price so they can get the most premium out of their option sale.\n\nWith earnings coming up for a company, there are a lot of speculators willing to play both sides of the chart. Some see the bullish case and buy calls. Some see the bearish case and buy puts. Some see the case for general movement regardless of the direction and buy strangles or straddles. All of this speculation is going to drive the cost of options closest to the earnings date upward.\n\nWhat's more difficult about puts expiring Friday on AMD: those same puts were almost $10 ITM last week, so it's difficult to get a good idea of a price point. Right now a $67 put for July 31 is $2.71. Three days ago, that same option was selling for $8.55. On the 23rd, there were 116 trades of that specific strike, whereas on the 24th there were 5,148 trades. The IV on this put as of friday is 107%. This means that you are definitely going to be paying a premium on the option. A lot of people stay away from high IV options because you're almost guaranteed to lose money, even if that option ends up ITM.\n\nIf you intend to stay away from IV crush and still want to play earnings, you can short or buy the stock, or you can purchase an option with further out strike date.

You're right for the most part but I feel you're wrong in the conclusion. We're not dealing with inflation in the states, we're dealing with deflation. And internationally, that's where the inflation is coming from.  \nWe printed trillions to prevent bankruptcies in the states. A small portion of that money went back into the consumers but most of it went back into debt repayments (rent/utilities/etc). We had swap lines open and have other central banks printing the dollar like you explained, along with the fed doing the same, but it didn't impact the domestic strength of the dollar, it changed the value of it internationally.  \nAnd because we lack exports and manufacturing, our dollar is not going to strengthen overseas anytime soon. And because we are in a deflationary period (lack of jobs, lack of funds, huge debt) the dollar will only continue to strengthen domestically until we remedy that situation.  \nWe aren't in a full on inflationary period. If that was the case then we would all have a decent amount of money, albeit at a lower value due to inflation. Do you? I don't. I just kept getting the same wage give or take an extra dollar or two lol. The only way we inflate domestically is if we ACTUALLY print fat money and give it straight to consumers. And even then, we're at a point where most of it will go towards debt again or to savings due to future insecurities.  \nWe are heading or already in a stagflation period. Deflated dollar domestically, inflated internationally. If we were in a fully inflationary period then all assets would continue to rise like they have been for the past 10+ years but assets will begin to depreciate as the dollar becomes stronger to individuals.  \nInvestors that see the writing on the wall will reduce their exposure to our market due to the inevitable reduction in asset prices. If we were able to bridge the gap between this UE+ stimulus, and jobs and all that coming back, then we'd be dealing with an all around inflated dollar along with assets. But because we couldn't achieve that, and we haven't opened up yet so we are in full deflation in the states until we do something about it.  \nBecause the route the fed/government chose to take, it forced everyone into equities, which in turn inflated the prices. Do investors continue to corner themselves into a market that is bound to deflate? When there are plenty of better opportunities in other markets?

And none of that is happening and the lapse in further stimulus has caused the dollar to start the spiral.  \nI don't know what'll happen to ADRs for those that want to get out of US equities. No clueeee.  \nAs the dollar loses value overseas, the only thing that's going to be inflated are the prices that we import goods at, all assets are going to lose value domestically due to the deleveraging pressures that we are going to experience.
