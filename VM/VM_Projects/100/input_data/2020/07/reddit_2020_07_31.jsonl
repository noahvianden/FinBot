As we discover innovations, it takes us some time to implement them due to the friction exposed by the implementation requirements.\n\nIf we take that AI started around 1950, and we take the heuristic assumption that 2050 is the approximate year of singularity, then it is plausible that we are more than halfway--maybe even 2/3 the way there. If we measure the wind, do we feel 2/3 the way there? AI can perform better than experts in various narrow scopes. In 20-40 years, it will exceed full scope superiority.\n\nBut what I was talking about is making innovations through existing data sets. One can make more progress with current technology using more data. China has data about their 1.4 billion people, plus usage and life habits of those that use Tik Tok. That is to say, they can store and analyze 100% of videos uploaded to the application.\n\nCurrently, real-time video processing is a weak point in AI--and perhaps you can note that I am a software engineer, not a hand-waving, unskilled observer.\n\nAt the very least, it is a security risk to send personally-identifiable data out of country to hostile countries. Further, it is not the best idea to send lifestyle habit and GPS with respect to time data of citizens to hostile countries.\n\nAs one example, how many innovations do you think China has already made related to AI that haven't been shared with the rest of the world?

How much do you know about how AI works technically?  I‚Äôm not trying to be condescending, so dont take this the wrong way. AI has been the subject of considerable pop science which has been dangerously overhyping and overrepresenting whats it‚Äôs actually capable of. \n\nAI as a field largely has been stagnant until the invention of back propagation. Before that was the infamous AI winter that left AI researchers largely disillusioned.\n\nThe reason modern AI can be considered almost orthogonal to general intelligence is because general AI requires a understanding of what its outputting. Current AI is just sophisticated pattern matching techniques which has zero understanding of the meaning of its output. \n\nA singularity requires AI to reach a cognitive level equivalent to humans - which basically means AI needs to be able to write another AI. Once that happens, humans are no longer a bottleneck in the advancement of AI and it progresses at a huge rate - but again, this assumes that incremental progress can be sustained indefinitely. If AI requires a revolutionary advancement to get to the next level, it might not be able to figure that out which will put a ceiling on its sophistication.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your reply. I think your points sit well amongst my previous ones.\n\nI approach it from the perspective of functional-reactive programming (FRP) with significantly above median understanding of multi-variable calculus. I understand what kind of math is being used.\n\nI find this recent advancement quite fascinating: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrIbQ0pIFOg\n\nAs an FRP programmer, I am looking at their usage of deltas after mapping perspective information into heat maps. To your points, this is still terribly infantile with respect to AGI, if we agree that the bleeding edge is still centered around the core functions of picking details out of an image.\n\nA video is a stream of images, so studying deltas in those is still a ways out. And again I'm talking about picking out behaviour details, which is much more advanced than picking out scene details. So I agree with you for sure, and then my points about exponential growth of innovations will come in. One black swan event may blow the doors open with a flurry of next advancements. I think your points speak to that as well.\n\nTo my points, I'm talking about an AGI being a composition of functionality that creates a system of positive and negative feedback loops that are driven from both real-time perceptions and background goals.\n\nThat is to say, if we can figure out what set of feedback loops allows the system to iterate moment to moment, gathering information and truly understanding what is happening in a video, then real-life starts to become almost analogous to video.\n\nWe are undoubtedly a long way out, but how dangerous is an AGI that can freely traverse Google search results and understand video at the level of a monkey species with minimal neuron/synapse count?\n\nI will start to become excited once I see AI able to derive and extrapolate scientific advancements using our existing piecewise knowledge.\n\nI don't work directly with AI now, but I can see the holes. We have gradient descent, but we don't really use gradient ascent. For all we know, this is half the pie. If settling on the minima of a concave surface is gradient descent, settling on the maxima of a convex surface is gradient ascent. One is pulling down (gravity), and one is pushing up. For example, there is no Wikipedia entry for gradient ascent. I see this as a huge glaring hole in our knowledge.\n\nI suspect we have many infantile ideas related to this while we are searching for maximal gain and minimal loss. There's two sides to the coin. With respect to evolution, there's traveling a maximum distance, but there's also consuming minimal calories.\n\nI think we will see new types of algorithms start to emerge as AI and AGI gets better at picking out behaviour details in videos. One example I would provide would be the assignment algorithm. If you look at it, it's absolutely beautiful--both simple and incredibly powerful. How many more algorithms like this need to be discovered before we can understand that a \"dog moving towards a target\" implies that the intent is to eat the target because the owner recently used the word \"get him\" in a video's audio--while understanding that zero cases of 'dog eating target after \"get him\"' has occurred in history, therefore, downranking eat into maime? (assuming him refers to a specific, known object type)\n\nI might say we are digressing, but I'm sure we agree this kind of stuff is hella fascinating.

Early visibility into future friction sources allows the agent to overcome the friction sooner due to brute force, and China has no shortage of man power.\n\nIt is also just as likely that I give them too much credit; however, I have these thoughts, so I might as well write them once in a while.\n\nMy only real personal issue with China is that they aren't open.

{"title": "Sell wide Iron Condors for Earnings Play. Won 19/19 times. Was it a good strategy or pure luck?", "selftext": "Hello, fellow theta warriors,\n\nI've been selling wide ICs since May.\n\nAll of them expire the same week as earnings. I sell them right before earnings and close them immediately after unless the stock price stays flat and my strikes are so far away that my closing order could not get filled.\n\nSold 19 times and won 19 times (I haven't closed my FB/AMZN plays yet, which was sold yesterday).\n\nI know someone will say this is picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. Indeed, I used to sell ICs with risk as high as $60K. But now I limit the max loss to $20K and never do more than two plays at the same time.\n\nAs for picking tickers, I first filter out low liquidity ones (unless the IV is really high), then choose from those with an IV of 80% - 200%. After that, I only follow my **instinct** whether this stock will fuck me up or not. I do go to WSB to see if a stock is over-hyped or not and adjust my instinct basing on that. But I never check the company's previous earnings, nor read technical analysis, nor draw a line on the chart or anything.\n\nFor stikes, I check the 6-month chart to get a feeling on what strike is safe. Then I try to find a play that risks $20K and win $2K \\~ $6K. If the play is not good enough, I simply give up and wait for next week.\n\nI almost got fucked a few times but eventually won. And I almost bought INTC & QCOM recently (for which I will definitely lose but I indeed gave them up as the plays did not look good enough).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My theory:**\n\n1. The market knows the price better than me do no matter how much research I perform on the ticker. The price right before earnings reflects the most anticipated price after the earnings (i.e., priced in). Assume the market is effective, this is actually the BEST guess you can have on the stock price after earnings (imagine the peak on a normal distribution).\n2. High IV stocks are hyped by crazy people (WSB, Robinhood, etc.) who want to become rich in one trade. Option price before earnings are comprised of: \\[true option price with expected movements priced in\\] + \\[a chance to become rich\\]. My understanding is that the former has an expected profit of 0 (meaning if you do it enough times, your profit tends to be close to 0). And I'm collecting money not from the former but the latter part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My questions:**\n\nIs it a good strategy or pure luck?\n\nWhat other risks in this strategy am I missing?\n\nIs it better to close a seemly super safe ICs right after earnings or wait for it to expire?\n\nCan the strategy be tuned to have higher (expected) profit but the same or lower risk?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd really appreciate it if you can give me some insights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My plays so far](https://preview.redd.it/ytcstqxck8e51.jpg?width=565&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68b7cebea631466b1b9c835ac62fe1ed90cf627a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The play I had today, screenshot from Fidelity Active Trader Pro](https://preview.redd.it/xyjjus5hq8e51.jpg?width=1076&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f69dd1b79fe50b48ac3fd19ac090118ec1a8203)", "id": "i1cgcz", "created_utc": 1596219129.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "I do this every earnings on big companies with high IV.\n\nDone this on Tesla 1340 to 1900.\nEarned $300 credit, $700 risk.\n\nAnd Amazon $2800 to $3300.\nEarned $200 credit, $800 risk.\n\nI actually tried to do this on Apple but the premiums werent paying enough.

{"title": "After 50k AMD play last week, this is next week‚Äôs play‚Ä¶", "selftext": "So after making money on  [50K AMD play](https://imgur.com/gallery/9MDo4UZ) last week (see also my last posts), the play for next week is Activision (ATVI) on Tuesday‚Äôs Q2 earnings. I believe they are going to beat expectations by **a lot**. This is my reasoning:\n\n\\-So Activision Blizzard is roughly 35% Activision. Q1 net revenue was 519M. However a lot of people were at home during Q2. Warzone has 60M+ players. There were 2 seasons Warzone seasons during where a Battlepass alone costs roughly 10 bucks. Let‚Äôs assume at least 20% of players pay for ingame purchases, and they spent 20$ on average (I have friends who spent 150+, 3 months is a long time to sit at home) so that would estimate 240M alone in revenue. And this is only Warzone, they have more games obviously.\n\n\\-The same arguments can be made for Candy crush and the Blizzard games. But I am not familiar with them (and their ingame purchases), but I would guess at least 30-40% more in Q2 compared to Q1.\n\n\\-The outlook for Q2 (1,690M) is LESS than Q1 (1,825M). I am expecting atleast 2B+. Stock has gone up from 65 to 81 already but this is mainly due to NASDAQ increase. \n\n\\-More companies who profited from many people staying at home have blown away their Q2 expectations (Amazon for example)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis stock has the potential to blow past 90 next week. Here are the best plays ranked from risk averse to ultimate WSB.\n\n\\- Jan15 21 60/100 callspread.\n\n\\- 08/21 85 Call\n\n\\- 08/07 82 Call", "id": "i18plf", "created_utc": 1596206685.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Don't you guys have phones?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Is this an out of season april fools joke?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Never forget...", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Same, they didn't live up with Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wish I knew how many hours of my life was absorbed by Diablo 2.\n\nLvl 99 barb (hardcore)", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just think about how sweet diablo four will be in 2032, though!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "08/21 85c üëåüèº", "score": 33, "replies": []}, {"body": "EA barely moved after crushing.

And gains would be credit from the shorts. A reverse strategy can be made so that you're neutral on movement where you leg into something like long 34 short 35, 33 and with this, you lose if they end up right at the middle of 34 but you're already accounting for a movement by initiating it OTM and you win if they don't move either.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But why would I open an iron condor at earnings ? For the rest of your statement I agree. I‚Äôm new into all this, though still learning and thanks for the advice", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Butterfly not condor. A condor involves having both calls and puts. So the butterfly strategy works if you're bullish but still neutral on earnings. If you already expect a stock not to move above a certain price, hence the credit spread, youre saying you expect it to to go up. Otherwise, a put debit spread might be better than a credit spread since you're already bearish.\n\n So let's say you do decide to leg into an OTM butterfly. By legging with 2 calls instead of just 1, you can set up a spread on both sides with a lower cost basis and secure some profits while maintaining a position where your credit spread makes money as long as it's below a price, and with this, you can take part in the earnings movement if they do go up. Your short calls are used to lower your max loss, and your max gain is increased COMPARED to capital in play at earnings report. In short, capitalize on run-up, hedge against directional loss, and participate in market movement. \n\nYou can read up what exactly are the max losses and profits on a butterfly is. But I only really advise legging into options if you know what you're doing since legging can go against you really fast really quickly if you FOMO or panic into it. \n\nThis is of course assuming that your sentiment is what I highlighted above.\n\nI'm by no means an expert btw and I can be wrong about the risks in this strategy so plug in the play you wanna try on optionsprofitcalculator for a better picture of how your trades will look like.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Very detailed, thank you, I‚Äôll look up more about the butterfly spread.
