My intention with learning and using options has two primary goals... to protect gains on stocks I own, and to lock in lower pps buying opportunities on stocks I think will go up.\n\nLet me begin by saying that I am MOSTLY uneducated on calls and puts, but I understand the purpose and the idea behind options... I want to start using them primarily to protect my positions but I am struggling to understand the pricing. Let me explain my confusion;\n\nHypothetically, lets say I own 1000 shares of NIO. I bought at $9.38 pps and the share price is now closer to $15 pps. Obviously I have come up a good bit in a short amount of time and want to protect my gains as much as possible, but I want to hold the stock in case it goes up more. As a result I become interested in buying 10 put contracts (to protect the gains from all 1000 shares) so if the price goes down I am still able to sell the shares at the strike price.\n\nHowever here's where my confusion sets in... and be prepared because I am certain I am about to sound very dumb, but I couldn't find anything online to explain.\n\nAs you can see in the image;10 contractsStrike:$15Limit: 3.88 (price per contract...? x100?)Expiration: 1 monthprice to buy these puts is $3885.16\n\nWhat I don't understand is why it is so expensive, for instance if the shares I own are currently worth $15,000 and I buy 10 contracts (puts) so I can sell these shares for $15 pps if the pps share drops, the cost of the puts alone would be like the equivalent (cost wise for me) of the stock shedding almost $4000 in value. The whole point for me is to avoid losing that level of money in the first place, hence the purpose of protective puts on my shares, but if those puts are almost as expensive as the stock suddenly tanking why would I use them?\n\nBy now you can clearly see that I don't understand and am deeply confused about the purpose of protective puts if my brokerage account says that they are almost as expensive as suddenly losing $4 dollars per share.\n\nCan someone please set me straight and fill in the blank for me here?

Bank valuations hardly moved from their lows whereas tech is at all time highs and outrageously priced in the eyes of anyone not feeling fomo. Most news has been refreshingly positive from other companies (until now with resurging covid cases). Most big banks seemed reasonably well positioned during their Q1 earnings calls. I think there was some surprise they didn't move higher. Data on home sales and rent/mortgage delinquency have been positive. Banks had to set aside huge reserves expecting defaults. PPP and the rest of the fed moves to provide liquidity are a backstop.\n\nPeople say trading is all about positioning. So like there was a brief pivot into industrials and value in May, then back to tech, it's certainly plausible there's a brief pivot into financials, then back to tech. \n\n\nI think seasoned investors are confident banks will find new ways to increase their margins in the near term despite the hit they'll take from the zero interest rate policy. Some won't obviously: Berkshire pulled out of Goldman and Wells before covid even happened.  But big money gotta go somewhere as the value of the cash diminishes.  Why not move out of tech which is clearly risky af at these valuations, secure some profits, and take a smaller risk on financials not being as bad off as they could be. Bet on the fed. Then move back to tech once tech cools off. \n\nThat's just my two cents though. I'm just some dude. I have XLF calls. I have JPM and USB.  I have not pulled out of my tech positions but I sure want to. I don't because I teeter on the fence about whether double the tech price multiples from pre covid is reasonable given the insane liquidity injected into the financial market. It just may be we see the avg s&p p/e move toward 30, even 40 and that's the new normal.

They might sell as many as 4-4.5 in 2025 depending on how many factories they can build (if there’s 2 things that Tesla just proved they can do, it’s build factories quickly and efficiently, and sell cars, even in the face of a pandemic).

Found this sub in late October and made the right decision to sit around and just lurk/ask questions for the first few months until I understood options a little. At years end I took the dive into options trading. Now almost a year after I started trading I've made a solid amount of money, not the hundreds of thousands or millions that some on here have made, but as a university student this is life changing money for me, it's enough to pay the rest of my tuition to finish my degree.\n\nAs much as this sub is bordering on one big shitpost it's done a lot for me and really changed my life and I hope others can experience this too.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Good summary.

I also watched vids by KamikazeCash on YouTube, he's a member of the sub and a lot of his posts are about people on here winning/losing big but he usually explains how they did it, which can be a big help. He has some older tutorials on a few options strats. Also just google some profit loss graphs for a certain type of option, like say a straddle, if you're a visual person like me it helps to get a clear picture of how you make and lose money with each type of option. Other than that, the Wikipedia pages for the various options are actually pretty good, though text heavy.\n\nAs far as my investments, two caveats. I'm Canadian so covering tuition is a lot cheaper than in the U.S., and I have access to a government supported trading account where my gains aren't taxed. I started with $6,000 CAD, then supplemented it with some cash I got from working a Co-op job, for a total of $13,700 CAD by late February, about $10,069 USD. Now here's the thing the reason I needed to add more cash was because I messed up hard and lost most of what I had initially put in, so with $13,700 in, my portfolio was only worth about $3,000 or $2,200 USD. My portfolio was at $52,000 CAD at close on Friday, about $38,200 USD. My tuition costs $5,500 CAD a semester or $11,000 a year.\n\nRegardless of how much you start with worry about the percent return, not the absolute value. If you have $1,000 in and make $100 off a trade it might feel lame compared to some of the big shots here, throwing around tens of thousands like it's nothing, but that's a 10% gain, that's huge, the S&P 500 has a three year, yearly return of 10.57% so you basically got a years worth of what the market does in a single trade. Just keep trading based on percent, and soon a few percent will be hundreds, then thousands of dollars. Don't look for the 1 play that will make you a millionaire.

{"title": "DD: New Fed Repo Schedule/analysis for what it means after today (SPY, VXX)", "selftext": "EDIT: link for the Fed repo email list signup. \n\nhttps://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFRBNEWYORK/subscriber/new\n\nIn the midst of today’s storm, I am calm. Joyous even. Why? Because this weekend I signed up for the FED Financial Operations E-mail List Serve: **the new FED repo was released this afternoon and will give us a shot in the arm heading into the close tomorrow and EOW**. Here it is, and here's some analysis/confirmation bias\n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details)\n\nContext:\n\nMy previous DD on the FED Repo schedule ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd\\_playing\\_vxx\\_and\\_spy\\_against\\_the\\_fed\\_repo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/)) saw a connection between days of what became known on the sub as “double pump days” and rises in SPY. These DPD’s were going smoothly on Tuesdays, but last week we hit a snag in the plan. What was the issue?\n\nThe issue became **no bids being entered for the Fed repos**. Jerome Powell extended his gracious hand, and the banks poo-pood it! What does this mean? It likely means one of two things:\n\n1.\tAfter already taking issue with the rates and terms from when Repo operations began in daily capacity in the winter, there had been displeasure among the banks with the FED. This, combined with a new set of restrictive regulation standards borne of of the Stress Test Results, led banks to break from the Fed for Repo operations even if they weren’t necessarily on the financial footing to do so, needing to shun the additional liquidity based on terms.\n2.\tThe banks saw the market—and themselves—doing so well now and in the near future from the recent euphoria that they balked at the FED’s increasingly aggressive rates.\n\n**Recent history leads me to believe it’s a mixture of the two with the second being the larger factor by far:** the day they last offered a pump (repo loan) of 0 basis points on the overnight were 6/12 and 6/15, SPY increased 1.1% and .93% respectively. *What’s even more notable is that these came after a drop of 5.7%—sheeeesh*.(this will matter later)\n\nWithin last months Repo schedule, they weened the banks off of 0 basis points loans (literally free money) and started to introduce 5 point loans on 10 point days. This worked fine for a few weeks of double-pump-Tuesday bliss. But then last week, it failed and we dipped. Did the mechanism fail? No.\n\nThe banks refused to take the loans.\n\nThe FED was offering the lifeline while trying not to dive into more spending debt, and holding banks accountable through interest rates. Things were going well until today, and the banks likely thought they didn’t want—or need—the increasingly high interest rate loans of the FED.\n\nSo what now and why does this shit matter\n\nNow they do need it. We are approaching tragedy levels today. As they did when they took the money after we dipped 5% the day before the last 0 basis points loans, they will take this money tomorrow. They *need* to take this money for two reasons tomorrow:\n\n1.\tBecause the market will have a cascading fall affect if people link this to COVID numbers rising\n2.\tMore importantly, banks have their earnings run this week. It’d be a debacle if they didn’t shore up financials with some swift loans amongst each other.\n\nBanks probably will not be as frenzied to borrow the loans as they were when they were 0 basis points, but tomorrow is the first double pump of the new calendar and the 5 basis point overnight +10 basis point term operation has been a fine combo for them up until they got cocky last week. In addition to the two factors above re: banks need this fucking money, there is a big factor as to why this will shore up today’s losses:\n\nROLLOVER DATES FOR FED REPO OPERATIONS PRINT BIGLY\n\nI looked at each rollover date for new fed repo operation and GUESS what I found? ***On almost every rollover date—going back to last year when the operations weren’t even daily— SPY is elevated***\\*\\*.\\*\\* Even more of note, almost all the rollover date were preceded by a dip. The only time the rollover date didn’t elevate SPY was during the March crash, which is a no-brainer. Someone smarter than me can explain why rollover dates lead to jumps in SPY, but I do not believe that’s coincidence.\n\n**These factors lead me to conclude that this was a correction today, and we will come out of through the week leading into another beautiful Monday.**\n\n*What could go wrong? Problematizing factors include:* 1) the fact that the overnight repos are taking place in the afternoon this time around. I don’t know how that change affects things and didn’t have the time yet for that breakdown and 2) the beige book will be released this week, which carries some—but not a ton—of weight depending on if they’re glass half full or half empty and 3) talk about UI benefits and stimulus 2 may heat up a bit, and you know how Mango be\n\n**I will try to update here when I can, but do more stuff on my twitter of the same name because I can react quicker to news and such.** For all the people who think I’m spouting permabull insanity, here’s a picture of the last time I played VXX last month so you can see my only allegiance is tendies.

Figured I'd try TSLA, just like the rest of you retards.\n\nSo I got ready to trade this morning, saw the crazy gap up premarket, figured paper was going to let this run as close to 18-even as they could get away with while letting FOMO retards fill their shorts. My plan was simple, trade the closing of the gap after paper showed its hand. Bought my 7/17 puts around 1770 after they hammered down the spike to 1794, i.e. the tape read that paper was saying \"So long retards, and thanks for all the fish!!!\": 4x1500p @ 16.9 (the low printed 15), 1600p @ 39.4 (low 33) and 1650p @ 57.9 (low \\~47). Almost the full cash balance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n94z39ckapa51.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=d988becf46031ac6b80ad462d0d9200ebf4a63f8\n\nSold the 1650 for enough to cover my position during the first break of 1550. Holding the rest (\\~50K unrealized) to see a test of 1400 tomorrow (because that's the tale of the tape).\n\nYou retards need to stop chasing your trades and learn to understand what the tape is yelling at you so you don't end up bagholding nor paperhanding shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** So a lot of you are asking about the tape and how you can learn and what not. Some have already answered below, but here goes.\n\nThe tape is what we called the T&S (times and sales) which combined with the book (NYSE order book, essentially a fuller level 2 quote) allowed you to see the price action as it happened. You could see where the liquidity was on the bid and at the ask (yes, the bid is always on and the ask is always at), where it was light but more importantly where it had a bias. You could literally make \\[almost\\] free money by hitting the last few lots on the inside while having a pending order to close your trade at the next tick (which you placed way in advanced to be higher up the queue).\n\nWhen I started, affordable charting software was terrible. Essentially a streaming chart that updated every 15 seconds. So you had to keep the important orders from the book and what you saw print on the tape in working memory for those 15 seconds, then when the chart ticked it would tell you how bad you were keeping track of the price action. That's how I learned, I first got a feel for what the book was saying about liquidity and others' intentions, and later got a feel for what the prints on the tape showed that you couldn't get from the charts.\n\nUnfortunately, like open pit trading, reading the tape is a bit of a lost art. Everything just flashes too fast and the level 2 quotes are meaningless (when I started trading canceling orders incurred a fee, something like a nickel or a dime, seemingly nothing but enough for people to not spoof the shit out of the book).\n\nI can't really tell you how to learn now in the age of HFTs and algos everywhere. I can tell you that there are things that you can still read if you already knew how. For instance knowing how quickly the buying dried out on the spike to the high of the day, probably a few that covered when it started to move past 1780, then a few FOMOs trying to catch the ride to break 1800 and  then finally the last few bagholders bailing out of their early shorts before 1800 hit. Then shit STOPPED for seconds with no prints and suddenly got sold down to 1770 with a shitload of volume in a blink of an eye (yes, I was caught being that last bagholder plenty of times just to be shaken out at my 10 tick stop and see it rip a full point in 5 minutes).\n\nThat's how I knew that was the level to watch out for. Got in the 1500p shortly after the spike, and later when the 1750 level really broke (again the real break could be seen coming on the tape) got in the 1650p, then realized a 150 spread was too much to easily adjust the trade and got another 1600p contract.\n\nI can also tell you they were pinning the price to the strikes while the floor was falling out from under the SPY and the cubes. If the market hadn't continued selling off the area around Friday's close would have held and I would have closed my trade. But it btoke, and then seeing the impending break of 1500 I placed an order at 170.1 for my 1600p contract. It all happened too fast but I believe I saw my order on the ask (the .1 is an old trick to be able to see where your orders are) but the high print was around 167, otherwise I'd be up 17k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 2:** To expand on the how I read the tape part, I'll retell the weird afternoon pinning from my point of view (I don't know if it's weird or not since I've been watching the stock 2 days, but definitely looked like something was up). So when everything else was dumping TSLA started printing FOREVER at the 10s. If it went down to 1540 you could see the tape fill red with hits on the bid and rebound straight to 1550 and print FOREVER AGAIN at the ask full of green, and fall down to the lower strike just to start all over again for shits and giggles. It happened for a long while from the 1560s (maybe the 70s) down to the 1530s until, my best guess is, liquidity for keeping the pinning ran out because the market continued to tank.\n\nWent it started tanking like everything else a test of the 1500 price looked inevitable (mind you I wasn't directly trading this move). But I know from experience that these kind of \\[very\\] round prices attract stop loss orders, so I threw an ask out there in case the break of 1500 triggered stops selling and see if I got a fill at what is effectively ridiculous price improvement caused by the sudden volatility that dries up option liquidity.\n\nLike I said above I didn't get filled but I do believe I saw my order at the ask for a few seconds (just checked and the actual high print was in the 165s). This is also how I got filled at the ask (166) on my 1650p when the race to fill down the gap happened (the high print for that move ended up in the low 180s, so I went for a little more when it looked like a bigger move was going to get triggered)\n\n**Update:** Closed out today for a 43k gain\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hr5pgv/bought\\_tsla\\_puts\\_yesterday\\_just\\_after\\_top\\_16k\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hr5pgv/bought_tsla_puts_yesterday_just_after_top_16k_to/) ", "id": "hqpbml", "created_utc": 1594679323.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Damn right, except im using my unemplyoment money", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.
