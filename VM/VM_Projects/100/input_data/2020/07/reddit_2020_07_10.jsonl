But Kodak didn't pursue the technology because its customers didn't want digital cameras -- they weren't good enough. The people interested in digital were Kodak's worst customers, people who weren't that concerned with the quality of the picture.\n\n>Another finding is that companies can often perform at their best right as they're being disrupted. This is because market entrants tend to pull an incumbent's worst customers, those worth the least with the lowest margins. As the American auto-makers ceded the low-end car market to Japan, they performed better than ever, because their remaining customers were their most profitable customers. The temptation is for disrupted incumbents to flee into even higher markets that entrants cannot enter into. (See again Ford abandoning the midsize car market for trucks alone.)

Haters will say mommy and daddy gave it to me to gamble, but I got it through years of blood, sweat, tears and constant ups and downs of failing and persisting. I own several businesses, e-commerce and cosmetics manufacturing with my family. I joined this casino after seeing someone posted their AMZN gains and I dove in head first with no retard helmet on 4/20. BIBLICAL date to start my autism journey with you retards.\n\nLast week before 4th July week, my portfolio was down a total of -1.7m and TSLA gains brought me back to life. Read it here if you haven't -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hk6hcl/thank\\_you\\_papa\\_elon\\_3m\\_gains\\_on\\_tsla\\_from\\_17m\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hk6hcl/thank_you_papa_elon_3m_gains_on_tsla_from_17m_to/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow... here's the story of the most epic come back of all FDs. I jumped into TSLA 1500c 7/10s WAYY too early this week. Eventually held 1530 contracts at average $10 cost, for total of 1.5m total. I was -99% on these and held them like a stubborn autist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qc1tl8zro3a51.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8b6a030c41ba952fd9cae87a878dff2773b1071\n\nI fucking BELIEVED that TSLA will pull off some crazy shit again and blast thru 1500 by end of today. It coiled all day at $1412, surely the big boys and algo will come in after lunch. And what happened at 1pm? Pure fucking excitement and epic buying. Everybody and their fucking grandmas were buying TSLA OTM calls. Just like Daddy Elon blessed us with his tweet back in May, he's done it again and again. NEVER. BET. AGAINST. ELON.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ay601vygp3a51.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=319471e00c3b28be7710bbc0a78bd52b3fc4ac28\n\nIn minutes, I went from -99% to positive net and in pure euphoric panic I sold all my positions at $7-12 to break even I think.\n\nWe thought TSLA was done at $1495... but no... she fucking rested and came back for MORE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5atrdtuop3a51.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc7a6cfc0b2773c956deaf5319b0611faa9f88d2\n\nIf I had held on to my position thru the end, it would've been 4.5x. From 1.5m to 6m\\~\n\nWhile I am truly grateful I made an epic come back, I'm speechless and learned a valuable lesson here. To take back some cost but let the rest ride out on big rallies and momentum.\n\nMy sell history. It doesn't have all my buys from earlier this week. But eventually I averaged the fuck down like a retard to $10. Was very tempted to buy more when it was at $0.30. This is the most retarded thing to do and I will never do it again (until Monday) and don't suggest anyone try this at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9v9kwpzq3a51.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=22c045cfe61d401123cdabd3f81676f6068ad858\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4doj460r3a51.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=e132cf8daf3d4bb933ceec61eb83b8c859ab86af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1rn2iq61r3a51.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=64e0b86dfc06e8b878830fa42bf105c17f9d6d05\n\nAll in all, a great week and I'm forever grateful for the momo trading crew (love you autists). If your portfolio is down, keep believing and never give up seriously. Yeah it sounds like some law of attraction bull shit. But if you constantly observe the patterns, in the market, in your trading style and constantly refine your process and find what works for you... You can do it.\n\nLooking forward to all the comments that my portfolio will blow up next week. Bring it on retards.From -1.7m to +1.1m to +1.8m to +3m to +4m in a week. I am definitely not letting these big wins get to my head, and as of today I am mostly all cash and will be starting Monday fresh and a little less retarded on the FDs.\n\nStay safe everyone.\n\nPS.  \nElon reads wsb and will give us gold.
