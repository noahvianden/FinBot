Supposedly Intel has been at a process disadvantage, so how have they still been able to compete if their architecture is inferior too?\n\n> Intel 10nm process has way inferior yield than 14nm..\n\nThis is the case with all new processes and affects the entire industry. Mature processes yield better, that has always been true.\n\n> IceLake for servers will be a huge headwind to margins.\n\nYou don't know this. Also, if AMD is so good, then why are their margins still so poor?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "TSMC makes processor for Apple, NVDIA, AMD and QCOM. Strategically Intel should be the competitor for them and would want strong AMD. TSMC may quote monopolistic price to Intel being their competitor. Hence trouble for Intel margins.\n\nYou don’t know how bad it is for Intel on product side. I mean there is not even a competition. 1 64 core EPYC Rome beats 2x Xeon Platinum single handedly. Threadripper 3990X is more than 2x faster than best of the best Xeon. Ryzen 3950x 16 core is faster in all apps except in high fps games vs i9 10900K. Ryzen 4000 mobile is faster than the top of the line i9 10900HK while consuming less than half the power. This landscape is not going to change anytime soon. \n\nPlus, AMD has scalable chiplet architecture means chips used in servers can also be used in desktop and HEDT. Its the same die unlike Intel monolithic dies. Separate for desktop and servers. Huge dies are bad for yield. AMD EPYC has 8x 8 core 70mm2 dies + 1x 12nm I/O die interconnected via a high speed bus. Intel Xeon on the other hand has a missive 500mm2 die. Smaller dies are good for yield and can be binned accordingly\n\n10nm is beyond worse. Thats why after more than a year of the launch of 10nm Icelake mobile we are still waiting for 10nm Desktop and server parts. Yield is very bad hence poor margins. (btw Did you look at Intel margins they are way off from ATH?)\n\nIceLake for server skus will have big die plus 10nm poor yields hence more binning would be needed. This will cause compression of margin. Based off todays leak 28 core Icelake is only clocking at 1.5GHz (MP part could be higher). 2x of these 28 core is not even faster than 1x Epyc Rome (launched last year).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't understand anything you just said.

Actually, 10nm is supposed to be marginally better than the 7nm process, Most likely AMD will have a short window where there are better and then be leapfrogged by Intel, and then back to AMD, etc. for the next while. This picture of total dominance from AMD is a delusion. Just because 10nm had issues before doesn't mean it's doomed to always be terrible even after release. Random leaks don't mean much.\n\nThere is also the risk that TSMC encounters issues at smaller nodes (Intel did make some difficult process transitions much earlier than TSMC, so we'll have to see what happens there in terms of sustainability). I do not see Intel giving up on process, likely they will see injection from government due to China tensions and try to surpass TSMC.\n\nI have no investment in any of these companies btw as I have avoided semis. But I think people investing in AMD at the moment are crazy. Consider yourself warned.

One of my labs is building a new server, and the standard for high-core count server-grade computing is still Intel by a good chunk -- we've used Xeons in the past and we're sticking to Xeons. That said, we're also in an upgrade cycle for personal machines, and the majority of the hardcore Arch-using Unix-beard types have shifted to Threadrippers for their workstations. Everyone I know still uses Intel-based machines for their laptops. That said, in the next few years, AMD definitely has potential to do better. It's also worth noting that, while Su is a great CEO, AMD success arguably has more to do with Jim Keller (who recently just left Intel after barely a year for \"personal reasons\", following a while at Tesla and, prior to that, a stint at AMD where he more or less invented the Zen architecture). He was also responsible for AMD's success in the late 90s/early 2000s (though left for Apple to work on mobile chipsets).

So before anything else, thanks for the advice, learning, and retarded-ass humor. Yeah I'm a simp fuck you\n\nStarted in late Feb during the airline/travel crash with $850; I accidentally diamond-handed on a cross country flight, made 500 bucks, and was.... intrigued. Also had puts on the airline I was flying which felt like living on the edge. \n\nLong story short, I got serious, and by serious I mean reading the fucked up DD that was all over this sub. Also started learning about theta gang, only chucking around FD's when I was willing to lose the money, etc. Made it to around 15k and stagnated between that and \\~10k for a while fucking around with AMZN FD's; finally got out of that with some dumb luck, TSLA, and FLIR calls. Passing 25k felt like an emancipation, but I quickly found out that the paper hands you get with unlimited day trades is risky as fuck. Started running the wheel on high dividend energy stocks and playing a stupid FD or two; made it to 40k largely on Amazon and Tesla calls, then went back down to 26k trying to catch the falling knife on both. Been crawling back up with theta and earnings plays and trying not to repeat my mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, these gains are small compared to the big fish on here, but they represent a whole new way of how I look at $, and a whole bunch of knowledge, stupid decisions, and good times that I wouldn't have had without this sub.

Sorry if its not too collected.  \n>  \n>The core of what you need to know is that gold is one of the leading - if not the #1 alternative - to government bonds. (It's not the only one though.)  \n>  \n>You need to know the bond market is fucking huge. Way bigger than the stock market.  \n>  \n>You need to know government bond yields go down when interest rates go down.  \n>  \n>You need to know that the world governments have no choice but to stick to 0% interest rates for a long ass time, because our entire domino tower global economy is addicted to monetary policy expansion.  \n>  \n>You need to know that with 0% interest rates, the bond market is going to give almost meaningless returns.  \n>  \n>You need to know that if 0% interest rates don't save us, the central banks are going to start talking about negative interest rates, and no one is even going to want to hold bonds.  \n>  \n>You need to also know that in addition to the bond market issues, there is also the secondary inflation discussion. As interest rates are low, fractional reserve banking laws have been repealed, and government handouts are at an all time high, the number of actual dollars (and all currencies) in circulation are going way way way up. As the economy recovers, the velocity of money will likely lead to large amounts of inflation.  \n>  \n>Investors are afraid of sitting in cash and losing to inflation.  \n>  \n>In a stagnant environment, gold protects against even 1 or 2% inflation.  \n>  \n>In an environment where inflation could be even higher than that, there could potentially be a real fear of inflation running away, and there could be an unprecedented demand for inflationary protection, above and beyond the regular bond market hum drum.  \n>  \n>You also need to know that these crazy ass economic conditions could even lead to major currency issues. Governments buy other countries currencies as one way to stabilize their own currencies. They also typically hold onto gold, even though there isn't a real gold standard anymore.  \n>  \n>Even without a gold standard, in the event of wide spread global currency devaluation (such as whats coming following all this government spending and monetary madness), purchasing other currencies isn't going to be very attractive. Even with all the current central banking policies remaining constant, this suggests to me that the government demand for gold will likely increase. Even if just China or Russia go back to buying up gold it will spike the prices even further.  \n>  \n>However, Donald Trump is now quietly pushing this lady, Judy Shelton into the fed board of governors/directors. She believes in getting USA back to the gold standard. She has already been nominated by the fed committee, and now she needs approval from the Senate. As of the time of writing this post, it is suspected there is enough republican votes to elect her. However, the democrats have been clear they wont support her. 2 republican senators said they wont either. I think she is 1 or 2 votes away from not getting elected.  \n>  \n>If this lady gets elected, it does not matter if the USA doesn't go back to the gold standard. The possibility of it alone is going to make people go crazy and buy gold.  \n>  \n>To be clear, I don't think the US go back to the gold standard even if Shelton gets nominated and then even made chair of the federal reserve. I consider myself extremely educated in politics (I work in Canadian politics, as does my significant other). I just don't see this gold standard thing happening.  \n>  \n>BUT. If USA DOES go to the gold standard. I don't think $10,000 per ounce gold is that crazy of a possibility. It would be revolutionary if this happened. I don't think it will. I am just saying, IF it does. Look the fuck out bud.  \n>  \n>FINALLY. Last thing you need to know. Gold mining company stocks are going to move a lot more than gold itself. If you want to make big money in gold, its the miners, not the bullion.  \n>  \n>All these companies are breaking even at like $1200-$1400 per ounce. Most of their costs are fixed. This means if they were making like say $100 per ounce at $1400, when gold increases by 35% or whatever from $1400 to $1900, their profits go up from $100 to like $600 or a 600% increase, not 35%.  \n>  \n>I've been trying to tell people, gold trading at $2000 is like the barrel of oil trading at $200. If this price is here to stay, these guys are going to be rolling in cash come 2021. If their stock prices don't move from where they are today they going to have PE ratios of like 4 or 5.  \n>  \n>These \\^ are all hypothetical numbers by the way.

I'll outline my 3 reasons for this:\n\n1) Juniors are less diversified - all their eggs are in one basket. Juniors focus on exploration, have few (often just one) assets, and often produce no gold. A higher gold price will make or break a project, and therefore make or break a junior(to compare with seniors, a changing gold price might significantly influence some of their mines, but not not all - if gold drops and one of their mines closes down as a result, at least they have 9 other mines that are still profitable).  \n\n2) Juniors make discoveries. As I stated, they focus on exploration. Seniors allocate a relatively small portion of their cash to exploration (as they're more focused on the mining aspect). With more money flowing into the sector during a bull run, juniors are able to finance their exploration programs - thus, a major discovery is more likely to be made with a junior.  \n\n3) Juniors get bought out by the majors - usually at nice premiums in bull markets.

NKLA is overvalued based on where they are as a company because a bunch of morons got excited and treated their IPO like they were 3 days away from having a product on the road instead of 3 years.\n\nThe theranos comparison is beyond idiotic, and is an illustration of how much of a retarded moron you are and why you are losing money.  Theranos was a private company that hid everything and never let anyone see inside their box.  NKLA would have to be as big a morons as you are to go public if they were doing the same thing, especially since they already had enough money to buy their mansions before the IPO.\n\nThey live stream their trucks running on twitter where every hydrogen engineer on the planet can run it in slow-mo and pick it apart for anything fake.  They literally have the trucks sitting in a place where you, or one of those engineers, can walk in and crawl under the truck and look at it for anything fake.\n\nIf they're faking it then they're fucking retarded for having as much transparency as they do.  Far more than any other company this far away from actually putting their product into production.\n\nThey're a bad buy BECAUSE of their transparency.  Because they are buyable 3 years before they have a product and having it so accessible makes dumb investors think it's closer to reality than it really is.  Did you see the Tesla Roadsters engine 3 years before they actually started selling them?  Did you see an iphone's internals 3 years before they actually started selling them?\n\nNKLA is a bad investment because there's a 1% chance they are the future of the trucking industry and a 99% chance they fizzle out into nothing.  And that small upside chance is a long ways off with probably many cheaper buying opportunities before it even has a chance of hitting.\n\nBut this dumb WSB meme about Theranos is fucking retarded and anyone repeating it deserves to lose their money on their dumb short dated puts that already have sky IV.
