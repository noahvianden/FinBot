{"title": "Massive Debt Bubble and How to Play it", "selftext": "Over the past 40 years the Federal Reserve has been gradually lowering interest rates. Now, the reason that they do this is because the total amount of debt in the economy increases with every business cycle. Once interest rates hit zero there is no more room to move down (and no Negative rates DO NOT WORK.) Once this happens the FED begins monetary policy #2 this is when they begin to buy corporate assets and flood money/liquidity into the markets. (This began after the financial crash of 2008-09) This with the extremely low interest rates causes many companies to become over leveraged because borrowing is too attractive to pass up. Eventually, the FED can no longer pump money into the economy and the companies who became over leveraged cannot pay back their debt. This causes the burst of the debt bubble and the cycle starts all over again. Right now we are in a massive debt bubble and while you might not believe a guy on Reddit here are some facts:\n\n1.)

The money will come from the monetization of the usage and usage metrics into other things useful.\n\n2.) Azure File shares as a service - yes, it’s reported to be a bit slow so far (it’s SMB3 over the internet after all) but every company uses basic file shares still and Microsoft now owns the easiest cloud available attachment that auto scales storage. You just can’t easily do the same thing with AWS S3 or other storage providers and get all the access restrictions and other configuration a windows admin is used to. You can cifs mount these from Linux or Windows so it’s the easy button for shared hybrid environment storage. No need to have, manage, or backup a file server. That’s powerful stuff.\n\n3.) Windows Defender ATP - everyone is already using their O365 subscriptions to protect Windows endpoints - but now defender now runs on Linux. Anyone who needs to pass an audit needs capable hybrid virus protection and the short path to an integrated solution in a single pane is MS ATP. The competitor at this level would probably be Cisco AMP vs a McAfee. \n\n4.) I also think as these products ramp up in adoption MS services like sentinel, and power BI will more probable choices in product selections for consolidating products in terms of management and bundled pricing.

I pretty much only used investopedia, browsing Reddit, and my own autism (it's only partially a joke) to figure things out. \n\nPersonally, I'd advise against buying too many books directly on the subject. They'll probably turn you on to a few good strategies, but if someone truly had \"the answer\" to making money from trading, why would they care to charge $100 for a book about it? The value I could see from something like that would be in some of the *really* complicated strategies that have, like, 12 options and they're delta neutral and depend on differential decay of gamma or whatever. Those are the games the big boys play, and they require way more information to be processed way faster than you or I could get or process. \n\nTBH, I rarely even mess around with four option positions (like Iron Condors, Synthetic Shares/Shorts, etc) beyond strangle spreads any more. \n\nI would actually recommend books that deal with the underlying math. IIRC, \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" is one I have a love hate relationship with. It's kind of opposed to TA, in that it treats market movements as a \"random walk\" and discusses some of the implications of that. \n\nAnother good one is \"The Black Swan\" (you want the one about trading by Nassim Taleb, if it's got a picture of a ballerina on the cover you've probably got the wrong one... I mean, unless that's what works for you, no judgement). You'll either come out of it completely black pilled or with a healthy understanding of probability and risk. \n\nUnlike what I normally say on Reddit, the following is *not* meant to be condescending... but I'd also recommend a few books from the \"For Dummies\" series... Calculus for understanding the Greeks and Differential Equations for understanding how they relate to one another. For Dummies because you don't need to be a fucking genius to understand this stuff, you just need an ELI5 level understanding of high math.\n\nThen, and only then, would I venture into the world of books dedicated to options trading. And I unironically suggest actively trading during that time. Not paper trading, open a Robinhood account, fund it with the $100 you're ready to shell out for a book and start having fun. As you pick up concepts from the aforementioned books, start applying what you're learning to simple debit spreads. Real money. Paper trading doesn't count. You'll learn a lot more by losing $10 bucks in a real trade than making $1,000,000 fake bucks on paper. If you've got the knack for it you'll figure out *why* and *how* you lost your first $100, and as you learn more you'll lose your second $100 a lot slower. By the time you've finished reading you'll probably be $500 in the hole, but your losses will probably be stabilized, you'll be able to evaluate a strategy that one of the \"classic\" books lays out and make a much more informed decision about whether the risk profile is worth your time given the potential reward and whether or not you can even find the opportunity you're looking for. \n\nAlternatively, a PhD in a quantitative field is only about $100k, and they say that will set you up for a great job too!

The idea of training your body to preferentially burn fat has no impact on the amount of fat you burn, since it's ultimately calories that determine how much fat you burn.\n\nNow I will say a positive, carbs seem to be a major trigger of hunger hormones, so people who adhere to keto experience much less hunger and will naturally eat fewer calories with less effort than someone on a traditional diet.  If you can stick to it, you'll eat fewer calories with less effort.\n\nThe downside is that, using myself as an example, I ate around 1100 calories a day on the diet where my maintenance would have been around 2200.  At that high of a deficit, your body burns fat as well as muscle, because it's full-on we're dying survival mode.  You end the whole thing skinny-fat rather than lean.  Also, with that large of a deficit, your body starts trying to preserve calories as much as possible, and your energy/workouts will suffer.\n\nTL;DR: It works because you get super not hungry and eat way, way fewer calories than your maintenance.  There are downsides of this.\n\nI'm not saying don't do it, I'm just saying you should understand the mechanisms and risks better before you do.

{"title": "Using Spreads: a guide on how to stop getting destroyed by theta", "selftext": "I've seen way too many of you pay way too much for calls and puts when you could be using spreads instead to get a similar amount of leverage for way less risk, so I'm writing this guide as a way to teach some of y'all a thing or two about how to not blow up your account. This will mostly deal with very basic strategies that every trader should know (but apparently don't) but if you don't know the MOST basic concepts like IV, call, put, strike price, you should probably stop and go read some shit before risking thousands of dollars on options you moron. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm going to be assuming we hold everything I discuss here to expiration day because it's much simpler. Many spread strategies involve getting out of positions before expiration, but if I included what happens before expiration this post will be 10x as long. As a general rule, spreads are much less sensitive to movement before expiration, which is a bad thing if the direction is going your way, but a good thing if it is not.\n\nOK, the beautiful thing about spreads is that there is an absolutely endless number of ways you can set them up to do whatever you want. You can bet on a stock going up or down a little, bet on a stock going up or down a lot, bet on IV going up or down, bet on a stock not moving, bet on a stock going up and then down, etc. We will first talk about the most simple and common spread, a bull call spread, which involves buying one call and selling another call. Let's use an example, and compare it to just YOLOing on buying a call, using everyone's favorite meme stock, TSLA. \n\nAt 3:45 PM today, TSLA is sitting at almost exactly 1500. Let's say you are bullish on TSLA, its earnings are coming out next week and you think it's going to smash them. You COULD buy an 1800 weekly call like a bunch of morons did on Monday, and it will cost you 31.25 x 100 = $3125. Your max gain is infinite, if TSLA goes to 2000 you will turn your $3125 into $20000 and you'll get to post that sweet gain porn on WSB you sexy stud. But, much more likely, TSLA will not go up 300 points in the next week, your call will expire worthless and Goldman Sachs will thank you for your money. \n\nInstead, you could buy spreads. I am going to talk about the basic concept of how much they cost one time, and then use shorthand from that point on. In this case, as an example, you buy the 1600 call, which will cost you $7450, and you sell the 1610 call, which will gain you $7100. The difference between the cost you paid and the money you got is $7450 - $7100 = $350, which is how much a single spread (buying 1 call and selling 1 call) costs you. If the stock closes Friday below 1600, your spread is worthless and you lose all $350. If it closes above 1610, however, your spread is worth the difference between the strikes x 100, so (1610 - 1600 = 10, x 100 = $1000) So, since it cost you $350 to get into the position, you made $650. \n\nLet's compare to buying a single call. As noted before, the 1800 call would have cost you $3125. Therefore, for the same price as buying that one call, we can afford 3125 / 350 = 9 spreads. Our max loss is 9 x 350 = $3150, so it's basically the same. Unlike buying the call, our max gain is also capped, at $650 x 9 = $5850. So obviously the downside is that when TSLA smashes and runs up to 3000 a share, you missed out on all those gains. The upsides, however, are that your call has a breakeven point at 1831.25, whereas the spreads have a max gain at 1610. It's MUCH more likely TSLA goes up 110 points next week than that it goes up 330 points. It isn't until TSLA hits 1889.75 (31.25 from the call you bought + 58.5 from the max gain of the spread) that the call alone outperforms your max gain from the spreads. Additionally, if TSLA tanks at open on Monday or Tuesday, your spreads will lose FAR less value than your call, because the 1610 calls you are shorting will be gaining you money while the 1600 calls you are long are losing you money.\n\nSo, to summarize, for the same cost as betting TSLA will reach 1831.25+, you can bet it will reach 1610, and you are only losing out if it goes above 1889.75. You may ask here \"But wait, what if I am insanely bullish and I DO think it's going to 2000? Shouldn't I buy the call anyway?\" Aha! There's an even better spread for that! Look at the risk/reward for the 1950/2000 call spread (buying the 1950, selling the 2000): the spread will cost you $300, and has a max gain of $4700 if TSLA closes above 2000. That's 16:1 leverage baby. For less than the price of that one 1800 call, you could buy 10 1950/2000 spreads, which would have a max gain of 10x4700 = $47000 if TSLA hits 2000, which would WAY outperform that one 1800 call, with the obvious downside that THIS spread will be worthless below 1950. But considering that the breakeven point of the 1800 call is 1831.25, and the breakeven for these spreads is 1953, you're only talking about a ~122 point difference for 16x the leverage. The 1800 call only makes more money than the 10 1950/2000 spreads if TSLA goes above 2301.25 (1800 from the strike price + 470 from the max gain of the spreads + 31.25 for the cost of the call) by next Friday.\n\nSo, you can see how you use spreads to lower your risk, and to maximize your leverage. But possibly more importantly, you can also use them in a simlar way to stop getting fucked by high IV. Let's now use MRNA as an example, because I made so much fucking money on MRNA this week using this strategy. \n\nLet's say I think MRNA will hit 110 next week. Stock has insane IV, so the 100 calls are currently sitting at $550. Stock has to go up to 105.5 to break even, and if it hits 110 you don't even double your money. Instead, the better play is to buy the 100 and sell the 110. This will currently cost you $200 per spread, with a max gain of $800 per spread, so essentially 4:1 leverage. For the price of 1 call, you could buy 3 spreads: your breakeven is at 102 instead of 105.5, you don't get blown the fuck out if the stock dips, and if the stock hits 110, you make $2400 instead of $450. Again, the only downside is that you would have made more money from just buying the 100 call if the stock goes above 124.5 by the end of the day Friday, but that's far less likely than going to 110. (Or that the stock skyrockets but then dips, because you make much more money from selling the call early in this case, but again, I'm assuming we're holding to expiration for simplicity).\n\nThis post got a billion times longer than I expected so I should probably stop here since you autists won't read this much as it is. If you liked it let me know and I'll write some more. If you didn't like it, tell me to go fuck myself.\n\nEdit: goddamn this got way bigger than I expected.

To see why, consider the example of the 1600/1610 spread in my OP. Let's say on Monday the stock opens at 1610. The 1600 calls I am long will go up massively, BUT the 1610 calls I am short will ALSO go up massively almost as much, cancelling out a lot of the gains from the long calls. Theoretically, the value of the 1600/1610 spread when the stock is at 1610 is roughly equivalent to the value of the 1490/1500 spread when the stock is at 1500. Your spread will have increased in value, definitely, but not as much as you might think. Essentially if the stock is at 1610, the price value of your 1600/1610 spread will be roughly 50/50, because it's about a 50/50 shot it goes up or down from there. The more the stock price increases above your strike, the more the spread will increase in value, because the more likely it it is that it will STAY above your strike.\n\nYou can think roughly of the value of the spread at any point as the odds it will expire ITM.

It's been very illuminating.\n\nTo piggyback on closing the spread early, I think I'm missing something fairly obvious. Let's use the TSLA example. Bought the 1600, sold the 1610. Let's say TSLA is now trading at 1700 and you have two weeks until the spread reaches expiration.\n\nI understand the max gain in this scenario at expiration is $1k. You \"buy\" 100 shares of TSLA for $160,000 and sell them for $161,000. However, if TSLA is all the way up to 1700, I would assume the premiums for both contracts will have gone through the roof. If that's the case, and let's say the 1600c is now worth $100 per contract, and the 1610 is worth $85 per contract, you'd sell your 1600 for $10,000 and buy back your 1610 for $8500, netting a larger gain of $1500. Obviously it's very unlikely the contract prices would differ that much for such close strikes, but for the sake of the question, is that when you'd close the spread early? Are there any other reasons to close a spread early?\n\nAnd one last question if you can bear with me, let's assume I did this exact trade and both calls expired in the money. I have 42k in my account. I theoretically need $160,000 when my 1600c expires to own the shares. However, since I'll be immediately selling them, does your broker require you to have that full $160k? Currently using Etrade, so I'm assuming they'll be similar to tastyworks. If they do require you to have that money for the split second before selling, is that where a margin account comes in handy? I'm currently just cash but will consider changing over to margin if that's the case.\n\nAgain, thanks a bunch!

Essentially that person was \"shorting\" the call, they said to you \"If you give me $400 right now, you can buy my stock for $95 each at some point in the future\" which sucks for that dude if the stock goes to $10000 but is great for that dude if the stock stays below $95 and he just got your $400 for nothing. \n\nSo just like you can sell stock you've never bought (which makes you short), you can sell (short) calls you've never bought.\n\nI realize this wasn't a great explanation but selling a call is a pretty basic concept so if you aren't familiar with it you should look up some education on investopedia before dealing with options :) Not trying to be a dick, there's just a lot of basic info that you should know about options before you trade them.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to explain it for me!

Different brokers may have their own procedures on handling them (which means possible risks/safety for ppl using them). Check how yours does it.\n\nThen they can differ based on underlyings as well. So for example the closing price for VIX may not be the final price, as the value is calculated on the next morning (why this matters is say EOD the price is $34.04 but next AM it’s $33.96) - when the option is not tradeable anymore (this is not from experience, but from tastyworks FAQ, google for stg like “tastyworks expiration faq” or directly on their page in the help section, I’ve read it but can’t link from here now). In connection to this there’s something called *pin risk* what you might want to look up, and the aptly named *maximum pain theory*.\n\nThose were about **the way** you’ll get assigned. There’s also *early* assignment, that - in its simplest form - may prompt you to exercise your long leg, incurring you the assignment+exercise fee plus you’d lose the extrinsic value of the option. (This is assuming you don’t have the cash to take assignment. If you happen to have enough cash to take assignment, then you do and sell the long leg, or let it ride, as you see fit.)\n\n*Btw this is not an exhaustive list by any means, just what I can recall right off the bat at 4am* lol\n\nNow these above weren’t even considering the money-ness of the options.\nWhat you stated is the best case scenario, your spread expiring fully ITM. If it were to end up inbetween your strikes, that could end up costing you dearly.\n\nSay your long $110 option expires ITM and gets auto exercised (check whether your broker would have it auto-exercised!). Your short call is worthless and gone (stock between your strikes) and as you held a long call, the ability to buy at $110, now you’re long 100 shares at $110, which I believe you’d hold through the weekend as the settlement is not instant and only after market close. This is assuming you have enough money for that in the first place.. this exposes you to over-the-weekend news, possibly a margin call and a huge interest rate if you didn’t have enough cash to handle assignment. If you do puts, there might even be a hard-to-borrow fee depending on the stock ($NKLA or whatnot) and somehow the dividends could make your life harder as well but there’s no way I can explain that now, partly because I’m tired and partly because **I’m no expert**. So I just decided to evade dividends altogether until I’m more experienced and can keep an eye out for that as well.\n\nI’ve read that closing your spread early (not waiting for it to expire) can eliminate a great deal of risk. But your assignment is always at the mercy of the long holder.\n\nSorry for the sketchy answer. Hopefully you got a picture on the possibilities and what to further read about.

MRNA insiders now care more about where to invest their money next, not if their company is profitable, a huge red flag.\n\nInsider ownership of MRNA is 2.6% and just 3 months ago was 30%. Forward P/E is 319 and massively overvalued. Institutional ownership has increased only 0.54%, meaning institutions are holding, but not buying more at these sky high prices, and may sell soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxbso7o1khb51.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=5eea2a5fd02306d21b4614e1a46881aaefe9c058\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompare this to NVAX, a comparable smaller company with $8 billion market cap, 11 forward P/E, institutional ownership has greatly increased from 8% to 28%, and insiders cashed out only about $2 million of stock. Looks like insiders and institutions think NVAX has a much better chance of winning the vaccine jackpot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jft6bcv6khb51.png?width=1135&format=png&auto=webp&s=273fc5f520b58fa58574dc1aa748db0504709a4e\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVAX&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVAX&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)\n\nFurthermore, MRNA has massive open interest at the $95 strike august calls, but very little interest beyond $100. To me this means there is a lot of incentive out there to pump MRNA to $95-100 by pump and dump organizations and it looks like they just started cashing in today. As long as retail investors continue to FOMO buy the dip, they will cash out slowly for max profits. Once the FOMO dip buying money runs out though, expect a heavy 20-30% sell off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zolj2qnsghb51.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=12d78199bfdd006bb0eb4bbb99754b2f55310d54\n\nLastly, the US government gave gave $1.6+ billion to NVAX ($8 billion market cap) and only $0.5 billion to MRNA ($37 billion market cap). So 75% chance NVAX wins and 25% MRNA wins? I think there might have been another round of funding for each and can't find it right now, but essentially the US gov strongly favors NVAX over MRNA on winning the vaccine race.\n\n[https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/moderna-snares-483-million-u-s-funding-for-covid-vaccine-tests](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/moderna-snares-483-million-u-s-funding-for-covid-vaccine-tests) \n\nMRNA 7/24 $80p\n\nMRNA 8/21 $105/95 bear call spread\n\n[www.twitter.com/speedToTheMoon\\_](https://www.twitter.com/speedToTheMoon_)", "id": "ht54de", "created_utc": 1595023980.0, "score": 343, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "As much as I want to agree, MRNA has a legion of retards behind it.", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "So does every meme stock.
