Maybe they think the lower price will get some people to jump from their SR reservation to a dual motor.   Maybe it is to get the people waiting for a 7 seater to jump.   Maybe they know the margins of the Model Y are much higher then the Model 3 was/is and by lowering price they will increase demand even more for the more expensive variants thus increasing overall profit.\n\nYou understand Tesla has much more information then we do.   They know what orders they have.  They know what variants people want.    They know how many people have cancelled or paused their orders while the pandemic is going on.   They can use all this data to figure out if lowering the price slightly to get more sales of the higher priced variant is a good idea.    Honestly your argument would make more sense if the SR Y was already released and it was opened up to all markets.    If the SR Y was released already and it was in all markets and they still decreased pricing the lack of demand argument might make sense.  But this just seems like them modifying pricing to sell the variants that they want in the near term.\n\nPlus do you really believe that the model Y will only sell as many as the S and X in a quarter.   Based on Q1 that is only 12-13k units a quarter.   The Model 3 sold 75k in the same quarter.  So even if you say that Model Y will sell 15k a quarter that is 5 times less then the 3 did.

Whoever wrote the contracts would be obligated to honor that deal.\n\nUsually the goal isn't to actually do the deal - that is, to sell a bunch of stocks at a given price. The goal is to sell the contracts to someone else who actually has hundreds of shares to sell. (Each contract is for a bulk lot of 100 shares)\n\nIf the stock price dips below the strike, in this case $1300, the value of those contracts goes up since someone who bought in at over $1300 and is looking at a loss could buy contracts that give them the right to sell at $1300 in order to mitigate their losses.\n\nThere's one other factor, and that's the expiry date. With American options, you have up until that date to sell or exercise. (European options don't have this flexibility and resolve on expiry, whereas American options can be exercised at any time before expiry. If this doesn't occur they are resolved at end of day on expiry.)\n\nIn the case of the autist in question, TSLA was well over the strike on expiry, and so the contracts were worthless - who would pay money to sell a stock at $1300 when it's over $1500 on the retail market? No one. The contracts expired worthless and whoever wrote them got to keep homeboys $60k in premiums.\n\nThe bummer here is that at one point, those contracts were valued at $90k, but that glorious retard didn't opt to sell.\n\nSince I'm already explaining, Calls are exactly the same as Puts, except instead of the right to sell shares at a given price up until a given date, you buy the right to buy shares at a given price up until a given date.\n\n#TL,DR; Basic options are a bet that a stock will either be above or below a given price during a given timeline. If you guess wrong, you lose all your investment. If you guess right, you can potentially turn a little money into a lot.\n\nEDIT: I want to explain what would have happened if it had gone the other way: In that case, whoever wrote the contract would be obligated to actually buy 100 shares at $1300 per contract on exercise/expiry. This is called being assigned, and this is where writing puts can really fuck you. With $60k in contracts, I have to assume that there were a lot of them. Get assigned and that $60k in premium might help dry your tears, but now you've wrapped up insane amounts of liquid to buy copious amounts of stock for more than it is currently worth. One way to mitigate this is to buy the contracts back at a loss and let them expire worthless/unexercised.\n\nSame situation as before, you aren't actually going to sell the person who wrote the contract hundreds of shares - odds are you don't have hundreds let alone any to sell.

You'd do the same thing for calls as you would for puts depending on where the stock is sitting. You'd no more want to sell 100 shares you don't have than you would want to buy 100 shares that you can't afford. So I would assume that it's either algos both ways or people who don't want to or can't cover their contracts, puts or calls regardless.\n\nHowever, most people can't write naked puts or calls, and most people who can don't.

{"title": "Tesla Model Y price cuts", "selftext": "# [TSLA drops prices for Model Y](https://imgur.com/gallery/3CUdXaK)\n\nThe Long Range AWD version went from $52,990 to $49,990 ($3,000 drop) and Performance AWD version went from $60,990 to $59,990 ($1,000 drop). This is huge because it means Tesla is committed to keep demand for their Electric Vehicles (EVs) high during the pandemic (even after inclusion to S&P 500 based on likely performance beat in Q2 ER).\n\nYou could take this in two ways: A) TSLA is having issues keeping demand during the pandemic and are hurting their profit margins or B) TSLA has optimized manufacturing for Model Y and is capable of bringing prices down to the consumer to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\n\nThe price drop is **YUGE** for Tesla because it allows the Model Y Long Range AWD and Performance AWD MSRP price to qualify for EV rebates in some states (e.g. $2,000 off in NY for EVs with MSRP less than $60,000 and range greater than 120 miles). This means a Model Y Performance in basic configuration could qualify for EV rebates in New York.\n\nConsidering the Model Y captures an extra 5-10% margin over the Model 3 (according to [Sandy Munro](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/articles/sandy-munro-tesla-model-y-costs-are-shocking)), the Model Y is positioned to be one of the most popular, in-demand EVs in the world (surpassing the Model 3 which is insane) since it is a more affordable SUV/CUV. Furthermore, this is consistent with the recent price cuts from the Tesla Model S, 3, and X.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla is going to Mars!

Now, they‚Äôre about to reveal what three more months of Covid-19 did to the industry.\n\nSecond-quarter results, set for release next week, will probably show that the trends that took hold at the start of the year only intensified: surging provisions for loan losses and slumping consumer spending, with trading gains helping some banks weather the storm.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a full three months of the pandemic coming through the numbers now,‚Äù Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in an interview, adding that the second quarter was probably the worst for bank earnings since the financial crisis. ‚ÄúThe first quarter was rough, but it really only reflected a couple of weeks in March.‚Äù\n\nSoaring unemployment left many consumers unable to pay back their debts or take on new borrowing, forcing banks to set aside more to cover souring loans and crimping their net interest income. At the same time, nationwide stay-at-home orders left once-bustling downtowns and retail districts deserted through much of April, May and June, which probably hurt a cornerstone of banks‚Äô growth in recent years: service charges and credit-card fees.\n\nLending Trouble\n\nLoan-loss provisions seen continuing to weigh on bank earnings\nSource: Estimates compiled by Bloomberg, company filings\n\nShares of the companies reflect how rough this year‚Äôs crisis has been on the banks. The S&P 500 Financials index has slumped 26% since the end of December, compared with a drop of just 2.4% for the broader S&P 500. Wells Fargo & Co. is the year‚Äôs biggest loser among major banks, tumbling 55%.\n\nMost firms probably set aside even more provisions than in the first three months of the year, and combined earnings at the four biggest U.S. banks will be the lowest in more than a decade, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\nWells Fargo to Start Cutting Thousands of Jobs This Year\n\nWells Fargo & Co., the largest employer among U.S. banks, is preparing to cut thousands of jobs starting later this year.\n\nFor Wells Fargo, already struggling under the weight of a series of scandals before the pandemic hit, second-quarter earnings could be the worst since at least the financial crisis. The company will disclose how deep it has to cut its dividend when it releases results next week, and people familiar with the matter said the San Francisco-based bank is also readying thousands of job cuts for later this year.\n\nWells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said last month he expected the bank to set aside more for bad loans in the second quarter than the $4 billion tally for the previous three months, which itself was the most in a decade. For the industry as a whole, loan-loss provisions are poised to reach their highest levels since the financial crisis, according to analysts at Barclays Plc.\n\nTrading, Underwriting\n\nTrading and underwriting will likely be the silver lining for most banks, as a global hunt for liquidity drove up fees in the second quarter, according to analysts‚Äô estimates.\n\nCombined stock- and bond-trading revenue at the five biggest banks probably jumped 31% from the second quarter of 2019, the estimates show, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. seen posting the biggest increase. The bank expects trading revenue to climb about 50% from a year ago, co-President Daniel Pinto said in June.\n\nTrading Bump\n\nEquities and FICC trading expected to outperform last year\nSource: Estimates compiled by Bloomberg, company filings\n\nBanks‚Äô revenue streams have remained much healthier in this crisis than in previous ones, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a report. Previous cyclical downturns saw investment-banking and trading revenue drop as much as 30%, according to the report.\n\nCitigroup Inc.‚Äôs Richard Zogheb, global head of the debt capital-markets division, said last month that he expects record volume for the period.\n\nU.S. investment-grade corporate bond issuance more than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $757.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. High-yield sales jumped 61% to $130.1 billion.\n\nMortgages\n\nMortgages are set to be another strong spot for banks in the second quarter as historically low interest rates spur homeowners to refinance. U.S. refinancing activity has almost doubled from last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage has tumbled to 3.03%.\n\nLenders sell most of the loans they make, and the spread between what they charge borrowers and what they‚Äôre able to sell the loans for was at its widest in April since 2008. Also that month, a measure of lenders‚Äô profitability maintained by the Urban Institute hit a record high.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe outlook now depends on whether businesses continue reopening, or if a resurgent virus in the Sun Belt and other regions forces another nationwide shutdown. States that faced the initial brunt of the pandemic in March and April have managed the spread of the virus, but new outbreaks in states such as Texas and Arizona are stoking fears of a second wave.\n\nWhile banks‚Äô net income will continue to face a substantial hit, the crisis is still expected to be one that brings temporary earnings pain rather than existential capital concerns, Royal Bank of Canada said in a report.\n\n‚ÄúOur outlook is cautiously optimistic as we expect the economy to continue to gain momentum into the end of the year,‚Äù RBC said in the report.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "!Remindme 1 week", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That‚Äôs a good bear argument, yet you give no bull argument. Let me help you. \n- \n\n1.) The PPP loans - The JPM, but especially BAC are almost certainly making a killing there. More loans processed in a quarter than multiple years combined.\n\n2.)this is different from 08 in the sense that the banks were the bad guys then. In this case - they didn‚Äôt cause the recession, they have had 12 years of FED induced stress tests to prepare, and they are the industry facilitating the FED‚Äôs tools (and getting paid well for it)\n\n3.) The banks are going to understate how well they are doing, partially because they do not want to look like the bad guys again. This seemed to be the theme of The previous earning season, when they allocated a ton of their capital to accommodate POTENTIAL losses on loans. I think they were intentionally overestimating the impact of COVID, and rightly so, because that‚Äôs their job. Always better to underpromise and overdeliver right? We will see for sure this week.\n\n3.) banks took an additional hit when Buffett sold all of GS and some of the rest of his bank stocks, but what was missed is that he sold some of his bank holdings to get his ownership just under 10% (to avoid insider status) and he *likely* sold all of GS because they are in the middle of expanding into consumer banking with their Marcus platform. \n\n4.) interest rates are low and yes that affects bank profitability to an extent. But JPOW is adamant that we are not going negative, which means rates can only go up (lol). In the meantime, this presents the buy and hold investor with year(ish) opportunity. \n\n5) commercial real estate is hurting, but residential is booming due to the low rates - banks also make money on the underwriting.\n\n6.) The fact that most banks came out of the stress test and didn‚Äôt cut dividends is hella bullish for me. WFC is the exception, but they have self inflicted wounds (legal expenses) due to their fake account scandale (full disclosure; I do not like WFC)\n\n7.) A big reason banks do buybacks is because there‚Äôs very few things they are allowed to do with money. That changes with the repeal of the Volcker Rule: https://www.complianceweek.com/regulatory-policy/regs-rollback-volcker-rule-restrictions-on-bank-investments/29123.article << this is slipping past a lot of people, but it means that bank can now invest alongside their clients. More risk, but certainly more reward; and I‚Äôd rather they did then get back into Collalterized Debt Obligations in a big way. Will likely only see the consequences of this post COVID.\n\nIn sum: bank are the shit for buy-and-hold guys; they make money in all scenarios, so long as they continue to regulated against over-leveraging like in 08.

It's not a balance sheet issue, it's an earnings issue. (with the exceptions of course namely WFC)\n\n3. Again not irrelevant. Banks front loaded all their covid losses up front and from appearances overestimated them. This is important to earnings. If loan losses are way lower than what they prepared for, banks are likely to pop really nicely to the upside. \n\n4. Is the long term buy and hold strategy. Interest rates will only go up in the long term. It only matters for the buy and hold strategy and not any type of earnings play. \n\n5. It will depend on the bank. Banks are being pretty careful with who they give great rates too. I have a credit score in the high 700s but my bank isn't giving me remotely the best rate possible. I'd extrapolate that and would think the banks are not lending to high risk individuals on a large scale level. \n\n7. Why the hell is this negated? Buybacks were one of the main ways they could do with money. Now they have more options with the repeal of the Volcker Rule. This is hella bullish long term. IT takes time for investments to pan out so again this is a long term buy and hold bull point. \n\nI mean I definitely worry about some of the points you've made in the post.
