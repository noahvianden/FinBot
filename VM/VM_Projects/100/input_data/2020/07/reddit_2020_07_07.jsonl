Of course they typically get better prices from major food distributors than a small store is going to. The craziest thing to me is that their entire food market is just bait, they sell some goods for small profits and a few for losses but overall their food system is mostly flat. It's just bait for everything else where margins are much MUCH higher than food.\n\nIt's impossible for a small old store that only sells groceries to compete with that as far as I know, all they have going for them is distance from the giants and the misery of going into them.

In south korea I just got this atom breaking news:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSEOUL, July 8 (Reuters) - From an eponymous cocktail to eager buyers following the shipping routes of long-awaited cars, Tesla Inc is having a moment in South Korea, particularly among tech-savvy professionals.\n\nKang Sung-mo, who runs an advertising production agency in Seoul, is a convert.\n\n\"I am not interested in cars, but I am interested in the Tesla brand and its technology,\" the 39-year-old told Reuters.\n\nKang bought a Tesla Model 3 in December, ditching the Hyundai crossover he bought only last summer. Being associated with Tesla's reputation for innovation was good for his image, he said.\n\nThe U.S. electric car maker had its best month for South Korea in June, selling 2,827 vehicles and bouncing back from weak sales in April and May which were hit by U.S. production disruptions due to the coronavirus. The Model 3 is now the country's No.2 imported vehicle, ahead of the BMW 5 series and the Audi A6, and just behind the Mercedes E-Class.\n\nBy contrast, Hyundai Motor Co , the dominant automaker in South Korea, saw sales of its Kona EV slump 31% in June to 2,513 vehicles.\n\nAnother 4,000 to 5,000 South Korean customers have the Model 3 on order, although most of them may have to wait until at least September for delivery, said a source familiar with the matter. The source was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified.\n\nTesla's rising popularity among affluent professionals in South Korea, who have been relatively unscathed by the pandemic, is one of many feathers in its cap.\n\nHighlighting the threat it poses to established brands, Tesla last week surpassed Toyota Motor Corp as the world's most valuable automaker while its second-quarter deliveries smashed expectations at a time when sales at rivals have been laid low by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Korea's generous subsidies of 12.43 million won ($10,380) for the Model 3 have definitely helped sales, bringing the car's price down to less than $40,000, but the Silicon Valley automaker has also generated a genuine buzz.\n\nIn social media posts, South Korean Tesla fans avidly track the routes of ships bringing its cars to Asia, while at the country's bars, the latest trendy cocktail is a mix of HiteJinro's Terra-brand beer and the Korean traditional liquor 'soju'. Smashed together, their names are pronounced \"Tesla\" in Korean.\n\nThe automaker has additionally benefited from free advertising after popular Korean actor Yoo Ah-in, known for his sense of style, drove his Tesla Model X SUV to go grocery shopping on a reality show aired last month. That has led to a spike in orders for the vehicle, a second person familiar with the matter said without elaborating.\n\nSome new Korean owners noted they bought a Tesla for practical reasons.\n\nKim Dong-hwan, who works in IT in Seoul, wanted to avoid public transportation during the pandemic and driving fatigue on his long commute.\n\nNot everything is perfect - his Model 3 has a panel gap and he has to wait several months before it will be fixed - but Kim says the benefits and emotional appeal of a technologically advanced brand were worth it.\n\n\"I am very satisfied given that Tesla's self-driving feature has reduced fatigue while driving,\" he said.\n\n($1 = 1,197.4600 won) (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Additional reporting by Daewoung Kim; Editing by Edwina Gibbs) (([hyunjoo.jin@thomsonreuters.com](mailto:hyunjoo.jin@thomsonreuters.com); 82-2-3704-5685; Reuters Messaging: [hyunjoo.jin.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net](mailto:hyunjoo.jin.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)))", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Sweet subsidy.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Unlimited demand", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "üôÇ", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh hell yeah", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "You know what they do in japan cause they are afraid of TSLA?

I had two HNW ESG investors call yesterday about their crazy TSLA holdings (we actually advised them to not invest so much lol) and now they were worried about tax gains. One (father) was sitting on 15mill in gains and the other on close to 3mill (daughter's trust). The father just wants to donate money to charities and leave money to his daughter for her to take over his philanthropic ventures, but the dad is old asf and has a history of cancer so we advise against any sales because he has some crazy fucking gains. We rebalance and get rid of garbage his last financial advisor got him into (a lot of that in march when we finally had losses to work with). We tell him not to sell in general because he is at high risk to die any day (*knock on wood* seriously, this guy is fucking amazing and so nice and the world is 1000x better with him around). This is an issue because if he sells now, he pays taxes on those gains, and then if he dies tomorrow, his estate pays taxes on the market value again. \n\ni.e. Scenario 1: You buy Tesla 2 years ago at 130 and sell today at 1300 1) you pay capital gains tax this year and then 2) when you die your estate pays estate/inheritance taxes on the full market value of the inheritance, 1300 and the cost basis for the inheritance is stepped up to the current mv i.e. all gains/loses are wiped\n\nScenario 2: You buy Tesla 2 years ago at 130 and don't sell 1) you DONT pay capital gains tax because you didn't realize shit 2) when you die your estate pays estate/inheritance taxes on the full market value of the inheritance, 1300 and the cost basis for the inheritance is stepped up to the current mv i.e. all gains/loses are wiped\n\nHe's aware of this, just giving you backstory, but he agrees he'd rather just avoid the capital gains tax - especially since he's in the top income bracket. We ultimate settle on buy super long options as hedge to put him at easy of having so much tesla (June 2022 Puts) and we'll just revisit and roll them up every 1-1.5 years where we can then a combination of stocks/puts for tax lost harvesting and touch base on if he still wants to hold them.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for the detailed response.

Do you have a percentage risk of success/failure in your estimate? \n\nWhat makes Tesla incredibly difficult to value is the Elon premium. Others might refer to that as a method of cheap cash. What Elon does well is capital raise and there's no real way to value that. The most valuable asset Tesla has is Elon's ability to oversubscribe an offering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> How many years of growth should be priced in? \n\nHonestly it depends on the industry, business mode, elasticity of demand, etc. All of these contribute to towards the predictability of numbers. Just think about the comparison between a utility provider versus a phone manufacturer. You can predictably estimate utility revenue 5-10 years into the future because it's a staple good that everyone needs, whereas with a phone, that's a discretionary good and it's anyone's guess how popular that particular product would be in 5 years. It all has to do with time horizons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Do you presume the 45% yearly growth rate will slow down, stay stable or accelerate? \n\nNo here's why, Fremont has always had excess capacity between ramping up production and gaining efficiencies. It's very easy to grow revenue with excess capacity, but what happens when you're at maximum capacity? You need to PPE and how do you pay for PPE? It requires resources and like with any resource, there are opportunity costs. It's a shift of resources and it would require shifting resources away from another function of the company. That's the fixed overhead side of the argument.\n\nThe other side of the argument is it's just not reasonable to expect a linear growth rate because the entire market doesn't exist at one price segment in the market. Someone will pay $10 for an apple and another will pay $5 for the same apple. If you want to start selling apples to the other person, it requires a lower price and that directly affects revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I don't really get why everyone suddenly think TSLA is overvalued when you have stocks like Shopify and Zoom around. I think most are just jealous of long investors getting their payback. The path to growth with Tesla is much more defined than most growth companies, like Uber who is just burning cash. \n\nI think those companies are overvalued, but it also comes down to scalability.

Keep loading up on $TSLA calls, because at this rate, they're only going to go up. \n\nThere are two huge reasons; one is based on real evidence, the other is my autistic brain figuring out Elon's 2000 IQ play.\n\nNumber one, and the obvious reason $TSLA is going up at this rate, is due to Elon's recent bonus deal. \n\nElon will be awarded a 55.8 billion bonus should the company reach the 650 billion mark within the next 10 years (as well as other set conditions). This plan was originally started in 2018 I believe, so he's just being aggressive and trying to fulfill this duty.\n\nThe second, 3000 IQ play that Elon is doing right now is YUGE.\n\nFor some background, Tesla recently announced that their factories produced around 100,000 vehicles this quarter, drastically exceeding expectations, and putting them on the road to break even, and even better - exceed earnings. This will give Elon and Tesla their 4th positive quarter in a row, which could land them on the S&P 500, increasing investor confidence, therefore increasing value, sending them closer to that 650 million mark. \n\nThis is where Elon's big brain, 4000 IQ play is coming into play. \n\nElon understands us degenerates; he understands our bullish nature, our gambling nature, and the retards and autists alike - and here's the thing - although they exceeded production expectations, earnings may or may not break even or be positive.\n\nSo, he, Grimes, Kanye, his team, and his group of investors, etc. are doing what they can to moon Tesla, and along with it, put money in our pockets. Elon figured out if he can somehow get money in our pockets, earned off of Tesla stock, we would then take those tendies to a Tesla dealer, and buy a brand new model S, X, Y, Cyber Truck, you name it, therefore pushing them to their earnings goal, and reaching that milestone, landing them on the S&P 500. \n\nSo keep buying calls, because $TSLA is about to moon.

EBAY reports on July 15th (just over a week from now). I know what you're thinking... ha ha ha, EBAY, what a garbage company. No. This is why you're poor.\n\nEBAY is currently mooning harder than a hollywood film lot in 1969. Why is that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It's an affordable alternative to Amazon, AliBaba, Shopify, and every other eCommerce site out there. Those other sites are currently priced in the hundred or even thousands. At the time of this writing EBAY is sitting at $56.00. If you missed the boat on those other plays, this is your last chance to avoid swimming in Trump's swamp.\n* They sold StubHub earlier in the year and are flush with cash, which they've been using to strengthen their core business\n* They recently settled a dispute with **Starboard Value** an activist investor hedge fund that currently sits on their board.\n* They brought on an outside CEO-Jamie Iannone former COO of fucking Walmart. This dude is an expert at personalizing the eCommerce experience and retaining customers of which EBAY recently got a LOT\n* As above, they've gotten a LOT of new customers thanks to the pandemic. Everyone who got laid off and didn't get their bailout checks is selling their shit. Everyone who DID get their check is buying. People are only going to sell MORE shit if there's no stimulus and the economy tanks.\n* The stock popped July 1st on the RUMOR that they are selling their classifieds division for $8 BILLION (Dr. Evil pinky finger). If this happens bam, instant upsized-tendies.\n* Analysts believe in this shit too. EBAY is a Zack's #1 Strong Buy.\n\nTL;DR EBAY cheap eCommerce. eCommerce to moon. Rumor of big tendies if sell Classifieds division. Buy rumor sell news.\n\nEBAY 60c 7/17\n\nEDIT: this seems to be getting some traction. Follow me, and I'll post my next DD after EBAY earnings.\n\nEDIT: Many of you pointed out the earnings date has been announced to be the 28th. All of that DD up there is still good. Either roll your options to the 7/31 or hold them, depending on your personal risk tolerance. Since I posted this DD though, the stock tested 60 and closed at 59.22, so I think it'll print for me.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Some of you guys have messaged me for financial advice.
