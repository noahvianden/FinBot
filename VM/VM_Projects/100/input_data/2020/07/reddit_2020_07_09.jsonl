So its good to be aware of ones own motivation and internal battles. So here is mine, would be interested to hear yours as well.\nIf I hadnt had a goal, it would be just a gambling addiction. Its not, I gladly leave the options playing field in case I reach my goals.\nA bit of history: I started investing in TSLA 2.5 years ago and I am up big time obviously. Only sold 5 shares at 600 to start options. I never put anything of my personal funds into options directly, financed them with gains from shares. Current status about 25k, but most of that is again in options which might go to 0. So they dont count, yet. Also Im not counting the shares as I am not selling these for 20 years, so they dont count towards my goals either.\n\nTime horizon for these goals is until end of S&P madness.\n\nGoal 1: If I make below 50k with options, Ill keep trying, there will be plenty of opportunities in the coming years.\n\nGoal 2: I want a Model 3. If I make between 50k and 100k on options, ill put down 20k for a M3 and finance the rest. Finance is so much cheaper than not having TSLA shares, but I dont want to be negative on my monthly running cost. From the leftover I put down a share per year of TSLA into a trust account for my son until he leaves the house. Since shares are cheap now compared to later, I better start owning them asap. The leftover from that goes into more options until I reach Goal 3.\n\nGoal 3: I want to live in in a self owned house, though thats very expensive. I reckon, I need at least 200k to start the process and not go broke, and I am not going to touch my shares. So thats my stretch goal. Anything above that will go into more TSLA shares for the far future.\n\nOnly thing I wonder.. what would the wife say when I break the news.. She lost 5k in stock at some point in her life where she had a managed account which went to 0 (management fee ate the account until it was dead). She doesnt approve stock as a consequence. On the other side, I never gambled anything I couldnt afford to loose, never went into margins, never took a loan, so she should be fine. The alternative would be to do nothing and gain nothing.

So this means the price for your tea starts moving up. Some times it drops as people take advantage of the pre rush but smart people hold and get more tea. Some bought at $11 and sold at $14 pre convention. Other just bought whenever they could and held onto it.\n\nSo your tea now sells for $14. But news just broke the convention is Happening and extremely soon! Wow people get excited and fight for the left over tea that you now sell at $16 and even $18. Finally convention date is announced and even more people dive in. Your tea is now selling for $20 and you can hardly believe why! But who cares!\n\nConvention time! We'll look at that even more demand and price pops up all the way to $22 even spikes to $24. And it just kinda holds there while the convention last. Good bloody times!!\n\nBut finally everyone at the convention has filled their qoutas and it leaves town. Well lots of people still have your tea but a.majority of the buyers just left town. Granted there's less tea for all but the price falls back down to earth. But funny enough since now you can only produce 70 units of tea a.month you still get to sell it for around $13. So youre still up, but it dropped a bunch from the crazy high from the convention.\n\n\nSelling now is the dumbest thing you can do.unless you feel Q2 wont hit gaap profit.

We estimate the cost of revenue, including the payment processing fees, incremental customer care, and transaction losses, at about 200 bps, which is significantly higher than PayPal's all-in cost of revenue of ~172 bps in 2008/2009 when its TPV was closer to where eBay will be in 2022. The company reiterated recently that it is on plan to deliver $2B of revenue and $500M of operating income by 2022; we think that could prove conservative because the GMV likely would be much higher than pre-COVID-19 assumptions, and the profitability target of 25% may be reasonable when we compare with PayPal's financials from before its Braintree acquisition.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "but the parts are finally in motion you must account for, pricing asside, now is the time for judgement. pardon my run-on", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yo can you message me your store?

TSMC might increase their prices, which would cut down AMD's margin, but I don't really think the company trades based on its margins - its story is more about product quality, plain and simple.

My PHD is in mechanical engineering, and if we're pulling out our dicks, I have been on AMD for 5 years now. The reason the stock goes up is because of how amazingly well run their company is from the top down. I don't expect you to understand how manufacturing works, but I'll try and spell it out for you: TSMC is a \"supplier\" and what they do is make parts that they are UNABLE TO DESIGN for companies that have better shit to do than worry about actually making them. Ryzen processors are not competitive with Intel offerings because the TSMC fab makes smaller transistors - in fact, TSMC just published a paper in an engineering journal a month ago about how the \"7nm\" label is not adequate for describing their process. Yes, the number 7 is smaller than the number 14. Good job. PHD is paying off. The efficiency of the processor is not completely dependent on the gate size of the transistor. There is a lot more going on. Materials, environmental control during processing, timing, precision and repeatability of the equipment moving the wafers around - it's why Intel processors are still competitive in various benchmarks. If it was as simple as 7<14, there wouldn't be as much uncertainty in the price of AMD stock.   \n\n\nWhat AMD did to suddenly become competitive with Intel was to design a chip architecture called 'chiplet,' which does benefit, I admit, from smaller transistor sizes. The chiplet design enables more efficient use of multiple cores, and spreads things out so that the waste heat created doesn't fuck up the chip so much - keeping the whole CPU cooler, making it run more efficiently. Again, yes, smaller transistors help with this BUT IT IS OFFSET BY AMD ADDING MORE FUCKING TRANSISTORS. The idea to spread out the transistors, make smaller groups of transistors and then connect them with a high bandwidth data transfer solution ('Infinity Fabric') - that idea didn't fall from a fucking tree, and Intel couldn't think of it themselves, despite having more R&D resources that AMD. \n\nSuppliers (especially in Asia) lack the ability to design, it's just the way it is.

{"title": "$40,000 to $128,000 Thanks WSB", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThe reason I am sharing this post is not to brag about my result but instead I want to share my experience and as a result, some of you can take away something useful from this. I feel it is a responsibility to give back to the WSB community as I believe I have learned from others sharing their experience.\n\n\\#1: Pick only a few stocks to trade that you strongly believe they have a competitive edge over peers.\n\nFor me it was NVDA and COSTCO that paid off big for me. \n\n\\#2: You have to be disciplined. \n\nI bought COSTCO calls beginning of June and I actually lost about $40,000 as you can see from the dip in June. Thank God I stayed true and didn't sell. I had over 200 calls with different strike prices expiring all on 7/17/20 and I told myself I was going to hold until the June sales report.\n\n\\#3. Options trading is more luck and less analysis or acumen than stock investing. You have to time it right even if you picked winners. In the long run, I think it will be hard to continue winning. Get out while you're up.\n\n\\#4. Something I read from other posting on WSB: Don't fight the trend.
