However, the price is already beginning to rise and should rise after the split also because so many people now can taken advantage of this sale.

It literally changes nothing fundamentally. It is completely cosmetic. Everything else is correct here, but people should realize you don't \"take advantage\" of a split.

Either way your gain is 100%. It's just a question of whether you paid $100 and now you have $200 (if you bought post-split) or whether you paid $400 and now have $800 (if you bought pre-split). If you had one share pre-split you would have a position of $400:\n\n1 share x $400/share = $400\n\nNow the stock goes up 100% and you have:\n\n1 share x $800 = $800\n\nOr: the stock does a split before going up, giving you this:\n\n4 shares x $100 = $400\n\nNow the stock goes up 100% and you have:\n\n4 shares x $200 = $800\n\nSo, either way you make $400 on your initial investment. If you bought post split and only bought 1 share, sure you're only going to pay $100, but when it goes up 100% you will only have $200, not $800. To have $800 you would still have had to buy 4 shares post-split and it would still have cost you $400.\n\nThe reason a split is bullish is because if you had only $100 to invest, before you couldn't do it because the smallest size you could buy is 1 share and that share cost $400. Now with the split it's $100, so you can afford it, but it's only worth 25% of what it was before. It's not like you're getting three shares for free. It just opens the door to people who previously couldn't invest. It's more obvious with a stock like AMZN, where the price is $3300 ... if they split 33:1 now every investor with 100 bucks can buy a share of AMZN which opens the door to a lot more investors and creates buying pressure, even though the value of the company hasn't changed at all.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, that was a great explanation!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I get what you’re saying.

In turn, if said battery manufacturer invests in capital to make more and Tesla volume drops, they can sell that same package size (different chemistry) to any other product using the 2170 size.   Rivian got it, that’s why I have high hopes for them. \n\nEvery other auto manufacturer is using bespoke pouch cells.  Not only are they a unique size, but they require a bespoke line.

My TTM wave was light blue and below -10 which usually tells me it's a good time to buy AMZN unless the markets are in a massive sell off mode. So if SPY is trending up or trading sideways, I almost know I can make money on the trade if I scalp a close to the money option. \n\nHere's a pic of the indicators. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DTZe59P.png\n\nThe From_ indicator is below the rest are standard ones in ThinkorSwim\n\nhttps://tos.mx/X6RkvhY\n\nAbout it from the guy that wrote it\n\n You can use it similar to the TTM Squeeze/A wave combination that I describe above. To provide color, the TMO gives more accurate signals on momentum than the TTM Squeeze (since based on delta pricing) and is useful in conjunction with the short-term A wave (TTM wave which I describe above) to confirm whether a move in short-term momentum will be sustained through the following candles. The TMO is your main momentum gauge but your A wave helps you react faster to the move (so for example if there are two decreasingly negative yellow bars and the TMO turns green, that is a \"potential\" signal of a reversal. Obviously need to look at other factors on the chart. Re the TMO, there is a red shaded overbought box where if price action falls out of that, it signals a potentially bigger downturn and a green shaded oversold box where if price action pierces above it, it signals a potentially reversal from the bottom. For instance, price action can stay in the overbought box and red and continue to rise but once it falls out typically takes a bigger move down. Lastly, as with any tool I use, multiple time frame analysis enhances its use. You can look at multiple time frames to get a gauge momentum on more than one time frame. The A wave gives you a sense of cycle for X time frame and a potential leading glimpse into a move and the TMO will confirm", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What’s your profit % YTD?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "it's really skewed due to covid.

Just from a competition perspective though, Intel has no option other than to invest directly into 5nm. If they don't focus on 5nm now, they will be forever behind. If this CEO is a short term profit over long term market dominance kind of person, Intel is dead. Consumer market is surely moving towards AMD - new laptops with AMD chips, and if you go to bapcsales, pcmasterrace, battlestations, you can see how highly praised AMD chips are.

ZEN3 brings 9900KS+ levels of intercore latency. The final hill INTC has to fight over, gaming, is lost to them.\n\n\n2. ZEN3 is on 7nm EUV, w/ 20% transistor density increase and a 10-15% reduction in area with an equivalent increase in die per wafer accuracy. Translation: risk production of 7nm EUV had 80% yields out the gate. Formal production will have that ironed out and we'll see 90%+ yields per wafer. ZEN3 also brings 8c unified CCXs, which means printing errors will drop further. Factor in their chiplet architecture and you're likely looking at 95-98% yield per wafer.\n\n\n3. INTC's 10nm node is hobbled, and 7nm node is fucked. They won't release any new chips on these nodes till 2022-2023. TSMC enters formal production of 5nm EUV Q3-4 2021. 5nm EUV has been confirmed to be an 84% increase in transistor density over 7nm EUV. ZEN2 is 7nm pure. This means:\n\n\n4. ZEN4 will arrive on a node that will see 1.04x scaling from the last tick architecture aka doubling of core/thread offerings across the entire product stack with a 95-98% yield per wafer. I'd expect AMD's prices for each segment to rise <=50 per to increase margins.\n\n\n5. ZEN4 means Intel's 14nm++++++++++++++ vs. TSMC 5nm EUV. AKA 12000K 8c/16t - 12c/24t @ 5.3GHz vs. 32c/64t @ ~4.3-4.4GHz (w/ superior IPC) at equal pricing circa Q4 2021 to Q1 2022.\n\n\n6. By the time INTC is able to release a new chip on their 7nm EUV node in ~2023, TSMC will be on 3nm EUV. INTC's 7nm EUV node is comparable to TSMC's 5nm EUV node. Which means TSMC and AMD will be one generation ahead.\n\n\n7. Everything above also applies to GPUs in competition with Intel and Nvidia w/ consoles generating consistent YoY revenue out to 2027-2028.\n\n8.

{"title": "Where is AAPL going after the split?", "selftext": "We learned today what has been true since the ipod:  Apple is indirectly receiving cash from the US treasury via a long line of credit, some overseas manufacturing, artistic branding, and your mother's monthly disability check.  Straight profit.\n\n#TLDR for u/rowdygentleman1 and his Eskimo Bros:\n#AAPL is splitting 4:1 to let the gig economy workers get in on the ownership.  Why would very wealthy investors want very poor investors to come in and take a very valuable bag off their hands? The game is called when to exit.  AAPL climbs before or after split (maybe both), and drops as the rich get up from the table.  Time it right to get out before they do.  Or run with the bull pen to $150 EOY.\n\n** *Post Continues* **\n\nGoogle says a stock split is a neutral event.  Bullshit.  No one rich does anything except for them and they boys goin' get richer.  Tim not-Cook-the-books says a 4:1 split will allow more people to participate in owning Apple stock.  This implies that he sees an advantage to an over-valued Titan class tech stock being easier to own by retail investors (compared to Google, Tesla, Amazon,... Berkshire Hathaway).  Let's get real.  Retail invest investors can already buy fractional shares on the easiest app to download onto an apple iphone.  Does he think that more people would choose to buy AAPL over GOOGL or AMZN or MSFT or even NFLX?  Or that dumbass retail investors will think going from $100 --> $120 is the same as running from $380 --> $400?\n\nIn these instances, the post-split stock would quickly run up faster than pre-split, allowing Industry and Oligarchs to slip out the back door without crashing the retail party.  Then us bagholders wonder why AAPL can't climb above $125 for the next decade.\n\nSpeaking of Berkshire.  How much AAPL is coursing through Omaha's ground water?  Google says 245M shares (5.6%). Interesting. Vanguard Group owns 7.3% [and Vanguard owns 9.5% of itself, that means that Vanguard investors that own AAPL are double positioned on to AAPL].  No Ducking way these guys are pushing Tim Cook to help the small guys make money.\n\nAssuming that AVD and BRK know the music is slowing down and they need someone to dance while they slip out the back, and assuming that a lower bar to entry means dumber, eager buyers, I present three scenarios:\n\n1.  Stock runs up in anticipation of the split.  A future cheaper price means more investors will buy in after the split, effectively allowing current white collars to buy in bulk at a discount now over competing with the filthy wage earners later.  AVD and BRK start paring down their piggy bank.  Ease it out a few million shares a week.  Once we realize they are gone we just sit in a sideways party together.\n\n2.  Stock is sideways to split.  Google says a stock split is neutral so nobody panics.  Inside their corner offices, V and BRK are shitting their pants.  What if retail doesn't show.  Trump might try to push off the elections and deploy BORTAC to quell transgender bathroom users in Arizona.  Retail is too busy with other shit to get a rise out of AAPL.  Once the split happens, AVD and BRK GTFO as the newest WSB boys show up to YOLO 5DTE $150 Calls.  Stock drops.  Theta gang has to payout $90 to own $80 stock.  Then they start selling $91 Calls, but WSB already YOLO'd.\n\n#3.  AAPL runs up like #1, but then falls like #2.  Probably something to do with AVD and BRK earning statements coming out or they need to buy a shit ton of farmland from retirees right now and don't have time to tiptoe out the back.\n\nTo me, it seems impossible that AAPL drops back sub $400.  4:1, August (4x2 month) 24 (twentieth plus fourth day).  The numerology is there.  Not going below $400.  It also seems impossible to me that we will continue to see 83% annual gains for AAPL after the retail fuck-bois drive up the post split price.  I won't get a bear tatoo, but I think this split is a sign of the smart money trying to sneak out. (I've said that like five times now.)\n\nWhat do you think?  I'm cashing out my $380/$400 spread ASAP and then going to stare deeply into a JPOW deepfake to internalize whether I'm more afraid of bagholding or gaining massive tendies ala TSLA.\n\n#**Edit** \n\nOur boy u/pavemental brought up a great point about the Stimulus checks. Goddamn AAPL is going to $120.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bl8nzPn courtesy of CNET\n\n#*Edit 2*\n\nVanguard is AVD. Looks like I'm the kind of guy that would yolo on TLSA.  \n\n#Edit 3\n\nA link for my friends. http://www.rightline.net/home/tradingsplits.html\n\n#Edit 4\n\nI/pootytang13- asks a great question:\n\n>You realize Apple continues to increase their stock buybacks? They already bought back 480 billion dollars worth. Why would they stop after the split? Why would institutions get out ??\n\n*I typed out a response, and then realized my answers were much longer than the questions. So I place them below.*\n\nAll good questions. Why does a company buy back stock? As a way to deliver rewards to investors via capital gains. Obviously they could instead pay a larger dividend, but the decision to purchase stock means the most influential investors (the ones with the real say in the company) have a preference for higher share prices over straight receipt of cash.\n\nI never implied that Apple would discontinue their buyback program. Indeed the safest place for a mountain of dollars in a inflationary environment is in a capital asset. Apple is keenly at risk as their hoard is legendary.\n\nFinally, why would the largest institutions want to pare down their AAPL holdings? We already discussed the dividend being low priority in a inflationary environment. So we can assume they aren't cashing out to swim in a pool of golden dollars. The two alternatives I posit are 1) stay vested or even double down, 2) find larger earnings elsewhere. \n\nDid you know the real growth is not in the stock market? In fact, one could say the stock market is smaller than it's ever been in terms of businesses present. The real money is in private equity. You have to know someone to get in. You have to bring real money to get in. Not our dumbass $400/share. Think BRK/A scale.\n\nPerhaps the largest institutional investigators want to draw even more retail investment into AAPL just to see big gains. Or perhaps as the real economy crashes, capital intensive shit like farms and railroad are beginning to sell for discounts. Shit we will need when people can get back to work. Maybe now is the time to slide out of the hyper-valued tech sector and pick up the actual levers of industry.\n\nOr maybe they (the influential investors) simply see the opportunity to personally gain from high share holdings.  A la Pump no dump.  Their separate business models may indirectly benefit from a high AAPL valuation. However a straight Pump implies that the valuation will pause or slowly settle to pre-pump excitement, meaning their indirect benefit must have short term goals.
