Then week of 7/13 we start to get Q2 earnings rolling in, and that's when real volatility will start to hit. Probably not a major rug pull like March, but SPY starting to test some of those sub-$300 supports, and maybe a slow bleed-out through mid-August, as company after company reports terrible Q2's that are all a total surprise because everyone suspended guidance after Q1.  Rosy outlook for Q3 (reopenings, etc) will soften the blow, but continued ramp up of virus cases & deaths will keep that optimism in check.\n\nI still think there is a high risk of a major rug pull, a strong rapid decline - but if that happens it'll be triggered by some new negative catalyst- not by the shit we already know is bad.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "This is my take too, and I also don't know what I'm talking about for the record. \n\nWhen spy was $300 I thought the market would end up getting pumped this week to cushion some selling pressure so that none of the massive amounts of 290 and 300 puts would pay out and more calls could be sold (didn't think it would get pumped that dramatically). Figure this upcoming week will be slightly upward/sideways.\n\nAs long as the market stays above $300 by 7/17 then the  options sellers do well for themselves. So I'm thinking with those shitty earnings coming in, the two to three week lag period on hospitalizations and deaths (and the July 4th weekend socialization) and no incentive to prop up the market further there's going to be a sell off near there and after (not necessarily some circuit breaker). \n\nThe Senate comes back that week I think so who knows what that will do to the markets.\n\nOnly thing I can guarantee is even if this happens exactly as written ill somehow still not profit off of it.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "You know it's a pump when Cramer comes on and tells everyone to buy before the holiday.

{"title": "DD on $NIO", "selftext": "TLDR: Any Call strike in 2021 or 2022\n\n**Detailed DD:**\n\nAlmost a penny stock till last month.\n\nIt has seen major movement in the last few weeks.\n\nThe key catalysts being:\n\n1. Getting $1B semi-govt funding and raising $485m by issuing equity: which takes away the bankruptcy fears which have been driving it down in the recent months. Enough liquidity now till 2022\n2. The actual car delivery numbers have sky rocketed in the last 3 months m-o-m and y-o-y\n\nCommon misconceptions:\n\n1. Owned by the chinese govt: No it is not owned by the Govt, the investment was by Hefei City Construction and Investment Holding. Think of it similar to the usual tax-breaks and other incentives offered by local county/state govts here, but instead of just giving free money, they are instead taking 24.1% of equity in the new entity created, and in return the province gets a premium car maker to set base and generate employment\n2. Nio like all Chinese cars is shit quality: No, based on anecdotal feedback all the Nio models are very premium with great interiors at par with Lexus. Infact in terms of premium feel of interiors and experience, Nio is heads and shoulders above Tesla's low cost plastic feel\n3. Battery swap is a deal breaker: Actually Nio cars can be charged using both a Supercharger as well as battery swap.\n\nSome strengths of Nio:\n\n1. Battery swap: It takes away the biggest risk of owning a EV vehicle. Also, the 4 minute battery swap also includes a full diagnostics run in parallel for the car. It can also upgrade systems during the swap. If there is a better generation of batteries in production the car can be upgraded to a better battery with longer miles\n2. Supercharger + Battery Swap + Call-anywhere-anytime-support-guarantee where they send a charging vehicle if stranded anywhere\n3. Premium positioning: They are positioned at the top end of luxury/premium vehicle space, and the interiors and experience is top-notch\n4. Pricing: It is high enough to provide a path to profitability, also only premium segment vehicle to qualify for govt subsidies. Tesla had to reduce its pricing in China to qualify for its base models.\n5. Technology: Self driving, AI, voice assistant hardware, 0-60 acceleration and the whole bag of tricks. Battery range and features are almost nearing Tesla\n6. Nerd Positioning: Till date NIO's cars hold the world record for fastest EV vehicles, which are not just prototypes, but real cars.\n7. Exclusive Community: The car owners don't just buy a car, they get a premium luxury community experience exclusive to NIO owners in multiple cities. Current count: 22 NIO Houses and 55 NIO Spaces in 57 cities in China\n8. Low overheads in terms of not owning huge debts and running a production site. They do all R&D and design in-house but outsource all manufacturing, just like Apple\n9. New ES8 model launch pretty successful and more exciting models coming soon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForward outlook:\n\n1. Currently gross margins are negative, projected to reach unit profitability within this year.\n2. It may or may not become a $100 Billion company, but certainly enough juice to stay in the race and go upwards\n\nRisk issues:\n\n1. Accounting frauds or shady stuff unearthed in the future at some time or the other. After Luckin Coffee etc, one can never be sure.\n2. Falling out with the manufacturing partner\n3.

This GA could fit inside the building that it fits in because it was specifically designed for it by Tesla. This helped them achieve \\~35 gross margin. No other automaker can just \"copy\" another GA. They would need to build the exact same building roughly, manage to copy the exact same GA, figure out a way to get third-rate suppliers to produce exactly the same inventory Tesla is able to procure from first-rate suppliers. This is not like copying to make toasters, there is infinite more complexity involved. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Tesla's OS ](https://preview.redd.it/pf9dld5kdp851.png?width=319&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3e4fddd39e5a1fc4f312260f6a71e79c36d7667)\n\n[ Tesla's HW3 computer that can run only Tesla software because it checks physically for electronic PGP keys ](https://preview.redd.it/n4zhz1vldp851.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d6fab9e17b3ef5ae49c58ba906c9bbc6d3c1489)\n\n**Point 2)** Please bring your attention to the software which gives Tesla its supreme performance and excitement. Why has China not been able to copy iOS and put it in their local phones? This question almost seems too dumb to ask but this is what you should be asking. Tesla's software is pushed from California, electronically signed and authenticated via Tesla's servers. Soon Tesla will have their own App Store like iOS. Chinese automakers can't just \"copy it\". On top of this fact, recall how iOS runs on Apple's custom chips. This is similar to Tesla. Since last year, all Tesla software is designed specifically to run on their custom computer. Traditional autos can't just \"copy\" just like they can't copy iPhone chips or Intel processors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Tesla 2170 cells \\(soon these will be only used for energy products, because Tesla is likely to announce in-house cell development on Battery Day in September for their vehicles\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/01fzx2hrdp851.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=718b59203377c6c15d5542df9b3044dbcc9c31a9)\n\n**Point 3)** It's all about the batteries. Currently Tesla is the largest consumer of batteries in the world and even they're cell constrained not demand constrained. They cannot get the top tier battery manufacturers to produce top quality batteries fast enough. This is why you've been reading the news of partnerships with CATL, Panasonic, and LG Chem.

This likely means they could replicate it.\n\n2) The OS/AI in the vehicle and the head unit that supports it are probably the easiest thing for China to recreate, as they have significant embedded hardware, computer vision, and AI expertise. This all supposed they can't/haven't already stolen most or all of the Tesla OS codebase (looots of Chinese nationals working at Tesla corporate, spies are likely embedded already). They could also probably reverse engineer the more esoteric bits of the code from the binaries that live at their electronics assembly houses in China, given enough time.\n\n3) I'm not sure where you've been for the last 40 years, but the Chinese are tool and die/indistrial chemistry masters at this point in time. Literally the only limiting factors for them on the battery front are not being able to steal the latest and greatest battery chemistry (unlikely), and not being able to source the minerals. If they can keep a good supply of cobalt coming in from Indonesia/Africa (China has a fuckload of Lithium already), there is no reason they couldn't light up sufficient battery capacity for half a million vehicles annually inside of 24 months, if the government/central bank decided to back the venture.\n\nSorry bruh, but you don't know as much as you think you do about how China rolls.\n\nEdit: Apparently the new long-life NiMnCo chemistry shit is CATL already, meaning the biggest, most Chinese battery company has the best chemistry and infinite money cheats to drive global market dominance. The ONLY chance Tesla has at this point is to be able to suck Beijing's dick harder and with more gusto than a Chinese company can.
