But I was never an insider of any kind. I thought at the time that he was a bit socially awkward, but I never really perceived him as evil.\n\nMicrosoft vs. Apple was, in the end, the only significant OS battle, and I remember using both in my university computer lab. From the very beginning, even under Windows DOS, I felt Apple, while definitely prettier and even easier to use, was too opaque and too limiting, so I came down on the side of Windows (as did most of the world). In the end, Microsoft saved Apple from bankruptcy, just to preserve the illusion that it wasn't a monopoly. I guess that was kind of asshole-like.\n\nEnter the Internet, followed quickly by the browser wars. I think this is where Microsoft/Gates is mostly considered an asshole. But my recollection of it is that you had a bunch of competing browsers, Netscape chief among them. But the notion was that these would be, in today's parlance, paid apps. I personally was happy when Microsoft integrated Internet Explorer into its operating system because I was poor as fuck and did not want to have to pay for a bunch of different programs each of which did only one thing. Further, I had used Netscape a lot and thought it was shitty.\n\nWindows never prevented anyone from downloading and installing Netscape. Many of my friends preferred it over Internet Explorer. I did not (OK, call me dumb). It is true that they effectively made sure Netscape (and other browser developers) could not make any money by selling their browser, and that is kind of assholish given that those guys had spent a lot of time and effort putting that program together. There is a lot I don't know about this, so please forgive me if I am totally off base here. Educate me as gently as possible please, as I am thin-skinned as hell and take everything personally, but I am always open to learning.\n\nBut even early \"asshole\" Gates built an overall open environment that promoted a multitude of software and hardware industries that thrived and facilitated the evolution of modern computing. Browser development continued apace. I'm on Firefox right now, not IE. I just switched back to Windows from Linux because for the things I use my computer for, Linux is just too clunky. Because of the open nature of Windows, motherboards evolved and got better. Video cards, sound cards and many other hardware innovations from many companies got to have their day. If Apple had won the OS war, computing today would be 20 years more primitive.\n\nSome people believe Gates was an asshole back in the day, and the truth is, I didn't know him and have no idea. I did not see him that way at all. He was a shrewd businessman, no doubt, and perhaps even ruthless. But even today, if you take the time to figure it out, you can run a huge variety of hardware on Windows 10 and you can do it with as much privacy as you desire using whatever \"apps\" you think are best. It took me about 10 minutes after reinstalling Windows 10 to get rid of all the intrusive shit I didn't want, and I hope dearly that \"God Mode\" will still work after they eviscerate Control Panel! I think the person who built an OS that facilitated the rapid evolution of both software and hardware for computer systems by a massive number of extraneous companies is the same person Bill Gates is today.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Am a developer, still don‚Äôt prefer a Mac.

My understanding is that Apple is much preferred by animators and by people who produce live music events because apparently, there are some timegap issues in live performances in Apple versus Microsoft. \n\nThank God, Gates saved Apple from itself back in those early days. The idiot who ran Apple, the guy, who had a great sense of style,  who killed himself by trusting homeopathy rather than medicine, had a lucky day.\n\nAs for Unix, I am only generally aware of its role in things, though I know it is vitally important in some very fundamental aspects of scientific computing. I have never seen it as a competitor in the commercial, personal computing space. I wish people (and myself) knew more about it. \n\nMy comment about Linux was heartfelt. I wish so much that it was more flexible and robust than it is. I tried it for a year, but I do a lot of mundane shit like renaming files and dealing with meta-data on those files. God, it is so pathetic in those particular areas. I mean you have to do one file at a time (unless you are a command line aficionado), when Windows can easily do folders or even groups of folders including thousands of individual files all with one click. Perhaps there is a command-line option that could replicate Windows if you are clever enough, but as I said, I'm not, at heart, a technical guy.\n\nThe truth is, I am an idiot about all this and my comment was only intended to respond to the claim that Gates was an asshole.

What would you pick?\n\n5x $SPCE $20c 8/14, about $285 each: they're announcing the cabin design and some retards here have me dreaming that it will go to 30 again.\n\n1x $TSLA $2000c 7/31, about $58.50: because why the hell not. Is it likely to hit 2k? No. Will it make money? Maybe.\n\n5x $CHGG $90c 8/21, about $2.95 each: everyone is going to be distance learning, undergraduates are dishonest little shits, I hear Chegg is great for cheating.\n\n5x $EBAY $62c 7/31, about $2.13 each. Not really sure what's going on with eBay but I see a lot of cocky fuxkers on here hopping this play. I guess they are transitioning from an auction site to a cross between Amazon and Alibaba and thus will stonk bigly?\n\n5x $PTON $80c 8/21, about $3.95 each. I find this company anmoying but if they're really diversifying to treadmills and other fitness stuff then they will make bank off rich homebound professionals, since everyone with a $$ job is WFH well into 2021.\n\nAdvice welcome but forget that puts stuff, I'm a real man\n\nEDIT 7/12: I now have 69 notifications from this thread.

{"title": "DD from a post of mine 2 weeks ago. VIX 70 calls 08/22", "selftext": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgeyf9/weekend\\_discussion\\_thread\\_for\\_the\\_weekend\\_of\\_june/fw7tu1m?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgeyf9/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of_june/fw7tu1m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nComment was made 2 weeks ago and so far it's panning out exactly as planned. I'm calling the top this week (7/12) or the next as mentioned in the original comment. The behavior of TSLA and others during the past week has all the hallmarks of the start of a blown off top. Here's the original text:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\n40 contracts on VIX 70c 08/22\n\nI usually get call contracts for VIX as a hedge. Last time paid off handsomely as it coincided with dklev's post.\n\nI am seeing the same behavior and decided to re-enter the position at $0.8 per contract. In my opinion here are the following catalysts for VIX potentially breaching $80\n\n1. EU ban on American travel including Business starting on July 1st.\n2. Inevitable lockdown measures from Florida and Texas. Death rate is not yet high because both states still have ICU beds. That will change in the next 10 days after which, unfortunately, the death rate will spike in those states.\n3. New stimulus check will not pass until we get a few red days. Internally, the GOP is facing an existential crisis. There are MANY members who oppose continuing the $600/week or the $1200 round 2. But they will change their mind with a 15-20% drop on SPY.\n4. NIKE earnings. This is much bigger than people realize and I honestly think this will be one of the main catalysts. NIKE showed that the USA is completely halted sale-wise but also that the REST of the world including the countries that are already on post-covid reality. Spending habits have changed, perhaps for the foreseeable retail future and Q2 earnings will bring a barrage of bad news plus very conservative guidance (if any at all)\n5. RH/Day trader/Home trader: this is exactly the same thing that happened in 2000. After record spending in IT many IT contractors found themselves at home with spare cash to spend and all of a sudden considering day trading as a serious full time job. With a \"stonks only up\" market many proceeded to make serious $$$ while making fun of Buffett, Wall St, etc. But eventually the lack of full time job and inevitable market slowdown required people to take profits and this happens at a time where earnings were just starting to get really sour. Well, the same exact thing is happening now. The last unemployment checks will come on July 26th. People are already curtailing their spending very aggressively. RH traders that are beating the market handsomely will keep doing it until the first serious red days (i.e. when a major player like AAPL or similar reports a big drop - same like in 2000s when AMZN reported lackluster quarter). The lack of discipline combined with the diamond hands effect will drive this market into the ground. Fundamentals will get it going but RH/home traders will drive it into overdrive just like in the turn of the century. I believe this will happen within the next 2 month time frame.\n\nTLDR: I'm calling rally market top in the 2nd or 3rd of week of July followed by maybe 1-2 days of blown top (i.e. major green day) and then the inevitable deleveraging.\n\nVIX 70c 08/22\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------EDIT: Note the additional items:\n\n\\-> Florida just recorded 15k cases a nearly 40% jump in a single day.\n\n\\-> Houston beds completely at capacity and many others as well\n\n\\-> Multiple comments from Senate members that any additional stimulus (if passed) will be lower than $600 a week\n\n\\-> Death rate 2 weeks ago was 300/day now around 900/day.
