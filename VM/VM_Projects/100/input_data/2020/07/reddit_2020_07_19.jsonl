{"title": "Unusual option activity and interesting bets placed in AMZN, BABA, BX, ESTC, HD, HUYA, MAR", "selftext": "I took a deeper look into the unusual option flow from this week and found a few interesting plays. Let’s take a look, shall we?\n\nFor those that want to scan for options activity, you can check out [options flow scanner](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) here.\n\n**AMZN – Amazon Inc**\n\nA player opened a $47 million dollar bet, short straddle, in AMZN last week. They sold to open 1,000 of each PUT and CALL September 18 contracts at the $3015 strike price to collect a total of $47 million in premium. The player stays profitable if AMZN stays in between a price range of $2,500-$3,500. The closer AMZN stays at $3,000 price after earnings, the morning money the player will keep. This bet looks like they aren’t expecting earnings to move Amazon that much and are trying to capitalize on the premiums from high volatility at the moment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmbnwrr56ub51.png?width=2748&format=png&auto=webp&s=420e1478e6b022c772abff830931d340b525ccf3\n\n**BABA – Baba Holdings**\n\nBig call buyer in BABA last week. Player opened a $55 million dollar position with 18,000 contracts in August 21 CALLs. BABA had a good run up recently, but has dropped slightly since reaching all-time-highs not long ago. This bet is suggesting the player expects for the stock to have another pop in the short-term.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrl1ltw86ub51.png?width=2742&format=png&auto=webp&s=32b6ecf1906977d7278a9f3bba8b21a818c0056a\n\n**HUYA – Huya Inc**\n\nAnother Chinese stock in play was HUYA. This stock doesn’t normally see a whole lot of unusual options activity, so this trade stood out quite a bit. A player purchased 2,500 CALL contracts at 9% OTM with an expiration in October, 2020. This is a pretty directional bet with a high risk factor due to how far OTM the position is. The position is valued at about $600k and they are expecting the stock to rise over the next 3 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl4uephc6ub51.png?width=2904&format=png&auto=webp&s=3782ddef867094efb31c2641458621ba18e43801\n\n**ESTC – Elastic**\n\nPlayer opened a long position that expires August 21, before the earnings reports for ESTC. ESTC is a cloud/software/SAAS platform, perhaps they are expecting the stock to rise as other tech companies report solid earnings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmkao1ne6ub51.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a529cfbece8d4794fdfa767f2696fe5bf20e3a1\n\n**HD – Home Depot**\n\nSaw some high call volume in HD on Friday. Total value of call positions was about $25 million on Friday where as a typical day for HD option volume is approximately 2-5 million daily. Biggest plays were both for August 21 calls at the 200 and 220 strikes with values of $18 million and $6 million, respectively. HD reports earnings August 18. The player is expecting the stock to have a good run up before earnings as expectations are high for a good quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gqpypfyg6ub51.png?width=2742&format=png&auto=webp&s=50ed4f7a72e5a25cd82e606ac7ff1c728ce73d42\n\n**MAR – Marriott**\n\nMarriott has been seeing some bullish flow recently. Some positions that caught my eye were multiple positions of players selling PUTs. These could potentially be another leg of a bigger position, but it seems like the player is expecting MAR to have hit a bottom. As long as MAR stays above $85 (now $91) in the short-term then both players will realize maximum profit from their position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vmz531bk6ub51.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0b5fe34f86d66941c574c9f32fa2f6fe53750b1\n\n**MRNA – Moderna**\n\nEveryone knows the news of the MRNA vaccine. On Friday, players continued to buy into strength expecting the stock to continue it’s rise up over the next several months. $90 million in calls were purchased on Friday, most positions were relatively far OTM, which shows confidence in the bet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tbix795n6ub51.png?width=2748&format=png&auto=webp&s=46837f18fe672a9b173a34341ff532d31819b820", "id": "hu2rud", "created_utc": 1595174330.0, "score": 935, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for that.

''Creatively, once you have advertisers in there, they think they have a voice. We'll stay the way we are.''\n\nAlso:\n\n>Precisely what impact advertising will have on cable programming is difficult to predict. Many cable channels have yet to begin operating, and those now running commercials, such as Ted Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network or U.S.A. Network's ''You'' program for women, carry 30-second and one-minute commercials that are a standard feature of regular television. Promotional announcements for other cable programming often appear to outnumber paid advertisements.\n\n>But there are indications that commercials, when they begin surfacing on cable, will not intrude as objectionably as they do on conventional television. For one thing, cable's content now leans more toward informational programming than toward drama or even situation comedies. As Mr. Dann says, ''Cable is closer to Good Housekeeping magazine than to 'Mork and Mindy.' '' Thus, industry members agree, there are likely to be fewer of the ersatz cliffhangers that are routinely written into television dramas to sustain suspense during commercials.\n\nTLDR:\n\n>But even the keenest cable industry advocate would have to concede that cable operators, program suppliers, advertisers and advertising agencies stand to gain more from cable advertising than viewers do.

Imagine the FAT company who currently has the initial owner and a few (thousand) employees. Their total share count is 1,000,000. The initial owner has 80% of the shares and the rest of the employees share the 20%. If they want to raise money, they ISSUE NEW SHARES. \n\n\nInvestment bankers then determine a valuation for the company, lets say $25m. Therefore, each share is worth $25. If the company wants to raise $5m, they would need to create 200,000 new shares and convince someone to buy them ('the open market'). Success! They do it.\n\nNOW, the company has a total of 1,200,000 shares, the owner still has 800,000, the employees 200,000, and these new owners from the market own 200,000. The price is still $25/share, and the company is now worth $30m (until the share price fluctuates). The company was worth $25m, but they now have $5m in cash from the issuance of new stock, which is why they are now worth more (Same $25m + new $5m cash = $30m total, OR, 1m shares *25 + 200k shares *25 = 1.2m * 25 = $30m total).\n\n\nSo to get to your question, how do investment firms invest into COMPANIES (because stock/shares/etc. is just partial ownership of a company). They SOMETIMES by on the market, but usually not, and when they do, they often do it through derivatives (like an option). \n\n\nBut more often, they buy those new shares, the IPO shares. Warren Buffett, for instance, often negotiates a new class of stock, Preferred Stock, where he is paid a dividend. He likely negoatiates further, and wants convertability to be a part of it, where he can share in the upside if the company does exceedingly well. \n\n\nInvestment firms like BRK have trouble investing because they need to make such large purchases. Anything under $100m for BRK is nearly a waste of time, and everything above that amount is more highly scrutinized. It is easy to buy a mom-and-pop shop for pennies on the dollar, but much more difficult to buy coca-cola.\n\n\nBerkshire Hathway, and Icahn Enterprises, etc. (though I much prefer BRK...), operate similarly to a Private Equity fund. They find more unique deals, and because they are the 900lb Gorilla, are able to throw their weight around. When Goldman Sachs may have gone under, they ISSUED NEW SHARES to BRK so that they could raise money and stay afloat.\n\n\nDoes this help? I am happy to answer other questions you have...

{"title": "Walmart+ thoughts", "selftext": "So everyone is wondering about the new WMT+ model, revenue, and profit potential. I did some research and want to share it with you retards in hopes we can all make some tendies. Here goes nothing.\n\nJeffries analyst Christopher Mandeville said -  \"1Q21 was downright impressive as WMT's superior omnichannel approach to catering to the consumer on their terms shone brightly, with outsize comps helping to offset ... COVID costs,\" he said in a May 19 research note. \"Given consistent market share gains, further evidence of a sustainable productivity loop, a strong financial positioning, and future e-commerce profitability enhancements to pair with already advanced omnichannel capabilities, we continue to view WMT as a core long-term holding.\"\n\nAlso, I don't know if you've heard about WMTs Data Café, but it's kinda insane. They pull data from 200 sources like meteorology, Nielson, Telecom, Econ data ect, and almost 200 billions rows of customer transactional data every few weeks, 2.5 petabytes an hour. They analyze all of this to make product placemt/pricing decisions across all 8k stores. This allows on the spot shifts, instead of monthly/weekly sales reviews. So allow E-commerce WMT+ access to this data, and you've got amazon level targeted ads and products. \n\n\"Walmart plans to save $60 million/year on shopping bags alone.\" -random quote about WMT+\n\nThat being said, have you ever met anyone or heard any one say they were \"really frustrated with Prime?\" I think WMT+ could help offset e-commerce costs to the consumer but wonder if those consumers would drop their Prime membership for the $20 savings, much less carry both.\n\nScott Galloway, Professor at NYU Stern, had the following to say about the new strategy:\n\n\"The most accretive action taken by any $10 billion or larger business is to move from a transactional model to recurring revenue. This exploits one of the fundamental flaws of our species, the inability to register time. Time flies — it goes faster than our estimated consumption of a product during a given time period. Only 18% of gym members go to the gym consistently. \n\nIn addition, the markets are a reflection of ourselves, and humans hate uncertainty. Waking up next to a stranger is exciting in the short run but exhausting in the long (see above: recurring revenue). Walmart interacts with American families transactionally, while Amazon lives in 82% of their homes. That could begin to shift with Walmart+.\"\n\nAs someone who long has advocated for subscription and auto-replenishment services that allow retailers to effectively compete with Amazon's Subscribe & Save, I totally agree with this but the keyword in Galloway's analysis is \"could.\"  Saying it and doing it are different things.\n\nSo since 2016, Walmart’s online sales are up 78%. Walmart’s online sales are also now growing twice as fast as Amazon’s. Walmart is already the world’s third-largest online store. \n\nAnother benefit to the costs associated with going online is warehouse space, which walmart has a lot of. They are using their stores as warehousing space for online sales, which is brilliant. Their distribution network is already set up, they already have storage, and delivery speed can be ramped up at lower extra costs because of this. That means Walmart will soon have the biggest and most effective “shipping network” in America. By the end of the year, Walmart plans to deliver stuff from 1,600 stores. For comparison, Amazon has only 110 warehouses across the US. And they can get this done, like I said, at little to no additional cost. \n\n8/10 americans also live within 5-10 miles of a Walmart physical store, reducing shipping costs, which are the most cost intensive part of the e-commerce space. That means they are already beating amazon on profit margins for their service.\n\nThis turns into possible billions in savings. \n\nI also like to look at the P/E for AMZN(2963.55) and WMT(131.77) which is 143 and 25 respectively. With so much room to grow, and WMT trading at .04% of this price of AMZN, I think it's a no brainier that there is almost unlimited potential upside to this stock.\n\nNow getting the customers to use the service will be the hardest part, potentially garnering new/existing customers and stealing some from Amazon. But I think having physical locations as well as online services gives people the day to day access they need for \"right now products\" and the easy of comfort of the \"need it soon/later/recurring deliveries products.\" This is a major advantage over AMZN, because customers can choose to drive to a store, or have something shipped depending on their needs and wants. \n\nLast thing to mention, COVID economic security is built in to this new program. No matter how long it lasts, americans will always feel more safe getting things delivered, and same day grocery is going to slay down the competition like nobody knows. Could be a potentially huge upside to this stock. \n\nTLDR; Buy WMT hold long term. Not sure about short term, but I think profit potential could be huge.

I want to keep this simple, so no dad jokes, no chad robots from the future this time\n\nSPY is about to move spectacularly, and I want to tell you my thinking as to why.\n\nFirst, look at this chart. I stole this from some twitter dude.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DZ7Z6T8.png\n\nIn this chart are 3 corrections.  You'll notice the behavior of the market here, initial drop, a rally back to the gap down at the beginning of the crash, a double tap, and then the real deal.\n\nLook at where we are today.  If you've been wondering why VIX has fucking died, or if you're wondering why we bounced the fuck off this price on June 8th, or why we've been flat as a pancake lately, well, now you know.  We're retesting the feb gap, we've done it twice now.  The show is about to start.\n\nThe thing is, this looks for all the world like an \"ascending triangle\" if you're not looking far enough back in the charts.\n\nThoughts to chew on.\n\nThere is tremendous upward pressure on the market right now, even to the extent that we can throw PE out the window.  FED has been wrecking confidence in the dollar with BRRRR, savings rates are insulting, real estate looks like a decent place to keep your money at first, but it's not liquid and 30% of people are in delinquency.  That alone is reason to put money in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, investors are forced to ask a very real question right now, is the economy in a better place than it was in feb? Can they justify these valuations?\n\nPredictions:\n\nA. The last phase of the bubble.  In this scenario, PE is completely abandoned, SPY goes vertical.\n\nB. We follow the pattern of recent corrections.  And if history is any guide, this low will be lower than march.
