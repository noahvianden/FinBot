Buying call debit spreads is how I started too. I've learned that there is a better way to place this exact same trade though. \n\nA put credit spread sounds like the opposite, but it's actually get similar bias wise. So, imagine being the person who bought/sold you those calls. They have $5000 held for collateral and are hoping your contacts expire worthless so that not of it is used, but they get to keep your premium. So buy selling a call spread  you are being for the stock to go down below the lower strike. Now imagine it's puts instead, puts are opposite of calls and so you would be being that the stock price will be above the higher put strike. \n\nWhy would we want to do this? Because option prices decay over time. When buying options, you have to be right about the movement, but you also have to be right about WHEN it will move. If you sold the option though, and are eventually going to buy it back to close the spread, the time decay works in your favor. \n\nAdded perks: \nPuts usually are more expensive, and you're selling them, so that's good. \nYou have to lock up collateral but you take in credit to offset a good amount of that immediately. \n\nThe only con I can think of is that the collateral requirement in selling a spread tends to lock up more money than buying the spread. In my experience your increased chance of actually turning a profit, mostly due to time decay (theta), more than makes up for the extra up front capital.\n\nYou'd think you would lose more per trade this way, I did too. But when you set them up correctly, high probably debit spreads cost more per profit potential, if that makes sense. \n\nPro tip: selling a single credit spread is alright, but you can sell the opposite spread on the other side of the stock price using the same collateral because only one can possible lose at one time.

But I would say mostly age 50 to 70. Deaths have dropped a lot each week since this began as our docs learn what meds work best, what pathways work best for each patient (like maybe choice of vent/no vent for example), but elderly patients still don't fare well (80+). But yea I've been surprised but how many 40 and 50 year olds end up in extremely critical condition with it. From what I've seen the 20-40 year olds who get it bad enough to need to come in don't usually escalate to critical care. They feel like dog shit and they look like it too, but after a few days of it they're good to go. The first few weeks were the scariest by far, I had two ladies in early forties who were otherwise fairly healthy die from it. So people need to realize, yes your chances of survival are very high if you are under like 70, but that doesn't mean it can't happen to you. It had me and still has me very worried for my mother who is older than both of them and works in the school system. That's another thing I can speak to, as I work in cardiology: kids going back to school in America right now is an awful idea. The extremely small percentage of kids who are dying from COVID are dying because of an issue with dilation of their coronary arteries, which is something that doesn't cause many symptoms and to my knowledge you would need an echo to truly know or not. Kids could be developing that for several days and you not even know it. Schools are gonna be breeding grounds for COVID. I hope that enough people have had it that we slowly form herd immunity, but the truth is no one really knows.\n\nThe other thing people need to consider. This virus is less than a year old, we don't have any earthly clue what all things it causes. It could be no other new things, it could be dozens. When HIV/AIDS first hit no one knew how it was spread, what all it caused and we didn't know for several years. Again in cardiology, I would use the example of rheumatic fever. Which back when it was a big thing, it just caused kind of a flu like issue. Years later it's found that for several people it causes deterioration of the mitral valve leaflets, which can be life threatening if went unknown and untreated over the years, which it often was. Many of them need valve replacements which is often equals a lifelong change in quality of life when blood thinners are needed. \n\nThis is complicated, because as a whole you can't just shut down and never do business until a vaccine is widely administered, but you also CANT HAVE YOUR POPULATION SPREADING MISINFORMATION, REFUSING TO WEAR MASKS OR OTHER THINGS TO SLOW SPREAD AND ACTING LIKE IT'S NOT A DEAL AT ALL.

On top of that, we still are limiting full amount of non COVID patient outflows, so as a whole, it makes sense that the percentage of patients in our hospital who have covid is extremely higher than the amount of people in the general public who have it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Why are over 90% of hospitals in the US furloughing doctor's then?", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "The fact you ask this question, means you don't work in the field or haven't done enough critical thinking or reading to fully comprehend it. Which is fine, mind you, not everyone should know everything about everything. But don't act like you know what the fuck you're talking about.\n\nI can't speak for all countries, but in America COVID hit the hardest in early March. This wasn't true for every state at first, but it was true for my hospital in Indiana. We had a sudden influx of COVID patients, a lot of whom were in critical condition and escalating quickly. I remember the first week the plan was to dedicate around 60 beds of a unit for covid only patients, that lasted only the first week. Then we dedicated another 40, few days later another area, then a week or so later another unit. We were up to like 200 covid only beds in a hospital that's only around 4-500 beds total. Around May we started to see a slow steady decrease in the number of new covids, and a decrease in how severe their condition got. The latter being likely a result of staff now knowing what medicines and pathways to treat these patients after having experience with it for a few weeks. We've had far less covid patients dying percentage wise.\n\nAnyway, throughout that March to like early June period, our hospital and from what I hear most hospitals in USA, closed 99% of outpatient testing down. Outpatient testing is a huge part of business. For example I'll give you a perspective from my world of cardiology. A patient comes into our adjoined outpatient building for an echocardiogram, which in and of itself is a small charge. If everything looked great then that's a small profit made there. If patient had an issue with a valve, they would typically then come in for outpatient TEE to evaluate true severity and need for surgical intervention, another profit there. If surgery is needed then they come in as outpatient for several weeks to do the actual surgery, then a couple days of intensive care during that immediate healing stage, then a week or so of impatient cardiac rehab, more testing to make sure everything looks good before discharge. So much staff is involved in that patients process: echo techs, reading cardiologist, surgeons and their nurses and techs, ICU nurses, x-ray techs, CT techs sometimes, rehab techs, cleaning staff, any docs who need to see that patient while they are there who aren't directly related to the valve replacement, like maybe a diabetes doctor or kidney doctor. All of that staff is now not doing these jobs, because we don't get to see that patient come in for the outpatient echo to begin with and get that process started. The hospital is losing money every day, by having to not allow outpatients and by having to limit how much care inpatients are getting in an interest to slow the spread and protect workers.\n\n The only staff who are busier or as busy as they were pre covid, are the staff directly involved in covid patient care. Not every doc has the credentials and skills to care for them, same for nurses. Those staff are often forced to use PTO, some cases file for unemployment, etc. If you were that cardiac rehab tech aforementioned, your patient workload went to like ten percent of what it was. A manager doesn't need six rehab techs right now, they need two. Then the staff who can work with intensive covid patients are overworked and mentally exhausted. Having to be paid overtime by the hospital, more money lost for hospital.\n\nSo as you can see from this one small example, of which there are dozens I can make from many different affected staff and fields: business is overly busy on the covid side, but because of need to reserve resources for potential covid patients, the hospital is losing money on almost everything non covid related. Budget cuts will have to be made, many have had furloughs as you said. But you're missing the point. The furloughs are happening to people who can no longer do their job and theyre happening because the hospital has to limit losses right now. \n\nSo doctors furloughed doesn't not equal covid is gone. In fact as you can see, the severity of covid caused the need for those furloughs.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You seem to know quite a bit so explain why hospitals are putting people on ventilators that don't need to be and then subsequently dying because of it. Is it because they are receiving (and not disclosing mind you) $39,000 per patient that they place on a ventilator? \n\nThe data doesn't coincide with what you are saying. COVID has less than a 1% death rate for anybody below the age of 50. I'm sure it is even less when you factor out those without any pre-existing conditions (i.e. obesity) or those who were labeled \"COVID\" deaths, but died of other causes while testing positive from COVID (i.e. getting shot in the head) or \"coughing\" while in hospice and then dying WITHOUT testing positive.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Im not a respiratory or ICU doc, nor an RT, so I can only give you my understanding of it. For the first few weeks resp docs were throwing a lot of people on vents pretty quick, but from what I've seen that has decreased significantly since then. I can think of several reasons for that. The biggest being that vents can kind of be thought of as a safety switch you can flip when you're worried a patient is at the point of dying from related issues. It's a move you make to sacrifice some other things in order to just keep the human alive long enough to figure out how best to treat them. So in early March docs were unexperienced with best way to treat the average ICU COVID pt and were also suddenly flooded with more any more of those patients. The easiest thing to do in interest of keeping people alive was to put them on vent if even remotely needed. So you can see why and how that could happen where at first vents were used and needed like crazy. Now with that said, for some diseases and disease processes, vents can do more harm than good for a lot of patients and their long term prognosis and COVID has looked like one of those diseases. Here I've seen a dramatic decrease in the number of COVID patients on vents. Again the reason why is multi faceted. We know what drugs work best for different stages of the disease which keeps some COVIDs  from progressing as far, we have cross trained some capable nurses/PAs/NPs to be able to help out a bit on patient load letting docs spend more time on the more critical COVIDs, we know that with COVID the longer a patient is on the vent the more likely they are to crash coming off the vent which leads us to not leave them on a second longer than needed. \n\nBtw, this whole getting shot in the head but being counted as a COVID death seems nothing more than political minded talking head bull shit and when I talk to people in the actual know, they tell me it is as well. I'm more likely to take the word of the people actually responsible for reporting these things than a Facebook post or a talking head on Fox News. So do with that what you will.\n\nIt is very easy in life, especially nowadays, to assume the worst of someone when presented with an issue. To assume that everyone must be out to make a buck somehow, that everyone must be faking numbers for X reason, so on and so forth. The people caring for these patients and reporting numbers and so on are normal Joe schmo's like you and me. It is true that hospitals are reimbursed an amount per covid patient, or at least it was for a time, I'm not sure if it still is. But as we discussed earlier, hospitals are losing money hand over fist right now, there's a reason they're being paid that money. Could that lead a hospital to claim more cases than they truly have? I'm sure some hospital somewhere has done so, sure. Does than mean all of them or even a handful are doing that? No. \n\nAlso, who gives a flying fuck whether the person dying from COVID has diabetes or other comorbidities. They are humans, who are dying, what's hard to grasp about that?

People can be fifty pounds overweight and turn their life around, you see it everyday here on subreddits like OMAD, intermittent fasting, fitness, LoseIt, etc. My wife who had been a normal weight her entire life had our child, had post partum depression and developed an eating disorder. She got up to around 90 lbs overweight in a surprisingly quick amount of time. She's now lost 70-75lbs in 18 months through eating disorder counseling, counting macros and routine exercise. Did she deserve to die last year while she was obese? Its very easy to get overweight, especially in America. We should not praise people for being overweight, for being \"comfy in their own skin\". My wife would be the first one to tell you that. We need a change in the overall public shift of eating, counting calories, exercise and not praising those who are overweight. But there are nuances to it. If more people learn how to talk to those who are overweight in a way that will help motivate them without intensely condemning them, we will see progress.

Tesla's liquidated market cap would be worth slightly more than the entire economic output of the Roman Empire between 1-5 A.D.\n\n**2) The entire US airline industry ($134 billion):** Taking the market cap of all US flag carriers combined, Tesla still has the industry beat by over $110 billion.\n\n**3) The GDP of the Czech Republic ($245 billion):** This central European country has more castles than any other country in Europe and the highest beer consumption per capita. Tesla's market cap literally exceeds the entire value of all goods and services produced in the Czech Republic each year.\n\n**4) Jeff Bezos ($166 billion) and Warren Buffett ($71 billion):** Papa Bezos and the Oracle of Omaha together come up short of Tesla's market cap by about $18 billion. They could not buy Tesla even if they dumped their combined entire net worth into it.\n\n**5) The world's entire supply of silver ($60 billion):** Tesla is worth more than 4x all of the silver that the entire world has ever dug out of the ground based on July 2020's spot price.\n\n**6) All MLB ($55.5 billion), NFL ($84.5), NBA ($60.5), NHL ($19.5) and MLS ($11 lol) Franchises:** All franchises in top 5 biggest sports in the US are worth a combined $231 billion. If liquidated, Telsa's market cap could buy all of the baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and soccer teams in the US and still have $23 billion left over.\n\n**7) The total value of all milk produced across the world in 1 year ($250 billion):** The world produces about 580 million metric tons of cow milk each year. As of July 2020, the spot price of milk is about $20.40/[cwt.sh](http://cwt.sh/) (45.36 Kg). Do the math, and the world's output of milk is about equal to the market cap of Tesla.\n\n**8) The approximate value of human blood plasma in the US ($193 billion):** I love selling blood plasma and getting about $40 for 0.6 liters. But interestingly, the spot price of raw plasma is actually about $200/liter. The human body has about 3 liters of plasma, on average. With a population of about 323 million, the US should have just under 1 billion liters of blood plasma in it. Do the math, and Tesla beats this $193 billion worth of plasma by more than $50 billion.\n\n**9) Final Soviet Union military budget ($200 billion):** In 1989, the USSR spent approximately $200 billion funding their military. Adjusted for today's dollars, this is closer to $400 billion. But Tesla's market cap liquidated could have presumably sustained the USSR's military for a year and several months in 1989.\n\n**10) Combined GDP of all the countries of Oceania except Australia ($231 billion):** Oceania is made up of 14 island countries including Australia, New Zealand, and smaller nations like Vanuatu, Tuvalu, and Papua New Guinea. Taking Australia's $1.2 trillion dollar GDP out of calculation, Tesla's liquidated market cap could buy all goods and services produced in the remaining island nations for an entire year.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla is undervalued.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "ha ha hey", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "people buy Tsla because they know Daddy musk has the ability to literally get funding from Kim Jon un himself.

The 21c are about 20 cents otm and have a small bid ask spread of 0.35-0.40. \n\nThe cost of these premiums in relationship to their closeness to being itm is an absolute no brainer. The charts are telling us the USD is headed to the lowest levels we've seen in a decade and you could be holding call options that are $3-4 in the money by December that you paid 15 cents for. \n\nFull disclosure I own 100 contracts at 0.17, expiring Dec 20th 2020. I will roll these contracts to March depending on the outlook between now and then.\n\nI am not a financial expert this is not financial advise I am a retard. Thank you for reading.\n\nUpdate 7/27: I opened a position of 300 contracts on UUP 25p for 8/21 that I purchased for 15 cents and I am down 13% on that position. My UDN 22c are up 42% at market close. Current premium 25 cents I entered at 17. Unfortunately my entry points on both were a bit higher than they should have been but I expect returns in the 200-400% percentile range so it's no big deal if you get in a bit high. UUP 3y chart looks extremely bearish and UDN conversely looks bullish.\n\nEdit: 7/29 after a rally in the USD and some growing pains, UUP is dumping and UDN is climbing again. DXY looks primed to break under its 2 year low and today UDN showed up on an unusual options activity scanner with a call volume increase of 350%.", "id": "hx3ilj", "created_utc": 1595603589.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Calls on single loaves of bread.", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Ticker please", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I tried to think of a smartass reply but I’m not good at thinking.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "$BRD", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "$RYE", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Better", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$BUNS?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "$D'OH", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$LOAF you loafs", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$DED", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You’re in the right place then.\n\nHeres your reply also “$weet”", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "> Everyone should have seen this coming months ago\n\nWe did. \n\n$DXY has steadily dropped. \n\nEquities have gone up in return. \n\nWe put money in stocks or calls.\n\nWhere have you been??", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Yet nobody is playing this angle.", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "\nbecause its fucking stupid\n\nyou're telling people to buy options on stock with less than 100K volume\n\nthe options you mentioned as \"higher volume\" are still less than 200\n\nwhy would i play this shit when i could just trade SPY? or trade currencies? or $DXY? or various futures like vix or es?", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Because the premiums are so low relative to the returns?

Companies that have high market caps are much less volatile (aapl, msft, tsla, etc). On average, AMZN sees <0.5% pps fluctuations.\n2. At the same time, AMZN's share price needs to increase nearly 17% in 5 days for your contract to expire ITM. This is almost unheard of for a company that has a share price at $3000. Remember TSLA's run up that brought its share price from $1000 -> $1700? This 70% increase took 15 trading days; so on average, it had a price velocity of around 4%+ every consecutive day for this to be possible. AMZN needs to increase its share price by 3.4% on average per day for 3500c to print; thus, it requires that level of hype and optimism that TSLA had and probably even more, since the price of AMZN's share is already high enough and it wouldn't flock in as many retards as it did. Further, a share price increase of at least 3.4% has happened merely 14 times in the past year. 6 of which happened during the corona recovery phase, so I would discount this. So 3% (8/253) percent chance that it'll see 3.4%+ in a day. And therefore, seeing 17% increase in share price within 5 days, is less than 3%.\n3. High possibility of AMZN share selloffs post earnings. Remember when TSLA and MSFT beat earnings expectations, and yet its prices still plummeted? Who's to say the same won't happen to AMZN despite their earnings expectations and already inflated prices? Furthermore, do you have any supporting data that their earnings beat isn't priced in?\n4. Unlikely, but what happens when there's good vaccine news within the next 5 trading days? AMZN is a COVID stock, so if there's any good news from any of the 100+ biotech firms that are racing to produce the first vaccine, AMZN's stock price will most likely fall.\n\nAMZN needs to overcome so many hurdles for your calls to print, and it has to be one of the most retarded bets I've seen to this date.

Although certain big pharma companies would likely sign onto such contracts, companies that use DNA/mRNA vaccine techonology (like Moderna, BioNTech, Inovio, others) are quite attractive for this purpose given the rapid turnaround time from obtaining the sequence of a viral/bacterial genome to developing a product for clinical trials (because all that needs to be changed in the product formulations is the mRNA/DNA sequence used, and the difference in physical/chemical properties of polynucleotide sequences is smaller and better understood than differences across antigenic proteins used in more classical vaccine approaches).

They're selling server chips with two year old processor form factors for twice the price of AMD's Rome procs. For every company looking to do a refresher on hardware, the choice was a no-brainer. The Rome 2 procs were something we waited to August 2019 to order, and there was such a backlog from orders, that delivery occurred in May of 2020.\n\nI don't think Intel is going to do well. I am surprised they remained $60 until they lost $9 premarket.\n\nYes, Intel does have other revenue streams: network chipsets, motherboards, storage SSD fab, ~~video cards~~, etc. Still, I can't help but think that Intel's lack of R&D into another processor architecture informs me as to their company modus operandi: they rode astride the chip manufacturing world for too long, and a more innovative company is now eating their lunch. They were content to imagine that single-NUMA architecture was going to continue to dominate, while AMD focused on multiple NUMA nodes.\n\nThe disadvantage of single NUMA architecture is the complexity of assembling a die with 24 or 28 cores as a single unit. A lot of their production is thrown away or put into a lower bin when a manufacturing defect takes place. This effectively increases the cost of manufacturing, and Intel processor prices as a whole.\n\nAMD on the other hand, has been developing the Zepplin architecture since the Bulldozer chips in 2011. Their goal was to make production easy by assembling NUMA node modules in batches, and then later integrating them on the  CPU die with a separate processor responsible for intra-node communication. This decreases the points of failure from the entire die, down to single cpu components. This decreases their rate of rejection, which gives them the upper hand on price.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Intel is their inability to close the architecture process size below 10nm. When I'd heard that AMD was producing 7nm processors, I was intrigued what Intel's response was going to be. When it came out that they were going to be producing only mobile processors at 10nm, I knew they were in trouble.\nIntel has become second-class, and if they don't invest in some serious R&D on their process and architecture, their processor division will soon become redundant.\n\nI am ultra-bearish on Intel in the long run.

The only place that single NUMA configurations win out is when running single programs capable of multi-threading more than the highest NUMA node count, which for AMD is 32 processors per Zepplin. That limits the amount of memory which can be addressed by a NUMA node, which can be the absolute ceiling for a specific program.\n\nFrom server perspective, it's no big deal to separate virtual processors. Intra-node communication is slowed due to the need to pass memory addressing between nodes, but that's about it.\n\nIntel processors will become a specialty for high speed processing, while AMD will be useful for every other type of work.\n\nThe next thing AMD needs to solve is their NUMA node interconnect.
