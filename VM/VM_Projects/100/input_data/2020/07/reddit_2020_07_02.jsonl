All these industries are behemoths and just to capture one of them would result in them absolutely crushing competition. All these industries have quite a high barrier of entry (extensive charging network, software, etc..) especially if you need to throw in self driving to really bring transportation into the future. \n\nFor my bull sceneario, i would say im fairly certain that Tesla would be a trillion dollar company (if not more) once they solve self driving and get government approval.\n\nFor my bear sceneario, they lose their competitive advantage(Highly unlikely as it takes years and years to catch up to Tesla's current standards) and become just another car company. \n\nAs an investor of Tesla, i do not want them to focus on bringing the company to profit, i want them to dump money back into research, into expanding their charging network, their solar integration and other competitive advantages that would make it impossible for competitors to catch up. Then we start to look at profits. The Jeff Bezos way if u will. \n\nSo to paint an ideal bull case for Tesla:\n\nYou park your tesla at home, charged by your solar roof. When you leave for work, you are chauffeured to your destination in your self driving tesla while u can have some shuteye. If your vehicle detects that its low on battery, it drives itself to a super charger while you get to play games on your car's massive screen. \n\nYou reach work refreshed and ready to go when your shipment arrives in a Tesla Semi. You unload your shipment and distributes it to your retail outlets in a Tesla van. You get off work all tired and your Tesla is there to pick you up. If say you get into an accident with a human driver on the way home, your insurance would be so much lower than that of the ICE vehicle.\n\nYou reach home and you send your car off on its own to a repair shop. During your vehicle's downtime, you could book a low cost Tesla robotaxi ride instead. \n\nLook at Apple as a comparison, their ecosystem is so robust and profitable that they need not be the company with the most devices sold to be the largest market cap in the world. They sell things that people want and need. You may think that comparing Tesla to Apple is ridiculous but consider this. Do you need energy? Do you need batteries? Do you need stuff delivered to you? Do you need a cleaner and healthier world, a world not as reliant on fossil fuels as we are now? Tesla has been making cars people want for quite awhile now, all the while not spending a single cent on advertising. \n\nSo to me, the potential upside is so much greater than the downside.

They just took the boring old phone and made it epic. But fundamentally its still the same in the sense that you charge your phone the same way you would charge a flip phone. You make calls and text your friends the same way. \n\nElectric cars on the other hand is fundamentally different from ICE cars. People are used to filling up their tanks in a short period of time. People may feel uneasy not being in control of their car. The entire dynamic of the automotive and transport industry has changed. \n\nThats only on the consumer side of things.\n\nOn the distribution side, Tesla eliminated the middle man. They are vertically integrated and streamlined the production process. Imagine toyota cutting out dealerships and after sales model. Oof.\n\nAnd on the practicality side of things, I would say that legacy automakers has become lazy and too set in their ways to adopt new tech into their cars. Most ICE cars cant even turn on electricity without turning on the engine! \n\nSo.. they cant play catch up cos they are really far behind, they cant turn a profit due to declining sales( ford and gm is in a real hole now). And they are still developing a product that would in time to come, be obsolete. I think the plan going forward for these legacy makes is to just buy tech from Tesla. And thats the beauty of this stock.\n\nIn conclusion, yes, Tesla is competing in several categories and industries. But those industry are slow to react in the digital age. What Tesla is doing is bringing all these inefficient industries together to create an epic product.

{"title": "Tesla Infinity Call Gamma Squeeze", "selftext": "So I’ve had this hypothesis for a while now, and I’m almost certain it is what’s happening. Obviously I don’t have all the data in front of me and I only have the observed data, but I can infer that essentially Tesla every few months will undergone an “infinity” call gamma squeeze that will keep pumping the stock up. There’s been some talk on Twitter about this if you just like search TSLA gamma, squeeze, etc. so I’m not the only one to observe this. \n\nIf you are familiar with the famous Volkswagen squeeze, it’s similar, but the key difference is instead of it being a short term squeeze, this one seems to be a more drawn out squeeze that occurs every few months. So the reason it’s notable is that Tesla holds some interesting characteristics. First, it’s call skew in options sometimes is MUCH HIGHER than its put skew. This is unique. Very rarely do you see companies where the call skew is much higher than it’s put skew. Option demand is usually on the downside for protection for big funds, but in Tesla, the majority of the option buying are OTM, upside calls. Next, Tesla at times can trade option deltas greater than share delta, which means options have a huge weight on price movement. In order to properly hedge options flow delta, a market maker would have to move the stock quite a bit. Furthermore, Tesla has a decent amount of shorts, despite being a successful stock (successful is defined as in the  price move). Finally, Tesla has a ton of retail interest and despite being a 1000+ dollar stock, it has a ton of retail call options buying too. These make for a lethal combination to basically squeeze it to “infinity” with little resistance. Anyways, this leads me to what I think what’s happening with Tesla. It’s actually quite simple to understand (more so if you understand terms like delta and gamma).\n\nHere’s what happens. Someone starts by buying way OTM calls > force market makers to buy stock to hedge calls initially, which moves it only a bit up > release some good news > force algos who trade news to buy stock > the original OTM calls are now closer to ATM > due to gamma, market makers have to buy more stock > after seeing the initial move, now retail is piling into calls too due to FOMO > shorts are buying back stock and buying calls to hedge too > causes market makers to now desperately buy more stock to hedge > cycle repeats > stock price goes to infinity.\n\nObviously this doesn’t work if you don’t have good news to release but Elon always does. This doesn’t work if no retail help you buy more calls, but everyone here will FOMO. Just go to wsb and check out the posts. This doesn’t work if there weren’t so many shorts in Tesla but there always will be who have to manage risk. This doesn’t work if some big find offloads Tesla shares as it goes up, but most are holding, including Elon. This doesn’t work if SPY tanks either due to beta, but SPY just goes up too on average.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker. Once the calls expire, the stock price won’t drop since it erases all downside gamma. Then you repeat this every few months. This is how you can get a stock easily to infinity actually.\n\nNow who’s the initial call buyers? No idea. It could even be Elon himself or someone related. This is what Porsche did with Volkswagen to cause the squeeze. Porsche loaded up on the calls first and then released their “news” (which was they locked up the float). The way Elon is taunting the shorts and SEC could mean he knows what’s happening too. The thing is, since all the initial person is doing is buying calls, he’s not doing anything bad. It’s not his fault that people then FOMO, market makes them rush to delta hedge, and shorts continue the call buying + share covering. The initial call buys may have started the chain, but the rest is set in motion by everyone else. \n\nAnyways, this means you actually can’t short Tesla. It’s just strictly -EV to do so. I bet you if you take a graph of SPY and Tesla side by side, on almost all days in which Tesla actually dropped, SPY probably dropped that day too. But there were days in which SPY probably barely went up but a Tesla shot up a ton (like today). So if you short Tesla, you would be strictly better off shorting SPY. Shorting Tesla also means paying a much higher IV in put options too and having more upside risk in short shares. The other way a short can win on Tesla is some bad news, but can you really time that greater than the times you keep buying puts?\n\nSo yea that’s basically the story of Tesla. This stock can literally go to 2000 with no fundamental change. As long as the call buying keeps happening, this stock will chug along to infinity.\n\nHere’s my post a few months ago talking about this so I’ve been thinking about this for a while: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3g63c/tesla_options_activity/fnr3j1d/?context=3\n\nI just wanted to give a more formal post. As I also mentioned, this is just a hypothesis, but there’s a ton of evidence supporting this, and it’s talked about my others too. You can google like TSLA convexity squeeze on YouTube and someone made a video about it. I’m just adding more details to provide color.\n\nEDIT: This is just a hypothesis, so nothing set in stone. I can only infer things from the data. My tldr is if you are thinking about shorting Tesla, it's probably not a good relative short vs another name or vs SPY/IWM. I would not recommend buying puts, selling naked calls, or outright shorting stock. That doesn't mean you can't win shorting Tesla, but your EV on the return is probably not as high as other shorts over the Long Run. You need to time it incredibly well, and it's very hard to do. For example, during a SPY selloff, Tesla can drop a lot, but can you time the next SPY selloff? You are also paying a ridiculous IV for the puts, much higher than other names. If you do want to short and really have this urge to do so, pick a specific known event like say the earnings later this month and short it then. For the record, I'm not long Tesla (I am long other big tech though), but I'm merely trying to explain a hypothesis. Also saying \"don't buy puts\" is not the same as saying \"buy calls\", so keep they in mind. I'm not advocating to just keep buying calls either with the high IV. But saying \"don't buy puts\" or \"don't short naked calls\"  is a \"trade\" in itself since saving money means you can use that on other trades.\n\nEDIT: I’m gonna add one more edit because of the last comment. This dude on Twitter literally copy and pasted my original post.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hq11ao/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_july_13_2020/fxwedwz/?context=3\n\nI explained this already on wsb and commented below but I’ll just type it here since people don’t read my comments below, given the latest post.

I had to re-take the entire 30-question quiz in order to achieve my 100% score because I got that question wrong.

However, let's say there are only call buyers and no sellers. In this case, the MM has to be smart here. He has to make his theoretical value of these call options very high (hence why you see a high call skew or high implied vol IV on these calls). Now he still has to make a bid/offer around this value. Since options have many risks, one risk the MM will get by selling calls is he will be short delta. Hence he needs to buy shares to hedge that. The MM's goal at the end is that they charged high enough of an offer such that it was worth it for them to sell those calls, while properly hedging their delta risk with shares.\n\nOptions are even more special for market makers because the entire option chain can be connected by a vol surface. So if there are a ton of buyers of say the 1500 strike call, that will also make the IV of the 1510 call higher, even if no one is buying that strike.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I am studying hard, and I find all these nuances behind the curtain (or behind my trade platform) fascinate me.

They probably have no incentive to improve until they see someone else improve is my guess. Like they make it 1-1.2 right. They want to capture max spread as in 20 cents across the bid/offer. \n\nNow if you put in a 1.2 offer, you as a customer, get priority over them on fills (this is a complex rule, but if you search exchange rules, customers get first priority on matching fills). So now they have to improve to undercut you. Of course if you put in an even better 1.1 offer, they will just join you at 1.1 too. You still get priority but they hope to then get 2nd priority. If SPCE is trading at 10 cent increments. 1-1.1 is the best you can do. But on SPY, it can be 1 cent wide sometimes since it trades in pennies for under 3 dollar options (over 3 trades in nickels). You probably have noticed this before. \n\nIt's all controlled by algos. I'm being kinda simple here. In reality, they have complex algorithms who make decisions for them how to improve, how much to improve, when to match, when to widen, etc.\n\nThere's also this tricky \"price improvement\" mechanism. You might have benefited from this. Every cross the spread and then you get your price improved? Well MM, when they get hit or lifted, they can  choose to improve their bid or offer through an auction. This can then undercut the price even more.

SPY options are popular. You wanna get on as many trades as possible. More trades = more spreads = more rebate = more money (risk adjusted of course). If you sit wide on SPY, you aren't getting anything. But if you sit wide on Wayfair, since it's not super liquid, you can still get it sitting 2-2.60. You do less trades, but per trade, you get a wider spread. \n\nAll about tradeoff between liquidity and risk. Of course higher priced names generally will have also have a wider spread. Amazon has options trading dollars wide. No MM wants to be quoting super tight in a nearly 3000 dollar stock. So all of that comes into play. \n\nBut as a customer, if you undercut, well if they really wanted to be part of the trade, they have no choice but to undercut you some more.

We saw unusual call volume on SHLL on Thursday for the October strikes even through the market hasn’t had much time to figure out the market price for calls. It’s also possible that a headwind was cleared on Nikola on Thursday, given the warrant lock-up cleared 7/3, so shares staying flat or going up should further help SHLL. It seems very likely MMs will need to delta hedge SHLL options by buying shares in large volume very soon; combined with increasing retail interest I could see this only picking up more. I only own a small amount of warrants but I’m very interested in this short/medium term mostly because of the fact that options on SPACs seem to be nonexistent until DKNG/NKLA/FMCI and I’m wondering if hype + added chain will cause this to pop quickly even though the merger isn’t until late Q3.

If you do sell next time, choose a way way way OTM strike like the strikes near the 3000 strike for next week. And yes it’ll be worth still a few hundred to collect.

Generally what you would do in this situation is sell 5 ATM puts as like a “reverse” of a covered call strategy (since you are short shares here) so you are bearish but collect theta with the high IV.

Some newer large installations (Middle East and possibly elsewhere) have long-term contracts to provide power for around one cent/kWH. In much of the world, including much of the US, solar and wind are now the least expensive choices for new power generation, and in some cases even cheaper to build new wind and solar than to keep old fossil fuel generation running.\n\nThe problem is that the power company won't sell the homeowner the power at 4 (or 1) cent(s) per kWh. After the markups of utility-generated solar, residential solar can in some cases still offer the home user a price advantage.\n\nRecently Tesla seems very interested in virtual power plants, with generation and storage capability distributed to homes, and with implementations being expanded in Australia.

Tesla's developments on battery cell chemistry, battery cell manufacturing methods and their brain talent in their battery division is...overwhelming. Nobody is even in the rear view mirror.

This is what Tesla is doing -- they invented the product so they could own the global energy platform. Once the surviving auto mfgs switch to EV, I would bet a pretty penny there are going to be no other competitive equivalents to Tesla cells, and most of the world will be riding or juicing up Tesla-brand cells.\n\n> Or there's the other explanation: \"I don't understand it from my perspective of quarterly analysis, therefore everyone else is wrong, and since I DON'T understand it, it is Kool-aid\" which is a lot like Clarke's Third Law.\n\n\nCongrats on your TSLA position.

Everything else is merely how well the business can operate those inputs and outputs. Toyota $280b revenue for $230b COGS gives $50b gross profit, for a market cap of $174b, about 3.5x. Tesla $26b revenue for $21b COGS gives $5b gross profit, for a market cap of $224b, about 44.0x.

You did not say \"Mommy\" by saying the M sound and then the \"O\" sound and then the M sound again, etc. and put all the sounds together. That's more complex than just speaking for Pete's sake! So why should we teach our kids to talk that way? The ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) method does just that. They show the kid the letter \"T\" and the kid needs to say the \"T\" sound 8 of 10 times to \"master\" it before going on to the next sound. I have seen this first hand. If you buy into my common sense approach, the whole traditional education system should be changed. The reason the system still exists is that us normal, typical folks, figure out the meaning ourselves and we learn. For example, I used to play with numbers when I was five years old.

They don’t get double entendres;  they don’t get jokes; that’s why they get made fun of all the time because they don’t get the subtleties of humor.

The bell curve distribution the guy showed for it in the video showed that 100% of those in the standardisation group that got 38+ had an ASD. This is what got me thinking about all this again recently. \n\nMy psychiatrist said that the main issue he had with saying I had an ASD (apart from that as I was then late 20s it wouldn't have made any difference in treatment for the real issues), was that I seem to have developed relatively normal social skills, and be able to understand emotions of others to a reasonable extent, even though I'm extremely unemotional and have a flat affect myself.\n\nHe said that it's possible that I learned these skills through observation and trying things repeatedly. When people are showing emotion around me I feel extremely awkward, but know what to say to show I care and to get people talking and open up and I can go on for hours discussing whatever they want to about it without feeling drained emotionally (because to me it's just ask a question, get an answer, then ask another based on that and so on), but inside me I just don't feel it, or care on an emotional level, though on an intellectual level/have thoughts that I do.\n\nSorry to be a bit long winded, but basically, is it possible for someone with a milder ASD, be able to essentially be able to learn these skills over time and develop a kind of repetoire and behaviours that are known to work in this or that situation, and in a sense, seem less \"typical\" for an ASD? One previous gf of mine was very good socially and she really noticed that I was a bit awkward and seized up when things were unfamiliar and I couldn't work out what was expected or what I should do, so I'd kinda do nothing. For example, if I'm in a situation in which I'm working with anyone on something, I'm fine and comfortable talking and making jokes etc, but if there isn't that small focus or purpose of working together, things for me become much more difficult even though you'd think if you're okay in the first situation you should be fine in the second. \n\nI spoke to one of my parents about it and went through that whole test with me and agreed on each answer, but disagreed that I was on the spectrum. I saw a few specialists for ADHD as a child and they never brought anything AS related up. Though I have really wondered since that test now whether the psychiatrist, and 2 friends who've worked with autistic people might've had a point. Plus yeah, getting really deep into trading and loving all the patterns and numbers etc, that's kinda hard to ignore too tbh.\n\nEdit: I just remembered one other thing too, I tend to go on and on about the same shit when speaking or even messaging, sometimes to the extent that even I realise I should shut up and move on. Haven't managed to fix up that habit yet, but maybe one day. And yeah, go into way too much detail, like this question I guess haha.

First, it's not a one way street. I am looking now for an organization to host a discussion about the neurodiversity paradigm vs the medical paradigm. The medical paradigm treats autism as a disorder and we need to fix them and make them like us \"normal\" people. the neurodiversity paradigm suggest seeing autistics and appreciating that their mind works in extraordinary ways. It sees autism as a \"condition\" that may need help in some ways, rather than a \"disorder.\" So, my first response to your question that the autist cannot be \"functional\" without seeing how society can also appreciate what the autist can offer. Sometimes meeting in the middle = functioning.\n\nHaving said that, the answer that more directly addresses your question is that there needs to be an internal change, that reflects the development of the person's mind. Why can a child not have a friend in first grade and continue to not have a friend in 8th grade? What a failure of the educational system! That's because being in a class with others is not enough. What I mean by an internal/developmental change is for example a person may not consider others and be very egocentric. This starts to develop around two and many kids on the spectrum do not develop this, and there is what I call a developmental gap. If we bridge this gap, one-on-one (not in a classroom), then the outcome is having more of an ability to make a genuine friend. I may work with someone for four months so that the autist is able to establish a real, mutual, friendship.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Also, self-awareness is key.  If you’re aware of what you’re doing and why are you doing it, then you can change it.  Sometimes it’s as easy as a specialist drawing attention to it.  The second thing is be open to listening to a friend or somebody else whose giving constructive criticism.  Some ASD people react very strongly against people they view as criticizing them, and that’s not good.  Listening to others’ feedback and awareness about an issue is the first thing to do in order to get better.  \n\nTrained specialists are also very important to help the ASD individual learn the concepts necessary to function in society.  For example, a non-functional autistic person literally may not understand the concept of past and present. With help and practice, such concepts can be learned.  \n\nAnother example is that a non-functional autist may not think for himself.  He cognitively can think, but does not do so.  So, a specialist can get that person to think.  For example I’m going with somebody who loves fire engines. I said you know what let’s figure out where this thing is.  So we’re driving along and I asked him where are we going to get off the highway to find a fire engine.  He says ‘what do you mean?’ I said ‘well we’re driving, where do we go for the fire station. ‘  He says ‘well I don’t know, don’t you know’?  I said ‘no, how am I suppose to know that.’  He’s used to everybody filling in for him; he’s used to his friends, his mother, his girlfriend, his brother filling in for him.  He has to take responsibility and use his logical mind.  So here we are and we decided we have to go back to the office, look on the internet, get an address.  In other words, he was forced to use reasoning and logic.  His own emotional impulse motivated him to use logic.  I didn’t force him to do anything; he was forced by himself.

{"title": "THANK YOU PAPA ELON! ~3m GAINS on TSLA - From -1.7m to +1.1m total", "selftext": "I know Papa Elon is in here and he will give everyone gold itt.\n\nWhat a fucking amazing TSLA rally this week. Elon is sending astronauts to space, the moon, Mars, AND retard's portfolios along with it. I bet against TSLA back in May and Elon whooped my ass for it. Never again did I touched TSLA... until now.\n\nSince Tuesday and Wednesday, I was in and out of TSLA when it was around $1000. After realizing the potential upside of the delivery number's momentum and the pure koolaid power behind TSLA investors, I made the yolos of all yolos, around \\~800k on TSLA 7/2s.\n\nI had 1100 7/2s that I paper handed which would've been 1000% gains but that's in the past. Yesterday at close, I was -20% on these because I bought high during the chase. I decided it's either going to be $0 or 1m and left my fate in Elon's hands.\n\nBetted on 2 things:\n\n1. SPY gaps up due to good unemployment numbers and because America wasn't gonna end the week red on the most patriotic weekend. TSLA gaps up with SPY.\n2. I saw 1200 7/2s in the flow and gauged the market sentiment on StockTwits (gotta figure out what all the rest of the retards are doing).\n\nThese 1200s were getting hit throughout the day all the way until closing for 50k - 200k amounts. I was already all in on my current positions so I didn't jump in these but out of all the flow, these stood out to me and I kept seeing comments about open at 1200, gonna be 1250 EOD...\n\nWoke up this morning and SPY was $315, TSLA $1200. Jumped outta bed and took a cold shower to get this wonderful day started...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfo8gwvwhi851.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=0730a5cc3d2b09e8ba8f5f6c6d597b441b26658a\n\nRH position, 310k on 1150 7/2. Netted 1.1m - 356% gains. I closed these out at the near top at $74/contract. Cost was $14.67/contract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSLA 1150c 7\\/2 +356&#37; - 1.1m profit](https://preview.redd.it/363l24m3hi851.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=88a9d5202537755d5a75c75b9e7711d165becb04)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy 3 month RH chart. This chart tells the story of pure autism, persistence, and yolos. I started this game on 4/20 and got my first big gains on 5/1 with DFS puts. Right after that, I chased TSLA puts on the same day and took a -150k loss.\n\nConstant ups and downs 4 times back and forth. DIS calls got me back up again only for the mouse to take it all back the next day. Then I moved on to BABA for ER only to get fucked by CHYNAH, not once, not twice, but THREE times.\n\nAt the very bottom, I was -700k in the hole (-72%)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mdgnpshii851.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=e51cffa239edeff7091b7090c8e19adcf1179aab\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTOS account. Last 500k all in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vg9qazgyji851.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=9378ee407f56bf1f35dd59fb6d1aa53932d4784d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I went from all time lows of -1.7m to now +1.1m. I'm taking this 3 day weekend to journal all my past trades and reanalyze my process/risks. Papa Elon gave me a second chance and I'm gonna take a break... until MONDAY.\n\nLessons learned? I've truly learned nothing valuable in terms of fundamentals. The losses and wins have taught me more about trader mindset and keeping myself in check after a huge loss and to fucking keep going back for more.\n\nI've had FB weeklies of $250k expired, I've had calls I held that were -99% and came back from the dead, only to get greedy and lose it the next day. It's hard to explain but you get tunnel vision and your mind just goes blank when shit like this happens.\n\nAlot of you will give me hate for playing recklessly with amounts of money like this and it's understandable. Everyone in here is going through their daily trading days on their own, refining their process, their mindset, and dealing with their losses and wins in their own ways.\n\nMy perspective was really simple. I was ready to lose it all and already accepted that end of day yesterday. But I was ready to take the loss, regroup, and get back in after I pick myself back up. I've already done that 4 times in the past 2 months.\n\nThe MAIN taking point of all my wins and losses for me was to TRUST MY GUT more and stay CONVICTED.\n\n**Notable positions that had I held and stuck with would've been big gains.**\n\n1. SPG 65c 7/17 - Had 100k in this and closed to break even, a few days later they were up 1000%. The play was on mall recovery, reopening.\n2. FB 220 7/2, FB 230 7/2, FB 240 7/2 - Bought last Friday and opening Monday. Got too impatient and closed it for loss. FB rallied huge yesterday. The play was FB was oversold from ads boycotting and will rally back up.\n3. SHOP 800c 7/17 - 100k in, sold for 30k profit the next day. The play was SHOP is pure retard strength and every mom and pop retailer is on e-commerce. (I use SHOP for my e-commerce biz)\n\nThe key lesson in these 3 were that I had the right idea but no follow up plan.\n\n**My advice to you retards:**\n\nNEVER. GIVE. UP.  \n\\-If you are down big, step away and regroup  \n\\- Analyze what went wrong and what went right.  \n\\- Build a checklist for your process to keep you on the right path.  \n**- IF IT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT. IT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO LOCK IN GAINS.**\n\nHave a good 4th of July weekend all, cya Monday!\n\ntldr: I'm retarded and Papa Musk saved me from -1.7m to +1.1m. Just placed 2 orders for Tesla X + Cyber truck.\n\n**SEC can suck Elon's CAWK.**  \n**IRS, fuck you too!**  \n\n\nMy retarded V shaped / Nike just yolo it recovery. Total +680k on RH, and another +400k on TOS. That adds up to 1.1m right?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvwmc7syoi851.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=780f0c52ee80c881ca083f6cadb85608c73a4745", "id": "hk6hcl", "created_utc": 1593727308.0, "score": 1090, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 356, "comments": [{"body": "So you stepped away when it went wrong , analyzed what went wrong, and decided to yolo 800k on Tesla short expiry FDs.", "score": 1171, "replies": [{"body": "I stepped away for 5 seconds and went back into it for some more", "score": 634, "replies": [{"body": "lol i skimmed the takeaways and was like uhhh this dude got fucked by FDs and saved by FDs\n\nif this is play money to you more power to ya - but if this is serious money then i'd start putting away enough to 1) pay uncle sam 2) dont regret it again 3 months from now", "score": 33, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hey bud I’m hating but enjoy your fresh new life.

A basic run over is you sell a put, giving you about 1.5k to 2k depending on the strike price. They hold collateral of 100 TSLA shares, which is 120k right now. If the price stays above the put you sold, you keep the 2k, and can rinse and repeat the next week. If the price goes below the put you sold, you are assigned to buy 100 shares of TSLA at that price. TSLA would have to fall 20 dollars below your put strike to break even because you keep the 2k from before. Now that you have 100 shares of TSLA, you can sell calls on it, which give similar money to selling puts. If TSLA doesn’t go above your sold call you keep the cash, if it does, your shares are called away. Typically your calls should be above your puts so you make money in stock appreciation as well. Then you repeat the wheel. If you have faith in the stock you shouldn’t mind holding shares, so it’s a pretty low risk consistent strategy. You have 1.6 million dollars so you can run 13 wheels on TSLA, 13 x 1.5 to 2k = 19.5 to 26k a week.

{"title": "[DD] All aboard AXDX!", "selftext": "This is my first DD. I feel really good about it. I’m just your average investor/trader/gambler, but do like to dig deep, and think I found something here. Let's go.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nBuy AXDX calls. July/Aug/Nov exp.  15-20 strikes. Shoot for 25 for max tendies.\n\nGo long AXDX shares on margin, too.\n\nWhy?\n\n* Experienced investor with an awesome track record of winning as a shareholder (and fighting for shareholder value) recently showed showing extreme confidence in the company ($25MM buy)\n* They are gonna get $ from COVID testing revenues incoming which were not expected in their business plans at all (and this is a relatively low rev company, so the boost will look great)\n* EUA for the tests < 2 weeks away from being announced - we have evidence from other applications that it should be any time now\n* Besides all that, everything on track with their normal core business and it shouldn't be much affected by COVD\n\nNow, for the real story...\n\n**It started with a LARGE buy that caught my eye**\n\nActually, a series of buys from [Jack Schuler](https://www.schulerprogram.org/staff/jack-schuler). Schuler has spent over 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry, including having served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Abbott Laboratories.  Today, Mr. Schuler serves on the board of directors for several companies, including Accelerate Diagnostics, Quidel Corporation and Biodesix, Inc.\n\n[I'll do the math for you: that's $26.7MM of stock purchased during this dip. ](https://preview.redd.it/gy6yh4icti851.png?width=3106&format=png&auto=webp&s=af7772f0e78fa18ee01554cd2a9b85fff26c97aa)\n\nOK, so insider sales don't mean everything? We don't panic when we see selling because sometimes people just need to cash out. So we cannot just assume this means anything. Can we?\n\n**Looking back at Jack's buying history - this was a v big buy for Jack**\n\nLooking back, Schuler is quite active in [investing in his companies](https://elite.finviz.com/insidertrading.ashx?oc=1021412&tc=7). But it's not always buys, he does sell. And if you look further back, you actually see some interesting things.\n\nStarting with AXDX: Before the buys shown above, the last time Jack made a slew of purchases was between [Aug 11 2017](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727207/000114420417043378/xslF345X03/v473193_4.xml) and [May 15 2018](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727207/000114420418029491/xslF345X03/tv494321_4.xml) when he purchased $29MM total. Note that this was over the course of a year for an average price of about $20 a share. Prior to those buys, you have to go back to Jan 2017 before he made any other bets.\n\n*In other words, Jack just bought as much stock in the last few months than he'd bought in the previous few years.*\n\nSo it seems like Jack feels really good about buying this dip. Is that enough? Probably... but let's keep going.\n\n**Jack has been around the block - and Jack likes winning (Jack gets top $ for Ventana)**\n\nHe's been quite successful in being an activist that fights for his shareholders. That is a great thing if you are in investor. I managed to stumble across this gem: [Jack Schuler historical record of 'dirty tricks' in business](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4349&mn=39&pt=msg&mid=6732323). It's truly amazing. It's some dude's salty manifesto about how Jack S is a actually just a bad ass investor.\n\nBack in 2007, Roche wanted to buy Ventana who Jack was an investor in. He has big problems with the initial price that was offered and slowed down the deal. Here's what he said:\n\n>\"This is about stockholder value,\" said Ventana chairman Jack Schuler. \"Simply put, we believe that Roche is trying to capture value for its stockholders that rightly belongs to Ventana's stockholders.\" Ironically, as Roche was hailing its offer as a 44% premium on Ventana's stock value of $51.95 on June 22, 2007 (the last trading day before Roche submitted its bid to Ventana), the stock has steadily risen to a recent close of more than $83.\n\nPreach! He's not playing dirty tricks. He wants shareholder value. What's wrong with that? Long story short, the deal was hung up because Jack needed all of his tendies.  It eventually went through at a [19.3% premium to Roche's initial offer on June 27, 2007](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/roche-holding-ag-to-acquire-ventana-medical-systems-inc-for-89-50-per-share-/). Well done, Jack! I'd certainly want him to negotiate 20% more for my shares.\n\n**Turns out Jack has a history of winning - Jack wins with Stericycle, Medtronic, and more**\n\nDigging deeper, Jack (and John Patience, the same one from the screenshot below) did the same trick with [Stericycle](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121617335185356747). The buys referenced in this article were unloaded 4-5 years later for 80-100% profits.\n\nHe also did it with [Medtronic in 2010](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052970203296004575339213130461810?tesla=y).  He picked up 30,000 shares at an average price of $36.93 each on June 25. Medtronic is at $93 today ($115 pre-covid) and pays a dividend. That ones seems to have worked out too.\n\nHe has other winners too. Jack. Is. A. Winner.\n\n**Is** ***that*** **enough?**\n\nHonestly, for you degens, yeah it should be. Jack has a strong track record. He thinks $10 is way too cheap, so he just bought an assload. Also, we know he doesn't hate money. A man like that never starts to hate money.\n\n**Did I say a COVID tailwind? Yup.**\n\nDid I mention that they have a [COVID tailwind](https://acceleratediagnostics.com/fight-against-covid-19)? I shit you not. It keeps getting better. You know the serology tests that determine if you've had CV? That test for antibodies? Well, turns out AXDX was perfectly set up to capitalize because they can make these. And they are planning to do so!\n\nOn top of a slow and steady growth of sales of medical devices, which is AXDX's core business, AXDX can monetize on these tests which will be really important in the coming year  as the world learns how to live with COVID (knowing who has had the disease is very important). From the CEO on the [earnings call in May:](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/09/accelerate-diagnostics-axdx-q1-2020-earnings-call.aspx)\n\n>Lastly, through a recently signed collaboration agreement with BioCheck Ltd, we have begun commercializing the MS-FAST fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer and SARS-COV-2 test for the detection of IgG and IgM. **This partnership has the potential to provide both an avenue to reengage prospective customers on Pheno as well as a near-term revenue uplift.** The performance data for these assays are best-in-class with sensitivity and specificity estimated as exceeding 95% for both assays based on over 100 samples collected at the source of the pandemic, Wuhan, China. Since announcing the partnership on April 15, we have received several indications of interest across the global business.  \n>  \n>**We are continuing to work with the FDA on our emergency use authorization for commercialization in the U.S., and we have taken initial orders in EMEA.** While we are tremendously excited about this collaboration agreement and are eager to play a role in fighting this pandemic, it remains too early to estimate the revenue potential of this opportunity. In my 30 years in diagnostics, I have never experienced a period of such profound disruption. **However, with this disruption comes the creation of new opportunities, the near-term impact from this pandemic to accelerate and most other healthcare companies is significant while at the same time shining a brighter light on the value of rapid diagnostics for infectious disease.**\n\nAwesome! So, we are stumbling into quite a bit revenue we were not expecting. That's dope. More good news? Yup. The CEO references that their **core product (Pheno) now has advantages due to COVID that will help future sales:**\n\n>And a big part of this will be, in my opinion, will be around how do you better manage infectious disease crises, how do you better manage secondary infections, how do you better manage bed utilization and staff utilization? And those are all things that Pheno directly addresses. I mean **Pheno gets patients on optimal therapy much, much quicker, two, three days quicker, and get patients out of the hospital two to five days quicker in some cases**. And so with that, I mean, as healthcare providers look at these things, I mean, **we fully expect them to be really having a heightened sense of interest in what we're doing in this space.**\n\n**Is now the time?**\n\nI think so. First, let's check AXDX over the past 5 years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0o2vw40m3j851.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd6870849fbd180cae421c934b8c6f509301dfb\n\nIn summary:\n\n* Lots of ups and down, but pretty consistently shoots above $20 (which will make us tendies)\n* In 2019 (pre-covid), it easily sat in the $18-$22 range.\n* We closed at **$15.86 today** after touching $17s yesterday and this morning. Profit raking before the weekend in the Hamptons. I'm not worried.\n* Looking back in the news on AXDX, I see no cause for concern. This is just a medical device company that's finally starting to see revenue.\n\nYou may notice the spike at the end of the chart...\n\n**Let's zoom in to the last three months - a recent run up and dip offer a chance to buy**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fiy5eew34j851.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=a868130d3e1a2449542e6822029ece6603088f4e\n\nIn the past month:\n\n* I suspect that others noticed what I have noticed, so it's been up up an away.\n* This week was especially bonkers. Up 5-10% most days. Never seen action like it.\n* But notice that **today was a BIG DOWN** day after 6 in a row up. It had to cool off. Maybe it cools off more Monday...? It will have reasons to go up soon that have not yet materialized (more below)\n* I see no reason why we wouldn't be headed back to ranges that it was safely in last year... especially with the tailwinds due to testing revenue, Jack S's confidence, and the recovery of markets (though AXDX is hardly affected by the shutdown).\n\n**Buy the dip, before the EUA approval!**\n\n***Remember those serology tests? AXDX is within weeks, by my estimate, of getting those approved for use.*** What pharma company doesn't love a nice FDA approval pop?\n\nSo when will it happen? Some digging: if you check here, you can see that the [FDA is pumping out these approvals](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covid19euas).\n\nBeckman Coulter was a recent company to get the approval, this [Monday on June 29, to deliver 30MM tests a month](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/en/about-beckman-coulter/newsroom/press-releases/2020/q2/2020-june-29-bec-sars-cov-2-igg-antibody-test-fda-eua). If you check back on their press releases, they were [chirping about this in late April](https://www.beckmancoulter.com/en/about-beckman-coulter/newsroom/press-releases/2020/q2/2020-apr-22-bec-serology-tests). So this process for them took \\~2 months.\n\nGoing back to AXDX's last conference call (May 8), we can read between the lines:\n\n>We **recently** filed for FDA emergency use authorization for our Pheno respiratory test kit, positioning its benefits for ventilated COVID-19 patients. If approved, this authorization will provide accelerate an avenue to reengage prospective and current customers, obtain useful analytical and clinical data on this new test and help some affected patients.\n\nAnd in the Q+A:\n\n>We have an EUA submitted, as I mentioned, for IgG and IgM combo test. We're also going to be submitting an EUA for individual tests for both IgG and IgM over the next couple of days. **The FDA has already come back to us with a few pieces of data that we need to follow up on which is pretty standard.**  \n>  \n>And we're working on that now. And in addition to that, I would say that we are submitting for a 510(k) for the MS-FAST instrument, and we're working on that currently as well with the consultant. Accelerate is the authorized legal agent for BioCheck. **And so we're basically spearheading all of the dialogue between the FDA and this opportunity which is a good thing because of the vast experience we have with the FDA already.**  \n>  \n>And so our expectation is, again I guess to be clear, t**here's been no setback at all relative to our submission**. And the new guidance that has come out. And then the last thing **I would say is the performance data that we have already submitted with the FDA is excellent data. And it already meets the requirements that they have called out.**  \n>  \n>Our sensitivity and specificity for both the IgG and IgM test or are both very solid. And again, **we're continuing to work with the FDA and hope to hear some positive outcomes here over the next couple of weeks.**\n\nBy the looks of it, from the statements and how press released line up, AXDX [was also writing press releases](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/accelerate-diagnostics-and-biocheck-announce-commercial-supply-and-collaboration-agreement-to-distribute-ms-fast-chemiluminescence-immunoassay-analyzer-and-sars-cov-2-antibody-tests/) in April about this, ***they applied to the FDA in late April or early May***. Given that Beckman Coulter's process took about 2 months... ***I think we could be very very close to an announcement, and I'd certainly expect it before 7/17*** (cough - calls - cough). \\[I checked a few other EUA timelines, and \\~2 months is about right\\]\n\n**That's it. What else do you need? Go buy some AXDX because:**\n\n* Experienced investor with an awesome track record of winning as a shareholder (and fighting for shareholder value) recently showed showing extreme confidence in the company ($25MM buy)\n* They are gonna get $ from COVID testing revenues incoming which were not expected in their business plans at all (and this is a relatively low rev company, so the boost will look great)\n* EUA for the tests < 2 weeks away from being announced - we have evidence from other applications that it should be any time now\n* Besides all that, everything on track with their normal core business and it shouldn't be much affected by COVD\n\n***What's not to like?***\n\n**My positions**\n\nJacked to the tits on 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 calls expiring in July, Aug, and Nov. Probably $25k across those. Then another $25k or so of shares.
