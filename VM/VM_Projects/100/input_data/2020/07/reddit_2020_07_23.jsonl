BTW if you’re still holding this in the morning just sell the first 5 minutes best price.

I left my job in 2013 to trade full time and did really well, and by like 2016-2017 I was so damn lazy cause all I did was wake up and trade for a couple hours and make my money and then watch Netflix all day lol. Occasionally I'd have a bad day and the market would really humble me and then I'd go into a depressive state for a few days and be a bum until I felt like I got it outta my system and then it was right back to it. It was hard for me cause I wanted to hit up friends and stuff but when you are done trading at 11am all your friends are still at work so I would just fill my time with laziness. Watching TV, browsing reddit, mindlessly cycling between email/facebook/twitter/checking the market/reddit/eat/repeat. It also caused me a lot of losses too cause I would get so bored I'd go back to the market during the shittiest time like the lunch hour and trade just to cure my boredom, and when I did that I would always lose. I even play a couple instruments and would do that to kill time but you can only cycle between your office/studio/living room/kitchen so many times before you start to go insane. \n\nIt's a weird thing because the reason everyone dreams of quitting their job and making their own living is so they can do whatever they want, and we have all these grand plans for the things we're gonna do when we're \"free\" but then when we get there, we are lazy as fuck! \n\nWhat I ended up doing was turning a side project I had been working on for a while into a subscription website. I was a tech dude before I left my job so I had some coding skill, and had been messing w/ Python to do stuff like scraping financial info off various websites and had a bunch of scripts written but no way to manage them, so I started learning Django and built a website to manage them all and when I got it polished up I decided it was worth setting up a payment system and seeing if I could get some side income from it. In the process of building it I also inadvertently became really good at Django and Python, got a mentoring gig on the side helping students learn software development and eventually started writing content for that company for their courses they sold and used that money to fund growing my subscription site. I also started volunteering at a local animal shelter and went and walked and socialized dogs which helped a lot. These days I'm almost completely independent from trading thanks to my software dev work on the side, my subscription site, and then trading to pay the bills, but if I stopped trading entirely I could still survive and I'm working on growing my sub site to the point it will be able to support me with recurring revs on its own. I guess my point is, you're doing well w/ trading but don't write off expanding into other things. Start a side business, build something, volunteer, learn a new skill you can use to create a new revenue stream ... give your life some variety. People covet this \"trading lifestyle\" where you wake up and make $1000 in 30 min and then have nothing to do the rest of the day but the truth is if you ever get to that point it actually really fucking sucks cause you will be bored out of your damn mind lol \n\nI'd also really recommend checking out /r/getmotivated, /r/getdisciplined, /r/getoutofbed, /r/entrepreneur and some of the related subs. They really help me with staying motivated and not becoming lazy just because I \"can\". If you are at the point where you could just stop working entirely and survive for multiple years, it's time to level up, not be a lazy fuck. Give yourself a challenge and overcome it.

Dozens of swing trading books, technical analysis books, and day trading strategies. I've taken online courses through my local University in finance (working on an MBA). I do hours upon hours of research before investing in anything, yet everything I touch just gets destroyed. I bought Novagold this year. Next day, short report. Stock plummets. Luckin Coffee? Scandal, fraud, delisted twice, worthless stock. I bought BEN thinking it was a wise long call for dividend growth. Just keeps plummeting. When I bought Tesla and Netflix, they both sank. I've bought endless stocks when they've hit below the lower bollinger bands, and everytime I do, they just go lower (with no news mind you). I bought AAPL yesterday, thinking $386 was a good discount value purchase. PLUMMETING AGAIN. I just don't get it. When a company comes out with a great earnings report and I buy, the stock tanks. When a company comes out with bad earnings, it goes straight up after I short it. I could literally pull letters out of a hat and have better success.\n\nEdit:  I should point out that I do day trade, and I wasn't actually referring to day trading, which I feel like is just a different game than investing.

If people expect earnings to go up 40%, and it does, the stock can still rise, or still fall. If people expect earnings to go up 60% and it goes up 40%, it can still rise or fall. It depends on where the current price of the stock is and (to some smaller extent) the technicals. I know a lot of people are going to say this is BS but it's not. \n\nThere is still a huge segment of the market that does fundamental analysis. What they do is they say to themselves via their math models that if earnings go up 50%, the stock SHOULD trade at x P/E ratio and thus have a stock price of $y. SOMETIMES, the market pushes the stock price up to $y in advance of earnings. Sometimes the market (via momentum traders, day-traders, or whoever else starts buying in size) might push the price up even higher. \n\nSometimes even though the market expects a 50% earnings raise, the next magnetic technical line is actually at a price that would kinda require a 55% or 60% raise. Sometimes the resistance is at 40% or 45%. The analysts still expect a 50% increase, but the next resistance is at a very different price. People assume that where the market \"stalls out\" pre-earnings fully aligns with analyst expectations, but that's not true. If the market stalls out at a technical point lower than fundamental investors would map to the expectations, then even an earnings miss can lead the stock to go up. The stock stalled out at a resistance line justifying 40% earnings increase, analysts expected 50%, company had 45%. That's an earnings miss, but, the stock is still underpriced and so goes up. \n\nThe same can be true in the other direction. The stock might have been pushed to an upper channel line by momentum and day traders that justifies a 60% earnings increase. The analysts expect 50%. The company has a 55% improvement in earnings, but, it was PRICED for 60%.  That's an earnings-beat, but, the stock still falls.\n\nMy main point is that the stock price and the analyst / market expectations are not the same thing. Everyone might expect one result, but the stock might be priced for a rosier or gloomier result.  Thus, whether the company has a beat or a miss, the price can still go up or down.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve been told and read that TA is bullshit though man.\n\nYou should check out ‘Random Walk on Wall Street ‘", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's not bullshit. It's also not a golden ticket. \n\nWe know that 90% of the market is robots fighting or trading with each other. If we know that to be true, the robots must have reasons they make trades. Every single trading algorithm has a single goal: make money for themselves, their clients, or their investors. Not all robots succeed in that, but that is their goal. \n\nRobots need price targets (for entries and exits) in order to know when to buy or sell. It doesn't matter if it's an algorithm for fidelity who just needs to invest $x that day based on contributions to 401ks, or a swing trading algo, or a momentum-trading algo, or a scalping algorithm, or a market-making algorithm, or any other algos, none of them want to lose money. \n\nThe thing is, the algos are able to analyze way more data than we can much quicker. They can check tick charts, time charts, various indicators, trend lines, channel lines, and more. The complex interplay of all of these signals will necessarily lead individual signals to appear unacceptable because they succeed as often as they fail. \n\nBecause of this it may seem to be a random walk, and even behave like one a lot of the time. But it's not a random walk. If it was a truly random walk, then none of those algorithms would ever be able to consistently make money.  In a true random walk, every single one of those algorithms would fail to profit. This is provably false. There exists at least 1 algo that consistently makes money somewhere. We all know that's true. SOMEONE is succeeding. And if someone is succeeding with an algorithm that explicitly defines when to take action, then the walk cannot be truly random. \n\nTA is very simple: try to discover when there will be more buyers than sellers, or vice versa. Even if we assume that the market is a true random walk initially, the existence of all the algos doing the trading now makes the problem a bit easier to define: instead of trying to discover or predict at what prices more HUMANS will buy or sell, the goal becomes to predict at what prices more algorithms will be buying or selling. \n\nThings like double-tops are real. When a market hits a top, and drops significantly, people and robots will both sell out when it gets near that top again. Some of the sellers will be people who lost a ton of money and finally clawed their way back and are ready to take some risk off the table. Others will be robots just predicting the double-top is a selling point so they'll sell too. But the fact is double-tops happen often. \n\nNow of course you can point to all the situations where a double-top DIDNT happen. Where the market broke through the old top. And you'd be right. But if you zoomed in closer at a shorter timeline, you'd see that on the lower timeframes, or even on the tick charts, a battle was going on, and the buyers won the battle and pushed it through. The market is a fractal. The daily is just a collection of 4-hour bars. The 4-hour bars are a collection of 1-hour bars, which are a collection of 5-minute bars, which are a collection of 1-minute bars, which are a collection of even lower timeframes like tick charts. At some point, the fractal breaks through like a house of cards and as the tick-chart breaks through some very small time-frame resistance, momentum moves to the 1-minute bars and smashes the 1-minute bar resistance, where the 5-minute bar traders and algos notice and jump on it. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to say TA is 100% correct or predictable. But my point stands. If the market were a true random walk, it would be impossible to code any algorithm that can consistently make money. Thus, those algorithms wouldn't exist, and the market would be run by human traders.

Also, there may be restrictions on how they can trade in that trading window. For example, suppose a company releases quarterly earnings on April 15, July 15, October 15, and January 15. Executives and people with access to financial data may only be able to trade the stock in the month following release of financial data (e.g., May 1-31, August 1-31, November 1-30, and February 1-28). Also, since an executive selling a large amount of stock could be viewed as bad and drive the value down, some companies also require key executives to give 30 days notice of their plans to buy or sell stock. Again, it is to prevent insider trading. If you are able to read that the CEO is planning to sell $1B of stock in a month, you may take that as a sign that the stock price is likely to fall and you can sell now. If the stock price does decline, the CEO sells at that lower price in a month. It is not that the CEO of a public company is not allowed to buy or sell his stock before a positive earnings result, but generally done to avoid being charged with insider trading. If the CEO buys and reports are positive and the price goes up, does any really believe that was not done based on knowing that the report would beat expectations and be viewed as very positive? “\n\nWhy has frost bought shares consistently up until 6-2-20.. then stops.. why??

Thanks!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR - Figure out your own target price, stick to your plan, ignore the noise\n\nIn the short term, stock market is just a voting machine and stock price is a reflection of that. As you can see from u/tenpies post below, there are people who think regulatory credits aren't real money and Tesla only made a profit because they cut salaries, not pay rent, etc., but conveniently ignoring the fact that Fremont was shut down for more than a month. There are also people who think 90k delivery in this environment is an achievement, and Tesla probably could've done 120-140K if Fremont wasn't shut down.\n\nThere are also a lot of \"traders\" who were hoping for a quick buck, and they either sold on the way up or exited on the way down. They will come back when the news of SP500 is announced, then leave again with their small profit/loss.\n\nA better approach might be for you to figure out how much YOU think Tesla will be worth  in 5-10 years, and then work your math backwards. For example, if you think Tesla will be a $1 trillion market cap company (this is also something I suggest, don't think in term of stock price but think in terms of market cap, this will give you a better perspective) in 5 years, this translate to a stock price of $5,400. You then figure out a rate of return acceptable to you, let's say 25%/year, and that will give TSLA a present value of $2,211. Technically, any price under $2,211 today will be a good investment for you in 5 years. I think this will remove a lot of these \"noises\" from the stock market for you. We have people yelling $2,200 EOM one day the $800 EOW the next, and it can just get confusing.\n\nDon't forget that this is a stock that traded in the $200-300 range for 6 years before finally exploding this year, even though they have executed what they originally planned (despite Elon time of course lol). Most people can't vision things, so they stick to that they see on the most recent quarterly results. I think the reason why the stock exploded this year is because people are finally starting to see the vision coming into place. You will still have people who think ZEV isn't real money (not my problem if other OEMs need to give us free money) or Tesla doesn't generate big profit (if Tesla wants, they can just severely lower R&D and just focus on making money, since the car they made in 2012 is still better than other EVs in the market).\n\nYou should be happy that we have so much volatility right now, because it means there's a fierce debate going on right now. Go back and look at AMZN's chart and you will see similar thing on their stock chart. You have people who \"get it\" and people who have to \"see it\" in order to believe. More of the \"see it\" people are finally getting it, so they are buying in, but they will still get scared and sell because they focus on the stock price. This also means opportunities for you to pick up cheaper shares.

I've owned TSLA for about 8 years now, and the stock has done everything from go UP on bad news to crash on great news.  \n\nI completely ignore short term price movements in my decisions to buy or sell stock.  The only thing I care about, is whether I believe that a particular company has good growth potential over the next 5-10 or even more years.

I believe that they will continue to grow as a business for many years into the future.  My advice on buying shares, based on experience generally: risk only the $ you can afford to risk (basically, don't spend your emergency fund or your home down payment on volatile stock), and price on a particular day doesn't matter a whole lot in the long run.   When TSLA made it to the $300s range, I didn't much care if I'd gotten shares at $31 or $34 apiece.

{"title": "18 learnings from options trading after losing 6 digits", "selftext": "I spent the last 6 months options trading (both buying / selling) and lost 6 digit sums. Here are my learnings shared with all of you so you don't repeat them.\n\n# 1: Don't buy options in high IV\nDon't buy put options when IV is high. I bought put options in March 20th and didn't exit them before the IV collapse.\n\nHeck, I didn't even know what IV was at that time. This was WSB-days\n\n# 2: Don't sell when IV / premium is very low\nThe risk isn't worth it. Always calculate the return on risk (return on nominal capital) before placing a trade\n\n# 3: Wait for probabilities to play out\nPosition size and have a plan so you can afford to let probabilities play out. I got rid of a couple of positions too early unnecessarily.\n\n# 4: No covered calls on individuals\nThe data & research seems to be clear that covered calls on most individuals is a net loser vs. keeping the underlying and selling part of it.\n\n# 5: No naked calls on individuals\nSold naked calls on BA before the spike and lost -9k. Combined with #3, I bought back the contract at the peak price\n\nIf you have to sell naked calls, then go for a spread\n\n# 6: Gamma risk is not an issue if you can take assignment\nJust wait it out and accept assignment. Also it means selling weeklies is ok\n\n#7: Don't sell more than 3 underlyings at a time\nIt's hard to track the prices and manage the positions\n\n#8: Early assignment of single leg on spread\nThis can lead to large paper losses till the other leg assignment\n\n#9: Dividend risk no spreads\nOne of my legs got assigned before dividends (short) and I got charged a lot of money which I could have avoided if I bought back the spread earlier\n\n#10: Start with simplicity\nI started by selling too many underlyings and trying fancy things. I should have sold on index underlyings and kept things simple\n\n#11: Use a portfolio / Analyse tab\nHave a plan and use a beta-weighted portfolio to know (a) POP (b) break-even points (c) delta risk\n\n#12: Have a plan\nHave a predefined plan and stick to it. You should be able to win in any market direction\n\n#13: Stick to a plan\nStick to the plan; Reference back to the plan when you're confused and want direction. Write down plans & goals\n\n#14: Correlations can change\nIf you beta-weight multiple underlyings, the correlations can change drastically even day-over-day particularly if there's an individual.\n\n#15: Short stock can close automatically\nI had two short stock positions which I was ok to hold till recovery and the broker covered them because there wasn't enough liquidity.\n\n#16: Look at recent backtests\nLook at recent backtests to verify strategy. Spintwig has a great site\n\n#17: Look at price movements\nDon't sell calls when the price is 52-week high! Add Bollinger bands, etc to help and look at the last 1 year price movement", "id": "hwg4tb", "created_utc": 1595512772.0, "score": 123, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Sadly you forgot rule #0 Don't trade options until you have studied them.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "any recommendations on options trainig?

Covered Calls are great especially during periods of consolidation. Make money when the stock isn't making money. At any time, the stock can moon (look at AMD the past 2 days).

I was reading through this post, and it looks like if you think they are in the money, then you are making gains. Ex. I was looking at your 7/24 1600 calls. You said, the closed out at $101. That means TSLA needs to be at $1701 when the options expired to keep that price. If TSLA opens up at 1680 like yesterday, then those options were going to lose that extra $21 and fall from $101 to $80 by expiration on 7/24. \n\nFirst off, never trade in-the-money options going into earnings. Your risk is usually negative. Second, during your DD, make sure the strike price you pick can be profitable (that means you expect the stock to trade past the strike and the cost of the strike price). Finally, never use more than 10% of your portfolio on earning trades, and always expect a total loss as a possibility. If you open a position of $50k on TSLA for an earning trade, then expect a total loss, and make sure you are mentally ready for a loss of $50k.

Some of them will be out of business by the end of 2021.  Forward P/E of the S+P is probably closer to 40 right now, and that's a conservative estimate.  And the S+P is a shitshow.

That's not entirely insane for a company that's growing revenue at 30-50% and expanding margins at the same time.  Forward P/E could easily be 100 - after this perfomance during a pandemic, who doesn't think TSLA could put in 4 consecutive $4 quarters once normality resumes?  You with your hand up - stay after class, you're going home on a short bus.\n\nTSLA was ludicrously undervalued 6 months ago.

Look how that turned out.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Now, that's just the base case, ongoing operations pitch for a widget factory that sells cars and solar roofs.\n\nCars and solar roofs aren't crap.  I know a guy, lives out in the desert.  His roof puts 12kW out, mostly sold back to the grid.  A little runs his A/C, fridge, chest freezer and lights. Some of it charges his Model X and some of it charges his Wonderwall (TSLA's fancy storage battery for your solar equipped home).  He drives for free, has ice cold A/C in the desert for free, and makes money on the deal every month after expending the capital to purchase the fixed assets (Model X, roof, wonderwall).  \n\nNow pay attention.  The wonderwall only has to exist because the sun goes down, and Elon can't fix that - yet.  But what about that Model X?  Can we fit it into the same capital investment - ROIC model that the roof is in?   Pay attention - this isn't a story the Ford would tell you. \n\nA few more years of in-house tweaking and a software upload later, that Model X is now a fully autonomous vehicle.  Now my buddy only uses it from about 9 AM to 6 PM.  After that it's sittin in a driveway.  Why should it be?  Why shouldn't some drunk ass fool downtown whip out his cellphone and summon my buddy's Model X to come take his drunk ass home?  The app the drunk guy is using looks like Uber but it's TSLA branded.  Neither my buddy nor TSLA have to worry about liability because the self-driving car is safer than air travel.  The drunk guy gets home.  Oh, and all that shit about how much Uber drivers get paid and whether their gig is employed or independent?  Let's just slice that out of the business model entirely.  UBER 7/23 1p, I digress but that shitshow is out of business.  Meanwhile my buddy paid TSLA up front to own a nice sweet Model X and he gets paid back just for owning it while he sleeps.  \n\nWhat?  Someone puked in my buddy's backseat?  The autonomous car can hear it, drive to the cleaning depot.  Drunkie gets his Apple Pay charged for the cost of cleanup.  If it takes long to clean it, depot can dispatch an identical Model X to my buddy's house in time for morning commute.  Maybe it's a loaner - maybe it's someone else's Model X.  That happens automatically.   What does he care?  This isn't a custom Camaro - it's a commodity, a capital investment that he uses for trips in the day and that pays him when other people use it for trips at night.\n\nTSLA can own all trips, in fact.  Going to work?  Maybe a 3 is despatched.  Going to Costco for the weekly 500-lbs of grocery run?  You'll be needing a model X.  Maybe you'll want one with a built in freezer so the ice cream won't melt on the way home.  Going to your other buddy's house who lives completely off the grid up the side of an unpaved mountain switchback road?  You'll need the Cybertruck, maybe with a lift kit.  Or maybe by then TSLA will make the CyberJeep and the CyberTruck will be reserved for contractors or others who haul crap around.  You don't care, you just tell the app where you're going and why, in natural language, and software dispatches the correct vehicle.\n\nGoing to the airport? The fuck you are, I told you TSLA owns trips now.  The conventional airport is still there, maybe, but they're downsizing their parking lot because most folks go to the TSLAdrome, where they can pick up an ultralight electric single passenger quadcopter trip across town during rush hour.   Or a small electric passenger airplane that runs on fuel cells for weight savings.  (No TSA screening needed, this flimsy composite creature can't take out a skyscraper or a nuke plant.)  Maybe a few people still will be ferried to international airport for the usual Jet-A powered turboprops and jets.  \n\nBut: what if you're going to the ISS?  Or Luna City, or Ell-Five?  In fact, what if you want to go to Paris but get there in 90 minutes on a suborbital semiballistic rocket? Who do we know who just built a fucking commercial spaceport?  It's cloudy but I seem to recall the guy had an affiliation with TSLA, the company that owns trips.\n\nMaybe you're going on a long haul, in which case the Dragon might drop you off at Ell-Five or Hong Kong Luna before you board the Ouroboros to Mars, Ganymede, Titan or Triton.  Or maybe you're going on a really long haul, the brand new *T. S. S. New Frontiers* is crewed and ready for boarding.  Next stop: Tau Ceti system.\n\nBut maybe you're just doing maintenance on the TSLA LightPipe satellite network.  The one that made the Wonderwall obsolete.  Dragon ought to get you up there in a jiffy.\n\nAs a kid I read the same SF books Musk did and he's only on chapter 2.

If everything has been chugging along normally, their Implied Volatility stays pretty low since nobody expects there to be a huge move in either direction.  \n\n\nNow in the case of Tesla, which is a meme stock (basically incredibly popular and in the news all the time), there are drastically varying opinions. Some people believe they will fail their earnings for Q2 and the stock will crash down to 1000 or less points.   \nSome people believe they will succeed and the stock price will jump to 2000 points.  \nBecause of these drastically varying opinions and controversy, the Implied Volatility goes up.   \n\n\nBecause IV goes up, more people buy into the stock thinking they could earn some nice tendies. This increases the demand for options, which in turn raises the premium fee of buying those options.  \n\n\nThe demand and premium price stays high right up until earnings, since people are expecting a huge move in the stock price. As soon as the earnings gets released, everyone knows the truth and they know if they were wrong or right. The stock price changes quickly in after earnings trading to reflect the earnings report.  \n\n\nThis instantly crushes the Implied Volatility since nobody expects the price the move drastically anymore, and this GREATLY reduces the premium price of the option you own, so you lost all of that extra value due to increased demand.   \n\n\nOn top of that, your option expires tomorrow and the extrinsic value of your option decayed over time.
