{"title": "How is Tesla Stock not in a bubble?", "selftext": "A 200 billion market cap on a company which has never turned a proper profit. Full of debt and in a cut throat industry where margins are slim and competition is fierce. Tesla is being priced like it will take over the world, that 1/2 cars in the world will be a Tesla. Have people forgotten that Ford, GM, Audi and BMW are all making electric cars now? Have people forgotten the self driving technology being developed by Waymo? Have people forgotten the bottomless pit companies like Microsoft have to dominate in AI and self driving?\n\nThere is virtually zero moat with what Tesla does, once the germans ramp up full self driving electric cars, where will Tesla go?\n\nAs valuations rise, a company has to deliver more and more to justify its price. Eventually it gets to a point where it can't. I want to stress that most great companies were profitable at IPO, Google was profitable, so was Facebook. Companies which don't make money but live on a fairy tale story always end in tears.\n\nFor sure there is a future for Tesla, as electric cars become mainstream, but being priced to take over the car industry is a joke and will not happen. There are many people who drive an Audi and will not drive anything else. Software wise I don't see Tesla having any major lead over Big Tech, Microsoft and Audi can very much work together on a self driving electric car.\n\nI know Tesla is a cult and has loyal fans, but you can't compare it to Apple. Apple produce a great product (the iphone) with a massive moat (the apple ecosystem) around it, Tesla doesn't have a moat.\n\nPlease explain to me why this valuation is not a bubble?

You take that laser and shoot a precise pattern of rapid laser pulses towards a small droplet of molten tin to vaporize it, creating a tin plasma.

Or will another manufacturer ride the wave of EV tech that Tesla has started, leaving Tesla in the dust. Noone knows, it's new tech and everything is uncertain, which makes them a bit of a gamble.\n\nThen again, will the bubble ever pop?

Do we have any data or reason to believe that people will flock to reserve or buy those new cars like they do with Tesla? Do you think that the Tesla brand has any value right now like Apple does in the smartphone space? I think it does but to not to the same extent though.\n\nFrom what I understand, at least in the US, if you ever sold your cars through a dealership, there are legal limitations to start selling your cars directly. Does not having to sell through this middleman allow Tesla to be more cost efficient than other car makers?\n\nI remember reading all the articles during the production ramp of Model 3 about how that car is going to kill Tesla. In case you agreed with that analysis at the time, why didn’t the Model 3 production ramp kill Tesla and where did that analysis go wrong?\n\nAnother talking point I always come across is how they never had a profitable year. They stayed profitable for 3 consecutive quarters and were very likely to stay profitable for this quarter too if it were not for the pandemic. And even then, their deliveries were much better than expected and they may still surprise everyone by staying profitable this quarter. Does this not make the whole “never had a profitable year” a mere technicality at this point?\n\nIf you are ready to believe that the legacy automakers and big tech companies are going to mass produce self driving EVs that are better than the Teslas in no time when they don’t have a single such car on the road today, why do you hesitate to believe that Tesla will keep innovating at the same rate even after they scaled up the production of Model 3 so quickly and have the best “self driving” tech on road today?\n\nDo you think people care about being able to drive long distances when they buy a new car? If you do, how long do you think it is going to take Tesla’s competitors to put a charging infrastructure in place like the one Tesla already has? How much is going to cost them? Do they have that money and the know how? What is stopping Tesla from installing more superchargers at the existing locations (compatible with other cars) and start charging other companies’ cars for that?\n\nAnd all of this without even taking into consideration that they are about to start producing their own batteries and if successful, they could probably start selling those batteries to their competitors.\n\nI think anyone who thinks Tesla is not overvalued at $1200+ a share and $200B+ Market Cap especially after the CEO himself said the stock was overvalued at $900 is absolutely wrong. And if there is a market wide crash, I definitely believe that Tesla will crash and crash hard, maybe even more than 50%. But I don’t see any of their competitors posing an actual threat to Tesla anytime soon and I believe that Tesla is here to stay and prosper. And if I have to make a choice between them eventually justifying the $200B valuation or going bankrupt, I will definitely pick the former. But luckily I don’t have anyone holding a gun to my head to make that choice, so for now I am playing short term option contracts to cash in on the volatility.\n\nTLDR: Sure, it is overvalued at $1200 a share especially after the CEO said that it is overvalued at $900 but all the other companies are so far behind, it is more likely that they will justify their $200B+ valuation instead of going bankrupt.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "E L O N", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "What if TSLA isn't a car company?", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "aw, man.

Waymo may be close but they use a ugly and expensive LiDAR to get to it while Tesla only uses cheap and well integrated camera vision and has the biggest huge dataset in the world (that is always increasing with every mile driven by its costumers) and is already deploying beta versions of FSD over-the-air while 99.99999% of other other automakers' cars don't even support ota updates (Tesla does since 2012!).

They’ve very clearly stated they do not plan to do this alone. Their mission statement is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, not be the world’s only sustainable energy source. They know and WILL need the help of all big auto to go electric as the world goes all electric. They want/need ford, GM, Audi, and BMW to make electric cars. Tesla currently has a 17% market share in electric vehicles today, and all reputable analysis assumes this % will drop in projections by at least a third (even though it still hasn’t) as the world goes all electric in the next decade or two. Way smaller figure than 50%\n\n- From what I understand, comparing to Waymo is apples to oranges. Tesla is working toward coast to coast full self driving, Cali to NY. Waymo’s engineers have to go to the field to completely 3D map any area the car wants to drive in first (which it does do very well). Completely different goals and approach \n\n- Amazon and Microsoft do have a great chance to succeed in FSD, I hope they start to show it\n\n- Once you’ve driven a Tesla, you will quickly understand their moat, unless you’re a tech averse boomer who likes his flip phone over an iPhone. I hate to shock you, but there’s a reason there were 90000 Tesla’s delivered to customers during a pandemic. All without advertising, a factory shut down for half the quarter, and an increase from Q1, when ford and GM are facing unfathomable declines. People love their product.

Tesla has collected over 15 billion real world miles driven worth of data which is collected in their proprietary AI. This data involves snow, rain, odd road conditions, smoke and fire, etc. Google has the next highest amount of data with 20 million miles driven. 15 Billion versus 20 million. \n\n2. Waymo could be a close competitor but their data will be owned by the Chinese government. I wouldn’t be surprised if they get banned from the US like Huawei.

Though it's obviously wise to have some diversification, as you point out, I like to give it plenty of room to grow, while not being in it 100%.\n\nThere's a non-zero chance that TSLA could drop by some huge amount, say 90 percent, but then later recover. If you're 100% in TSLA, what would you do if your entire investment drops 90%? Would you be tempted to sell it all and never look back, or sell it all thinking to buy it back when it drops 95%? Either way, you could lose an enormous amount of money. But if you have some other investments (or even cash savings), and you still believe in the company long term, you have the option to move some of your other investment money into TSLA when it's down, and keep some of your other investments so in case TSLA goes to zero you won't be totally broke. And then if/when TSLA goes back up, instead of a loss you get a tremendous gain. (In other words, some of the benefits of diversification.)\n\nI have other investments, but I moved a (big) chunk into TSLA, and made a decision not to \"rebalance\" - that's the \"TSLA money\", and if it goes up then I don't move any to other investments, giving it unlimited room to grow, and if it goes to zero I wouldn't lose more than I can afford to lose, so I'm less likely to be scared out of TSLA. (And even if it were to go to zero, I would still have the satisfaction of having contributed to a major change to sustainable energy and transportation.) TSLA is an extremely volatile stock with enormous growth potential, so that seemed like a reasonable plan to me, with a lot less stress than the \"sell it all, buy it all\" approach that some are using.\n\nI do like to keep a little bit of cash as \"in event of zombie apocalypse\" money, which came in very handy to buy stocks (mostly TSLA) during the COVID-19 crash. As the market recovers, I may sell some (not all) of these \"extra\" shares to replenish the zombie apocalypse money (and/or replenish it from income), to keep ready for the next big drop whenever that may happen. That way I can increase my number of shares while having only a little of my TSLA shares at risk from any sudden change - people who were temporarily out of TSLA last week lost an enormous amount of potential gain.\n\nThe overall plan is to gradually grow my TSLA shares while taking very little chance of losing them. Over time I expect the company to continue to grow enormously and the stock to (on average) go way up, so TSLA would be an increasing percentage of my total investment.

Thinking about this \"priced in\" trope, it is a way of asking whether we expect that the expectations will meet or beat reality.  I'm expecting that Tesla will post a profit and good margins on the Y during a pandemic.
