{"title": "Tesla earnings expected move and strike selection", "selftext": "* Tesla (TSLA) reports Q2 earnings after the close Wednesday (\\~4:10pm)\n* Options are pricing an expected move of 12% by this Friday, just over half of the move expected over the next month, which is about 20%.\n* The trading day following the prior earnings (in April) TSLA was higher by as much as +8.5% intraday before reversing and closing -2.5%. \n* On the day following the last 4 earnings, TSLA stock has closed higher twice and lower twice.\n\nHere is the 1 month expected move chart for TSLA, with this Friday's expiration (via Options AI technology)  highlighted (+/-11.6%):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8exo5wkkjfc51.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd04dcc0f9f2a55248845f35148635c3edf247b\n\nThat's nearly $200 in either direction. The prior earnings in April, the stock had a $100 range intraday between its high and low (about 11%)  but only closed down -2.5%. The most it moved in either direction that day was +8.5%. The stock then went sideways for a few weeks before launching higher in early June and nearly doubling.\n\n*Neutral* \\- First let's look at neutral strategies that isolate the earnings itself, expiring this Friday: [Fly and Condor comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.37.02-AM.png)\n\nThe fly is quite a lot of risk so we'll focus on the **Iron Condor**,  which is 10 wide (the call spread and put spread are each 10 dollars wide, so risk is the total credit received from the 10). Here's how it  looks on the chart, with breakevens set near the expected move: [Condor](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.45.51-AM.png)\n\n*Educational note - The reason the max gain of a condor is the total credit received of both spreads, whereas the max risk is the width of 1  spread (the wider of the two if they are not equal width) is because the stock can only be beyond the range in one direction on expiration, not both. Therefore one side will always expire worthless, at max gain, even if the other side is max loss.*\n\n*Bullish* \\- For those thinking directionally the expected move can be used to help determine strike selection. Here's some trades based on a bullish price target looking out a bit further in time beyond  earnings, to August expiration. The bullish consensus is about $1930 in  August: [Bullish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.01.19-AM.png)\n\nHere's a closer look at the **long call spread** (+1590/-1910) to the expected move: [Call spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.48.46-AM.png)\n\nThe +1590/1910 call spread breaks even near $1687 in the stock. It  costs about $97, which when looking at the individual strikes is  \"striking\" because it is selling the 1910 calls at about the same price: [Strike comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-7.57.30-AM.png)\n\nIn other words, a call spread to $1910 can be bought for about the same price as buying the 1910 call outright. That breakeven is lower in the stock by more than $300. ($1687 vs $2007).\n\nLet's now zoom in on the bullish **short put spread** (-1590/+1270): [Short put spread chart](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.00.52-AM.png)\n\nThis is a high probability trade, that needs to risk more to make less. For those concerned about a collapse of implied volatility following an earnings event short spreads can be a way to express a  directional bias while also selling vol.\n\n*Bearish -* Going the other direction in August, (bearish expected move about $1275) we can see these trades, via Options AI technology: [Bearish trade comparison](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.10.45-AM.png)\n\nWe see the bearish **short call spread** is on the other side of the advantage of the bullish long call spread above. It has to buy that really far out of the money call (1920 strike) to define its risk. But those calls are really bid up and a high implied vol, which severely damages its risk-reward profile. (It is selling an at the money  call at a lower vol than it is buying its out of the money call.)\n\nThe **long put spread**  (+1600/-1285) has a much lower breakeven, and therefore a worse probability of profit, but it does not have the same issues of unfavorable IV skew as the short call spread above. \n\nAlso, the  strikes of that spread can be moved to make the put spread a bit more in  the money, moving the breakeven closer to where the stock is trading,  and taking advantage of the skew on the upside strikes: [ITM put spread](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-8.19.27-AM.png)\n\nTesla is likely to move a lot today before the event so exact strikes will change, but the overall percentage expected move should be roughly the same for all these examples. \n\nFull post [here](https://www.optionseye.com/tesla-earnings-preview-expected-move-directional-and-neutral-spreads-tsla/).", "id": "hvwhag", "created_utc": 1595433968.0, "score": 287, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Trying to build a fence around a dragon I see, good luck not getting burned", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "Very good analogy..don’t trade IC guys no spread is wide enough with such high volatility.

It was stuck in the $200 to $300 range.\n\nThen the Tesla Model 3 comes out, and starts landing on a number of best seller lists in 2019, and Tesla posted a profit in Q3 and Q4 of 2018. You'd think that would justify an increase in the stock price, right? Nope, TSLA's stock price went DOWN, it even fell below $200 a share at the height of Mr Market Man's absurd bearish sentiment. \n\nThere was a trigger to it sure, the Q1 2019 deliveries were lower than Q4 2018's numbers. People ignored the fact that auto-sales are seasonal, and all automakers sell more vehicles in the second half of the year than the first half, and took Tesla's 2019 Q1 sale numbers as a bearish sign, even though Q1's numbers were much better then they were a year ago.\n\n> The criticisms of Tesla half a year ago are still very much valid today.

If you're buying into TSLA now you're probably FOMOing. But if you did your research and bought into TSLA in the $200's and $300's back when the hype that TSLA was going bankrupt was rampant in the media and at reddit you were going against the market sentiment. That's when I bought, that's when a number of prominent finance channel Youtubers bought into it.\n\nAs to the valuation of TSLA today, I think there's sides to this. \n\nOn one hand I actually agree with you that I wouldn't buy into TSLA today, because the risk of Mr. Market man reversing course and hating TSLA stock again in the near future is too high. I think odds are good we eventually see a pull back, quite possibly to $700, or maybe worst case $500.\n\nOn the other hand, I think you're not valuing Tesla correctly. Tesla's not as simple as something like KO or JNJ to value. I **did not** buy TSLA for what numbers they'd post in 2019, or 2020, or 2021, or 2022, or even 2023. I'm looking over a decade out in 2030, as are many other TSLA longs. I believe TSLA has a **massive** opportunity to grow into a trillion dollar company overtime. I think TSLA will be producing around 10 million BEV's a year by 2030.\n\nThe other automakers are huge today yes, and sell millions or tens of millions of vehicles today, yes. But guess what, not all market incumbents survive when new technology disrupts the market. Nokia utterly dominated the cell phone market, they sold 9 of the 10 best selling cell phone models. And yet that market dominance couldn't save them when Apple came along with the iPhone, Nokia tried to adapt to the technology shift, but they were too slow and too late.\n\nThe legacy automakers are trapped in a damned if they do, damned if they don't situation. They're making a bunch of money off of ICE vehicles right now. If they switch to selling BEV's they'll be cannibalizing that lucrative money maker, and they'll need to pour tens of billions of dollars into the R&D and other expenses of shifting to BEV's. And just like Tesla struggled to make a profit selling BEV's for a while, so will the legacy automakers when they make the shift. So why would they want to shift to BEV's in the first place?\n\nWell, because if they don't they WILL die when BEV & battery tech improves to the point that they reach cost parity with ICE vehicles. By that point no one will want an ICE car, and it'll be far too late for them to shift to BEV's.", "score": -3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "if you knew anything about reddit tesla and elon have been hated on reddit for many years since those kids in asia were stuck in that cave", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah, daily threads \"Tesla is detached from reality\" are hilarious.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I would say the mix is consistent with the world at large.

It is true that some net buying or selling of stock can occur after expiry depending on the delta curve of long and shot options at each strike, but it's not a very large effect.  Really what happens is the portfolio delta changes but the delta was already hedged.  Some times the resulting delta change from expiry will be large and the hedging software can decide to move some shares around, but firms do their best to be *roughly* delta neutral in an expiration on expiry day (i.e. long and short about the same amount of options delta when all strikes and deltas are added up).\n\nTechnically a firm that does this badly would be required to buy or sell a lot of shares the day after expiry.

Tesla swings on no news at all, it makes no sense that they are the most valuable auto manufacturer. Stocks used to be based on actual performance, Tesla is based on hype. Again, you got lucky riding the hype wave, in a market that makes no sense. I don't think you have any idea about the market, you are just very lucky.\n\n> Tesla consumers (Tesla never did) no longer receive subsidies for US sales, while other manufacturers do\n\nWhat do you call those government run ZEV credits, and other similar systems in other countries? Those are subsidies made by the government that Tesla directly benefits from. Without these government subsidies, Tesla would not be profitable.\n\n> Also way behind schedule... Model 3 came out right on time, Model Y came out early\n\nIts always on time when you change the schedule. If I remember correctly the schedule of when the model 3 was going to come out changed a couple times, and it just so happened the most recent schedule was actually on time. However, the \"s curve\" never really happened. Also, I am still waiting for that 2016 FSD drive, and the million robotaxis this year. FSD related stuff is so far behind schedule its ridiculous.\n\n> Good luck with your short position, you sound really smart so you should probably double your exposure there :)\n\nAssuming I am a short seller now, even after saying \"Difference is I've put money behind my statements\". I think I've mentioned that I don't touch cult stocks like Tesla, short or long. I think Tesla is way overvalued and in a sane world is a great short opportunity, but in this crazy world where nothing makes sense anymore its not worth the risk. Stocks used to be based on the fundamentals, Tesla is based on hype.\n\nI suspect that as it becomes clear FSD is not happening on Tesla's hardware, the hype will die down a lot, but I have no idea how long it will take people to realize this, so I am being smart and staying away from the cult.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> The reason I don't put any money behind it is because the market doesn't care about logic.\n\nAh, in following this logic, I will simply ignore you then: \nhttps://twitter.com/talebwisdom/status/1197202572941115398?lang=en", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You want to know what I have in my portfolio?

{"title": "DD: The dollar, the next SPY crash, and JPow hoisted by his own petard", "selftext": "Ok. First things first. I have a masters in finance and was an econ professor for five years. I do have some idea what I'm talking about. However:\n\n1. Timing is always impossible. I know there have been several prophets on here who proclaimed the end of times, only to make fools of themselves. I have suspicions about when the crash is coming, but won't claim I know with any certainty.\n2. Macroeconomics and our current financial system are so, so, fucking complicated that NOBODY really understands them perfectly. You can listen to two legitimately genius dudes on macro podcasts who are saying precisely opposite things. So - you can have a hunch. I do. But at the end of the day, NOBODY knows anything.\n\nOk then. That being said. Here's one thing I feel pretty strongly about in all markets: there are no easy fixes; the rubber *always* meets the road, eventually.\n\nSo what's fueling this insane stock rally? Obviously it's the Fed. It's the Fed pumping money like crazy. And what will pop this bubble? ***When printing money itself starts hurting the situation, rather than helping it.***\n\nExhibit one: The dollar index over the past six months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp82kbk3adc51.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9f406fae57dc932bc6a9bd7f91e5016f192b8c\n\nThe dollar index, ($DXY) measures the strength of the dollar against a few other currencies. Specifically:\n\n* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR), 57.6% weight\n* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY) 13.6% weight\n* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP), 11.9% weight\n* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight\n* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK), 4.2% weight\n* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF) 3.6% weight\n\nThe dollar has been gradually weakening since April, and yesterday it absolutely nose-dived. Why? Some say the past months dip has been because the dollar is where people run to in times of crisis, and now that the crisis is passing, they don't need dollars as much anymore. Yesterday's dip in particular was attributed to the EuroZone passing a stimulus, giving investors faith that the Euro zone will remain unified and strong (there were rumors of it potentially breaking apart).\n\nHonestly, I don't know why the dollar has been tanking for three months (I have guesses, that's all), and anybody who tells you they do know is a lying sack of shit. And maybe the reason it's been tanking is less important than what the *narrative* around it will be, if it drops much further. You probably guessed it. What's everyone gonna be saying?\n\n**The Fed is printing too much money. They're inflating the shit out of the dollar!**\n\nAgain, whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, because if that's the narrative, the further devaluation of the dollar becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: other countries don't want to hold dollars anymore because they'll lose their value. More sellers of dollars = $DXY drops even further, etc, etc.\n\nAnd now you're JPow watching $DXY drop down past 93, and you're starting to shit your pants. Because the rubber is meeting the road. The Fed wants modest inflation (2-3%) because it will make their debt worth less. But at the end of the day, a*bsolutely nothing scarier than* ***hyperinflation***. That's the nightmare scenario.\n\nAnd you know hyperinflation sneaks up on you. You have to be fucking vigilant. Not only do you have to stop printing, you might have to RAISE interest rates to avoid inflation getting out of control.\n\nBut again, it ultimately doesn't even matter if JPow changes his colors or not, what matters is the *narrative* that he's going to have to stop printing.\n\nThe market might already be sensing this... while Gold has been shooting up nicely and consistently, Silver has been fucking killing it the past two days. Maybe this \\^ is why.\n\n**Positions:** As I said at the beginning, even if I was 100% sure things were gonna go down like this, I'm wary of trying to time it. I have IWM and SPY puts for November, and GLD and SLV calls, for times between September and January 2022.\n\nNote: Even if this is totally wrong, I'm think there are other factors that will rain hellfire down on the market by November. Second wave in New York + Uncertainty around elections --> both of these could actually *cause* the above cycle to start. Dollar strength is about faith in the US government. Remember that if Biden wins, Trump is still president for another two months. Those two months, where we're not sure if he's even going to leave office willingly or not, could be enough to shake $DXY down and start this thing off.\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nTL;DR  November SPY $280 and IWM $120 ,  SLV and GLD leaps\n\nEDIT: 7/22: Dollar index down bigly again today. You'll know if something is happening if yields shoot up past .70 (Now .58). That will indicate people unloading treasuries because they're scared of dollar devaluation. Fed will then have to buy even more treasuries to keep rates down. It's a death spiral.

The US made an agreement with OPEC countries that they can invest in US markets as long as they agree to trade oil with all countries in only US dollars. Prior to this agreement created by the Nixon administration, OPEC countries were only accepting gold bullion as payment for oil shipments after they felt like they were unjustly attacked by Israel during the [Yom Kippur War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War). In the same time frame, OPEC countries also agreed to create an embargo against the United States and some ally countries which led to the [1973 Oil Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis). The resolution to the 1973 Oil Crisis was achieved by Henry Kissinger, which led to the creation of the [Petrodollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrodollar_recycling).\n\nAs the price of oil has fallen due to lack of demand, the value of the dollar is going down with it. This leads to some legitimate ideas about middle east US military intervention, and dollar/oil value manipulation by military struggles in the region.\n\nI don't think it's because the fed is printing money. I think the reason the dollar is falling is because it's based on oil, which no one has any use for at the moment. Remember: currency has both intrinsic and extrinsic value.
