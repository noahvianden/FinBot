{"title": "Unusual Options Activity from the week. LB, VXX, PINS, PTON.", "selftext": "What's up my fellow options traders. Swaggy is back with a few plays that caught my eye from last week in the unusual options activity segment. A quick note about my [option flow sentiment tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I created and where I am scanning most of this data from. I noticed it was tracking WAY too much data, so in order to keep the accuracy higher, I've modified the script to analyze much more trades that would be marked as \"unusual\" instead of any block trade that was at the money. It is definitely much easier to look through the data now.\n\nHere's a few things I spotted this week.\n\n**LB - L Brands**\n\nOn Tuesday this week a player rolled out their long call position to a further OTM strike price. They sold their position of 15,000 January 2021 calls at the $17.50 strike price and collected almost $7 million in premium. They then opened a new position in the same expiration with 15,000 calls at the $22.50 strike price. Their original position was 7% in the money, the position they rolled out to was 20%(!) out the money for January 2021 expiration. I'm not sure what initial amount of capital they entered the position with, however, they were willing to risk $4 million on a 20% OTM play. Personally, this is the kind of unusual activity I like to see if I am going to enter a position. Very interesting. It's important to note from the graphic when someone rolls out a position vs entering a brand new position the sentiment will look the opposite. Usually they close out a larger position (in this case closing the original position was bearish), and enter a smaller position, but further expiration or strike price for less premium (in this case entering a new long).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibrdu6dj89d51.png?width=2284&format=png&auto=webp&s=8642afd38f86dfecb6fe7f1fa83ce9a1bb0bf992\n\n**PINS - Pinterest**\n\nPINS saw some notable bullish option flow come through this week. The largest position was on Wednesday where a player purchased 11k CALL contracts for November expiration at a strike price of $26 (3% OTM at the time). The position size was approx $4 million in premium. 11k call contracts, 3% OTM strike price, November expiration, all pretty bullish and qualify it for 'unusual activity'. The stock has been pretty stagnant since reaching high point of $26.50 a couple weeks ago.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6no4qz4u89d51.png?width=2282&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7b27b3583c3108fe9552423b0802b7a502736b\n\n**VXX - (VIX Short-Term Futures)**\n\nFor those unfamiliar with VXX, it tracks VIX which is a volatility play. On Monday last week I came across some bearish activity, betting that volatility would go DOWN by September. Multiple directional bets were placed in LONG PUTS and also a BEAR SPREAD where they purchased a long PUT closer OTM and sold a short PUT further OTM to reduce the risk on the play. In my opinion, this week and next week's earnings reports will provide us with guidance moving forward (as all companies refused to give guidance previously) and should ease the markets in terms of volatility. I think volatility might pick back up again as we get closer to elections and fall season of potential 2nd/3rd corona wave.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ea8jax0099d51.png?width=2534&format=png&auto=webp&s=5536aa790ce29045b9d855f65f2ce98766bba26f\n\n**PTON - Peloton Inc**\n\nPTON has been a beast of it's own having very high volume in option flow recently. This lucrative meme stock is expected to blow earnings out of the water and the stock price has nearly doubled in the last 2 months. Last week witnessed a slew of bullish call option activity. They ranged from large bullish bets at the money, to selling puts, and also one September 18 bet for 1,000 CALL contracts with a premium of $330k and strike price of $80 (25% OTM). These are pretty directional bets with a high volume of contracts.\n\nIt looks like the one large 'bearish' sentiment activity could possibly be a fund selling a covered call on a larger share position. The strike price was $65 and 1.18% OTM at the time. If the stock stays above $65 they collect 1.18% return on the share position as well as pocket the $3.85 million in premium from selling the calls. Assuming they are covered calls that would mean the position size of the shares is 3k contracts \\* 100, or 300,000 shares. Also assuming a current share price of about $65 means their entire share position (or at least the amount covered by the calls) is about $19.5 million. The $3.85 million they collect in premium + the 1.18% they could collect if the stock stay above $64 ish would be a 20% return overall on the play. Keep in mind they collect the premium from the covered calls regardless if the stock goes up or down, as it provides protection.\n\nPeloton reports earnings in 2 weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdodmh6m99d51.png?width=2526&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa266e8dc9431015729a92f39e2b320486fbf9c", "id": "hydixo", "created_utc": 1595793259.0, "score": 365, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "I look forward to this analysis every week.

Set a GTC limit order immediately after opening a trade\n\nConsider rolling up/down/out your viable losers at ~21 days to expiration\n\nClose your trades before expiration. 3 days until expiration at the latest. Near the money losers rarely become winners in the final week and finding a liquid market right before expiration is very hard. \n\nCalculate your risk reward ratio before entering trades to be at least $.30 premium on every $1 risked on a 70% probability of profit trade. Implied volatility is usually overstated so take profits early to raise your win rate. Anything less than that ratio is a zero sum game or worse.\n\nThe majority of your trades should have defined risk. No more than 5% of balance at risk per symbol.  Scale up from 1% to 5% based on quality (IV Rank and risk reward ratio you can get)\n\nBuy cheap protection when you can get it. Expensive long positions significantly reduce delta on a narrow spread. \n\nTrade small and trade often. A high number of occurrences is critical to seeing probabilities play out the way they should.\n\nDon't dwell on losers. No one wins them all. Learn whatever you can and then move on.\n\nKeep half your balance in cash in a margin account\n\nBe very slow to adjust trades. I've turned many a winner into a loser that way.\n\nTrade beta neutral so your portfolio profit is greatest at where the S&P 500 is today meaning some bullish, some bearish, and some non-directional strategies. \n\nAlways use limit orders and start your initial offer slightly above the mark price. Give your broker time to find a buyer.\n\nDon't force trades. You will feel better later having no trade than a bad trade. Not losing money is right up there with making money.\n\nDiversify across sectors and asset types\n\nHave a few core ETFs that you trade routinely each month.

IV should be significantly higher (maybe 2x as high) for the closest expiration date. The whole purpose of this play is to take advantage of the inherent IV spike during earnings, so you want to sell as close as possible.\n2. Call credit spread \\~10 delta, no higher than 12. Put credit spread as low as possible because tickers can fall a lot faster than they rise. This ensures your condor has broad wings AND acts as your risk management because you won't have time for any adjustments after earnings hits. Don't be slick, don't sacrifice your wings to squeeze in more credit.\n3. Selling for 16% credit on your collateral is consistently attainable.

Because of this Christians burned other shrines and temples, such as mythracist temples.

But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body.

I expect a decent fake pump off this into Thursday because although people are acting like it could be a surprise it really isn’t. Zero interest rates, continued easing seems to be the foregone conclusion but market loves suspense games. \n\n***Quick postmortum of Tendie Stimulus 1***\n\nCongrats to those of who you rode with me on that VXX play--the timing and accuracy worked out so well I'd be lying if I said even I wasn't shocked.  If you went with the 32/34 plays you still saw some profit, but the 30c on 7/24 strike was where it was at.  I updated in the comments on the first post about the switch to 30c on Wednesday and here on my Twitter --sorry if you didn't see it at the time, I'll try to put updates to call/strike on here too at the top this time, not just Twitter (i actually have a real job now, too, unfortunately, that requires me from time to time :()\n\nWe got a big assist from China on the volatility, and in my trading I am trying to remember that mean ol' Mr.China is not going anywhere this week.  If I'm being honest, I think it was a bigger factor last week than even the floundering negotiations.  So, to a certain extent, I can only take so much credit for that call.  Please remember China retaliation is coming if you're still committed to trading both indexes and volatility, and be more conservative in your approach for a bit.\n\nThat said, this week is set up to be another bumpy ride.  Things have been a little confusing, so\n\n*Here's an update on what's happening with negotiations:*\n\nRepublicans, who have not done a thing about the HEROES act until this past week, were busy the past 7 days fighting among *themselves* for the *first* offer to make to Democrats.  Them getting this starting point out on Monday is in no way a victory for the process; this was actually supposed to be done by last Tuesday.  The noteworthy tidbits:\n\n* Donald Trump demanded a payroll tax cut, supported by Mnuchin, early last week (think of this as like a temporary easing measure which allows both individuals and employers to gain an extra 1-3% in their check).  Senate Republicans pushed back, and the WH surprisingly capitulated on the demand.\n* Their next internal squabbles had to do with the Extended UI benefits (I'll get to that in a minute)\n* The big breakthrough this weekend was committing to another round $1,200 Stimulus checks, and an extension on the eviction moratorium (this is HUGE for the housing market)\\*\n\n***So, what's important here?***\n\n* The payroll tax rebuff against the White House orders was important because the GOP knew the Dems wouldn't have it, so they wouldn't add it.  **Senate Republicans already ceding ground on an issue that was key to the President.**  As much as McConnell postures, this would indicate that Republicans understand how sensitive they're re-election chances are to the outcomes here and Momma Pelosi kinda has them by the short and curlys.\n* Repubs came out on Thursday saying two key things: 1) UI extension would fall from $600 to $100 a week in their proposal and 2) they were willing to apply a \"temporary\" extensin of UI benefits as a stopgap measure; with benefits enhancement set to expire this coming week.  PELOSI SAID HELL NO TO THE TEMP EXTENSION.  Again, Dems know they have them cornered.  Republicans this weekend started throwing out raising the weekly to $200, up from $100, and since this is the starting point of negotiations I think the Republicans know they may have to bend over all the way to $350 or $400 weekly, even, and are trying their best to come in low enough to get out with $300.\n\n*\\*Side note: the eviction moratorium is a huge win for Dems, but it's also a win for staving off what was clearly a coming housing crisis.  I believe there is another win wrapped inside this win; at some point down the road, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next month, but sometime in the next year, a mortgage/rent relief program is going to be floated.  They already introduced a city-wide lottery here in Los Angeles where you can have your missed COVID rent paid by the government if you can prove you lost employment due to COVID.  There is just no way they can be expecting all the people who got a free ride to be saving and pay back lump sums of multiple thousands to landlords once this all clears up.  I guarantee there is a nationwide rental credit or something in the future, it's economically unfeasible not to.  The hard part will be figuring out how to not punish the people who scrimped and did things right and used their UI/COVID check to pay rent on time, while rewarding those that didn't*\n\n***So, what will happen  in the coming week***\n\n* People are dancing over the $1,200 stimulus check announcement--and yes, I think it will provide a healthy boost for the morning session tomorrow.  I hope so, at least, given I'm holding a 7/27 323c on SPY and a QQQ 7/31 160c (which I'm actually not terribly happy with myself for buying).  But please remember, that's only a part of what is the beginnings of the new package negotiations.  One thing I will say is that the market actually cares way less about UI than the Stimulus checks--the $1,200 covers the midle class working folks if it's  up to $75,000.  Extended UI is also for survival with a cherry on top, the $1,200 affects retail, travel, tech, etc.  That said, this week will still be volatile\n   * Pelosi is going to say, probably Monday afternoon/evening after Republicans send theri package that it's a no.  Markets will get nervous because they will act like they're surprised by this, and freak out that a deal won't get done in time.  Rhetoric around a no deal will get ratcheted up.\n   * There are still probably at least two full back and forth draft cycles between both sides before we see a deal\n   * China is still going to retaliate\n   * All the tech CEOs are being brought to the hill (moved from Monday to Wednesday).  They are speaking in front of the Democratic house rather than the Republican Senate.  I don't expect it to be kind, particularly in light of recent Bezos hate, Zuckerberg Civil Rights issues, and Papa Elon's recent shenanigans (though he won't be there).\n   * Non-partisan take: Republican or Democrat I think it's pretty clear Pelosi is going to win this one.  a) COVID is getting worse, and the Republican platform largely centered around it being better b) Republicans frittering away off-session time not making any progress is bad optics c) they're already capitulating on key offers d) this is going to THE issue of the coming election--aside from COVID, which Donnie has botched\n\n***How I'm playing it***\n\nHonestly, I'm a fucking QQQ addict, and even I will be staying away until EOW if I can dump these 7/31 calls for a profit Monday morning/early afternoon.  It's just not time yet.  **This week is a week to play invididual equities, not indexes.  If you hit on an index you're not gonna hit THAT big, and if you lose you're going to lose big and be like yeah, I pretty much could see this coming**.  So, if things generally are unfolding as I think;\n\n*Monday*\n\nDumping: my QQQ calls and my SPY 7/27 once/if I see a profit in the morning session. Moving into: GRMN\\* 90p 8/21, CRWD 105 8/21c\\*\\*, SPOT\\*\\*\\* 300c 8/7 or 8/21 depending on how it is PM\n\nEDIT: u/hospitalchurn brought up ZS here too in the comments, which I didn’t know much about. At first glance looking like as strong as a play as CRWD if not even stronger. \n\n*Tuesday*\n\nIf we haven't tanked and VXX has reset to sub 29 VXX: 7/31 29c (dumping likely Thursday)\n\n*Wednesday* Sitting on my hands but that's a god damn lie because I'll probably have found some rididulous YOLO on the daily thread and will move my GRMN put money into it\n\n*Thursday*\n\nDumping VXX, reassessing, and likely putting a bunch into 8/7 and 8/10c's anticipating a done deal and a bounce back from a beating this week.  Will load up on QQQ as well as I think tech hearings will be a bottom of sorts\n\n*Friday*\n\nUpdating this DD on why I did none of this and instead put my bank account and heart into the bank of Su Bae.  But hopefully not lol.  AMD has to come down.  I'll most likely be staying in the SPY and QQQ call game for 8/7\n\n*Notes:*\n\n\\*GRMN is going to get WAY worse; similar situation have seen stocks drop by the 20% to 30% range in the immediate aftermath.  The fact that they are doing TERRIBLY at communicating with their customers is a godsend because it means they have plenty more bad news to trickle out in pieces next week.  They were cucked, yes, but as always happens in these situations, their lack of honesty, proactiveness, and trasnparency is going to cuck them way more.  Forward guidance during their earnings call will be poopy, and there was already talk that they were honestly topped out at 100 a share.\n\n\\*\\*CRWD has kind of taken a beating this month, and cloud security is going to be a big winner as the GRMN story breaks more.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Erbody that know whatsup knows SPOT is going to hit 300 sometime soon.  Their roster is just too off the charts, I expect their forward guidance on the earnings call to set them over the top.  I'm also reall scared of earnings this season though, so my thoughts may change on this.\n\n**TLDR: The $1,200 check is only a starting point, and not the bread and butter of coming, tense negotiations this week around UI benefits extension.  With shuttle negotiations coming up and lots of doomsday rhetoric around them, China acting a fool, and the tech hearing coming on Wednesday, it may be best to play individual stocks based on your research and some discounts than dive back into indexes just yet.  GRMN puts and CRWD calls should print at least Monday, VXX back in play later in the week, SPY and QQQ calls on Friday**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*As always, updates will be a hodge podge of here and my Twitter of the same name.  Also as always, I know politics as I am a fundraiser for political campaigns, non profits, and foundations, but I am NOT a financial expert or somebody who works in the field, so don't bet the farm on anything I write if something doesn't align with your own Crayola drawings.  We're all just playing hunches and doing our best to justify them; I'm on a streak now, but all streaks end lol.*\n\nEdit: further reading on upcoming tech hearing https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21335735/tech-antitrust-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google-preview\n\n**Monday Update 3:00 PM PST**\n\nPositions\n*CRWD (B+)* turned out to be a solid move, up 3.5% on the day.  Not an A because GRMN didn't move down with it, lending less credence to the theory that GRMN's fall was the catalyst for CRWD's rise.  Can't really ask for much more than a 3.5% day though\n*SPOT (C+)* pretty much stagnant at about 1.5%, but bought somewhere around there during PM.  Such slow movement right before earnings is worrisome, but hoping for a big day tomorrow.  If it's not moving PM, I may dump it.\n*GRMN (DNC)* didn't end up buying it because I saw they were back online before open.  Would've been a big ol' F.\n\nNews\nThis is a pretty good summary of what Republicans are proposing in the HEALS act, their answer to HEROES:\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/politics/stimulus-negotiations-republican-plan/index.html\n-The key changes: the additional $500 for dependents from the first CARES act would now be for all dependents, not just those under the age of 17\n-The $600 will be replaced with $200 for extended UI benefits, higher than the initial $100 Republicans floated on Friday.  Look for this to end around $350.  In October, it will be replaced with a 70% of current worker salary cap, up to $500.\n\nHow I'm moving\nNot doing much, for now.  If SPOT doesn't move much in PM I'll ditch it most likely.  Due to the recent Under Armour news I'm thinking of long puts.  For right now I like where I'm at with cloud security and will be searching for new plays tonight.  If you have any recommendations on what to look into hit me up, please.  Obviously if I add it here I'll tag you.\n\nIf we're green tomorrow--depending on how green--I may (gasp) consider some QQQ puts.

The securities laws seek, to the extent possible, to put all shareholders on an equal footing. One technique in achieving this end is the simultaneous disclosure of information to all shareholders. It is one reason why companies give advance notice of quarterly investor calls and release of information through public press releases.\n\n**The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) does not permit companies to decide who they like, who they dislike, and then to disclose information only to the favored group. This flatly contravenes the spirit of the securities laws.**\n\n\nBlocking access to Trevor's Twitter feed is certainly not at the same level as refusing to disclose quarterly financial information, but there is value in the Twitter information and it certainly has the potential to move the stock price (in either direction).\n\n\nI understand Nikola has an \"official\" Twitter page but it is much less active and one HUGE discrepancy I can most recently point out was Trevors tweet announcing he is buying 91MM shares. Unless I missed it, this was not tweeted on Nikola's official twitter page.
