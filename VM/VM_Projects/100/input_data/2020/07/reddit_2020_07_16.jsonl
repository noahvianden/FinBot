A lot of people before COVID did go towards Netflix’s other competitors such as Hulu and Amazon Prime. But what I’ve realized and many others have is that Even though competitors such as Amazon Prime have much a larger selection (somewhere in the range of 17,000 movies/tv shows), Netflix has by far much better quality in their selections, and this whole stay at home ordeal has proven that to quite a lot of people. I was considering Netflix to be falling behind in the streaming services before COVID, but It’s now become much more clear on the current stance of Netflix. \n\nHOWEVER! My current opinion is that I don’t believe that either one of these competitors are gonna stamp the other one out, I’ve seen many cases (as in my own family as well) where people just get both, and pay $20 a month rather then having to decide.

Since I’m trying to be more frugal, I’ll just switch providers every few months. Except for D+. Goddamn the mouse and their 3 year special pricing. All streaming services need to offer discount annual/multi-year subscription packages. Too many viable competition - need to lock down subscribers.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "The problem for Netflix over the long haul is multiple:\n\n1) None of their competitors is fully stood up yet and they're already reducing projected subscriber counts less than a year after the first (Disney+) got stood up, and Netflix is going to lose massive amounts of content over the next few years. They've all been hobbled to one degree or another due to COVID-related production delays, but those won't last forever. Plus, Disney+, HBOMax, Peacock all are missing IP because of pre-existing contracts with Netflix. All have said, to one degree or another, that they will not be renewing those contracts. As that IP \"returns home\" and their original programming gets in full swing competing services are going to be more attractive to customers while Netflix becomes comparatively less so.\n\n2) Netflix has been taking on massive amounts of debt trying to develop original programming to make up for that anticipated loss of content. Its competitors are content creators first, and streamers second. Even if they somehow able to service all that debt, they simply can't compete with the combined content creation capabilities of Time Warner, Disney, Universal, etc. And if they aren't growing subscribers as quickly as expected (they're not), then their ability to service that debt load in the future can quickly start becoming an issue.\n\n3) Speaking of that original programming, quite frankly most of it isn't very good at all (just try to watch some of those Adam Sandler movies that they threw $275 million at him to make). People like to focus, understandably, on the good ones. But a lot of that debt they're taking on is essentially being thrown down the drain.\n\n4) Netflix's primary advantage has been having an essential monopoly on the streaming business. Hulu and Prime Video have been around, but it's a side business for Amazon and Hulu has primarily been in the rebroadcast business rather than creating originals. With the expiring relationship with Comcast and Disney's acquisition of Fox, Hulu is going to be getting a lot of new programming in the future. Netflix has had its choice of properties to acquire for their service in the past, but there is going to be a lot more competition for the best ones going forward which means a lower net quality of Netflix original programming and much higher costs.\n\n5) There are even more streaming services coming. Discovery Networks has already announced that they will be putting up their own and CBS/Viacom is working on one as well. And I haven't even mentioned Apple TV+. \n\n6) All of that adds up to subscription-hopping - something Netflix has never really had to deal with before. People may still subscribe to Netflix, but necessarily for 12 months out of the year. Maybe they'll pause their accounts for a month to catch up on HBOMax, maybe a month on Disney+, maybe a month on Peacock, etc. Even if their subscribers start pausing a single month out of the year, Netflix's revenue will take a serious dip.\n\nNetflix isn't going anywhere (unless their debt service winds up crippling them), but their days as the undisputed King of the Hill of OTTs is likely coming to an end within the next few years.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "During our stay at home phase, my girlfriend and I had subscriptions to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBO. \n\nNothing beats Netflix.

I generally only buy weeklies unless it's a ETF like SPY. So the premiums move faster on Thur/Fri then they do on Mon/Tue. So saying cut losses at 20% might work on Monday but on friday morning that might mean 1 bad candle.\n\nSo have a plan. If i enter a weekly on Monday i go in saying if this drops to -30% then I'm out. If I think it will run then I made a bad entry and I'll try to re-enter.

If for example i hit 30% I set a mental stop at around 15%.
