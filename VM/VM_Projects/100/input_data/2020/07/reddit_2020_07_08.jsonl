That would be exponential growth.

This is why it is SO powerful to get a stock when it is low-value (if it blows up). Say you get a stock at 2 bucks. Then it goes to 4 (2 dollars yours, 2 dollars profit). You’re up 100%. Then the stock goes up 50% from 4 so it is at 6, but guess what? Since you got in at 2, you are up 200% (not 150%) because 6-4 = 2 (2 dollars yours, 4 dollars profit). Let’s now say the stock goes up 100% from 6 and is at 12. You’re not up 250% (which would be 100+50+100), but a whopping 500% because your 2 dollars are now 12 (2 dollars yours, 10 profit). Don’t be fooled, though. This is a dangerous realization. You still need great companies for the growth - you can’t get into any “cheap” company. In addition, stock price fluctuation is also tied to market cap, so be sure to check shares outstanding. A low ticker price does not imply a low market cap (if high shares outstanding). \n\nYour bottom statement is also correct.

And how?\n\nProduction targets are rigidly set in most modern mines. You can't just decide to ramp up production.

No idea if they made it.\n\n> just because they THINK gold is in these here lands, they are often still speculating and actually need to pull the gold out. \n\nFalse for all modern mines except fraudulent ones.

Balance sheets can be quite different depending on several things, including management style.

There will be efficient businesses and wasteful ones. \n\n> Why? And how?\n\nMany ways, but here is one example. Prices increase and suddenly a particular gold mine that was dormant seems more appealing to mine. They need to work through the EPA (maybe?... actually interesting thought given the current EPA lapses), the fed, and the state government. They need to hire people. They need to bring equipment. You are right... they can't just decide to ramp up production, but are they going to try to make hay when the hay is there or are they going to operate in the same business environment that they were running in when the price of gold is 40% lower? \n\nOr... shit.. companies that leverage out on some of the companies because the time is right and it can be easy to justify funneling money to other entities under the guise of 'doing whats best for the company'\n\nTo be clear, I am not a gold expert, but to look at the price of any product and presume that the company is going to be profitable based on the market price of the product is straight-up silly. \n\n> False for all modern mines except fraudulent ones\n\nMaybe. The entire pipeline of gold mining is going to fill as prices increase... from the big dogs to the small ones. The best of class producers are more likely to be prepared for this and also able to prepare for the inevitable drop in future price, as well. \n\nIf I remember right, there was some considerable consolidation on the last go around.\n\nThere are going to be other mine-related companies that will offer prospects of better futures, but aren't going to have the deep pockets of the best in class miners.

The only speculation is on inferred reserves.

The real question is, as they scale up their revenue over the next couple years, can they expand their margin just a few percent?\n\nPeople like to compare TSLA unfavorably to existing companies, but if they can get to TYTA or F or GM levels of margin by 2022, their earnings will skyrocket.  And in the attempt to do so, they are unburdened by union contracts and pension overhangs and have modern healthcare arrangements.  For people who do not understand how much of a drag on earnings that can be for the traditional automakers, let me just point out that before the 2007 GM bankruptcy, they were literally *paying Medicare costs* on family members of employees who had died 50 years prior.  These people would have been eligible for straight Medicare from the Fed Gov but at some stupid negotiation in the past GM had agreed to take on the actual costs borne by Medicare to care for its ex employees’ health because some politico promised them union compliance in return.  One analyst at that time pointed out that when you bought a GM car, you were basically buying a retired person’s pension and healthcare expenses; the shoddy car they gave you with it was an afterthought.\n\nTSLA hasn’t any of that overhang to deal with.  No reason it can’t expand margins a percent or two and be making $50 a share by 2022.

There are literally millions of millionaires who were born into poverty. You are vastly oversimplifying it.. but that's generally how you strawman.. No one said it's purely work ethic. Competence, compassion, conscientiousness, communication skills, etc are all important traits for becoming successful. Yes, many of these are affected by our upbringing and that does fall on our 'luck' or privilege of having good parents, but that's your luck, those parents probably had to work hard, and make very hard choices to get to where they were to be in a position to give you that privilege of good upbringing in the first place.

They also believed that their “system” was fair and that they deserved for wealth. Not simply by divine right, but also because they provided services to commoners and peasants such as protection and legal representation. They used the EXACT same arguments to justify inequality as people do today.\n\n> Most people in a westernized country do have a good deal of equality of opportunity \n\nNo, they absolutely do not. When you say “well people can pull themselves out of poverty” you are missing the point. Our economic system is designed to be unequal. The scant few equalizing and redistributive systems that we have are deteriorating. The entire Western world economy is stagnating. Household incomes are only going up because women are being pulled into the workplace and we aren’t discounting the lost domestic labor. \n\n> most of the billions you speak of who are impoverished live outside of this system.\n\nIt’s all the same system mate. You don’t understand: American is an Empire. We have vassal states and exact tribute from our provinces just like Ancient Rome. Yes, there has been progress, but the same principles that applied back then still apply today. America and Europe have been ruthless in the way they have worked their will to set up a system of global exploitation. There are hundreds of millions of people working in sweatshops or worse in order to make American companies richer. We aren’t actually trying to make anyone’s lives better. We are deluding ourselves into thinking the “trickle down effect” is an efficient mechanism of progress.\n\n>  I'm not saying capitalism is perfect by any means and that it can't be improved on vastly, but it has brought us a lot further than any other economic model and is the best system we have for pulling people out of poverty\n\nCapitalism is a myth that was invented by Westerners to justify imperialism. There is no clear definition of what capitalism actually is. Free markets? Lmao. We don’t have free markets. Just look at the monopolistic behemoth companies that dominate our economy. Just look at the banking cabal that runs our financial system. People will change the goalposts of how to define “capitalism” to suit whatever argument they want to make. At the end of the day, capitalism is just modern imperialism. We define the Empire as “capitalist”, and anyone who resists we call “socialist” or sometimes “communist”.\n\n>These kind of discussions just turn into disadvantaged olympics\n\nAgain you miss the point. I don’t want to play “disadvantaged olympics” any more than you. I don’t care about personal stories or individual circumstances, I am analyzing the system as a whole and it’s quite clear that we have inequality *by design*. The whole fact that we have stories of people “pulling themselves up by their bootstraps” is only possible in a world where inequality and poverty and permanent fixtures. The reason immigrant families from poor countries can come to the U.S. and get rich is that they simply joined the winning team. It’s an exclusive team with a limited number of spots, and the vast majority of the world will never even make it to benchwarmer status.
