And how?\n\nProduction targets are rigidly set in most modern mines. You can't just decide to ramp up production.

No idea if they made it.\n\n> just because they THINK gold is in these here lands, they are often still speculating and actually need to pull the gold out. \n\nFalse for all modern mines except fraudulent ones.

Balance sheets can be quite different depending on several things, including management style.

There will be efficient businesses and wasteful ones. \n\n> Why? And how?\n\nMany ways, but here is one example. Prices increase and suddenly a particular gold mine that was dormant seems more appealing to mine. They need to work through the EPA (maybe?... actually interesting thought given the current EPA lapses), the fed, and the state government. They need to hire people. They need to bring equipment. You are right... they can't just decide to ramp up production, but are they going to try to make hay when the hay is there or are they going to operate in the same business environment that they were running in when the price of gold is 40% lower? \n\nOr... shit.. companies that leverage out on some of the companies because the time is right and it can be easy to justify funneling money to other entities under the guise of 'doing whats best for the company'\n\nTo be clear, I am not a gold expert, but to look at the price of any product and presume that the company is going to be profitable based on the market price of the product is straight-up silly. \n\n> False for all modern mines except fraudulent ones\n\nMaybe. The entire pipeline of gold mining is going to fill as prices increase... from the big dogs to the small ones. The best of class producers are more likely to be prepared for this and also able to prepare for the inevitable drop in future price, as well. \n\nIf I remember right, there was some considerable consolidation on the last go around.\n\nThere are going to be other mine-related companies that will offer prospects of better futures, but aren't going to have the deep pockets of the best in class miners.

And in the attempt to do so, they are unburdened by union contracts and pension overhangs and have modern healthcare arrangements.  For people who do not understand how much of a drag on earnings that can be for the traditional automakers, let me just point out that before the 2007 GM bankruptcy, they were literally *paying Medicare costs* on family members of employees who had died 50 years prior.  These people would have been eligible for straight Medicare from the Fed Gov but at some stupid negotiation in the past GM had agreed to take on the actual costs borne by Medicare to care for its ex employees‚Äô health because some politico promised them union compliance in return.  One analyst at that time pointed out that when you bought a GM car, you were basically buying a retired person‚Äôs pension and healthcare expenses; the shoddy car they gave you with it was an afterthought.\n\nTSLA hasn‚Äôt any of that overhang to deal with.  No reason it can‚Äôt expand margins a percent or two and be making $50 a share by 2022.

There is no clear definition of what capitalism actually is. Free markets? Lmao. We don‚Äôt have free markets. Just look at the monopolistic behemoth companies that dominate our economy. Just look at the banking cabal that runs our financial system. People will change the goalposts of how to define ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù to suit whatever argument they want to make. At the end of the day, capitalism is just modern imperialism. We define the Empire as ‚Äúcapitalist‚Äù, and anyone who resists we call ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù or sometimes ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù.\n\n>These kind of discussions just turn into disadvantaged olympics\n\nAgain you miss the point.
