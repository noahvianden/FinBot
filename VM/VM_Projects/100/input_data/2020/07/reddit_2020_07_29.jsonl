Sure, AMD can attempt to undercut them with low cost CPUs but the moment Intel actually wants to go all out, they would obliterate AMD. My father spent his 35 year career at Intel and was a Director of Engineering (one step below a VP) and he said that honestly AMD isn't really even seriously on their radar.

He detailed the work his teams have done over the years and it's a lot of post manufacturing software testing so that chips can be properly binned into their correct speeds, i.e. what makes a chip an i3/5/7 is really just based on the quality of the production of the chip, often called the \"silicon lottery\" where the best chips that can go the fastest often are made from the same wafer as the lesser chips that go slower. There are systems in place that allow them to yeild many more of the high end chips than their competitors. So much so that most of them come out this way and they actually had to design a system to LOWER the quality of their chips by switching parts of the CPU off permanently via internal one times fuses. Once you measure the capability of the CPU the software determines what product level it can be sold at, again i3/5/7 etc and then pops all the necessary fuses to make it so. This process is so powerful and unique that as far as I know not many other companies do it. It's simply not worth their time and money to bring that level of quality control to their products, but Intel designed these processes a long time ago. And that's why if they really wanted to go all out, they'd rofl stomp the market. They've literally spent billions of dollars reining in their power. Now admittedly they are having a hard time with 7nm, which is interesting, but the company I work at is working hard every day to provide the chemicals they need to get the best wafer etches and overall layer to layer consistency. I always joke with my dad that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree as I just ended up working at a chemical company that sells to Intel haha.

And spun of their fab and as tech nodes kept shrinking they‚Äôve been getting ridiculously hard to build and crazy expensive to outfit for. Intel has to carry that weight all on their own.  Amd has had the option and ability to work with multiple fabs.  The fans have had the benefit of working together to build these new technology nodes and sharing the cost on it.  Since they worked together developing the chips can be designed under a single design package and designers are able to change who builds their chip whenever they like, even after production has begun, or have two favs making them. Apple shunned Samsung‚Äôs fab because they don‚Äôt like to source from any company they see as a competitor. That freed up a lot of room to produce a lot of chips though it did cut down on how much anyone could get out of tsmc. Another benefit of not owning their own fab is these favs are working with a bunch of different design companies to make their processing better and increase their yields. \n\nWith intel they‚Äôre carrying all the cost, all the load, and everything about everything that they do is intel‚Äôs style.  That can even make it tough for them to hire people since everyone else is on industry standards for methodology, procedures, even the type of software they use.

Proven again that words are for eating.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think this is a really good time to start opening the possibility of this. \n\n2-3 years ago if Tesla had done this most legacy OEMs would just have thought \"Who gives a fuck? We can make our own stuff.\", maybe they would have tried alone for a couple years and then come crawling back to Tesla, but it wouldn't be a good business relationship. \n\nIf the wait another 2-3 years many OEMs would start to have a lot of sunk costs into their own battery and powertrain technology and be hesitant to abandon everything in favor of Tesla. Who knows, someone could have actually started making really good electric powertrains and start to rival Tesla. \n\nDoing this now most OEMs have been forced to dip their toes in the water. They don't really have solution and are scrambling. Are investigating Tesla's technology they've realized this is something very different and they may actually be screwed trying to compete with this. \n\nLike BMW started making some EVs but recently said they will continue to stand by combustion engines since they think some people may still care about them in the future. I mean, if everyone goes EV there's a niche in the market to sell just really polished and beautiful ICE cars for novelty, like horses today. But it's also pretty much admitting defeat and recognizing there's just no way your company will be able to compete, so you need to capture a more niche market. \n\nHow it will affect Tesla's business and how many will choose to buy real Teslas vs repackaged Teslas in the future, I don't really know. However, if other automakers go for this, it will solidify Tesla as the market leader and stop other OEMs from treating them adversarially. \n\nThis may not be the best for the actual consumer, but battery and manufacturing costs are dropping rapidly for everyone. If others were racing with Tesla to make the best EV, it would start becoming a race to the bottom with margins and price. People seem pretty comfortable paying $30-40k for a car nowadays, say that $35k car costs $25k to manufacture, costs for everyone drops down to $15k based on cheaper batteries, motors, automation, and stamping ect, then other companies would be inclined to lower their prices to push their inferior cars over Tesla. A $20k brand new EV that still does all the basics is hard to pass up Vs a $40k Tesla, so prices will have to come down for everyone. \n\nIf everyone starts using the same Tesla powertrain and underlying technology, there will be more cooperation and kinda mutual agreement to keep costs around the same to maintain healthy margins for everyone, benefiting Tesla most of all. Just look at Smartphones, the first iPhone was $499, nowadays people seem mostly fine with a $1,000 flagship phone, that's just what they cost. \n\nA few years ago Smartphone makers could buy a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC for around $40, this generation Qualcomm wanted $150 for the Snapdragon 865. Everyone was mostly fine with that cost increase, like every android smartphone sold in the world uses a Qualcomm SoC so there are no winners or losers here, costs increase equally for everyone. They're kinda getting greedy and pushing up the Snapdragon 875 to $250, every flagship phone released 2021 will still use that chip and pay that price. Qualcomm is releasing a cheaper SoC for $45, but you know, everyone wants the fastest phone. \n\nThis is getting very long, but to pull this back, I don't think Tesla will jack up prices immensely, they kinda seem to want to lower prices whenever they can. However once they're established as a reliable powertrain supplier, they could turn to OEMs and say like \"Hey do you want this SpaceX Powertrain with ROCKETS? Air compressors and cold gas thrusters to accelerate at up to 2G included, we can sell it for $150k.\"", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You can‚Äôt compare to smart phones.

It‚Äôs what makes google well google. Constant data collection being used continuously to improve the system, it‚Äôs a feed back loop. Just like microphone feedback. The mic picks up it‚Äôs own amplified output and send it back to the amp to then again be pickup by the mic to be amplified. We have witnessed this type of cycle and know only takes a second before the feedback is out of control. It‚Äôs the speed and exponential growth of the feed back loop that‚Äôs important to keep in mind. \n\nTwo, FSD march of nines will only become easier over time once the initial 99 percentile is achieved and is proven safer than humans. This is my analogy of having to picking the high hanging fruit before the low hanging fruit. On a purpose built road track, FSD is easy, and has been accomplished by many different companies and universities. The high hanging fruit is having to deal with current road network and random actions from human driver and pedestrians and out laying events including construction zones, emergency vehicles and road closures, or falling debris off moving vehicles to mention a few. Our transportation system has been constantly improving over time for driver safety. The same system will also improve over time to help advance the safety of FSD like better markings or electronic signals on construction cones, emergency vehicles, and intersections. \n\nAs you can tell I believe FSD is possible in a shorter time frame than most people. Whether or not this become reality in three year I know FSD will be exponentially safer than humans. Once that fact is proven people will be demanding all car have some form of FSD.

I focus on a single ticker with only occasional deviations to other companies. My intra-day trades usually last less than 1 minute. Swing trades are between 1 week to a few months. Since 2008, I have never lost money in a calendar year. My goal was 7 figures last year which I achieved. I lowered that goal to a more attainable 500k this year which is technically achieved right now but not completely realized. I trade stocks and options (I sell a ton of calls to you guys here).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI started buying mutual finds in high school. Then, dot-com hit and I traded tech stocks. It was expensive. Broker assisted trades were $125 per trade back then. Then online trading started at $30 per trade. I took $2,000 and turned it into over $150,000, and then lost most of it. I got greedy. I learned (the hard way) to set goals early and book profits when goals were met. Risk management was the next hard lesson to learn. Eventually, I decided to go to med school and used all my trading profits to fund school. I continued to trade during school and graduated debt free. I moved to the USA in 2008 with virtually nothing and started from scratch again. I saved enough to open a brokerage account with a few thousand dollars. It took 18 months of slow trading to get to over 25K and finally I could day trade without dealing with PDT rules.
