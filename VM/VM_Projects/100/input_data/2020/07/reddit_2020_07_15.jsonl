Its hard to say because Tesla is a cult stock with massive hype. If it didn't have cult status and hype most people would tell you it's going to drop, a lot. The problem with hype is that you don't know when it will end. Probably why even though people load up on Tesla shorts they keep getting burned. But it will stop eventually. The graph can't bend over back on itself. It has to correct eventually.\n\nThe problem I see with Tesla at this value is that it's not something everyone has or is looking to get. Apple and Amazon, I get it. Everyone uses prime. Everyone wants an iPhone.\n\nNot everyone wants a Tesla and when I drive I still see only a handful of them. A lot of car owners still have problems with the idea of getting a Tesla. Especially truck owners which is a huge part of the market. If they had it, maybe they would deserve this valuation. I think people are pricing in future market dominance before it's happened. It's become very speculative.\n\nYour only other option. (other than sell or hold) is to start averaging your price down. I would do it slowwwwwly. That means increasing your exposure to risk though and you're potentially in for a long time. You put in smaller amounts of money at lower prices and start averaging cost out to increase your position. I would only do this if you're leaning towards going long and you have money to burn. Do it in several price levels. Start with a small piece and increase as the dip expands. You will know when it's going back to steady and back up.\n\nBe wary of prices that are parabolic. Be sure it's going to continue or stay away from it. People like to say on reddit \"stonks go up\" and they do, but they also go down. The majority of stocks are not a straight arrow up and it's entirely possible that some levels will not be seen again. That's true for the majority of stocks. When they are exploring new prices, it's risky to buy in.\n\nOne thing you can do, is you can watch the volume indicator and check sentiments around the stock in the next few days. If they start trickling off, that's a bad sign.\n\nLearn the lesson from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel for you and anyone I see who makes this kind of post. I've been exactly where you are and it cost me 5 figures. I waited a long time when I bought near the top and eventually sold out. 3 years later and it still hasn't retraced.

Who is competing in the industry, who has  the edge, but even more importantly, is the entire industry a growing one.  It's okay if an industry is saturated with competition as long as the industry is growing, which allows the players to capture a piece of the pie that is growing.

What is the culture of the Company?  -- this is where you find and adopt your belief in the company.  I can't emphasize this research eniugh because at the end of the day.

If not, do they have access to capital from somewhere and will it be sufficient.\n\nCash flow statement:\n\nThis is basically the circulatory system of a company.  Healthy Cash flow in my opinion holds way more power than profits.   If a company has a negative cash flow it doesn't mean game over,but you should research as to why.  Is it because there is no economies of scale or is it because theyre spending profits on themselves. I like to see the latter if free cash flow is negative.\n\n\nI apologize for the length of this post.  Feel free to dm me if anyone wants some clarity on any of the topics I wrote about.

Just because there is some technology behind a product (which there is for every single product in human history) it doest make the company a tech one. Selling a physical product (cars) is the first clue that it's not. A tech company is expected to scale infinitly to take all demand. Thats why they are so attractive to investors.
