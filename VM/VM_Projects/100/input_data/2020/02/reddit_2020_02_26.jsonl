This is my first post here. I've been a lurker for a long time, and several years on Reddit. I've gained so much insight from this community, and I honestly believe that my life has changed since I started investing. Currently I'm all in on Tesla, although the amount is very low ($35.000), as I just finished my master's degree and I'm 26 years old and slowly building more capital. My income from work is around $100.000/year (I'm from Norway), where I am investing about 80% into Tesla. If all goes to hell, I'll be in a lot of pain, as I've previously lost $20.000 which was all I had at the current time, a few years ago on stupid crypto investments because of FOMO.\n\nFor me, Tesla being the future is a no-brainer. We, as humans are interesting creatures. My thesis is that when we as a species face a crisis, such as global warming, rates of innovations in the world increases, because our future depends on it. I doubt we as mankind will die out, and I believe that companies investing in technology and green enviorment will have a huge benefit in the future. \n\nI spend too many hours everyday browsing here, Tesla Investor Forum, and even the dreaded Real Tesla, because I like to gather all opinions on one subject. I'm still a novice, yet learning. I did not sell two weeks ago when we went to $960 and all the way back to $700. I held strong. With yesterdays market crash, I bought 3 more shares at $849 and held strong, however I'm very nervous right now. I genuinely believe that the Coronavirus will spread to most western states. I don't think the virus is as dangerous as media has it, but there might be rough times ahead before we see better days. The biggest problem with this virus is the isolation on cities, which in turn affects the business aspects of countries. \n\nLong term I belive that this will just be a small dip to gather more shares, before we bounce back and crush $1.000 barrier. Short term I am prepared for this to fall even more. My family members are encouraging me to sell, because my current gains are equal to two month's salaries, but I did not invest in Tesla to make a quick buck. I invested in Tesla, and will continue investing in Tesla, because I see this as one of the leading companies into the future, and I'll keep investing in Tesla until the stock price either gives me enough money to retire comfortabely or I see another alternative that's better. Let's stay strong through this, and let's not lie to each other, this current dip blows. I've only got 44 shares, I can't imagine how some of you guys are feeling.

{"title": "Volatility for Autists", "selftext": "I know most of you autists haven't been trading for long enough to know a 6% drawdown from a true market crash, so the market conditions the past couple days might be new to you. But some of us have been around the block before, and if you're going to trade options and not get absolutely destroyed, you need to know about *volatility*.\n\n**I'm a dumbass who's been trading options without knowing anything about them. What's volatility?**\n\nVolatility, or vol for short, is a measure of how much a stock price (or anything) moves around. If you want to get technical about it, it's the standard deviation of log returns, but that won't be on the test.\n\nTraders divide vol into two types: *realized vol*, or how much the stock has moved around in the recent past, and which can be calculated exactly; and *implied vol*, how much the stock is expected to move around in the future, which is unknown.\n\nAssuming you're trading options, implied vol, or IV for short, is the kind you need to know about, because it deeply affects the price of an option.\n\n**Oh yeah, I've heard of implied vol before.**\n\nYep, if you hold an options position on Robinhood, it'll tell you what the IV is. You also can, and should, look at what the IV is based on the quoted bid-ask before you buy or sell options. If you have a Bloomberg terminal or a big boy brokerage account, you might even be able to visualize the \"vol surface,\" which plots IV for a stock across a variety of strikes and expirations.\n\nThe important thing is that, assuming the price of the underlying stock stays the same (and ignoring theta), the price of an option *only increases* as IV increases, and *only decreases* as IV decreases. It's a \"monotonic function,\" which is another math term that will not be on the test. The point is that you can think of IV as a re-scaled version of the price of an option. \n\nYou might also have heard of the VIX.\n\n**Yeah, some people shorted it and blew up hilariously.**\n\nRight. The VIX is a single number meant to represent the implied volatility of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. It was invented after the '87 crash and is calculated using the prices of options on the index. About 15 years ago people started trading VIX *futures*, or making bets on volatility. Nowadays you can trade ETFs that hold long or short VIX futures, although I wouldn't really recommend it.\n\nAnyway, VIX isn't perfect -- it doesn't do a great job of predicting actual volatility, and some people think it's being manipulated. But it's the best single number that represents **how much people are willing to pay to be long vol.**\n\nAnyway, the VIX closed 2019 at 13.46. It closed Friday at 17.08, Monday at 25.03, and today at 27.85.\n\n**What does this mean for me?**\n\nSince option prices are tightly related to IV, any time you buy an option, you're going long vol, and any time you sell one you're going short vol. (How much the price of your option moves around with volatility is measured by a number called *vega*, and if you're a real nerd, another number called *vomma*. Not on the test.) So if you bought options last week, congratulations! Your long bet on volatility has paid off! Don't you feel like a winner?\n\nWell, no, probably not, if you're not a 🌈🐻. (If you are, then my sincere congratulations, now fuck off.) But you might if your options expire longer than a few weeks out, and the market recovers. If you're tempted to buy options *right now*, you should keep in mind that you're paying twice as much for the volatility as you were a couple months ago. And if selling options seemed like a good idea last month, it should seem like an even better idea now -- assuming you can handle getting assigned, at least.\n\nGood luck out there, autists.

Our global health response team is acting to help protect   our employees in accordance with global health authorities' guidance.   Worldwide, Microsoft   employees are working to support organizations addressing the challenges on   the ground. Microsoft   also continues to make donations to relief and contamination efforts,   including directly providing technology to help hospitals and medical   workers.\n\n📷\n\nOn Jan. 29, as part of our second quarter of   fiscal year 2020 earnings call, we issued quarterly revenue guidance for our   More Personal Computing segment between $10.75 and $11.15   billion, which included a wider than usual range to reflect   uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.   Although we see strong Windows demand in line with our expectations, the   supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than   anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call. As a result, for the third   quarter of fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to meet our More Personal   Computing segment guidance as Windows OEM and Surface are more negatively   impacted than previously anticipated. All other components of our Q3 guidance   remain unchanged. \n\nAs the conditions evolve, Microsoft   will act to ensure the health and safety of our employees, customers, and   partners during this difficult period. We will also continue to partner with   local and global health authorities to provide additional assistance. We   deeply appreciate the commitment of the people and organizations that have   united to address this health emergency; our thoughts are with all those   affected across the world.\n\n[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-update-on-q3-fy20-guidance-301012053.html](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-update-on-q3-fy20-guidance-301012053.html)", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wanted to post something like this but everything I post the auto mod removes it as low effort.
