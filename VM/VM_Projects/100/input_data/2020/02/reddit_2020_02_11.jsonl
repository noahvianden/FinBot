If I made any mistakes let me know and I will correct them as well.\n\nI cautiously offer a mid-term price target inline with Morgan Stanley's bull target of $60.  I would not be surprised to see this happen in next 6-8 months but due to being cautious on an extremely speculative industry & stock, I will instead speculate we will see a move towards $60 early to mid 2021.\n\nThat being said, it is also on a huge uptrend right now and in the very short term we could see a retrace while we await stronger news.  I would enter at this point with some caution and be prepared to average down so you don't get emotional if it drops for a bit before moving back to all time highs.\n\n# EDIT: To be clear - this is a long-term play for me.  None of my calls expire before June/July even.  Not that I can't see it going up further in the short term... just wouldn't risk a short-term expiration on it until some of the points below occur.\n\n**Introductory Links & Information:**\n\n* **Virgin Galactic** \\- [https://www.virgingalactic.com/](https://www.virgingalactic.com/)\n* **Virgin Galactic Investor/SEC Presentation -** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000114420419034053/tv524921\\_ex99-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000114420419034053/tv524921_ex99-2.htm)\n* **The Spaceship Company** \\- [http://thespaceshipcompany.com/](http://thespaceshipcompany.com/)\n\n**It definitely has a major first-mover advantage on multiple fronts.**\n\n* It is a first-mover in the commercial space industry,\n* It is a first-mover as publicly traded company for the industry.\n* It is a first-mover in the hypersonic industry.\n* It is potentially a first-mover in the manufacturing/supplier vertical and has cleared the way to do so with its close relations with Boeing, IMO.\n\n**Very few catalysts for a downturn in immediate future**\n\n* Any known possibility for \"bad news\" seems unlikely before at least a few major catalysts for a move up.\n   * Test Flight Crash\n      * I see this as unlikely but it seems to be the \"worst case scenario\" in the short term for the long play.\n      * They have already made it to space with their first vehicle so they have proven they are capable.\n      * The crash that many talk about was pilot error, not due to manufacturing faults.\n      * Before we can get to Test Flights, which would mostly run out of the Space Port, we need to get the space ships to the Space Port which will likely include many events from announcing the flight with fanfare and celebration to announcing a reopening of ticket sales (see below for those and more).\n      * Before we get to Test Flights, we also have the event at the end of Feb where they seem likely to make major announcements leading into their earnings call.\n   * Delayed initial flight w/ Branson\n      * I can't imagine this will occur but it has been delayed in the past multiple times.\n      * I have some added observations below which show why they seem confident in their schedule.\n   * IPO from Blue Origin\n      * It does appear that Blue Origin is gearing up for a move public.\n      * *This could either:* greatly increase interest in Space and expand the industry across the board since only two options would exist\n      * ***Or:*** This could break $SPCE's monopoly on the industry as it has today and move much interest to \"the new Amazon potential.\"\n      * Blue Origin is $SPCE's main and only major competitor that has been able to show a real potential at delivering on their promises.  They have recently conducted test flights, they have hired a comm director in recent days, and Bezos has been selling far more stock than usual (I believe just over $3 billion at time of writing this) to fund what seems to be a major strategic move.\n      * I do think the announcement of Blue Origin IPO being imminent could be a temporary hit to $SPCE, but the effect will be **greatly muted** should $SPCE already have momentum, announced dates for their flights, re-opened ticket sales, etc.  **THIS IS CRITICAL** and my **#1 concern at this time** is that Bezos realizes this and the recent moves he is making are to try to move their schedule up and get ahead of them here.\n      * If Blue Origin can \"steal the thunder\", if you will, before $SPCE is able to gain the worlds attention with reopening ticket sales and other things mentioned in the points above, this could prove pretty harmful to the gains we would otherwise see.  Although I think either way we would move up, there will be a whole different narrative if the \"but Blue Origin...\" footnote is added to every news release that would otherwise be solely focused on $SPCE.\n      * Bezos is a shark and he's damn good at what he does.\n      * Bezos is essentially \"all-in\" on space...\n      * Needless to say, I will be investing major in Blue Origin as well...\n   * IPO from SpaceX's StarLink is all but guaranteed\n      * SpaceX has announced that they are almost surely going to be spinning off StarLink from SpaceX and going public with that.\n      * Timeframe, however, does not seem to be in the immediate future and we will likely have a significant warning ahead of this move.\n      * I've done fairly significant research on StarLink but will leave that to IPO announcement time since it is off-topic here.\n      * There is not much competition of the two aside from them both being considered in the \"Space Industry.\"  I do not think this will cause any kind of downturn.\n\n**Boeing Clears the Way for The Spaceship Company?**\n\n* Boeing has invested $20m (so far) into $SPCE.\n   * Interestingly, Boeing seems to be turning its interest away from space & hypersonic and deferring to others to take up the mantle (meanwhile, \"working closely with $SPCE engineers at the Spaceship Company as allies\"... hint hint?)\n   * Interestingly, shortly after news of Boeing no longer pursuing some contracts that \"The Spaceship Company\" can easily target, all this news breaks about NASA and Space Force looking for private contract bids on many fronts they can easily service.\n   * Whitesides (CEO) has mentioned that Boeing is a very active partner that their engineers are working with \"intimately\" to advance their technologies in a recent interview.\n* Spaceship Company seems like a surefire spinoff of $SPCE in the near future?\n   * Being able to provide hypersonic flight manufacturing services to others allows them to corner the market\n   * As mentioned, their partnership with Boeing clearly gives them an advantage of Boeing's contacts & expertise\n   * From what I can tell they have a significant lead on R&D from those we have seen show interest in the space.\n* The Spaceship Company President promoted to COO of $SPCE\n   * This feels like a move to allow Enrico to begin preparations for major moves and restructuring to bring about their Hypersonic flight ambitions.\n* The Spaceship Company seems to have some clear potential for independently bidding on many of these new government contracts on top of the other pieces mentioned above.\n\n**Hints to July First Flight Plan for Branson?**\n\n* In a recent interview, Whitesides (CEO) mentioned how Branson was looking forward to going to space as it would essentially be his 70th Birthday present.\n* Last year, Branson mentioned he wanted to time the flight with the Apollo 11 Anniversary which also coincides with his Birthday within a few days  (July 16 & 18 IIRC), quoted as saying \"... So yeah, July the 18th is my birthday so why not? We'll go for that.\" [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/richard-branson-eyes-apollo-11-anniversary-trip-space/story?id=61102112](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/richard-branson-eyes-apollo-11-anniversary-trip-space/story?id=61102112)\n* I have seen some hints that June is a possibility as well, but either way they appear to be quite confident in their ability to hit mid-year for the first flight.\n\n**Re-opening Ticket Sales -- raising price per ticket?**\n\n* Whitesides has said that due to strong demand they will likely raise their ticket pricing by a significant amount.\n* Tweets and Instagram posts went out about joining their newsletter.  One of the main questions in that form was how much you would pay for a ticket.\n   * It would appear they are pricing out how many they can sell at various price points to see what they might be able to open ticket sales at again.\n   * If I were doing the above, I would expect a couple weeks or so to generate those leads which would include various posts that seem kind of pointless of random accomplishments as an excuse to advertise those sign-ups in the meantime -- I doubt they will want to hint at their goals to generate leads as that could affect the lead quality they receive.\n   * They have a conference scheduled a few days before their earnings call at the end of the month.  It seems like they will likely plan to announce their intent to re-open ticket sales and at what price then as we lead into an earnings where they are likely to post a significant loss.  Guidance of new revenue should then be the only thing in focus.\n   * Personally I believe we will see tickets go on sale for $350k with perhaps some cheaper options -- not really sure here but $350k seems to feel what they will target.\n\n**Hints at Major Celebration Event Imminent**\n\n* Recently someone tracked Flight Aware that their first spaceship was flying to the Mojave to join its new sibling.\n   * Unless it required some sort of work done, this seems like a move where they are preparing for a major event in-which they can have press photograph the two together as they make the voyage to the Space Port together.\n   * Clearly they will want to make a grand spectacle to go viral on news and garner a surge of leads leading up to ticket sales re-opening.  This seems like the perfect way of doing it?\n   * They have recently announced that their second space craft is nearing completion.  They are working on the internal systems at this point.\n   * They have also pointed out that they have also begun work on Spaceship 3 and that they are completing them far faster and less expensive with each iteration.\n* Branson recently tweeted pictures of him at the Space Port with the entire team.\n   * It seems to me they were having an all-hands on-deck meeting to discuss & plan these celebrations and coordinate the team moving into what will clearly be one of the most important events of the companies history.\n\n**Hypersonic / Point-to-Point is a Game Changer**\n\n* Point-to-Point is a game changer which the Virgin brand will have a moat that will be hard to beat.  Combining hypersonic options with their contacts within the airline industry from Virgin Atlantic & Virgin America to offer comprehensive travel options for any travel needs.\n* Ability to do a level of cross-marketing & promotion that no other player hoping to break into PTP/Hypersonic will be able to come close to.\n* Many years ahead at this point and the **only** player I am aware of that will be able to go from manufacturing of the vehicles all the way to the consumer level.\n   * No one will be able to touch their pricing for the foreseeable future.  This is one reason why many are calling them the \"Tesla of Space\"  [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/09/virgin-galactic-is-the-tesla-of-the-space-industry.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/09/virgin-galactic-is-the-tesla-of-the-space-industry.aspx)\n\n**Insane Growth Opportunity**\n\n* Some massive potential to enter industries/verticals that they have not yet indicated interest in - **pure speculation below warning.**\n* Space is big - and the market opportunity for a company which is servicing every vertical which is currently practical are mind boggling.\n   * As their tech evolves, being able to deliver payloads and/or people into actual orbit would increase their market potential exponentially.\n   * They seem likely to approach this market as we are starting to see news of \"space hotels\" and such which would fit beautifully into their Space Tourism marketing.\n   * As mentioned, they also have incredible opportunity to cross-market with other Virgin brands to achieve a level of consumer awareness that would cost competitors much more to capture.\n\n**While not part of the $SPCE family, Virgin Orbit is worth knowing about**\n\n[https://virginorbit.com/](https://virginorbit.com/)", "id": "f21u76", "created_utc": 1581389388.0, "score": 189, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "Why use many words when few word do trick\n\nSPCE 420c 4/20", "score": 221, "replies": [{"body": "420 yasss lmao I almost missed that. \n\nI’m holding stock from a couple of weeks ago.

Most companies could drop 20% and still be fairly valued.\n\n2) Microsoft really is a damn good company right now and short of a recession or government regulation I don’t see that changing in the near/mid-term.  Even with a recession I think Microsoft will stay in the elite tier (though every company will surely fall a massive amount) and Billy Gates has survived regulation before and they haven’t even been a discussion lately (though that might be because of DJT hate boner for Bezos and Google-crew rejecting military contract work).\n\n3) Asset price inflation is more likely linked with QE (and global equivalents), massive tax cuts, and ultra-low governmental borrowing rates.  The amount of money in ETFs have been steadily growing over the last 25 years but if you look at the shape of the SP500 or NASDAQ and they tend to have more pronounced upticks when the activities I just listed are going on (go look at how the Sp500 moved while QE was going on, and then the bump when the tax cuts were introduced).  I’m not saying ETFs aren’t having an impact but there are arguably other things going on.\n\n4) You’re suggesting mega market cap companies are impacted by option volumes.  This is basically “max pain” and I always thought max pain was not real except somewhat true on “quad witching” opex days.  But then a friend of mine did a study and targeted some large and some small companies over the last 6 months and he parsed data multiple times a day and each time he got data he got\n\nShare price  \nOption contract value at +/- 20 strikes (I think) of the current share price expiring for the current week and then every expiring date out to a year (it’s a LOT of data for one company let alone 10)   \n\nWith this he would calculate max pain for those dates and see if there was any real correlation between share prices and max pain and while he wants more data (more companies and more time) so far what he has found is that share prices do NOT follow max pain and if anything max pain follows share price though again nothing close to perfect correlation (if MSFT went up in value 10% over a month time period the max pain for options expiring in the near future would also go up) and the bigger the company the less share price follow max pain but the other way is more true (on occasion).  The only “fucky” things he has seen has been on “quad witching” days when share price might jerk quite a bit (sometimes 1-2%) in the last half hour before market close on opex day.\n\nMSFT is probably going up due to general market hype, somewhat or maybe majorly impacted by ETFs, but it’s also been divergent from general market performance because again point two above.  As mentioned my buddy’s study tells me that, especially on the biggest of companies (but even those like AMD), max pain is almost irrelevant; i.e. even large option contract orders have limited impact on the share price.\n\nIf you’re wanting to make some group effort to get the SEC to shut WSB down due to a pump in dump in which you convince 10,000 of our brothers and sisters to buy call options on a company while you yourself hold shares and then you sell as they’re going up in value, you might want to pick a micro-cap company.\n\nThat said this is all entertainment and not educational because clearly if I post here I’m neither a pro nor very intelligent.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Your tag is accurate.

This is a place of huge returns and well-timed guesses. A robinhood screen can easily be fictionalized as well, so keep that in mind. This place will fill your head with unrealistic pipe dreams that will set you up to lose big.  \n\nYou listened to the wrong information and you paid for it. The next few paragraphs are, more or less, what a paid financial adviser will tell you & do with your savings. so don't hire one, because you can do exactly what they do and not pay any fees. It's not very hard. It's also the way to have a MUCH higher percentage chance of getting the absurd returns seen on this sub, but it takes longer to do. it trades speed for safety. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. DON'T MAKE YOUR WHOLE PORTFOLIO OPTIONS AND SHORTS. debt-financed investments carry a tremendous degree of risk, because you are on the hook for potentially ALL of the upside of a venture, and in the long run, value goes up, not down. If you had the courage to HOLD during 2008, your S&P 500 ETFs are now worth much more than they were at the height of the real estate bubble. What I am saying here is that options and shorts are best done by insiders with years of experience in analyzing balance sheets, income statements, 10Ks, and other documents available from the SEC. Unless you know something that no one else does, the smart money will beat you. These are people who work/worked for institutional investors, financial firms, banks, and hedge funds. You and I are the \"dumb money:\" normal people who are trading publicly available equity via apps like Robinhood and Fidelity. Because we aren't having lunch with Wall Street traders everyday, we will ALWAYS be a step behind the smart money. SO DON'T BET EVERYTHING ON OPTIONS, BECAUSE YOU'LL PROBABLY LOSE! \n2. Now that we've got all those negative waves out of the way, let's talk about how to make good money given the fact that we're not smart money. It's a pretty simple recipe:\n   1. BUY INDEXES AND MUTUAL FUNDS. \"to big to fail\" is a truism. buy indexes and mutual funds. The degree of risk (and the size and speed of your returns) depends on how big it is. The bigger it is, the less likely it goes under completely. It might crash, but it will go back up The S&P 500 is one of the safest bets in this category. You are essentially betting on the American economy, and the American economy is not going anywhere. In the long run, GDP goes up, slowly but surely. In the mid 2000's, this index was at about $1100. It is now at $3300. That's a 200% return after 15 years. Your investment of $240 would be $480. But if it was a $10,000 investment, that's $10k in profit we're talking about. I would recommend the XLK. It's a tech mutual fund, and tech has literally infinite room to grow. However, it is more risky because it's only one economic sector, not all of them. But it is made up of highly stable and profitable firms (Apple, Miscrosoft, NVIDIA, Intel, Visa, etc.) No Amazon, Facebook, Uber - none of the questionable ones that might sink eventually. Here's a good data sheet on it.  [https://www.etf.com/XLK#overview](https://www.etf.com/XLK#overview) It yielded a 375% return over the time same time period in the above S&P 500 example. \n   2. BUILD UP, BUILD AFAP. you probably don't have $1M lying around to throw into passive investments and live off the profits. But someday you might, if you keep building your investment! Financial advisers typically advocate normal people to put 10% of yearly income into investments. This is a reasonable expectation for everyday Americans with bills and rent to pay. But hey, it'll grow faster if you can manage to put more in each month! \n   3. FURTHER LOWER RISK BY DIVERSIFYING. diversifying and picking safer investments. if 80% of your portfolio is in indexes and funds, you can make high-risk trades with the other 20% from a position of considerable safety. \n   4. CONSIDER PAYING OFF DEBT AND / INSTEAD OF INVESTING. Using savings to pay off debt can often be more profitable than most investments. If you're like many Americans, you'll surely have a mountain of student debt to pay off and the interest and fees are eating your monthly income. If you have $1000 on a student loan and pay $100 a year in fees / interest / scheduled payment plans, you are essentially making 10% profit over one year by paying off the $1000 immediately. This is referred to by accountants as a \"cash-on-cash\" return. You can then take that $100 you saved and put it into an investment. \n   5. \"HOLD FAST.\" The advice above guarantees that your returns will keep pace with overall market returns, but selling in a panic will negate that. My mother, bless her soul, she thought we were about to enter an economic dark age in 2008. All her inheritance was in the S&P 500. We might lose our house! Our family's savings might be entirely wiped out! We have to salvage something or we'll starve! And it was so, that my mother dumped her entire position at the VERY BOTTOM of the 2008 crash, and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. I was going to be a child who would get their diploma debt-free. Her panic is the reason why 15% of my salary is now going to student debt payments. YOU MUST HOLD. YOU WILL PANIC. BUT YOU CANNOT CAVE TO FEAR. \n   6. SUGGESTED PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION: 40% S&P 500, 50% XLK, 10% individual stocks / options. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry you're down. Don't listen to these idiots.

Literally, then don't have to file anything with the government.\n   * \\* that 70 Million has gone up throughout the years.  As of 2018 its up to 85 Mil.\n* FTC announced today that they will be investigating FAAAM in regards to HSR going back to 2010.\n* The investigation will focus on \"deals of companies that could have potentially developed into larger businesses, and moves by tech giants that increased their influence in adjacent markets.\"\n* In plane English:  The FTC is worried that during the last decade, FAAAM used HSR to squash competition before it could arise and take over the world.  A easy example of expansion: Amazon buying a bunch of small manufacturing companies so they suddenly have the infrastructure to produce Amazon Basics, products designed to compete with everyday needs.  An example of competition: Facebook buying a small social media company worth 50 Mil that could have easily grown into an Instagram competitor.\n* The FAAAM are tanking today because everyone savy enough to have watched and understood the Social Network already knows this is true and this investigation will turn over some dirty laundry.  For Christ's sake, [John Oliver had this shit down in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00wQYmvfhn4).\n* But if you stop panicking and take a breath you'll realize that when you think about it, Its all Amazon Facebook and Google that have done this.

The MEME status of internet explore compared to 3rd party browsers like Chrome and Firefox is proof positive that MSFT has been respecting the rules when they dealt with this shit 20 years ago.\n* I guarantee that as soon as it becomes clear that this investigation is focused mostly on Google, Amazon and FB, MSFT will get back on track.", "id": "f2dzly", "created_utc": 1581451254.0, "score": 252, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Whew.
