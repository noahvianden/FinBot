The argument has been worked out to the point where the points are clear and the remaining gaps are \"we need more data\".  That's what I mean by \"open argument\".\n\nI'm tired.  Waymo's first fully self-driving trip on a public road was in 2015.  They're currently working on things like nonverbal communication with opposing cyclists while making unprotected lefts, and the consumer angle of \"where exactly do people want to be picked up in a busy downtown supermarket parking lot?\"  They're incredibly risk averse.  It's a different approach.\n\nI'm not dissing Tesla.  I love Tesla.  I want Tesla to succeed.  I want LiDAR-free autonomy to work because of how much cheaper it is.  I own a 2019 M3.  I would love it to suddenly be fully autonomous.\n\nAnd none of this is relevant at all to this thread.  I watched autonomy day.  I enjoyed the presentation immensely.  Most of the content is the same stuff Waymo has been saying for years, or the direct converse of stuff Waymo has been saying for years (i.e. the LiDAR discussion).  Not wanting to rehash this discussion, is not a sign of weakness of mind.\n\nEDIT: I can't keep myself from responding.\n\n> Also the presentation explained why simulation data was nowhere near as valuable.\n\nWhat happens when you show a 5 year old who has never seen a squirrel, a squirrel?  One particular 5 year old responded \"haha funny kitty\".  Their parent responded \"no, honey, that's a squirrel\".  The kid responds \"Oh WOW\".  Now the kid knows what a squirrel is.\n\nThis type of learning from a single example is something AGI will be able to do.  If I were to make this argument on an ML forum, people would respond with how \"it's not a meaningful distinction because we can permute input data via simulation and train the AI on every angle of what a squirrel looks like, until it understands\".  This is why simulation is critical.  Tesla also does simulation.  The argument against simulation is arguing that you need super high fidelity, real-world data, to base the simulation on.  It's not an argument against simulation.\n\nNow, I recognize that Tesla has a lot more data, but it's also much lower fidelity (no LiDAR).  And Waymo has a lot more purposeful data.  They know where they are weak, and they purposely put the car in those situations.  Whereas as a Tesla driver, I tend to disengage autopilot when the car can't handle it.\n\nIt's a different approach.  **My disagreement with you on the quality of the difference, does not imply that I don't understand.**  This is the only point I'm making, in this edit.\n\nEDIT2: To be clear, the thing I'm tired about is Waymo dragging their feet.  Yes, I know this supports your argument.  I'm secure enough in my own well-rounded perspective to say that.  But I remain tired.  And my opinion is of no relevance to anyone.  Which is why I don't want to discuss it, here.  I'm just waiting for more information to be released.\n\nI hope you understand my perspective better, after this, and are willing to leave me alone.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "but those were Tesla-gonna-die-soon days.

They first released it in China in an obscure mobile book so they could tell investors it was released and just now after half a decade managed to fix their broken node for the mobile market. \n\nMeanwhile they don’t have 10nm on their desktop roadmaps for the next year as well as no Xeon models that outperform cheaper Epyc processors.\n\nTheir HEDT line was cut 50% across all models and they still don’t compete on both price and performance to the equivalent thread ripper models.\n\nThat and the fact amd already has mobile ryzen 4000 processors prepped for release either this or next quarter or store shelf’s leaves intel with 0 competitive products for general use for a year. This doesn’t mean people will stop buying intel though both in the server/enterprise space and  consumer space but it does ensure market share gain which is all AMD needs to net decent returns.\n\nAMD’s roadmaps are consistent and actually met unlike Intels constant 10nm promises and they are slated for 7nm+ by the time Intels optimistic 10nm desktop processors will be released. AMD will have 5nm BEFORE intel will have their 7nm released. That’s even if they manage to release it without any hiccups or delays. This “assumption” that AMD has given it all it’s got and will sit still for an entire year is retarded. \n\nSeriously all this shit is online how far up your ass did you pull this stuff. Just google the roadmaps for both companies. You aren’t wrong to assume intel will come back but you don’t seem to really know what you’re talking about either.\n\nTo further point out how little you know I will also mention that Intels 10nm( not 11 ) are comparable enough to consider same in terms of node performance. “nm” stopped meaning size a loong time ago when it comes to processors and neither Intels 10nm nor TSMC’s 7nm scale equally to each other. Intel 10nm will roughly equal TSMC 7nm, Intels 7nm will roughly equal TSMC’s 5nm.\n\nTLDR:intel 10nm desktop isn’t out for 1+ years and intel 7nm isn’t out for even longer.
