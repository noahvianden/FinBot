That means if you sold now and price still continued up to $700 and then decline 20% you could buy back at $550. However, imo, since Tesla is now at an all time low of short sellers and is being priced at a 3x multiple of GM stock. It is likely to eventually return to and retest support at $400 before continuing its trend higher. Most will not agree with me but people typically don’t agree with bearish views at tops.

If you would like to look at examples of this look at Tilray stock, Beyond Meat stock, and even Bitcoin. Beyond Meat is a great example imo because the company likely has a very great future ahead of them just like Tesla.\n\nAdditionally, I only give the $400 price target because after large run ups stocks often, not 100% of them time, will return to retest previous highs.

Now is that anything compared Tilray going from 30 to 300 in about 2 months? Maybe not if you only consider the duration and percentage of increase, however, Tesla has much larger market cap and a significantly larger float which means it takes significantly more money to move the price.

I refinanced my house to pay off some debts, and decided as long as I was I’d go maximum LTV, and use what’s left to invest in TSLA.  I bought about $70k of shares.  That was just before the infamous ‘420’ tweet, and the stock started to nosedive.  There was no reason for the stock to react that negatively and I knew it.  This was Elon’s problem, not TSLA’s problem.  Then Q1 came out.  I thought ‘hey guys, we expanded the Model 3 to three new continents this quarter and the cars are on the boats’ to be a dang good reason for the low numbers.  Then there was autonomy day and I realized this thing was massive.  My $70 had turned into $50k, so what did I do?  Did I regret my decision and sell shares to deleverage myself?  No, I sold half my shares and bought 6/19/2020 $420 call options.  The stock continued to nosedive.  I sold the other half of my shares and got more of the same call options.  I work for various car dealerships, and my business will be gone in a few years if TSLA is successful.  So if TSLA fails that means I’ll have a business on good footing.  If I lost my whole investment, my business could still pay my bills and I’d have no change to my quality of life.  The day of the Q3 release, my options were worth $20k.  I almost panic sold to de-leverage, but decided the risk was worth the reward to hold them.  They went up over $100k in value the next two days.
