I had enough residuals to tap our on my 40th birthday, not rich but bills paid and could really evaluate what I wanted to do in life all over again.  It took little time years to realize I don’t like “normal” hobbies.  Golf was lame.  Polo club is cool but it’s really just booze on Sundays for watching the games. Businesses of traditional sense are failing all over the place in the sme size and a new career seems all the HR clowns want is to hire a cookie cutter person that came from the same role elsewhere, zero innovation or interest in fresh approaches.  That was stressful.  \n\nThree years later I now got back in the ring and opened a real estate brokerage after a combination of luck and cleverness developing a market and doing a few dozen deals to crack the process and learn.  I signed up my first deal within 2 days of clear registration (yesterday) and have another one for tomorrow.  Just under a million in production in week one. \n\nBacktrack, I have had horrible nightmares for at least 6 months.  Tonight for the first time I dreamed of big surf and no one in the water (I was a surfer when younger) and I was so happy.  \n\nMy hobby is business.  Let’s go!!!  I’m so thankful to be hopefully shaking off the nightmares, anxiety, and depression.  I’m not a religious guy but hoping everyone sends me good vibes as mental health is really everything.  I hope this feeling can be maintained for the rest of my days.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is the way", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy stocks long lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "$WMT calls & $FIT puts", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is going to go well.
