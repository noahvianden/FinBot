He's generally opposed to excessive regulation of the economy and believes that legislation should have sunset provisions so that outdated regulations don't accumulate over time. He does however, support regulatory efforts to constrain artificial intelligence and protect things like privacy and election security. He has donated to both moderate Republicans and moderate Democratic candidates. Explaining his decision to build the first Gigafactory in Nevada Elon told the moderate Republican governor \"it smells like freedom here\". \n\nHe has a general aversion to much of the work coming out of Big tech companies like Google and has directly criticised Facebook, calling it lame repeatedly. He believes that in the future, direct democracy will supplant representative democracy, with people voting directly in referendums on issues electronically. He supports a carbon tax as the optimal way to solve climate change, but that so long as the government continues massive subsidization of fossil fuel companies there's every reason to provide subsidies for alternatives. He likely supports public-private partnerships in advancing technology, given that SpaceX and Tesla only survived thanks to NASA loans which were paid back in full and led to thriving multi-billion dollar national champions. He also likely is a proponent of atleast high-skill immigration, given that SpaceX and Tesla (as we know it) were only possible thanks to his immigrating to America from South Africa. \n\nIn foreign policy he believes that the United States has been a uniquely good force on the world stage and argues that it has effectively saved the world from totalitarianism twice (during the second world war and during the Cold War). He complains that other countries (specifically Australia) do not value entrepreneurship enough and have a \"cut down the tall poppies\" attitude. He was inspired to start SpaceX by Robert Zubrin's book \"The Case for Mars\", which emphasized the need for a Martian frontier in order to revitalize the dynamism of western civilization. He was also influenced by Robert Heinlein, a notable libertarian author. He complains that technological stagnation is a serious problem (pointing to the stagnation of the space program and aviation as examples). He supported fellow entrepreneur Andrew Yang during the Democratic Primary and believes that a Universal Basic Income will become necessary as automation wipes out huge numbers of jobs throughout the economy.\n\nHe says he cares very much about humanitarian causes and wonders why more people aren't, having given millions to address the water crisis in Michigan. When asked about climate-denier Donald Trump, Elon replied that it's a very good thing that he's only the President and not King, indicating a belief in the value of separation of powers and a limited executive branch. He's complained about socialists (saying they've gone to overpriced universities and have no sense of humor), is hostile to unionization at Tesla plants, and has portrayed Bernie Sanders as a Sonic the hedgehog villain in a meme on Twitter. \n\nHe's \"smoked weed\" (without really inhaling) on the Joe Rogan experience and repeatedly spreads 4/20 memes, so I think it's safe to say he's not a big fan of the war on drugs. There are unconfirmed reports he's done psychedelics. He has publically criticised the American public school system and has sent his own kids to an alternative school with a non-traditional model. He believes the universe is simulated, so it's safe to say he isn't religious in the traditional sense and therefore doesn't subscribe to socially conservative Christian or evangelical causes.  \n\nHe's not a hardcore right-winger like Peter Thiel or Donald Trump, but he's very far from Bernie Sanders' politics.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "good post but in the future I recommend paragraphs", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I honestly would have read that if you had used paragraphs", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I've edited it.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "TL;DR is that putting Elon in a political box will be... challenging.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "And then he goes and founds an anarcho-syndicalist commune on Mars.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I think Elon is basically a social democrat in the European mold, so he'd favor Bernie.

However here are the few things i'm concerned about especially after the recent q4 call.\n\n1. Full self driving is bullshit. Anyone who claims robo taxis will do anything with in the next 5 years (let alone 1-2 years or this year) with the current sensors and tech in the M3 is an living a dream. I'm well aware on how Neural networks work, and unless there's some massive step up or they put a super computer on each car, I don't think it's reasonable to conclude this will happen. I've worked with NNs for finanacial transactional software and it's difficult alone to scale features and optimize models, but for real world driving? Nah.\n2. Profitable, but to what degree? Sure they've produced a profit in the last two quarters, but for the entire year they are down (700$ million). They are actually down in revenue in Q4 from the year before, even when the fed credit was higher!!!\n3. Battery tech. Tesla is probably the most advanced battery tech (Tesla designs, panasonic builds) and perhaps they could push the limits higher (NMC vs NCA, NMC has a lot of potential ). Batterys though have been around for 2 centuries now, I don't expect them to revolutionize batteries so suddenly. Perhaps 10-20% increase, and costs will come down a slight bit with scale but I don't foresee this changing profitability to a high degree in the next 1-2 years.\n4. China. It's great that we have a giga factory in china, however realistically how many cars will they produce and sell? China has a GDP per capita of 8.8k (2017) per year, and it has like 1/15th the millionaires of the US. It's highly unlikely China's population will buy even 30% of the cars they sell in the US. There's also a lot of uncertainty behind coronavirus, authoritarian moves, etc.\n5. The US Economy. Currently we're enjoying a great run in the stock market which seems like it's mostly run from quantitative easing (lots of money from the feds, low interest rates), but do you really expect this to continue? Sure we're not in a recession and it's possible we may not got into one anytime soon but for how long? Also it's not easy for the middle-high class to afford teslas, they're still luxury cars.\n6. Expiring of the Fed credits. This is a big one, Tesla made lots of money from credits alone (remember when it was 7k? and then 3.5k, and then 1.8k and now it's 0). Although the last quarter shows Tesla delivered a staggering number of cars and it doesn't seem like the credits mattered that much, but there's still no gov incentive which definitely will effect this coming year.\n7. Solar business... I don't know anyone that has purchased or even is considering purchasing tesla's solar cells. From the pricing perspective, it's not well matched compared to the industry.\n8. EV credits, this is only 2-3% of their pure profits but this is still pretty decent number especially if other manufacturers are making EVs (although I know there's still no big contenders, Tesla pwns all).\n\nI want to believe in tesla, and I still love Tesla, but 700-800 range is fairytale thinking.

The court will grant Amazon's request or not.\n\nNote: US filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss (sealed), and MSFT, an intervenor in the case, filed a partial 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. I glanced through it. I do not see any response from AWS on the docket yet regarding these motions.\n\nThe AWS injunction motion and supporting materials are 87 pages, terse and verbose. I glanced through them.

I could see the government prevailing by arguing that any significant delay, during which AWS would conduct excruciatingly long discovery, would be deleterious to matters of national security, thereby harming public interest and tipping the scales of 4 (and 3) to the US government.\n\n**TLDR:** If AWS cannot prevail on any of those four points, then the court should deny the AWS Rule 65 motion, and MSFT can then go forward with work on Friday. But, any lawyer will tell you. Nothing is ever in the bag.\n\n**edit: like I said, nothing is ever in the bag with these things. The opinion and order was filed under seal.

At this point, the contract is still a loss since it‚Äôs a $45 call, and SPCE is only $40, right? Incorrect! If you were willing to pay $35 for that contract before when SPCE was all the way down at $20, imagine how much that contract could be worth now.

The volatility of the option contract price drops because there is no longer uncertainty about earnings. Option prices are calculated using derivatives, however volatility is what we typically call \"premium\". When people say you're paying too much premium it means you're paying too much for an option contract due to volatility being high. The lower the volatility, the lower the premium, the lower the price. This is what VIX measures, the volatility. \n\nIf your have options expiring tomorrow, you would have noticed that their volatility was high before earnings and that same option, the volatility will be low right after the earnings. This lowers the price of the contract back to its \"fair\" price, you probably bought the contract at a high premium. So even if you were right on your play, the volatility drop aka \"IV crush\" is going to prevent you from making any profit on your options.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "$40 for a weekly call 30% otm?
