My investment advisor (well intentioned salesperson) walked me through my RRSP fund performance for the preceding year (a pretty decent 15.5% for a mutual find, which I’m going to liquidate this year for a downpayment on a first home). They were just flabbergasted that my *new* RRSP (self directed through Questrade, and mostly made up of TSLA) is up 214% since inception in July 2019 through Jan 31st 2020. \n\nMoreover, when we had the senior investment advisor (a former Sydney-based day trader with a Super) join the meeting for a period to address tax questions and give their ETF sales pitch, we ended up talking about Tesla for the better part of a half hour and it was me who was taken aback by their lack of knowledge about Tesla and the EV market. It was the usual “they’re having quite a run lately but it can’t last now that the big autos are building EVs”.\n\nThey thought that Tesla was nearly out of money and spending more than they make each year, they didn’t know about Tesla’s energy business at all, nor that autonomous is so much more than simply a smart cruise control. They thought Teslas still start at $100k, were slow to charge (“overnight”), and were “pretty unsafe” compared to normal cars. No idea about Tesla semi, didn’t realize that Giga Shanghai was wholly Tesla owned vs a JV. They didn’t realize the Model Y (which they knew was a SUV) was coming out this year (let alone next month), didn’t know about OTA updates or optional post-purchase “DLC”, and hadn’t heard that Tesla designs and builds its own electronics, cameras, battery packs, seats, etc. They thought the Cybertruck was a “wild concept car” and wondered what it would look like if they actually built it. They knew Tesla had “a bunch of fast chargers in the States” but were certain they were “bad” for the car and would “kill” the battery if you used it too often. They also thought that you could only drive a couple hundred kilometres at a time on a road trip before charging. \n\nAltogether, they didn’t really know much at all but were still excited to see its bull run in the market. \n\nIt all just drove home to me what three first names, Dave Lee, Rob Maurer, Gali, etc., (Tesla YouTubers) have been repeating, which is that seemingly much of the traditional financial world has enormous blind spots about Tesla and you have to do your own research and then stick to your plan.

Automotive companies have low margins and extremely high revenue and Tesla can outperform the average but will not be a software company with 20+% margins. 48B$ revenue is rather likely perhaps with about 800k vehicles which is a fairly likely revenue number within a couple years. 50 P/E is appropriate for a company that might still be growing 25-30% at the point it hits that 800k vehicle mark.\n\nThere is no science to this really.

The old CEO John Standley who was a boomer douchebag that basically actively sabotaged the company and brought it from $180+ per share to penny stock status. But management had been changed with sexy CEO mommy Heyward Donigan two quarters ago and also a new COO. During Heyward’s first quarter, the company was already showing that it was rebuilding strength. It’s EPS improved and beat expected by 47.33%. Last quarter’s ER, they beat the $0.15 expected EPS by 261.47% with $0.54 actual. The stock price surged from $7-8 a share to $23.88 in a week. However, profit-taking, gay bears and short ers took tanked it, but RAD found a new support level at around $12. \n           Listening to the last earnings call, the company has very good guidance. They are planning to expand their digital platforms and other services. From the ER call: “We’ve seen the benefit of Rite Care in our business, in our third quarter results, which reflect growth in ancillary immunization of more than 47%, which is outpacing the competition.” Also, “digital sales have been growing over the past few quarters, with a 69% increase in Q3, driven by digital refills.

The sell-off last quarter after the earnings rally was because people were not fully confident that RAD could deliver consistently. But this ER will be bigly for the company.

RAD to $30 as soon as it gets moving.\n*****Alright here comes the fun part.\nThis stock has a 36% short interest. There is massive potential for a short squeeze. The market cap is fucking tiny, at 743 million. Here is an opportunity for us to pump the fuck out of this company. A market cap thats 5x less than SPCE means 5x more tendies and options are dirt cheap at the moment. Also, coronavirus panic + pharmacy stock = tendies.

{"title": "So I actually went to a trading course and what I heard was unbelievable", "selftext": "In my city there's a big bank that offers trading courses with the idea that you will know what you're doing when you open a trading account with them. So far so good, as what I've been learning is mainly from shitposts on the internet and fundamentals in investor books have not been of much help making quick tendies which is just how I like them - what I do is pretty much the opposite as I'm getting richer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I sign up, start going, guy talking is professional but still you can tell he's not dead inside, pretty cool. He's talking about doing analysis, volatility, figures and so on. He's always repeating himself saying how important risk management is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe shows a graph tracking his first 10 months of trading when he started some years ago, he turned 2k into 180k.... and then to 1k in 2 trades. Of course I start laughing a little bit, thinking yeah well that's life, other people in the course are very concerned, they seem to be r/inv\\*sting kind of people. He says to never put more than 10% of your portfolio into 1 thing and not allow yourself to lose more than 2% in a trade. Emphasizes that we need to follow the current trend as it's likely to keep going but never go overboard and blah blah\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo later at one point he's once again saying how important it is to keep in mind some boring real numbers, people ask him about currency trading and he's explaining the boring figures. I ask him what he thinks of $TSLA, he stops for a moment and says that this is just some hype and not sustainable. Then another guy on the course asks how we should trade during the China virus, guy says basically that we should be extra careful. He implies Trump tweets have an important role in market movements. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen he says that if you're having any emotions while trading, you're doing it wrong. I feel personally attacked as trading has become a big source of entertainment, despair and anger, often all at the same time. Ask him how he's trading during a market that's at an all time high. He says he has sold all his positions rn because it's not sustainable and shit will hit the fan any moment now even though he admits it probably won't happen before the end of summer. Ask him why he's not making tendies until then, he says it's beyond his personal risk tolerance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I learned is that I'm doing trading totally technically wrong but still making more tendies than this professional guy is. Turns out we are smarter even though perhaps more retarded than professional traders. Buy all the dips and market can't go down, stonks only go up.

Do you dump right after  or continue to hold?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">How do options behave on acquisition news\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n\"In the case of a buyout offer, where a set amount is offered per share, this effectively limits how high the shares will go, assuming that no other offers come in and the offer is likely to be accepted. So, if the offer price is below the strike price of the call option, the option can easily lose most of its value. On the other hand, options with a strike price below this offer price will see a jump in value.\n\nFor example, on Dec. 4, 2006, Station Casinos received a buyout offer from its management for $82 per share. Looking at the change in the value of the options that day gives a clear indication that some call option holders made out well while others were hit hard. On that day, the Jan 09 options with a strike price of $70, which was well below the offer price of $82, rose from $11.40 to $17.30—a 52% increase. On the other hand, Jan 09 options with a strike price of $90, which is above the $82 offer price, fell from $3.40 to $1—a 71% loss.\"\n\nThe thing I'm wondering about is the $S and $TMUS merger - I think this is an outlier case due to having to get the deal pushed through by the Government? And this is why $S continues to go up beyond the offered and accepted buyout price. I'd love more of an explanation on it though, because I don't fully understand it (clearly).", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Dope news!
