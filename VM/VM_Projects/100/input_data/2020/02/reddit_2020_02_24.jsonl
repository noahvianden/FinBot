Firstly, these big production plants aren’t supposed to allow sick people to work.  If half their staff calls out that’s a major problem. \n\nWhen I worked in poultry slaughter and  we had snow half the place would call out but work would still have to be done.  They could call ahead to farms and tell them not to send truck for the night shift but day shift trucks would already be at the plant.  That meant that 1/3 of the staff would be working on getting the product done. It would take two shifts to slaughter the number of birds that would normally be done in a couple of hours. The birds will die if they get too big so those birds that weren’t slaughtered that day may have been lost.  That’s money down the drain. \n\nWhat I see happening is the ready to eat places start ordering less meat to create their product.  The slaughter houses are usually contracted with farmers or they own farms. They will slaughter the animals and cut up the product.  The grocery stores or the ready-to-eat(deli meats, hotdogs, hams, frozen microwave meals) facilities may not be ordering though. They now have to store this product or throw it out. With poultry the corporations like Tyson and Purdue will provide chicks to the framers to raise.  They won’t be hatching any new birds. Now the farmers have nothing to grow and no income. \n\nIn addition to this there is packaging.  Where do they get the boxes and plastic wrap and print rolls of labels?  Is it American made or do they order from China?  Even if it is American mad where does that American company get their supplies?  \n\nThis doesn’t even address the pharmaceutical industry.

The stats we have now (which are still very early) say the ‘CFR’, or Case Fatality Rate, is about 2%.  This could be artificially high because most cases have not been reported, and a lot are even asymptomatic.  It could be artificially low, because once someone gets sick it takes a while for that to lead to death.  The problem with SARS-COV-2 is that it’s extremely contagious.  The R0 value (Pronounced R-naught) is somewhere between 2.6 and 6.  That means, on average, every sick person will infect 2.6 - 6 other people.  The incubation period for SARS-COV-2 is 5-14 days.  This is the period where the body is getting infected with the virus, and you don’t know you’re sick.  Most flus aren’t contagious during this period, but SARS-COV-2 is!  So you’re going around your life like normal, and little do you know you’re sick and infectious.  This simple fact is what makes the R0 value so high.  When an R0 value is that high - there’s simply no way to stop it without draconian measures.  My hat’s off to China.  Welding doors shut to control exits and actively searching for the sick to take them to containment centers and basically shutting the epicenter of the outbreak down - this is what needs to be done to protect the population.\n\nAs far as the markets are concerned - as more and more countries initiate containment measures, more and more supply chains will be disrupted; nevermind that demand from consumers will noticeably decrease for several months.

From the Wikipedia article [Basic Reproduction Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number): \"R0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen as it is also affected by other factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of the infected population.\" In other words, the infection rate can be changed by changing human behavior. There's an important difference between very difficult and impossible.\n\nBy that interpretation, China has been working to reduce R0 by greatly reducing the opportunity for the virus to spread from person to person. That's what I meant - if a society is willing to work hard enough (in terms of effort and economic cost) (and if there is not a large population of uncontrollable non-human carriers and, if it doesn't lurk in the body for years like herpes), then it can be contained or even eradicated.\n\nSARS (R0 of 2-5 based on a reference in the article) evidently had a higher fatality rate than COVID-19, and the countries of the world were willing to put in the effort to contain it. If society decides that COVID-19 isn't harmful enough to make a serious effort to contain it, then yes, it won't be contained.

No other virus I’m aware of has behaved this way.  That means that the people being reported sick right now - were actually sick a week or two ago.  And who knows who they’ve infected in that time?

More and more governments will be implementing lock-downs, which will drastically affect the economy.  Not to mention the damage that’s already been done by China extending their new year and running at half capacity even now.\n\nAs far as the health effects - the more we can reduce the R0 the better.

To be sure, there are VAST differences between the US and Denmark. It's not a given that things that work in one place work in the other.\n2. To those that argue that having socialized medicine will bankrupt the US, I submit that lots of big, industrialized countries have some version of it, and manage to not go bankrupt. The question is not whether it's possible, but what form one could agree on it taking. In most places that form is some sort of public/private split, where the public system takes care of most non-urgent stuff, and passes the high-margin stuff off to the private sector.\n3. There is always a trade-off between quality, coverage and price in any health care system. In Denmark it's handled by coverage/wait time guarantees that are specific to the urgency and seriousness of the issue. If the public system can't react within the guidelines, you are sent to the private system, on the public dime. So if you have pancreatic cancer you will get swift treatment, but a knee replacement will take time. You are always free to pay for a private health insurance so you can jump the lines, if you prefer. Many companies do so for their workers.\n4. I'd like to point out that universal healthcare expands the available worker pool, which should be good for the economy. Less need for immigrants should be a positive, if you dislike immigrants :)\n5. In the same vein, easier access to high quality college education improves the quality of the worker pool, which should also be good for the economy. If you need less skilled labor, you can rely on (seasonal) immigration for that, which of course is a bad thing if you dislike immigrants...\n\nSo, you know, if you can argue that tax cuts pay for themselves by improving the incentive to work (harder), you can also argue that a bigger, healthier and better educated workforce will also pay for itself by improving the availability of labor.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Shhh, in the US we refuse to believe this and all the data associated with it", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Scandinavia has a much different population and culture.

Of course this will not happen in 2024 but investor are betting in future capabilities. ( so here is my calculation, all north America and Europa public auto company are worth $1T dollar. The average gross profit is 15%, so if Tesla can do twice this, they could worth $1T) However this doesn't count the sales drop due to the robotaxi  \nNow let's evaluate the FSD Business. Waymo, which is in good track to achieve, is currently worth \\~ 200 Billion. If we say that tesla robotaxi will be 10X better ( not just for the service) we obtain that this part of the business will worth 2 Trillion Dollars. In a other document from ARK they said that the company that operate a Robotaxi Network with a 60% fee and that the miles stay flat ( this probably be the case with Tesla because the service will be in a few regions only)would worth $2T in 2030.

Living in Europe and not being rich I wish the Cybertruck reveal had been the Model 2 reveal, because that's the car I can actually afford.

Fact: as you scale manufacturing cost comes down. Fact: prototypes and first of a kind are expensive, as you improve manufacturing processes cost comes down. Fact: Tesla loves to push the check to the customers (not necessarily a bad thing) \n\nLet me explain, Tesla developed the new roster for a similar reason they developed the original roadster. To prove a concept. Concepts are expensive to test and hard to produce so what do they do, they roll them out as a proof of concept on a high cost, high margin car. Eventually tech in the car will be rolled out. \n\nElon has one true dream. Colony in Mars. Every single one of his companies was developed to further that dream. Like it or not, every company is interconnected and necessary. (Deal with it solar City haters) \n\nThis is where it gets tricky, my guess is the cybertruck was designed to lower the cost of the stainless steel alloy used in Space X rockets. The more you need to make the cheaper it is. The check is being pushed to the Tesla customers, in return they get a cool freaking truck.\n\nLowering price of rockets will lower price of payload, lower cost of sending payload will lower the cost of making starlink a reality. Starlink IPO Is Genius because you won't have to give away the control of SpaceX but you will basically have funding secured for years to come.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't be surprised if the stainless steel alloy use in the truck will also be used by the boring company\n\nOn the other hand the model 3 came out before the Y because the Y has a higher market potential. You don't want to be messing around testing and running through manufacturing issues with a potential crown jewel. So even though the Y market is way larger, they decided to iron out the mass manufacturing wrinkles with the model 3. \n\nFinally model 2. For it to work and still have high margins, you will need highly dense and inexpensive batteries (battery investor day ;) ) and a design that can be highly automated (100% or close to that). Once that is achievable, you will see a model 2. The tech just had to be polished.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Great response.

Obviously we can only speculate, but my thoughts is that the logical (IMO) gameplan is to use the CT to learn about this method of production and reduce opex and capex for a truly mass produced model 2/cybercar on that DNA. Going straight to a Cybercar wouldn't make sense, it *will*(/would) cannibalize the model the 3 and the Y, just announcing it could wreck the sales. When they unveil it, they need to be able to massproduce it (7 figures) freshly out of the gate. The CT is a perfect practice ground, it lends itself well to the odd design (looks badass and tough) and has a relatively premium pricetag. This way they can figure out the quirks of the work methods, get *it* thru production hell (it will be though) and with that knowledge be able to iterate on it properly plan a compact car with this design. We know from Munro's insights that the estimated capex is 10x lower than body-on-frame, that is the next car generation which'll put Tesla on price parity with basic ICE (combined with some battery improvements) and achieve proper car volume without requiring the company to go into $200B debt to produce 7-8 figures of cars. But it's also very hard per Musk, so they need that training ground first.\n\nRegarding Mars, IMO Musk's goal with Tesla is to maximizing his net worth and cash out to fund Mars. Kind of repeating Rob here but he's extremely incentivized to make Tesla extremely valuable to fund the extremely expensive Mars colony. Unless the goal is to idle for years while waiting for FSD to happen, in which case I'll regret my investment, CT is the first step towards Tesla rapidly increasing volume.
