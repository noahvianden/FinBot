Usually a stock price tries to reflect what the company will be doing in 5-8 years, (big money investors are patient) but TSLA is growing so fast that where they’ll be in 5-8 years is anyone’s guess.  They did say on the call their goal is to grow faster than 30% CAGR.  Let’s say they grow at 40% CAGR.  That would mean in 8 years they’ll be making 5M+ vehicles/year, (Toyota and VW each make 10M/year) and with better margins than either company.  Let’s say the ASP is 45k, with 35% margin..  That’s 84B profit per year.  That’s 21B per quarter.  180M shares means $470EPS.  Then put a conservative x8 multiple on the share price and you get $3770/share.  And that’s without FSD or Solar or Stationary storage”\n\nThat’s ignoring CAPEX, but it’s also ignoring solar and storage and FSD, and has an extremely conservative price multiple, and Elon said they’re trying to grow faster than 50%, so they probably balance each other out.\n\nThis stock’s run is -nowhere near- being done.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I 100% agree that the stock is not done, but I'm not confidant that it will be a straight line up.

I am mainly asking about those two aspects of the business, for FSD I don't see a serious third player, and regardless it is not something I can truly understand well enough to decide who has the edge other than in surface (TSLA has the driving data and GOOGL has the AI crown thus far, I have no way of comparing their algos). For the sake of the argument, let's pretend individually owned cars are not going away any time soon. As a side note, I do not mean to start a debate of diversification vs concentration, at the end of the day that's a personal decision, similarly to not being all-in SPY and actually picking your holdings. There will be a redistribution of market shares among the players, that much is inevitable IMO and I don't think Tesla will be the only stock to benefit or grow from it once the dust settles. And while dividends will take a hit out of the transition, I think whoever comes out of it alive will be a good holding to have, both for appreciation and as dividend plays since at some point they'll shift back to it rather than pursuing a dozen green ventures like Tesla will (I think/hope they will at least). Also to note, I have not delved into the financials or technological advantages of the other OEMs so I'm mostly brainstorming (with myself if anything, it helps to put one's ideas into writing) and sticking to the story-level discussion.\n\nFor cars it seems that the most serious OEMs in regards to shifting their resource allocation (albeit slowly) would be VW and Daimler. The latter being more of an upper-class car OEM, I do not see them as being able to really increase their market share as the sector shifts, if anything I see them as being really threatened by Tesla's whole car lineup, moreso than \"affordable\" cars OEMs. While some people find them more luxurious to Teslas, I'm sure the car quality of our horse will only be trending upwards. I see Porsche in a similar light. I like VW's stance, the CEO seems to recognize the necessity of shifting and they're willing invest accordingly. My doubts tho is that they basically haven't really done anything yet, there's the e-Golf but I don't even think I've seen any on the road. But then German engineering and STEM is recognized AFAIK, the pivot will be costly but I see them making it out to the other side. The third main one I see is Nissan, they are the go-to EV with the Leaf for people who can't afford the 3 or don't want to overspend (regardless of the 3's ability to maintain it's price second hand, I know a LOT more people with Leafs than 3s, I do not live in SF). Thus far they are I believe the second best seller in the space globally (I do not count GM's Volt as it's hybrid, even tho I actually think it's a good option for single people we're rapidly shifting away from hybrid as charging networks expand and mileage increases). I am not sure how profitable they are with it, they are the first non-Tesla company serious about EVs and I can see them increase their market share, especially until Tesla does not make an entry-level EV which I do not expect until S3XY is fully supplied, which is a few years out, tho my stance is that \"Cybercars\" are the future and I've been advocating for it every since the CT reveal night, once they learn the manufacturing quirks from the CT I think that could be the true ICE killer if Munro (and my layman's intuition) is right regarding manufacturing efficiency. Do you have any thoughts on a brand I am missing as a serious contender? And who can we count out of the race? There are Chinese companies which will do great I believe with their massive market and capabilities, but we do not see them outside of China and I do not want to invest in Chinese companies, not because of principles (I don't think investing is a morale statement), but rather because I cannot trust that their reported numbers are genuine. \n\nFor parts (well, batteries), what are your thoughts on battery makers *à la* Panasonic, CATL and co?

Do you have any opinions if lithium miners are worth digging into? It is clear that demand will only trend upwards, massively so, but the issue is that Li is actually quite abundant and there's no telling that the offer won't be able to follow and keep the prices flat. There's also cobalt plays but those are even more of a crapshoot given battery R&D and innovation. Battery day might be enlightening on what the future holds, hopefully.

Here is my interpretation:\n\nThey figured out dry cells with Maxwell. Every other car company talks about these cells. But Tesla got them. Way earlier than anyone else. Also, Tesla figured out a cost competitive mass production of the cells. This is key, the best technology is not worth much if they cant scale it.

And I disagree on your analogy, it is not like borrowing with interest quite the opposite as that describes the current debt. It is more like a one time payment (say 3-5% dilution) to get rid of said debt and interest (or at least the most expensive section of it). In the end I assume it's probably a valuation disagreement, I think $170B is too much *today* and not sustainable, markets are forward looking but also assume the road won't be a perfectly smooth ride as many overinflated yet legitimate companies have shown in the last. Surely you would accept to raise a sliver (%wise) of capital to erase the debt if the market cap next week reached something that you would think is ridiculous, say $650B (next week, not in 4-5 years), wouldn't you? If not, we'll just have to agree to disagree, and either way it's quite possible that window has closed yesterday.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Isn’t most of the debt already in convertibles?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}

BUT that's not all....they don't expire until 2021...so there is time value there too. Checking on yahoo finance, they're going for $362 (or 36,000) for each contract. 47 contracts x 36,000 = hes at like 1.5m right now.\n\nIf you look at the bottom he originally paid like 6$ or 15$ for these (600$ and 1500$ respectively)...now they're worth 360$ per share per contract or 36,000$ value.

He bought TSLA 450 strike calls back in April when it was trading at 280ish or so. These contracts had no intrinsic value, meaning that they inherently are worthless because there is no reason anyone would buy the right to execute a buy order at a price of $450 when the stock is trading at 280...you can just buy the shares directly from the open market.\n\nSo these options only had extrinsic value, meaning they were only worth money because they don't expire until 2021. Time = money. Given 18 months, there's a lot of uncertainty and technically anything can happen, TSLA could go to 450$, 800$, 2000$, or it could go to 200, 150, 100, or bankrupt. Option sellers fear this uncertainty, but they want to sell you options (its their way of making money). So they have to calculate the risk and see if it's worth selling you the option.\n\nIn this context, option sellers believe that from April 2019 to JAN 2021...the chance of TSLA breaking 450 is low and that chance is worth a premium of 600$ for every 100 share block. So why would someone buy an inherently worthless thing? Leverage. You can command way more shares with options than stock for same amount of money. Risk. You only lose the premium you paid.\n\nSo when TSLA went up above $450, now there is intrinsic value because OP can exercise his contracts to buy at $450 when the stock is trading at $780 on the open market. He paid for this right, but he is not obligated to exercise it. The seller sold him this right and is obligated to sell him TSLA at $450.

When you buy a call for 900 you are buying the right to redeem 100 shares at $900 if the price of the stock is at or above $900 by the expiration date. So many people, myself included, bought these contracts for much cheaper than they cost now because 900 seemed much further away on friday before the price went up 100 dollars. Now the contracts themselves are more valuable because the risk of the 900 strike price not becoming a reality is lesser than it was before the price rose 100 dollars. Thus the contract is trading at a higher price than it was trading at when the price was $600/share.  \nEdit: I hope that helps you understand it better. The best way to learn is to research options trading online then test the water with some lower priced stocks where options are much cheaper than tesla.

As I was writing out my question, I was going down the same line of thinking: I figured the price must go up because other people are now more willing to buy your contract, even though it is still below strike price, because the odds of it hitting the strike price have increased. But you said it much better, that the risk of it not hitting the strike price is now decreased, and thus the value has gone up.\n\nPretty fucking cool - congrats on the gain today man.

How do you avoid your call being exercised? And if I buy a call on Robinhood, how do I sell it?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "your call will be exercised at End of Trading day on the expiration date. The only way to avoid this is to either A) If the price is above your strike(In the Money ITM) and you hold enough capital to purchase 100 shares of the stock at the contract price then you can redeem the contract and purchase 100 shares for the strike price on contract. This is nice if you have the capital because you can buy the stocks at a lower price than the current sale price. People with bankroll use this method to roll into possible longterm investments. For instance if i had call options in tesla at $400 or something super low I would much rather own the stock outright than trade options(but thats just me). This also opens up other pathways like dividents, voting rights, and other trading strategies that require stock capital.  \nOption B) You sell the contract before the expiration at End of day on the expiration date. I feel like the majority of this sub, myself included,chooses this option, due to capital constraints or because they like day trading instead. The thing to realize here is that if you are chasing down a strike price, and cutting it close your contract could actually lose potential value. An example: You buy a 2/07 exp 800 call for TSLA. TSLA bobbles up to 799 but never crosses 800. You have held this contract all day hoping it would cross 800 and maybe even hit 802. You watch that line jut up and down all afternoon while you sit at work and then you realize its an hour until the markets close. Now when you go to sell your contract is worth much less than it was 2 hours ago and you might even run into issues getting the order filled due to other traders increasing lack of interest in taking on the now much riskier call option contract you are trying to sell.   \nIf you end up forgetting about a contract or you botch a sale or something to that effect then robinhood will automatically try to sell your order at limit price at the time of expiration. If it cannot sell it then the options contract expires and is actually taxed as a net gain. With all this being said, you should try to have an exit strategy in mind when you begin a potential trade. Even after you make it in the money, if the contract exp is some time away, you might want to look at bull put spreads and bear put spreads to minimize risk involved with holding an option over the course of a longer period of time. I recommend everyone who reads this go read up on options on a site like Investopedia, at least to get a better understanding of the strategies available to you the trader.
