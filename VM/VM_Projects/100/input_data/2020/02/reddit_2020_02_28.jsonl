{"title": "My advice for people panicking right now", "selftext": "I am by no means an expert or a veteran in this sport, but I have seen these sudden drops enough times to have learned something (mostly from personal experience).\n\n1. Take a breath and think rationally about what is happening right now that is causing the drop. Flu has been around since the dawn of men, and it's a consistent annual killer of about 50000 people around the world. Corona is just a type of flu that was given a name and some media attention. With a death toll of under 3000 so far and symptoms, infection rates and death rates similar to the \"regular\" flu, there is nothing special about it to warrant any kind of panic behavior. For comparison 500 000 people die of malaria annually. Do markets drop because of malaria?\n2. Figure out if the market is acting irrationally. Best indicator is if all the stocks are dropping at the same rate no matter the industry or the potential impact from the corona virus. is DAL going to be affected by the virus? Well people are going to be traveling less, so it's a safe bet that their revenue will drop. Will MSFT be infected by the virus at the same rate as DAL? A company selling PC software and cloud platforms? Probably not. Then why are they dropping at the same rate? IRRATIONAL MARKET\n3. Don't be a part of the herd. The market is moved by the average of all trading activity. An average investor is just that - average. Be better than average. Look at what the best of the best (buffet, icahn) are doing. Are they panic selling? No\n4. NEVER PANIC SELL! Are you invested in quality companies that you can see being healthy in 10 years? Then why would you sell now?? Take any of those companies and look at their stock price for the past 10 years. Did they go through dips of 20% or more? Most likely yes. Imagine the people that sold back then. Fools, right? If you sell now, you will probably end up reentering the position at a higher price when you figure out \"thing are going back to normal\"\n5. Don't short stocks. Are you a professional trader looking to squeeze every cent out of the market? No? Then NEVER SHORT STOCKS! It's simple math. Max potential gain of an unleveraged stock short is 100% (if the stock goes to 0 - highly unlikely!). Potential loss is unlimited (because the stock can go up indefinitely). Even the best of the best have lost fortunes on shorting (famous bill ackman herbalife short)\n6. If you have the cash - buy the dips, if not - hold. The virus will fade, markets will rebound. They always do. Worse things have happened. World wars, debt crises... Markets always rebound.\n7. Don't look at your portfolio every 5 minutes and don't try to time the bottom.

It will give you comfort knowing that you are buying great names at a discount when others are panic selling. You will be all the better knowing you bought low and will ride the eventual rise. \n\nAs well keep an emergency fund that you don't touch and this will give you more peace of mind during sell offs. You will be able to stand strong and weather the storm strong while taking advantage of discounted prices on wealth producing assets. Nothing better than this\n\nMy buy point flashes as soon as the indexes drop 15% from the high and I buy in periodic terms. I bought Thursday and Tuesday of this week. Waiting to see what happens next week to do my last round of buys for the time being. All viruses pass, we forget, and cure/treatment is found. \n\nI know all of this sounds cliche but I've been implementing this technique since I was as caught with my pants down in 2018. I prepared my self for this type of environment and came in with a strong personal balance sheet in terms of my finances. A good emergency fund, plus money to buy discounted stocks, and a solid portfolio of companies.

Nasdaq itself only fell by 16% and recovered 4% of that already, reducing the correction to -12%, so the TSLA drop has possibly overreacted, almost by a factor of 3.\n\nJust to demonstrate the overreaction: one of the biggest drops this week was when Bloomberg issued a borderline fraudulent report of Tesla sales supposedly \"dropping\" in January - while in reality they posted their best-ever first month of the quarter and became \\#1 EV makers in China by production and sales volume:\n\n[\"Tesla Model 3 Was Best Selling Plug-In EV Car In China In January\"](https://insideevs.com/news/401151/tesla-model-3-best-selling-china-january/)\n\nBloomberg pulled off this stunt by comparing December sales (which are seasonal and logistically peaks due to several shiploads of Fremont cars reaching China) to January sales.\n\nI believe the widely syndicated Bloomberg report, parroted by Fred as well, is priced in incorrectly, and the February numbers (due in the next two weeks) might falsify it despite the coronavirus shutdown in the first week of February.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I personally wouldn’t put a lot of weight on the market paying attention to a fake news item.

There is a great amount of overreaction and the economy at large has been impacted. \"Stability\" (whatever that means in the context of TSLAs volitility norm) , could be in a week, month, 6 months, or more, very unpredictable. I would never sell if it was market manipulation, negative news on tesla, or threats of \"tesla killer\" competition. But the panicked overreaction presents an opportunity to book profits knowing macro may drop the share price lower due to the sell off and in some cases valid concerns about supply chain or demand generation during a time like this. I still believe Tesla's current value is between 650 and 800, and 2 to 3 year  future value is over 1 or 2k (likely more). So for anyone else invested do what you feel best according to your risk appetite. I am taking some advantage of the situation and using the extra liquidity to buy more call options on tesla which are rather cheap at the moment. I'm targeting 2021 and 2022 calls which I'm fairly confident will hit the strike prices and earn a significant amount if the media overreaction and speculation of the world ending doesn't transpire, but what good is your liquidity in that case anyways 😂. I may also buy a few puts on GM, Ford, and others. Perhaps also travel companies, and cruise lines as those are likely guaranteed to go down and I  can likely recover any lost gains from my remaining 50 percent in TSLA till it hits (hopefully never) my average cost stop loss at 250. In summary, not best situation short term but long term this can help anyone increase their position or get in at a lower price if they never had the chance.

Technical issues in the repo market pushed the effective Fed Funds Rate above the Fed’s target, so they had to inject huge liquidity into that market in order to bring repo rates, and thus market Fed Funds Rate back into target. It's not QE, it's liquidity management in order to control the FF rate.\n\nLong version – I’ve paraphrased this source https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/01/28/what-is-the-repo-market-and-why-does-it-matter/\n\nOK. Let’s start with the Fed. Their main instrument of policy rate control is the Fed Funds Rate which dictates interest rates in US markets. At the moment the Fed Funds Rate is 2 – 2.25%, as it was back in September when this whole thing started.\n\nA repurchase agreement (repo) is a short-term secured loan: one party (a bank) sells securities  (bonds it holds on its balance sheet) to another and agrees to repurchase those securities later at a higher price. The securities serve as collateral. The difference between the securities’ initial price and their repurchase price is the interest paid on the loan, known as the repo rate. A reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) is the mirror of a repo transaction. In a reverse repo, one party purchases securities and agrees to sell them back for a positive return at a later date, often as soon as the next day. Most repos are overnight, though they can be longer.\n\nThe repo market allows financial institutions that own lots of securities (e.g. banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds) to borrow cheaply and allows parties with lots of spare cash (e.g. money market mutual funds) to earn a small return on that cash without much risk, because securities, often U.S. Treasury securities, serve as collateral. Financial institutions do not want to hold cash because it is expensive—it doesn’t pay interest. \n\nThe Federal Reserve (NY Fed) uses repos and reverse repos to conduct monetary policy to control the Fed Funds Rate mechanism in markets. When the Fed buys securities from a seller who agrees to repurchase them, it is injecting reserves into the financial system. Conversely, when the Fed sells securities with an agreement to repurchase, it is draining reserves from the system.  \n\nThe repo rate spiked in mid-September 2019, rising to as high as 10 percent intra-day and, even then, financial institutions with excess cash refused to lend.  This was way outside the Fed Funds Rate and is unusual because the repo rate typically trades in line with the Federal Reserve’s benchmark federal funds rate at which banks lend reserves to each other overnight. The Fed’s target for the fed funds rate at the time was between 2 percent and 2.25 percent; volatility in the repo market pushed the effective federal funds rate above its target range to 2.30 percent. This severely blunts the effectiveness of the Fed to control its funds rate in the market, which was pricing outside of the target. \n\nThe reason for the spike was due to a couple of technical issues that coincided. The main one being since 2014, the Fed stopped the QE program and has been reducing its balance sheet as it winds down QE since 2017.\n\nTwo other  events coincided in mid-September 2019 to increase the demand for cash: quarterly corporate taxes were due, and it was the settlement date for previously auctioned Treasury securities. This resulted in a large transfer of reserves from the financial market to the government, which created a mismatch in the demand and supply for reserves. But these two anticipated developments don’t fully explain the volatility in the repo market.\nPrior to the global financial crisis, the Fed operated within what’s known as a “scarce reserves” framework. Banks tried to hold just the minimum amount of reserves (banks have to keep 10% of deposits as reserves on their balance sheets for regulatory reasons), borrowing in the federal funds market when they were a bit short and lending when they had a bit extra. Banks don’t want to hold excess reserves above the 10% on their balance sheet because its dead money. The Fed targeted the interest rate in this market and added or drained reserves when it wanted to move the fed funds interest rates.\n\nFurther background to why the spike happened last year: Between 2008 and 2014, the Fed engaged in Quantitative Easing (QE) to stimulate the economy. The Fed created reserves to buy securities, dramatically expanding its balance sheet and the supply of reserves in the banking system. As a result, the pre-crisis framework no longer worked, so the Fed shifted to an “ample reserves” framework with new tools – interest on excess reserves (IOER) and overnight reverse repos (ONRRP), both interest rates that the Fed sets itself – to control its key short-term interest rate. In January 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee – the Fed’s policy committee – confirmed that it “intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.” When the Fed stopped its asset purchasing program in 2014, the supply of excess reserves in the banking system began to shrink. When the Fed started to shrink its balance sheet in 2017, reserves fell faster.\n\nBut the Fed didn’t know for sure the minimum level of reserves that were “ample,” and surveys over the past year suggested reserves wouldn’t grow scarce until they fell to less than $1.2 trillion. The Fed apparently miscalculated, in part based on banks’ responses to Fed surveys. It turned out banks wanted (or felt compelled) to hold more reserves than the Fed anticipated and were unwilling to lend those reserves in the repo market, where there were a lot of people with Treasuries who wanted to use them as collateral for cash. As demand exceeded supply, the repo rate rose sharply.\n\nFed officials concluded that the dysfunction in very-short-term lending markets may have resulted from allowing its balance sheet to shrink too much and responded by announcing plans to buy about $60 billion in short-term Treasury securities per month for at least six months, essentially increasing the supply of reserves in the system. The Fed has gone out of its way to say that this is not another round of quantitative easing. \n \nThe New York Fed has been injecting money into the repo market, where investors borrow cash in exchange for high-quality collateral like Treasuries, for almost three months, in an attempt to stave off a shortage of short-term funding that had led interest rates to drift outside the central bank’s target range. They are still doing this and it’s for this reason and this reason alone. This is not QE, however. The Fed are not making Large Scale Asset Purchases.

{"title": "Why $GILD is Ready to Break Out 💹📈↗", "selftext": "**$GILD** is set to 🚀🚀🚀. Ride the Coronavirus fear\n\nYesterday,  [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) made a post arguing to buy $GILD for 2/27 Market Open. I made the argument that $GILD was overbought and was likely to crash soon, and our time to buy would be within the next 2 weeks as the market calmed down from Coronavirus fears.\n\nI think that time is Friday 2/28 **AT THE DIP** Edit: bolded it for you illiterate fucks LMAO stop messaging about buying at open\n\nIMPORTANT DEETS:\n\n1. $GILD leading coronavirus treatment progress overall. (Remdesivir) [https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html)**\"There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's remdesivir,\"** Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said at a press conference in Beijing.\n2. $GILD has been testing the vaccine/treatment in China and are on PHASE 3 already. They've been hyped over Phase 1 trial news in the US so far. Every Phase they pass will be a huge $$$ boost[https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19)\n3. \\*\\*\\*\\*Most other overhyped companies are just starting PHASE 1, and they havent even passed it yet.\n\nNow check the graph below. Top to bottom we have 3 indicators for the last 5 days. For those in need of a refresher, we're looking at Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index, and the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63o7zzjsjkj41.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=811e6ec95bca9e3faa1693a3c73d8c53edf9e16e\n\nTogether, this confirms some previous beliefs, and establishes the basis for several more conclusions.\n\n1. Prior to market open on 2/27, we see from the RSI that the security is likely to be overbought with an RSI \\~70, indicating that we should prepare for a return to \\~RSI 50 (our equilibrium).\n2. At 2/27 Market Open, Investors scramble to buy $GILD and the price skyrockets, bringing us to the next indicator we will analyze, being the Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands show the 2 standard deviations above 2 below the SMA. We see that the Bollinger Band breakthrough causes Wall St Algorithmic Trading bots to instantly sell, driving price down and further triggering private trading bots to instantly sell and secure % gains. Thus, the hype finally crashes due to OVERhype and botting reaction to it. (70% of trading in US is algorithmic, you are not just playing with people, but also machines)\n3. WSB users still autistic and bought high and going to sell low on 2/27.\n\n🍆🍆🍆\n\nHOWEVER, this provides us with the opportunity now to buy in on 2/28 to prepare for the weekend as the evidence below will show.\n\n1. Look at the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator. We see over the last 5 days, there has been a gradual increase of people BUYING $GILD. The indicator is as it sounds. It's cumulative, meaning that a rise means more people are buying, and a fall means more people are selling.\n2. This overall uptrend of the Accum/Dist Indicator gives us the confidence to BUY IN. But we need to get the timing right to avoid the Autistic ™  fall of those following [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) yesterday (probably seeing a 30% fall in ~~put~~  Call premiums after they purchased at market open AKA losing 1/3 their money in 10 minutes).\n3. Now follow the RSI line and note how it falls to \\~40. This in combination with the Bollinger Bands beginning to tighten and the $GILD price evening out indicates to us that a short squeeze may be imminent (with prices shooting up likely Monday or Tuesday).\n\nPREDICTIONS:\n\n1. FRIDAY 2/28 $GILD goes up from Market Open and if you buy Calls, you'll be winning right out the gates.\n2. If $GILD goes down after Market Open but you bought Calls already, you'll temporarily be losing money. HOWEVER, after the weekend, with the buildup of coronavirus news, California potential OUTBREAK, and DJIA going down, $GILD will be set to skyrocket anyways and you'll be rolling in the tendies 🤑🤑\n3. Goes down at open. BTFD\n\nTLDR;\n\nBuy $GILD $80-$90 Calls for 3/20 - 4/17.

{"title": "I turned $96.90 into ~$18.7k in the last 6 trading days after learning the way of the FD.", "selftext": "Been seeing some pretty weak % gains on the front page of the sub lately, even with all the volatility over the past few days,  so I thought it was time that I finally show off mine after unlocking a higher tier of autism. \n\nFirst, the current one week view of my Robinhood Account: https://imgur.com/a/OdLoKcb\n\nAnd the one week view from last Tuesday (2/25/2020): https://imgur.com/3uutSI3\n\nMy trades over the past few days:\n\nSPY Trades: https://imgur.com/a/xU4odvt\n\nOthers: https://imgur.com/a/XGYW3YG\n\nAnd positions from earlier today: https://imgur.com/gBcrbOt\n\nNow, you're probably asking yourself, how did this autist manage to get a 19,192% return in the last few days? And why didn't they put in more money to become even richer or is OP just that poor?\n\nTo answer all those questions, first, you must look into WSB's past. Many of you know the legends of the $NVDA puts guy, the $ROKU puts guy, or u/__Fog__ All of them had one thing in common, weapons grade autism and making small fortunes using FDs. I sought to recreate their success over the last few months by undergoing similar conditions, i.e. very little money and a terrible brokerage like Robinhood. \n\nNow why did I subject myself to this?\n\nAs u/ipa-warrior much more eloquently puts an observation I made several months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa08kj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_27_2020/fiwgmow/\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt;I cracked the code on something over the past few months. I noticed that whenever I throw say, 25%+ of my account into one dumb trade, I tend to lose my ass. Comparatively, when I make a relatively small trade, 5%-10% of my portfolio, I'll often close up 50-300%. I would then scream at the monitor as to why I didn't make a \"big play\" when I win.  \n\nAnd they are absolutely right. Hypothetically, I could have YOLO'd everything and be a multi-millionaire right now, but realistically and truthfully, there is no way I could have done the same thing with everything I have. My emotions would become a very restricting factor. I might panic sell seeing my account lose tens of thousands of dollars in minutes, I might sell too early, or I might just straight up ruin my life clinging to a position. With much smaller amounts that really are nothing to me, I could rid myself of these negative factors and potentially achieve peak WSB autism. \n\nThus leads to my current theory and why I achieved such bigly % gains: \n\nThe more inconsequential your deposit amount is, the more restrictive your positions are, and the shittier the brokerage you're using (Robinhood violated Regulation T, got fined for front running customers, and can't even get a 1099 right), the more likely you can FD your way to some bigly gains. \n\nExhibit A- My 1-year graph RH graph to display my observation period losing money to FDs attempting to recreate that success: https://imgur.com/Ruf45UU\n\nFirst spike: Tesla puts April to May 2019 (Didn't go far enough OTM)\n\nSecond spike: Roku puts, September 2019 (Didn't reinvest my bigly gains into more ROKU puts, which would have outdone the legendary ROKU puts guy). \n\nDecline between second spike and now: FDs on a multiple stocks. No hits. Kept depositing less and less money even though I was trying to mirror my positions in TD. This did not work since I was trying to mirror an account that is much larger and can easily absorb losses, which fell into the gambler’s fallacy.\n\nThird spike (now): Looking for the frothiest stock valuations to buy OTM puts on for quick profits, especially valuation bubbles which will be the biggest winners imo\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talks. \n\nTLDR; Autism + FD = More Tendies\n\nEdit: Knowing big players are blantly lurking the sub, I'm not going to post my current positions in case others in the sub follow me and fuck with by vibe.\n\nEdit 2: Apparently my imgur links were fucked.

Easiest is to roll it out to 45 days.  Better way is to sell a call (or call spread aka credit call spread). Sell the call that's thehalf the delta of your sold (or the put in your put credit spread).  That neutralizes the delta.\n\nFor example, let's say on Monday you sell a SPY 285 put  (ie. naked spy put) with 45 DTE, then SPY drops to 290.  You would look at the delta of your sold SPY put.  Let's say the delta is now 30.  Then you would look at the call options for the same DTE, find the one at 15 delta and sell that call (ie. naked call).\n\nIf it keeps going against you until it's in the money then you roll the untested side to create a straddle.  \n\nSo let's say Tuesday SPY drops to 280.  Most people see that and panic.  Like, oh shit I could get assigned or this could could keep going down and them I'm screwed.  But you just roll down the call to 280 (buy back your sold call and sell the 280 call).  \n\nIf it keeps going against you then you go inverted and chase the atm or slightly in the money call.  \n\nSo if Wednesday SPY goes to 270, you roll down your SPY call again to 270 or 269.\n\nOnce you get to 21 DTE roll both the call and put at the same strikes out to 45 days.\n\nThe premium you are making from selling the calls and separately extending the time (ie. rolling out to 45ish days at 21 DTE) counteracts the losses from the sold put.  Plus high IV like right now will come down and that alone will increase the value of both the naked put and the naked call.  Actually that's why if nothing else just roll the naked  put out.\n\nAnd if you don't get to within 21 DTE you will very rarely if ever get assigned.  Even if you are super deep in the money.  I think it's happened to me once, maybe twice in all the years I've traded.  And if it does it's not that big of a deal.  Like in this case if got assigned on the 270 call, you get 100 shares of SPY at $270 per share (which is exactly what the stock price is at) AND you get to keep the premium.  So then you just sell the 100 shares at no loss and keep the premium from selling the call (multiple times) which will be more than you lost on the sold put (so you still profit in the end).\n\nI call it defense because the motto I always take when selling naked options (which is what I primarily do) or credit spreads is that once I get that premium $ from selling a naked call/put or call/put credit spread I'm not giving it back easily.  I'll fight and fight to keep it.\n\nI'll roll out the date (and usually get even more premium), roll down a put or up a call to create a straddle, go inverted, go inverted and then roll out the date again.  \n\nNowadays since I've done it for so long it's actually kind of fun.  Like I have this \"oh you sure as hell aren't getting this $ back no matter what\".  And it's gotten extreme before.  Actually Im still battling Tesla and that might have been the craziest ha.  I sold a 520 call and 525 call before TSLA went to 900-1000.  At one point I was (theoretically) down $150k.

Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally.
