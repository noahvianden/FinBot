However - because of the different engines being placed more forward and higher on the wings, this will change how the aircraft ‘feels’ to the pilots under very specific scenarios.  This means that the 737-MAX couldn’t be placed in the same ‘class’ of aircraft as the rest of the 737s, which would mean the airlines would need to re-train all their pilots.  Boeing’s solution?  Augment the maneuvering characteristics of the plane in those specific scenarios.  Enter MCAS.  MCAS was supposed to be something invisible to the pilots, as it’s very purpose was to allow the pilots to fly the plane the same as any other 737.  And it was a good idea.  Problem was - in its design the engineers allowed for a single failure point - the stall detector.  If this sensor started thinking the plane was approaching a stall - one of the scenarios where the plane would behave differently with the new engines - it would trigger the controls to nose down without pilot input.\n\nThe plane itself is physically stable.  It really is a software glitch that can be re-programmed to also use other sensors to detect the stall.  Then give pilots a good training on the MCAS system and what it’s designed to do and when.  Those two things would 100% fix the problem with the planes themselves.  Bigger issue is how the cultures inside Boeing and the FAA allowed this to happen in the first place.

I look at the big numbers first - total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered. I then look at the graph at the bottom right. Is the orange line (Mainland China cases) plateauing? Is the green line (recovered cases) trending up? Is the yellow line (international cases) staying flat? Yes, yes and yes. All good news.\n\nNumber of deaths in Shanghai where G3 is? Still only one so far and an increasing number of recovered patients in Shanghai. This is one is really important. If there's a sudden spike in cases in Shanghai, that will be an issue. If you zoom into the map, Shanghai has 299 confirmed cases so far which is the lowest or one of the lowest in the entire region of all major centers. Hubei, the epicenter, is about 1000 km from Shanghai and is heavily quarantined so transmission shouldn't be a concern at this point. Out of the two closest cities, Zhejiang has more cases at around 1000 and is 300-400 km from Shanghai but from my understanding is also quarantined so transmission to Shanghai is not likely at this point. I expect there will be a few more deaths unfortunately in Shanghai as time goes on but also a slowed increased rate of confirmed cases and a trend upwards with recovered cases which are all reassuring.\n\nAs long as these numbers are fairly accurate it's looking good so far as long as there is no further focus of infectivity somewhere in China or elsewhere. There's a good chance cases are under reported due to milder cases and/or poor or lagging recording/testing/diagnostic methods but overall things should be ok based on what I have been seeing. It's also hard to mistrust international data as we can be more sure of the numbers the US, Canada, etc. are reporting and those numbers have all been reassuring so far. I believe China is being very aggressive in shutting things down and quarantining high risk areas more so because of the infectivity of the virus rather than the lethality of it. Things can change of course but looking at these numbers so far has been reassuring.\n\nHaving said all that, the market is an emotional place and it's totally reasonable to suspect the Western world will react negatively to news coming from China out of distrust, fear or other reasons.

{"title": "$TMUS, $S, $SPCE and on and on gains for the day", "selftext": "A bunch of people have been messaging me about my gains from the $S and $TMUS merger I had posted about so I am making this post lazily to show.  Don't really feel like summarizing it all perfectly accurately so i'll post general summary and screenshots and y'all can see.  All-in-all was up $81k end of day max intraday was around $94k in the morning.  Not my best day ever but not going to complain either.\n\nIt is kind of hard to give all the exact numbers because I don't sell things all at once... but i will break down the summary for the day below.\n\nBest gain was as much as 12,500% on the option i screen shotted below.  I sold most between 11,600-12,000% and only one contract at 12,500% :(\n\nI messed up as I had $5,500 in calls that I had sold the day before on accident right at market close and couldn't correct it which would have netted around $12,000 extra profit.\n\n* **$TMUS -** $280 --> $16-17k\n* **$S** \\- $5,500 --> $68,000+-\n\nI have a lot of positions and make a lot of trades so it is hard to indicate the rest of the day, lol but needless to say I am not upset with where I landed.  Sold most of the $S and $TMUS - opened some shorts on $S even though prob not a good idea, etc.  Opened a bunch of new hedges and explored some new potential positions with some initial calls. Blah blah blah who cares.\n\nI always expect some loss throughout day as I am hedging various positions and do not go all in and YOLO like y'all love.  However, through a bit more modest gains held down by my hedges I have protected myself from losing everything and instead come out on top on multiple occasions.\n\nPosting my daily/weekly/monthly below as well.  Needless to say, it has been a decent 2020.

This tells me we are very very close to seeing ticket sales re open.\n\nAdd this with the fact we have that conference coming up and earnings call where they will need news like re opening ticket sales  to show that new revenue will be coming in and we can start to paint the picture and know what to expect. \n\nNow surprise, we can make decisions which have a decent probability of providing gains rather than jumping into a position blindly and screaming yolo :). \n\nIt’s also hard to deny that $SPCE is far above where I ever imagined it would be when I bought the stock and options when it was a mere $7.20.  I was expecting this price point maybe June ? July? When they first fly Branson.  \n\nI agree with Morgan Stanley that sentiment can rock this to $60 in the right circumstance but would also be cautious.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I want to find a community where nerdy news and analysis is gone over like you do.

Rather I will generally slowly add to my short position as my long positions move up as a portion of the gains.  This way I am not going to really notice any loss on the shorts and will be increasingly covered on a drop — with the stronger the drop bringing more and more of my previously lost equity to life.  \n\nBut I’m a bull to the death... so i hedge purely to make some potential gains on a drop and move them to calls for amplified recovery love.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So buying puts vs selling calls then.

No, I'm still alive and still selling options on TSLA. \n\nSadly I closed those naked calls on Tuesday last week and did not benefit from the the complete reversal on Wednesday. That 69k day loss would have been no loss plus a gain if I were to have held til Friday. However since I was way over leveraged and had negative 113k option buying power that morning, I don't think riding it out would have been a good idea. Shit could have continued up for all I know, and that would have deepened the losses. Life goes on. I could have moped and stayed home, but I actually went out to the gym soon after market close, and then the grocery store afterwards. Still have to eat and workout, even though it was the worst trading day of my life.\n\nThe lone Feb 21 $480c was nearly a reverse 100 bagger when I closed it. Quite possibly the WSB record for a reverse bagger, not that anyone would want to break it. Sold for $4.50 credit, bought back in the $410 range I believe ($40k loss on that strike alone).\n\nMy goal is to get back to even on the year on TSLA alone. I won't give any updates until I get there (if I do). Similar goal is to get back to positive for the year overall even if I don't quite get there with TSLA. Will provide an end of year update. I'm sure you can get an idea of how I'm doing based on my post/comment volume. I tend to turtle when shit is going bad in order to focus on trading. \n\nDespite TSLA only moving 0.68% Tuesday 2/11 (yesterday), I happened to capture $11.6k due to the nature of being short vega and benefiting from a drop in volatility: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hQBre71.png\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns.

I love the crazy yolos and overall chaos of wsb.  Do whatever you want with your money.  But if you don't learn from mistakes, you will 100% blow up your account. \n\n My first account in the mid to late 90s. The tech bubble wasn't as much of a surprise as people make it out to be.  Microsoft was found guilty of anti trust laws, and the entire NASDAQ dropped almost 10% that day. Newspapers had articles like this one: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2000-04-02/commentary-earth-to-dot-com-accountants\n\nSo I avoid dot com companies, and go with biotech.  People need drugs, we have unregulated drug prices, we have now sequenced the entire genome, people with PhDs and MDs are saying all these diseases are going to be cured.... literally can't go tits up (in my mind).  \n\nI was YOLOing biotech OTM options like crazy, and biotech stocks already trade like options and then you add in the leverage of options and since stonks only go up I was destined to be a rich asshole by 25.  \nIt's not if, it's when.  \n\nThen Jesse Gesslinger died in 1999 and it was all over.

I mention above that I was down $150k in TSLA.  But it's all relative.  $150k was the peak loss in one $500k portfolio margin account at one point in time.  Or you could say one account was briefly down 30%.\n\nAnd I've been in this guys situation before (not enough buying power) and there is nothing you can do.  IV and stock/strike prices change, Delta's shift, buying power goes down.  That 10 delta put you sold is now a 40 delta put and still moving. But if you don't enough buying power, youre done.\nNow I always have 50% buying power (which is easier in portfolio margin accounts like this one).\n\nWith buying power there are defenses and strategies to come back. And I am. There is money to be made right now in TSLA (and BYND).  \n\nEmbrace the chaos.  Buy options in low IV, sell in high, and be ready to play defense.\n\nRoll the untested side, go inverted if need be, roll out at 50% profit or 21 DTE, make money.\n\nTSLA is not staying at 767 forever.
