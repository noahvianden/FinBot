The rule is triggered when a stock price falls at least 10% in one day. At that point, short selling is permitted if the price is above the current best bid. This aims to preserve investor confidence and promote market stability during periods of stress and volatility. The rule's \"duration of price test restriction\" applies the rule for the REMAINDER OF THE TRADING DAY and the FOLLOWING DAY. It generally applies to all equity securities listed on a national securities exchange, whether traded via the exchange or over the counter.\"\nMeaning that FRIDAY, 7TH of FEBRUARY, 2020 – Regularly scheduled Short Selling will resume, WATCH for the 10am VOLUME Spike + PRICE DROP. \n\n#2 Shorts can keep shorting to drive down the price until they hit -10%. \n-10% = -$75; About 750 – 75 = $675\nCan it go down further? Yes and most likely it will because there is a GAP (between 673 and 650) in addition to the fact that people’s STOP LOSSes will be HIT when price is dropped 10%, or it hits the GAP. \nWhy will it continue to drop if the UPTICK RULE KICKS IN at 675? Because STOP LOSSES + REAL SELLERS who want to keep their profits as they see a 10% bleed, will SELL at this price. I don’t know how many, but at least some will. Generally, when stocks are volatile in both directions, GAPS GET FILLED. \n\n#3 I believe, and as is reported, Stocks like TSLA are held by many MILLENNIALS. Which I imagine to be early 20’s (in or right out of college age,) and late 20’s, so just starting to make good money, depending on their career. I am assuming a greater number of males than females are in this group of investors. Young MALES, especially in their 20’s are prone to take HIGH RISKS for rewards situation, GET RICH QUICK. New platforms like Robinhood provide quick & easy access to anyone with money, even if its small amounts. Plus they easily allow to LEVERAGE your account.\n\n#4 VOLUME , on Thursday has RELATIVELY DRIED UP at only 2/3 of Tuesday and 4/5 of Monday and Wednesday (a huge down day). I believe that when a stock is this volatile and people are expecting the short squeeze of a lifetime the price correlates to volume. When People think they're getting a discount they pay the ASK price, drives the prices higher. When they feel like it’s overpriced then no one is buying at ASK price, so volume is lower; Shorts hit all the BIDS and price drops. Many people are already leveraged or ALL IN. NO ONE* is coming to catch the Knife dropping-stock at this point. If they are smart they won’t, if they are dumb they already maxed out. \n\nI've been comparing volume for every 30 min interval for the past 3 to 10 days. Same time frames + adjacent. I've found for every 30 minute interval where volume does not exceed on the previous days, the price DROP, because not enough interest at that price. Especially today with the SHORTS Variable removed. I think volume is key, and it is very down. \n\nNot to start throwing out hypotheticals, I know people in that group who have bought TSLA on LEVERAGE because of the RECENT SPIKE. Once this stock starts hitting lows that make their account go into the NEGATIVES, they are going to have to DUMP it or LOSE more than they ever had. Either abandon ship or sink with it.\n\nSo, CONSIDER ALL THE FACTORS. \nThursday, finished green +2%, there was relatively NO DOWNWARD pressure, the SHORTS’ hands were tied. Friday, SHORTS are coming in guns blazing. From the breakout of Monday-Thursday, Volume has declined, people are scared, they dont want to buy in at this price. Shorts will easily take out the top bids and drive it down. There is no reasonable SHORT TERM LOGIC for TSLA to be this high, EVENTUALLY it will be, therefore NO UPWARD pressure. The SHORTS will HIT the STOP LOSSES + lots of Leveraged REAL SELLERS will lose everything in that drop + anyone who Liked the feeling of hitting the lottery in the past 3 months and wanna keep the gains(anyone with a wife)= SELL SELL SELL. \n\nSo for Friday expect a 10% drop is coming, with the help of shorts, and an additional $25 drop, with the help of profit takers, scared longs and people who fear waking up Monday morning with a margin call and or bankruptcy. \n\nIf it does hit -10% Friday, then Monday might be a Rally again, Uptick Rule. Or at least some amount of green, with renewed over-the-weekend confidence and a paycheck. \n\nIf for some reason, unlikely, Friday isn’t a total disaster and it doesn’t Drop 10%, then expect a -10% on Monday, which might be part of the game.\n\nIf you AGREE that it might play out like this, please THUMBS UP. \nAnd if you are someone who has LEVERAGED their account to Hold TSLA LONG, Please THUMBS DOWN so we can get some statistics.", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "Meh, we still have ten years to go, relax.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don’t agree or disagree, I just think all caps posts like these are unnecessary.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I completely agree, can't copy paste as plain text apparently.\n\nI just wanted to share.\n\nCheers", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What's up with all the random all caps?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The question still stands.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Formatting.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "FWIW,\n\n23.5k bid, 9.5k ask.
