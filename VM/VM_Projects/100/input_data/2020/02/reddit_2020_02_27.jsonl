Depend on how much you have to invest. If you have a lot don't go all in. Spread it across different markets             (ex. Durable goods/staples, tech, energy etc.) If you only have a little pick one market first build it up a little then go to another. Don't take my word for what to invest in. Take something you're interested in and find a company that does that and check it out. You will be amazed at what you can find with a little research and plus it will keep you interested. For example in tech I've been on AMD for awhile. Number one when I originally got in it was cheap compared to it's highest competition. I liked that it was an underdog (that's my personality) but it was really the only competition to Intel in the chip market and I didn't think it was going anywhere (people are always looking for cheaper/economical things in whatever markets they are buying in). Luckily for me and a lot of other people they have been more innovative than Intel in the past few years and Intel has had some setbacks. Also be forward thinking and think about what upside a company has going forward. I don't mean like new companies that have potential ( too risky). I mean like established in their field with potential. Don't keep waiting for the bottom to buy or you'll never buy. Like now I know it's a low cause the market is on a downtown but that's easy. Originally I just kept putting money in my account and would buy when I found one I liked until I had several. Then I started putting in and waiting for a low. Usually negative news or downturn in market in general. If you have a solid company usually negative news only stumps it in the short term. If it seems it may hurt long term I may get out and look for another opportunity. Sorry for the long post and not really a sure answer but in short use common sense and find companies or segments of the market that interest you. It seems to keep me more interested.

No.\n\nAs Q3 started to improve things, I still didn’t buy due to not being sure and fearing another dip. After Q4, it rocketed up too fast.

Specifically:\n\n> anyone doubting the tesla mission today and blaming it on a virus who has less confirmed cases in the US (60), than the number of children the flu has killed in the US (104) is not a true believer and should probably reconsider their true intentions.\n\nThat is the portion I would call gatekeeping. I stand by my decision to remove it, specifically because I do not believe it contributes positively to this community. That is my belief, and I encourage you to confer with the other mods. I would note that I have not put a note on your profile, Made any other recommendations to the other mods, or put any other measures in place. I don't consider this important enough to merit a proper warning, nor a ban of any sort.\n\n---\n\nMoving on to my reply:\n\n> I'm honestly sick of gatekeeping. Removed. Nobody decides what a \"true believer\" is here. Got it?\n\nI have seen many, many examples of people gatekeeping in this and other subreddits, and personally find it very distasteful. I don't believe that members of a community, individually, should have the power to decide who belongs in their community. That power is vested in the collective. In reddit's case, moderators are given (in my opinion too much) power to effect change within their communities. In response to this, I have tried historically to be very transparent about what I am doing and why, and be open to reversing my decisions when given an adequate argument. I have, indeed, reversed numerous decisions when people have pointed out errors in my judgment.\n\nMoving on from that rant, and commenting more directly on my comment. I believe it's mostly self-evident:\n\n> I'm honestly sick of gatekeeping.\n\nI am.\n\n> Removed.\n\nI usually specify when things are removed so people don't feel the need to delete their comments. It's just helpful in general.\n\n> Nobody decides what a true believer is here.\n\nReferencing your statement \"anyone doubting the tesla mission today... is not a true believer\". \n\n> Got it?\n\nNormally I'm more polite than this. My apologies if this gave offence.\n\n---\n\nMoving on to your reply:\n\n> can you help me understand what you mean by gate keeping?\n\nEntirely fair, it's not a universally understood term. Clarity is completely reasonable to ask for.\n\n---\n\nAnd next: \n\n> Unless you do/have/are [X thing that I, personally, have decided, you are not a real [thing]. That's the generic example. Things don't have to exactly follow that format, but they're usually close.\n\nI don't think I was sufficiently clear in this explanation, and that's my fault. A better explanation goes like this:\n\n> Gatekeeping is an action taken by members of the community in order to self-define the limits of their community. While normally this is a welcome action, the faults with it are two:\n\n> 1) They don't confer with other members of the community, or otherwise seek outside opinions in order to define this community. This often leads to disagreement about the definition given.\n\n> 2) Their definitions are given for the purpose of exclusivity. While this is to be expected to some degree, it is often used not to define their community to themselves or to those in it, but as a statement to others that they are **not** a part of it.\n\n> Gatekeeping statements as I usually see them follows this kind of format:\n\n> Unless you do/have/are [X qualifier that I, personally, have decided], you are not a real/true/committed [community member]. \n\n> That's only a generic example and the forms can vary, but it captures a large amount of gatekeeping statements.\n\nFrom there, I followed with:\n\n> In this case, anyone who has [doubt about the virus vs. the company] is not a true [believer in Tesla]. Very blatant gatekeeping.\n\nAgain, this is not nearly as clear as I thought it was upon first writing. Again, my apologies.\n\nTo be clear, I was attempting to demonstrate how your initial comment can be made to fit within the generic gatekeeping format that I am accustomed to, and hence why I believe it to be an example thereof. My example was not very clear however, so allow me to correct it as best as I can right now. A very rough paraphrasing of your initial comment could look like this:\n\n> Anyone who has\n\nModifying your wording slightly to match the format, but keeping (I think) within the meaning intended\n\n> Anyone who has [doubt about the Tesla mission today because of the virus' impact on the market], which I believe to be more significant than it should have been\n\nModifying away from the format slightly to better include your reasoning\n\n> Anyone who has [doubt about the Tesla mission today because of the virus' impact on the market], which I believe to be more significant than it should have been, is not a true [believer] and should probably reconsider their true intentions.\n\nThis is an effort to show how your comment can be written as a generic gatekeeping message. I hope this is clearer; I do still think that it acts enough as such (whether intended or not) that it merits removal.\n\nI finished my comment with:\n\n> Very blatant gatekeeping.\n\nWhich, again, is not very polite of me, and which I don't think I should have done.\n\n---\n\nYou then replied with:\n\n>> anyone who has [doubt about the virus vs. the company]\n\n> you seem like a reasonable and logical person, and i’m genuinely confused what you think i’m saying above\n\nI can understand why there would be confusion, my comments weren't very well put. I will admit, I'm also not entirely clear how you interpreted my statements. \n\n> how i feel that when i read your post removal and accusations at me is that you are defending all the shorts out there and people who lost money gambling in options that turned their back on Tesla the company because we saw a little volatility in tsla the stock. \n\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean here. Does this mean you think I'm:\n\na) Defending the people who short/etc the stock, as if I think they're justified?\n\nb) Defending the narratives/posts they make, as if I think they're valuable?\n\n**Upon re-reading this whole write-up, I see where the distinction between \"believer\" and \"investor\" starts to be important. I was thinking already in the scope of investment, whereas the shorts, etc. are much more important from the scope of a believer. Interesting. Please keep that in mind as you read on.**\n\nBecause the first is not exactly true. I don't particularly like them, but neither do I hold any real animosity. I honestly don't much care what people do with their money, and while I've seen evidence that they're otherwise trying to manipulate things, I don't particularly find myself interested in it. It's all above my pay-grade, so to speak.\n\nFor the second one, however, that would be true. I defend their narratives and posts - albeit, specifically within this subreddit - as a source of outside opinion and different information. They also inform a fair bit on how I view the larger market, so I find them valuable. That was the interpretation I made when replying to your comment, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n> i don’t think you mean to defending the hypocrites and that’s why i’m trying to have a conversation to understand your point of view\n\nI'm actually not sure I read the last of this sentence before writing my reply, to be honest. Normally I'd think much harder upon seeing \"and that’s why i’m trying to have a conversation\". I'm not too happy with how this has gone, at this point.\n\n**This portion also makes much more sense with the investor/believer distinction in mind.**\n\n---\n\nSplit into two parts as it goes over the character limit.

My intent was simply to explain what gatekeeping is and why I acted as I did in the few minutes I had between tasks working. In doing so, I do defend a more broadly inclusive concept of the community, but more in the face of an individual trying to restrict it than the community itself wanting to go that way.\n\n> So feel free to dislike the shorts, the weak hands, the gamblers all you want. But don't do it here, or at least in a way that will make them feel excluded. All are welcome, so long as the result is discussion that is good for Tesla investors.\n\nAgain, me reacting to an assumption on your position. From what I'd seen in the previous comments (and assuming I missed the \"trying to have a conversation\" bit) I assumed animosity towards the [shorts, the weak hands, the gamblers].\n\nI'm a bit hesitant on this sentence, as I don't disagree with what I previously said; I don't care what your opinions of other people are, so long as it doesn't exclude them from the conversation. Flufferbot, our VIP BEAR, talks very, very different outside of this subreddit. So long as he doesn't bring that in here, I don't care. But at the same time, the way I phrased it doesn't exactly relate to the comments you've made before, so I don't know that I was really clarifying anything at this point. I don't think it accomplished anything. \n\nI do think that the distinction must be made between Tesla and TSLA. \"All are welcome, so long as the result is discussion that is good for Tesla investors\" is something I'll stand by; regardless of if people don't view Tesla the company positively, it's the effect that things have on TSLA and thereby the investors that I'm focused on.\n\n> Your comment made a statement on what qualified a \"true investor\", and that people who aren't true investors should rethink their position. That's not welcoming, and that's not your call to make.\n\nThis I do agree with. It's back on the gatekeeping topic, and the very reasoning why I don't like the original comment is that it excludes people from this community, it makes them less welcome. That has an impact on the value of discussion for Tesla investors, and as such I don't like it.\n\n> Clear?\n\nAgain, probably too aggressive. \"Does that clear things up?\" would have been better, or better yet \"Does that help? Are there any other questions about this that I can answer?\"\n\n---\n\n>> ”So feel free to dislike the shorts, the weak hands, the gamblers all you want.

I'd like to say that it was brought about via. the community consent that I've mentioned before, but I don't actually know. I think that's mostly been here since before I was a mod (has it been a year now? I'm not sure). I know that the moderation has gotten a fair bit more formalized since then, so it's hard to say. \n\nAt this point, however, I do think that that's a community-accepted guideline. It's one that we've enforced before. That said, it's also not enforced absolutely; we have posts here from the short perspective from time to time. We require them to be well-sources and well-constructed, but we do allow them through. I'll still point out the \"so long as the result is discussion that is good for Tesla investors\". **As well, this is a notable difference in viewing the community via investor/believer lenses.**\n\nThe key difference, in my view, is that nowhere in the rules, or in the mutual agreement of the community, is the phrase \"true believer\". That comes specifically from you, and without the consent of others in this sub, to my knowledge. \n\nIn re-reading that rule, I'm actually of a mind to propose a change to the mod team. The \"posts\" part we still enforce fairly rigidly, but the \"comments\" part much, much less so. Hmmm. Paging /u/HighDagger, /u/TeamHume for opinions.

I'd like to put part of the blame on working from mobile, but it's true that it's also partly me just rushing to write a reply. \n\nI suppose there is a fairly important distinction to be made between the \"believer\" and \"investor\". I'm more inclined to be focused on the \"investor\" side, considering this is an investment-specific forum, but I recognize that it does change the argument. **This is the point in writing that I went back and made the bold comments, just to be clear.**\n\n> i don’t need you to agree with me, but don’t tell me i’m being insensitive of other people’s feelings without attempting to understand where i’m coming from or clarifying what i mean. i will try to be more sensitive of users feelings, and i will continue to voice my opinions of the mindsets that act as dangerous parasites to our community.\n\nI think I understand your mindset a bit better now, especially with that difference in mind. Because of this, I'm going to give you a heads-up: I'm going to be continuing to moderate on the basis of \"investing\". I hope that this essay has made clear exactly where we weren't understanding each other, and please do ask any more questions you might have so we can see properly eye-to-eye. But in terms of:\n\n> i will continue to voice my opinions of the mindsets that act as dangerous parasites to our community\n\nThat's not something I can endorse.

What you are implying makes no sense.\n\nI am actually assuming a multiple much higher than 50 when Y is in full production because of the expansion of the energy side and the expansion of the software side.  That plus the multiple is already significantly higher than 50 now.  The example of 50 was just to show that even if the ER multiple contracts SIGNIFICANTLY we are already at a point in revenue and margin generating profit that justifies the price you mentioned.\n\nYou thinking that the price needs to contract another 70% to get to a fair value just shows you aren't very good at valuing this particular stock, or any growth company at all for that matter.\n\nI mean, FFS, a 70% drop gets us to 203.70.  The current EPS runrate from the last two quarters with 0 growth or contraction implies 8.1/share earnings in a year, or a 25 multiple.\n\nYour last question is just dumb.  Right now we make 8.1 EPS, today.  At this capacity with a 50 multiple which is low by the way, we are already over 400/share before model Y sells a single thing.  \nSo to answer your bad question.  I'm assuming barely more units sold after model Y as are now, and whenever model Y is at any kind of sustained production rate.\n\nAgain, that's at a 50 multiple which is much lower than Tesla will get barring a catastrophic recession.  In which case, you will see me buying in enormous amounts.  At the more realistic multiples in the 75-100 range, prices like 500 are just a pipedream for those who want to by shares cheap.  When tesla network revenue starts arriving at huge margins, that multiple will likely grow again and there will be a very predictable step change in the equity value.

I have no clue what you should do with your positions.\n\nI've seen too fucking much speculation lately on just how bad this COVID-19 shit is.  Some say its the sniffles.  Other say its the start to World War Z.  More specifically I've seen this referenced as the next big \"Black Swan\" event because this sub is a bunch of fucking amateurs (myself included) and they just regurgitate whatever bullshit movie or book they read and used to self-proclaim themselves the next Michael Burry (see what I just did there?

The Big Short, Liars Poker, Flash Boys, Chaos Monkeys, Zero To One, the new /r/WallStreetBets book (which doesn't come in a fucking hardcover and looks like a fucking disgrace in my library).  What I have come to realize is there is no fucking science to stocks.  \\[Yes there is, you claim.  Stonks only go up.  Science duh\\].\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever there is science to a virus works and how a pandemic spreads.  So I've thrown together some half-assed research that you can disregard at your pleasure.  This includes charts that we are all so fond of reading.  Full disclosure, I am not a biologist, doctor, or any expert in the field of virology.  I just did some internet readings and used that data to apply my own logic.  Undoubtedly there are errors in what lies ahead.  Let's begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCOVID-19 Coronavirus is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a incestuous relative of our old friend SARS (we'll get to him shorty).  Depending on what you believe this has been caused by some starving Chinese peasants seasoning their soup with bats or the result of a Chinese bioweapon escaping its lab.  Long story short its the flu that really fucks you up.\n\nThis isn't the first virus we've seen rapidly rise to fame.  We've got a few historical examples we can look to for comparison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) 1918 H1N1 aka Spanish Flu\n\nThe big bad granddaddy of them all, this is the shit doomsdayers point to when they want to really incite some fear.  Firs appearing in January of 1918, this fucker infected almost 500 million and killed anywhere between 40 million to 100 million.  \\~28% of the United States was infected with a 2%-3% case-fatality ratio.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) 1956-1958 H2N2 Influenza A aka Asian Flu\n\nA bad nickname since most of these could be called Asian Flu.  This gets the crown since it was first.  Originating in our dear friend China, this spread to Singapore by February of 1957, Hong Kong by April, and the US by June.  69800 deaths in the US with 1-4 million worldwide (WHO estimates 2 million).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) 1968-1969 H3N2 Influenza A aka Hong Kong Flu\n\nArriving on the scene July 13th, 1968, this hit Vietnam and Singapore by the end of July and was widespread in the US by December of 1968.  Case-fatality ratio of 0.5%, it killed 33800 people in the US alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) 2002-2003 SARS\n\nProbably the last real panic over an Asian virus, this was declared in November 27th of 2002.  There apparently still is no cure.  That said, only 8098 cases with 774 deaths occurred (however that is a fatality rate of 9.6%).  There were only 27 US cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) 2009 H1N1/09 variation aka Swine Flu\n\nWhat looked to be the sequel to SARS but really was just a lame prequel, this had a case-fatality of 0.01%-0.08%.  WHO statistics as of July 2010 attributed 18000 deaths to the virus, but later revisions estimate somewhere around 284,500 deaths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of these have led to COVID-19 and speculation is rampant as to it's impact on the globe.  More specifically for the retards here, it's impact on their portfolios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately we don't have a ton of good data on how any of these affected markets.  For starters, the stock market today is quite different from 20 years ago, and the global economy is much more entangled.  News travels faster, and we have a way of sensationalizing everything.  We can look at the markets during each of the aforementioned virus' (minus the 1918 Spanish Flu.  If this happens there won't be a stock market).\n\nThe most recent two virus', H1N1/09 and SARS, both have unusable market data.  Why?  Because when both virus' struck, we had just popped two of the largest bubbles in history.  H1N1/09 struck in March of 2009, right in the midst of the Great Recession.  The market had already bottomed, the Feds were writing blank checks, and the economy was already in triage.  SARS came to fruition in November of 2002, one month after the NASDAQ hit bottom from the DotCom bubble.  What impact these virus' had on the world market is tainted by the preexisting financial landslides.\n\nIn January of 1957 the S&P 500 was valued around \\~418 (inflation adjusted).  When the virus hit the US in June, the S&P 500 was actual up to \\~434.86.  By December of 1957 the index value was 363.23 points.\n\nI feel however, that the 1968 Hong Kong Flu is our best comparison to COVID-19 and any impact the virus could have on the overall market.  Just look at these numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS&P 500 (inflation adjusted)\n\nJuly 1968           722.49 (virus reaches Singapore and Vietnam)\n\nDecember 1968       754.75 (widespread in the United States)\n\nFebruary 1969       707.12\n\nAugust 1969         665.90\n\nJune 1970           483.52\n\n&#x200B;\n\nH3N2 struck a year before the Recession of 1969-1970, a recession that ended the third longest period of economic expansion in US History.  According to Wikipedia:\n\n\"At the end of the expansion inflation was rising, possibly a result of increased deficit spending during a period of full employment. This relatively mild recession coincided with an attempt to start closing the budget deficits of the Vietnam War (fiscal tightening) and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates (monetary tightening).\\[2\\]  During this relatively mild recession, the Gross Domestic Product of the United States fell 0.6 percent. Though the recession ended in November 1970, the unemployment rate did not peak until the next month. In December 1970, the rate reached its height for the cycle of 6.1 percent.\"\n\nHowever I would once again argue this is a poor example, as the market didn't seem to rock much during the actual outbreak, and some of the surrounding factors of the recession were different than those of today.\n\nSo what does this mean?  In my opinion we are facing a somewhat unknown scenario.  Markets don't like unknowns.  And there is a lot of fear being tossed around regarding this virus.  Markets don't like fear either.  So is this unknown fear worth panicking about?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's look a pair of charts.  Some really unhappy charts.\n\nThis first one graphs all the cases of COVID-19 since its inception on December 31st, 2019, the day China contacted WHO and let them know shit was about to get fucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sd9u8lu40gj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b0923a47fb0c2c19336440d8e86486c1c45341\n\nFor the first month of that chart, you don't really see much.  Then you see one really big fucking line go parabolic in a hurry, and more recently a bunch of little tiny lines that don't seem to be doing anything.  That first line is the number of total COVID-19 cases, dominated by primarily China (>95%).  China has had a runaway explosion of cases that \\*tentatively\\* seems to be slowing down.  Already the panic from this has caused our recent markets to approach/enter correction territory in the matter of a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow lets go zoom in on those tiny lines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09ubl9360gj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7529cf1eaedf0c4a4019c3e19da0515ce5fe9f97\n\nHoly shit, they are fucking going parabolic too.  After a rough incubation period of about a month, we start seeing an explosion of cases in infected countries.  South Korea has especially been taking it through the teeth.  These are fucking exponential jumps.  If these were stocks, they'd be memed to death already.  If you were investing in virus outbreaks in countries, you can bet your fucking ass most of this sub would be buying calls on every fucking one of these nations with new cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo lets see, we have an economy that is nonsensical, in a trade war with a nation who is ground zero for a sweeping health crisis.  We have recession indicators blowing up everywhere, fucking Twitch streamers jumping into stocks, markets getting spooked to death over this virus, global supply chains being interrupted, the Feds pumping the markets desperately, and now this virus has decided to start going apeshit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHO declared this an international health emergency on January 22nd.  WHO has YET to declare this a pandemic.  We overtook the SARS death toll on February 9th, three weeks ago.  People went nuts about SARS.  According to Wikipedia in regards to Swine Flu, \"Critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading \"fear and confusion\" rather than \"immediate information\". The WHO began an investigation to determine whether it had \"frightened people unnecessarily\"'.  So if WHO took flak for overselling Swine Flu in 2009, I would wager they are underselling COVID-19 now.  \n\nDid you watch that speech last night people?  What about any of this is inspiring confidence?  I don't want to imagine what the presser would be if the number of US cases went parabolic.  Hell it might already have done so.  This wouldn't be the first time the current administration has fudged numbers.\n\nIn just the last week:\n\nDenmark, Estonia, Greece, North Macedonia, Georgia, Norway, Pakistan, Romania, Croatia, Austria, Brazil, Switzerland, Algeria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Israel all reported their FIRST cases.\n\nIran and Italy have gone parabolic.  South Korea looks like its gonna hit China numbers from a month ago soon.\n\nWe have outpaced almost every historical example of a major pandemic BESIDES the 1918 Spanish Flu.  Also this virus is matching the %2-%3 case-fatality ratio.\n\nI'm buying puts out the ass across the next two months.  Could this thing fizzle out and blow over in two months?  Yes of course.  Could this entire post be full of shit and age incredibly poorly by next week?  Absolutely.  But this sub isn't about investing its about white collar gambling.  You have to take the odds when they are in your favor.  An overextended market gets hit by an unprecedented external force?  The odds have titled.  It's time to lay down some fat fucking bets while it exists.   Or keep throwing money stupidly at meme stocks and hoping SPCE moves 2 fucking points.\n\nEdit 2: In the mere hours since I posted this gibberish, Kuwait, Switzerland, Iran, the UK, South Korea, Iraq, Finland, and Lebanon have reported more cases and deaths.  Australia says pandemic inevitable, the US has \nits first case of unknown origin who wasn't tested for days, and Saudis Arabia just cancelled the fucking pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.   After a few hours sleep I feel even more confident in this assessment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources: \n\n[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-a-timeline-of-how-the-deadly-outbreak-evolved/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-a-timeline-of-how-the-deadly-outbreak-evolved/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession\\_of\\_1969%E2%80%9370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession_of_1969%E2%80%9370)\n\n[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/study-72000-covid-19-patients-finds-23-death-rate](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/study-72000-covid-19-patients-finds-23-death-rate)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus\\_disease\\_2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/inflation-adjusted-s-p-500](https://www.multpl.com/inflation-adjusted-s-p-500)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe\\_acute\\_respiratory\\_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009\\_flu\\_pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish\\_flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu)\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza\\_A\\_virus\\_subtype\\_H2N2#Asian\\_flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H2N2#Asian_flu)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968\\_flu\\_pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_flu_pandemic)", "id": "faa4zz", "created_utc": 1582799257.0, "score": 1192, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 324, "comments": [{"body": "What you assholes are not realizing, when comparing to the spread of other viruses, is the modern day transportation.

{"title": "Formal discussion of where the market is headed.", "selftext": "*Please keep things civil and let's try to assess how this market is moving for the good of all.*\n\nGoing to be long, don't want to read: **The rebound you saw this morning is the market's way of taking one last deep breath before scuba diving in the Mariana Trench.**\n\nIn the past week, it's fair to say this market has been very bipolar with SPY/Techs adding an average of 3% one day, to losing 3% the next. For a lot of people, I am seeing mixed reactions from a few that profited largely to those that are always on the opposite side of the market.\n\nHere is my assessment of the market and the implication of the coronavirus in the short-medium term:\n\nCOVID-19 from a medical perspective is concerning. It has surpassed the SARS outbreak of 2002 by incidence and in a shorter amount of time. What is a common misconception and commonly referenced in this sub is comparing the coronavirus to the flu. The two are entirely different for one reason: COVID-19 is an **airborne** transmittable condition, whereas the flu is not. Airborne diseases are particularly concerning from a physicians standpoint (credits to a friend of mine in pediatrics/general care) because they travel significantly faster, have a much larger reach, and can infect masses in a short amount of time. COVID-19, though having significantly less death counts compared to the seasonable flu, poses a greater threat to humans at this point because there are currently no viable drugs for treatment and vaccines for preventative care. Moderna and Gilead at the forefront of this treatment are still far from a vaccine which is the most important thing for the outlook of this disease. Moreover, treatments are currently in late-stage development (albeit probably expedited for approval) and has not been tested on large samples of humans. I anticipate a viable treatment potentially in April and May, and a vaccine 3-4 months further down the line. That is if COVID-19 isn't beginning to mutate.\n\nThe implications of this virus is clear in the tech sector. The argument that I hear is that companies do not lose value simply because of delays in production, and once production is back in full force, these companies will appreciate. The issue with this conjecture is that factory delays do in fact depreciate the valuation of a company because it demonstrates 1) an inability for these companies to mitigate from natural disasters, 2) an over-dependence of out-sourced labor in a country that we are having tariff wars with, and 3) the lack of a diversified geography in overseas production. For tech, delays as such as be worrisome for short term value investors (day/swing traders) and call option traders. Take TSLA for example. The stock sat at around $900 5 trading days prior with no immediate signs of a pull back. In light of the 92% reduction of car sales report in China for Jan vs February, the car industry as a whole took a steep drop. TSLA in particular is already back in production, but they are currently seeing 42% loss in registration from December vs January, and I suspect the numbers are going to recede with February.  I am particularly interested in TSLA as it had such a tremendous last quarter, but the difference between the first/second quarter should help investors better understand the current valuation as being over-extended. I would even imagine $500 puts for April as reasonable. Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple are all likely to suffer extended losses with outlook revisions guiding downwards. Both apple and microsoft revising guidance and anticipating misses in revenue is also worthwhile to look into.\n\nMoving into the analysis of the movement. Stocks having daily value ranges that stretch, 8% of it's value. These fluxes can be seen in today's early trading hours when SPY reached $300 and all tickers were deep in red. If you line up 30 of the most popular large/mega cap tickers, you will notice that they are head north at the same time. This is a good indicator of algo trading as opposed to optimism in traders. It would be reasonable to believe that traders are buying the dip if these tickers were driven up in separate pace, but you will find a clear indication that many tickers experienced heavy volumes at the exact same time. I use Starbucks as a good support. For Starbucks, it's very clear where their next earnings are headed with the closing of 90% of their stores in China and this being their second largest market after the U.S. Their reopening of 3000 stores will not likely have a recovering effect with the virus still posing a significant threat all across China. However, this ticker moved from -3.80% lows to nearly positive when everything began to move north simultaneously.\n\nTLDR: Let's talk about your thoughts on the trajectory of the market in the short term. I anticipate further bleed in the weeks to come. SPY will likely visit sub $300 in the coming weeks. Over-extended techs will bleed out. Algo trading rebounded many large/mega caps today, but I suspect a quick selloff  out of the blue.", "id": "fahqdx", "created_utc": 1582832982.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Imagine thinking all of us retards can be civil.", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Stonks go up, stonks go down.\n\nOptions go to zero.", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Stonks also go GUH", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sir, this is a MacDonald.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
