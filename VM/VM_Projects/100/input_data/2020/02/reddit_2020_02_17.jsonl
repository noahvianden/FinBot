{"title": "SPCE - A Thorough Bearish Analysis", "selftext": " \n\nSPCE had a failed mission 5 years ago and blamed the pilot for the crash. \n\nCEO has said for the last 5 years that their SS2 aircrafts were set to launch each year, and of course, they always blamed contractors for not reaching “milestones” to get it all going. \n\nHere’s a summary of why it won’t succeed and further analysis on the speculative market size that bulls argue:\n\nThey have 600 pre-orders. Why go for such a small number if they have the potential to capture a much large speculated market that the bulls are contending? If they are front runners in this race, they have early bird advantage to take in much more and backlog them if they need to. But why 600 with revenues of only 150M?\n\nMarket cap is currently 5B, which is 42x revenue. And what do the bulls say about this? “Stop looking at current revenue, they have a much larger market”. Of who? Multi millionaires and billionaires? “Then they have hypersonic travel for 2 hour travel to London.” Who actually needs to get to London or any other country in 2 hours just to pay a gigantic premium when they can get a private jet and have a personalized/comfortable ride. Last I check, most execs, consultants, etc get to their destination days in advanced anyway.\n\nThen it comes to market cap. I can’t tell if this is a joke, but I hear bull gang compare SPCE market size to Tesla, Spotify, IBM, Microsoft, Uber, Lyft, etc. I’m not going to even have to explain this. The statement in itself has a high enough autistic frequency for even the lowest spectrum of autism to understand how retarded it is. Yes, buying an electric vehicle that will last for years, purchasing a music subscription, buying laptops and software, and getting a daily ride to work is equivalent to going to space for 250k.\n\nNow, when I say 250k, bulls says \"but they will reduce cost when they increase efficiency and have a fleet of 500 planes flying daily.” Firstly, if they reduce cost, it won’t be by significant margins. Why? Because space travel will not be cheap no matter how you put it. Cost of production won’t change unless they can do it with cheap labor in China. Efficiency will be the same unless they hire a herd of engineers working 24/7. R&D will continue to cost more as they try to scale this with large carriers. Ffs, they took years just to get 2 damn planes right. You guys are out here talking about 500 planes. As for scalability. By the time they scale, if they even can, BlueOrigins and SpaceX would have listed and would be flying herds of middle class enthusiasts to space.\n\nNow on to the preorders and future orders. 600 pre-orders are not going to fly this year. They will be backlogged. Why? Because they don’t own airspace. They can barely get their contractors in line with the schedule and you’re expecting them to make 100 flights to the edge of space all in half a year? They expect Branson to be their first passenger on his birthday in July. Do the math. That would be nearly flying every two days from August-December. They have 2 aircrafts right now. Do you really think they are going to expose those two newly made (and still technically under progress) aircrafts under that much fly time? And do you have any idea how risky something like this would be? They aren’t flying planes. Planes can fly all day every day with turbine engines and at low altitudes. We are talking about rocket fuel to the edge of space. And who's the grantee that none of these 100 flights will end in disaster. They blamed the one test flights on pilot error - what makes you think swarms of people would be confident with a company that blamed the crash on the pilot and not a lack of security protocols? Stop with this talk about how they are going to get all these pre-orders done and then add a huge list to the log. My guess, they might fulfill those 600 clients in the next two years. And have a backlog of irked clients that paid such a large deposit to sit around and wait like a saving account that returns -2% per year.\n\nAnd then the talk about hypersonic travel. You guys are talking about it like they have done it. That’s a vision, not a reality. They can’t even commercialize sub-hypersonic travel and they are talking about hypersonic travel at the forefront of this project as if it’s reality. You’re hearing an upbeat CEO trying to raise more capital. The reality is that they haven’t even flown a crew to space yet. They haven't even had a full 6 passengers fly yet.\n\nAs for the newly released sec filing for the warrants. 31M shares. Bull gang is thinking, ah this is regulatory stuff, it won’t get exercised. Literally two funds just filed for 11M on the same day. This is not a coincidence? They are listed for $11.50 per share. Institutions aren’t going to be buying in at market price at this time. Those funds are buying at the warrant price and that’s probably why it happened on the same day. It the share price holds above $18 for 7 more days, these warrants can be exercised.

Because you believe that the stock price is going to go up. Probably a lot. And you want to clear these things from the books as fast as you can.\n\nWhether this dilutes the stock actually depends on how much that dilution has already been priced in to the base stock. In this case, the existence of these warrants is known by all institutional investors and by most retail investors that follow the stock (the stock warrants have been discussed here already).\n\nAs to your other points-- this post is overly long already, but given some of the positions I have seen them hiring on their careers page, I think that their business model is shifting faster than previously anticipated.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I respect your opinion and analysis of the warrants, however, you should also think about why the warrants are being filed not instead of Feb 3rd when they reached the $18 milestone. If they had anticipated this thing to go up, they would have filed for the warrants to be executed because they have a 20 day contingency period. Filing when the stock is already at $30 makes no sense other than them seeing this as an opportunity to increase the outstanding float to milk this fomo.\nAlso, to the point of raising cash. It's pretty clear the company is going to need cash. They have been in R&D and production for 5 years and contractors are not cheap. They have failed to meet milestones year after year. I can't see this as anything other than dilution to raise cash. They took the deposit from the pre-orders and probably reinvested all of it by now. They need capital. At 196M outstanding float, the company does not have a lot of cash at all considering the max IPO price that tutes paid as seed money. You think this company can manage to only burn 1.4-1.5B in 5 years of developing a space tourism company and have an expensive staff of engineers, analysts, managers, etc? No way.\nAlso, many company's tend to have career pages with shill positions. It's not illegal but an open invitation to talent. It doesn't necessarily mean they are hire new staff, just opening the possibility of it. The companies that I've worked with, all of them have product manager, director, VP, and engineer positions open when the company is not actively seeking new staff. \nJust do the simple math and there's no way you can value this company at 5B at this time.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> when exercised by the holder, the company issues new shares...

Stocks going up is the natural order of things and that's the gains in trying to capture, I don't really want to be exposed to the short term ups and downs of the market. \n\nOne way to do this that actually works statistically is by doing multiple purchases over time. If the stock price each day is a completely random distribution with a standard deviation of $100 and a mean of $800 then buying everything on one day you will probably end up paying between $700 - $900 for the stock. If you paid $900 and it dips to $700 you got pretty screwed. On the other hand, if you purchase the stock over 10 (ideally) independent times then you will sometimes buy at $700, some at $900. The math works out that the standard deviation over all 10 trades is, std/sqrt(n) or $100/sqrt(10) so $31. Doing it this way you would likely end up paying between $770 to $830 for the stock, which is way closer to the \"true\" value of $800 and limits your exposure to the short term wildness. \n\nOn the other hand, doing 10 purchases takes time. If the true value is constantly going up, then even if you end up paying $900 all at once that may be cheaper than spreading out purchases.

{"title": "Some basic tools for your toolkit so you stop losing money on expired options", "selftext": "Since it's a holiday and we're all bored anyway I'm going to give you some *very* basic things to think about before you open a position. Who am I? I'm just a random dude with some business and finance education. I have had limited success and failures (over the past two years I've been up 90% and down 60%), but the key is that I *haven't cashed out of the game yet*. So, if you're looking for ways to justify your gambling addiction, read on. If you want to be the one retard who learns something today and not the 9 retards posting stupid shit in the comments, read on.\n\nToday I've picked a nice mix of glaring WSB faults and interesting things:\n\n1. Risk and reward expectations\n2. Stock and Options packages (ETFs and multilegs)\n3. Research aka Due diligence (DD)\n\nLet's dive in friendos!\n\n**Risk and reward expectations** \\- Generally investment managers, financiers, and traders gauge their performance for a quarter or year based on how they did **relative to the market**. So if the S&P 500 only grows 6% in a year, a trader is successful if they made 9% gain that year. If the S%P 500 grows 20% like in 2019, you could literally just park your money in stocks and sell a year later for 20% gain, no skill involved. **Historically, the market has grown 10%** ***a year.*** I mention this in bold because most newcomers here really need to have their risk/reward expectations reframed. Usually the rewards are directly related to the risk that you lose everything. Doubling your money with a yolo call position is *incredibly risky and you are likely to lose all of your money*. This isn't a bear/bull thing (which is fucking stupid anyway. Imagine gambling/investing based on a fucking animal mascot). Pouring your money into shares of an S&P 500 index is much more safe and likely to preserve your money. I think there is a big contingent of big brained smarties on this board who want much more risk and reward than buying shares, but don't want to fuck in the dark on WSB meme options. If you are ok making 5-10% a week instead of 5-10% a year, read on.\n\n**Stock and options packages** \\- Stocks get packaged up by companies and resold to you in two ways: mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are pretty much the same thing - a bundle of stocks that you buy into - except ETFs are... exchange-traded aka sold as shares. Why do companies do this? To hedge against the risk we talked about before!\n\nWe need to digress for a second into different kinds of risk. If you had 0 toleration for risk, if you wanted a virtual guarantee of not losing money, how can you invest? You can buy **US Treasury bonds.** The rate of return on US treasury bonds is literally called *the risk-free rate* in finance and is about 1.6%/year or something right now. Pitiful. In our desire to see bigger returns *we must take on bigger risks.* There is **firm specific risk** related to the operations and financing of a specific firm ($BABA, $MSFT, $ADI). Let's say we didn't want to deal with this risk. We just want to take advantage of their growth of an industry, sector, or the market as a whole, without getting burned by the mistakes of any one individual firm. Then we can *diversify away* *firm-specific risk* and deal only with **market risk** by purchasing shares of every company in an industry, sector, or market. So State Street Global Advisors purchases a weighted average of the S&P 500 and sells that package to you as $SPY. Any one success or failure in the S&P 500 doesn't make SPY move much; it moves the way the market moves in general.\n\nOk, so, there are indexes/ETFs for everything. Whole market, biotech, manufacturing, industrial power, you name it. These are incredibly successful products - $SPY, $TQQQ, $PEY - because they are less risky and move slower than the individual stocks in the funds. What's the deal with options packages? **Options packages hedge risk in exchange for lower returns and are available on Robinhood (but never take the pre-built offered packages)**. Take a second at this point to go to investopedia and get a handle on spreads - you'll see things like Bull/Bear Put/Call credit/debit spread.\n\nWith these risk hedges, **Options spreads on index ETFs are the right risk and return for me**.\n\nLets do an example with a single stock share:\n\nSo let's say you have a belief that $MSFT is going up, but you don't want to *risk* everything on straight calls that could expire worthless in a week. You have some *options* (pun intended). You can reduce your risk by changing the rules - open a *bull put (credit) spread* so that you don't need $MSFT to go up, you just need it to not go down. Or you can lower the cost of your calls (and the reward) by opening a *bull call (debit) spread.* What I love about these is that the only cost/collateral RH requires is that difference between strikes in a spread. For instance, I have a SPY bull put spread right now with strikes at 330 and 329 - RH required $100 in collateral and gave me 12 dollars credit when I opened it (the difference between selling to open the 330 put and buying to open the 329 put), and I think I can close it out this week for a cost of 5 dollars, netting me 7$ on my 100. That doesn't sound flashy except that *7% a week is literally rich people insaneo gains on a relatively safe bet.* If you've read this far, my secret volatility play this week is opening a condor tomorrow on $ADI and closing it after earnings. EPS is estimated to be pretty low, but the firm's operating cycle is absolutely solid, so I think it'll move sideways on the news and we're going to make money on the IV crush. $1 spreads on the low and high ends, with strikes roughly 6% out of the money. Open it for 30 bucks credit tomorrow, close it for 15 bucks debit on Thursday.\n\n**Due Diligence** \\- DD is more art than science, and it's going to look different for stocks than for options, but in either case often the only difference between sweating nervously for a week while you look for a way to not lose so much, and relaxing confidently in your purchase, is 15 minutes of research. **The price of a share is related to the performance of the firm, even in 2020.** If you're trying to do DD on a specific firm as an amatuer, you want to look at 3 things - Quarterly/annual reports of earnings, analyst opinions, and the sector as a whole. Let's take $MSFT for example: Big revenue growth each year for the past decade, analysts say that Azure and Teams are solid products, and the tech sector is growing, so there's room for $MSFT to go up without having to take market share from competitors. That info took me 5 minutes to find, and with it I'm very confident that purchasing shares of $MSFT is a good idea. You can usually go to a company's website to find their financial information in a government tax filing form called a 10-k, but that can be pretty dense. You're looking for a page called the Balance Sheet.\n\nAnyway, hope you had a good read and learned something.

I wonder if we are having some communication difficulty - \"short/long iron condor\" doesn't quite make sense to me. An iron condor has both \"short\" and \"long\" positions in a single condor. For **options**, the word \"short\" is essentially synonymous with \"Sell to open\" and \"long\" is synonymous with \"Buy to open\". \"Open\" means to create or enter into a position, where \"close\" means just that, to exit a position. So in a condor where the underlying stock has a price right now of say $335, you're selling to open a put at a strike of say $331, and buying to open a put at a strike of say $330, to create a *put credit spread.* AND you're selling to open a call at say $339 and buying to open a call at say $340 to create a *call credit spread.* This position is great because you get both spreads for the same collateral. Think about it - you can't have the underlying share price move both *below* the put spread and *above* the call spread.\n\nThe inverse of an iron condor would either be a *straddle*, where you buy a call and a put with the same strike price, or a *strangle* where you create both a *put debit spread*  below the price of a share, and a *call debit spread* above the price of a share.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just found out today (I’m literally like a week into learning about options) the buy to open and sell to open, as well as your other points in paragraph one. \n\nTo clarify short iron condor versus long iron condor, here’s what my research, that I referenced above, showed:\n\n**SPY Short Iron Condor**:     \nThinkorswim (TOS) what it looks like:    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/VBDbaOJ    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/nVmZ5w6\n\nBuy (aka long) Put 329.   \nSell (aka short) Put 330\n\nSell (aka short) Call 343.   \nBuy (aka long) Call 344 \n\n* Max profit made when stock price stays in-between the short put and short call:    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/opGwzsO\n\n* Max loss when stock price is higher than long call or lower than long put \n* Useful when don’t think stock is volatile; think stock will stay within a certain price. \n* Useful for limiting losses (lowering risk) with a non-volatile stock \n\nFurther explanations with examples: \n* https://www.projectoption.com/short-iron-condor/\n* https://www.projectoption.com/iron-condor-options-strategy/\n\n\n**SPY Long Iron Condor**:    \nTOS what it looks like:     \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/4weYIXi    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/P32Lzs4\n\nSell (aka short) Put 329.   \nBuy (aka long) Put 330 \n\nBuy (aka long) Call 343.   \nSell (aka short) Call 344\n\n* Max profit made when stock price moves higher than short call or when price moves lower than short put:    \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/3a7OVDR\n\n* Max loss made when stock price stays in-between long put and long call \n* Useful when high volatility in stock but don’t know which direction \n* Useful for limiting losses (lowering risk) with a volatile stock price \n\nFurther explanations with examples: \n* https://www.projectoption.com/long-iron-condor\n\n——\n\n**these examples do not include risk of assignment, dividend, or commission cost", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "It's not that interesting to even post a position.

The knowns are things like current market price of the underlying, strike, time to expiration, interest rate, and the current market price of that option. So in theory, implied volatility is the part of the equation that reflects the \"true\" volatility of the underlying - however you can't know the \"true\" volatility, so you see what volatility the current market price of the option implies. Hence the name, **implied** volatility.\n\nSo really, when looking at IV, it's a reflection of the market's sentiment on the underlying. Around earnings for example, option sellers will be anticipating more volatility and charge more premium, pushing the implied volatility higher. \n\nBack to the mathematical definition, what the volatility value (that IV implies) means is the standard deviation of the underlying. Read that again because it was a confusing sentence to type, let alone read. I'm not going to explain what a standard deviation means, it's a general statistics concept that you can research. The important thing is that the historic volatility can be calculated from historical prices. You can directly compare this to the IV and say \"oh the market expects the underlying to be more/less volatile than the last [timeframe you calculate historical volatility with]\". If you disagree with that, maybe you're the 200iq bigbrain beating all the algos and have found a mispriced security that you can make money off of. More likely, you're missing something.

Additionally, in the event we redeem the warrants, our board of directors may elect to require all holders of warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis, by surrendering the warrants for a number of shares of our common stock as calculated in accordance with the Warrant Agreement, even if the holder of a warrant would otherwise prefer to exercise the warrant for cash.\n\n[Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000119312520038372/d903370ds1a.htm?fbclid=IwAR0r4KGe5_Hk-8mEcGyRyj69eMzOrL0eCr7rBgktvlc9Vpd8-WP1syu-pvU#toc903370_19)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "How would dilution not affect share price??\n\nYou are not only lowering ownership of current investors but you are lowering EPS.

{"title": "Stop losing money. Sell against yourself.", "selftext": "Alright listen up, I'm tired of seeing idiots throw away their money when they could actually be making money. Am I talking to you? Probably. Do you have 1 ply hands that cant hold a position as soon as it shifts? Do you buy a call 15% OTM for next week and hold until its worthless (like you)? Do you hear about this legendary theta gang, but upon googling it you saw the phrase \"undefined risk\" and pussied out? Are you poor as fuck and see options available for 6 weeks out that look good, but you can't afford them? Good news! I got all you dip shits covered. Take your adderall and strap in...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#The Basics#\n\nMake your position work for you while you have it. You're going to be buying a position you want, and selling against it repeatedly. If you do this right, it literally can't go tits up. This is a very fluid strategy and you can, and should, adjust as the market moves and you reassess your life decisions and whether or not your daddy ever loved you before he went out for cigarettes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Determining the play#\n\nFirst things first, determine your favorite meme stock! This can be done simply by logging into reddit, going to r/wsb, and seeing what ever /u/Progr4mmatic submitted last to see wtf everyone is talking about. Seriously tho, his posts are awesome if you like data. So for this post, we are going to be as basic as becky at sbux and pick $MSFT.\n\nNow, if you're ever bought an option before, you know you need to pick 2 things, expiration and strike. Again, just visit r/wsb and find the thread for your meme stock. There are going to be a ton of idiots in there asking how fucked their position is. It wont take long for you to realize a lot of them are asking about the same strike. In MSFT case, 200 calls are everywhere. So we going hard in 200s.\n\nNow the poor retards are buying FDs and some are less retarded and going 2 weeks out. 10% up in a week with no catalyst? Yeah right. 10% up in 5 weeks? We have a chance. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n200c 1 or 2 weeks out --> bad\n\n200c 5 weeks out --> good\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Opening your postion#\n\nNow that we found an option that has a chance, we look up Mar-20 @200c. It's $160! I'm way too poor for that kind of play! Well you're in luck cause they're on sale in this strategy. Let's go way back to the bad option we located earleir. Feb 28 @200c costs $70, but since we are sure these options suck we are selling them. Now we can buy the March calls and sell the Feb calls for $90! Nice sale.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Holding the postion#\n\nHere is where shit can get confusing. If you're too scared of a fluid strategy and cant change your mind, that's fine. The calendar call you just opened can be your friend. Cant lose more than $90, and if MSFT does get to or above $200 by Feb 28, close the whole thing for a profit. If it doesnt get to $200, let your short leg expire worthless and you still got 3 weeks worth in a 200c that could pay big. \n\nIf you like making money, using a position completely on house money, or not being a gay mod, keep reading. 2 weeks have passed. MSFT went up, but not a lot. Definitely not to 200. Your short leg is about to expire worthless. What do you do? Sell again. Go 1 week out. I like to target getting my money back on this first one. So I look for the option that costs $0.90. Say the 197 strike 1 week out is 90. I could take that one, but I'm opening myself to more risk ($3 risk. Difference in strike). I'll probably go for the $200 again and take my made up $50 and live to fight another day. Now, I'm only $40 in this position. Had you got lucky and MSFT went up big, and the option that cost 90 next week is 202.5, sell that one. You made all your money back, and now you have a bull diaganol spread (go figure that one out yourself). Repeat selling against it at different strikes until you get you investment back. Then either decide if you still want the 200c for march and let it fly uncovered, or keep selling against it to catch your theta gang.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Closing the position#\n\nYou've sold against your position a few times now and you're approaching the final week. As stated above, you can keep selling against it, or you can let it fly. When do you let it fly? When MSFT is damn right on $200 and you want to just own the call now. When do you continue to sell against it? When youre a risk tolerant pussy who fears change. Depending on where MSFT lands at this point, you can sell into a large vert spread or a small one. Collect more premium on a small one, or collect more intrinsic value on a run up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Bring it back around#\n\nDid you feel personally attacked in the opening? Good. Because you should be. You dont understand why this strategy works for you because you actually cant read? Let me help summarize it for you.\n\n**You have 1 ply hands** and fold at the first move: as long as you have a long and short position open, and at or near the same strike, you're deltas are going to be offsetting. (Fucking google it if you dont know the greeks). This makes the spread delta low and makes your position not move much with the underlying. You will still have a positive delta, so you remain a bull. If you're a gay bear, do everything i laid out, but in reverse. I'm sure it's the same. 🌈🐻.\n\n**You buy 15% OTM calls** for next week: well, if you have read my dissertation, you now know those are bad positions, and you can sell them to your former self and actually make money on them.\n\n**Theta gang**: I didn't talk about this much, but it is vital. As long as your strikes are similar. The near dated contract will (almost) always have a higher theta. That's how time decay works. Why do you care? That puts you theta positive and if you didnt google the Greeks last time I told you to, fuck you. \n\n**You're poor**: cheaper entry. Make money and stop being poor.\n\nDont get it? I'm going to stop caring. Lose your money. This is my 1 attempt at teaching and there will not be another one. Also please hold any questions until after you blew up your account trying this because my hindsight is 20/20 and I really dont care about you. Also if you do manage to make this go tits up, please come show us your loss porn.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#TL;DR#\n\n1) find good meme stock and options contract\n\n2) buy that one, and sell a near dated call at the same strike\n\n3) when that short leg expires, do it again\n\n4) when that short leg expires, do it again\n\n5) when that short leg expires, do it again\n\n6) ???\n\n7) profit \n\n&nbsp;\n\nStill feeling sheepish about trying a new strategy and \\*gasp\\* selling options? Contact u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY and tell him youd like to practice this in the paper trading competition. I think there are still slots available if you ask nicely.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am in no way responsible if you some how fuck this up. Mods are gay. And I wrote and formatted this all on mobile.

We've seen the initial pullback and the feeling of uncertainty with investors. Yes, all the investors know that China's numbers aren't reliable, that it's worse than what we're told, and that this is a problem that we will face for the next year, at least. \n\nBut, as it's become contained, it's become easier to fight and protect against the virus in a business setting. The delays and loss of revenue we'll see is really from that those crucial first 3 weeks. Immediate withdraw of production in light of a unsurmountable issue is going to disrupt a lot of moving parts in a business. \n\nWe may see another pull back, but as we reach new ATH's, it's because investors are confident that this issue will resolve in a non permanent way. \n\nYou can expect a huge bull run once there is a definitive positive catalyst regarding corona, such as \"Vaccine found and approved, can be manufactured in less than 24 hours\" (pulling this out of my ass as an example, not that I assume this will happen). \n\nYou can then expect a small pull back if afterwards we see more delays in shipping and manufacturing. \n\nIf you're going to place bets on corona, your safest bet is a US index. China is pumping their numbers in ways that would never be allowed in the US. The US market will react as it has to it, in a more predictable and controlled way. \n\nRemember all those retards that bought FXI puts for when China re-opened? I was one of those retards. Turned right around on those FXI puts and bought SPY calls. Lost again. Lesson learned.\n\nIt's best not to trade in environments that you don't understand. If you're not familiar with how the corona can cost investors money, I'd recommend you stick to broad strokes like buying puts on SPY. What I would never do is buy puts on one of the strongest companies in the world, a company that is literally sitting on so much cash it rivals several banks, and a company that is not on short supply of phones to sell.
