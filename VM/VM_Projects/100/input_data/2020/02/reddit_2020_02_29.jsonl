Record volumes which affect the exchanges processing trades, and record new account holders at some brokerages which affects their systems' processing abilities with their clients. \n\nLayered on top of record volume and accounts are the inherent limitations of existing brokerage platforms. They are legacy systems with new software grafted on.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020.\n\n# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**\n*****\n> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.\n*****\n> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.\n*****\n> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.\n*****\n> “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”\n*****\n> Weekend action?\n> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.\n*****\n> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.\n*****\n> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.\n*****\n> Cutting forecasts\n> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.\n*****\n> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.\n*****\n> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.\n*****\n> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.\n*****\n> “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.\n*****\n> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n*****\n> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xxV96kn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3XfCFrl.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zbhTBQr.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zASmUSl.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wv7Xef1.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qPOD5uN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2z1n5iA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jgqhUBR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4awCCsW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ElXoU2T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xH2GYRk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/HyXxrSJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/GIw7Oq6.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19\n\n> The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.\n\n> “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”\n\n> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.\n\n> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.\n\n*****\n\n# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?\n\n> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.\n\n> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**\n\n> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-Bear-Markets.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off\n\n> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**\n\n> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**\n\n> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Biggest-Change-yield-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)\n\n> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**\n\n> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**\n\n> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**\n\n> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**\n\n> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**\n\n> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RIY-CYTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs\n\n> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.\n\n> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**\n\n> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.\n\n> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Decliners.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$JD** \n> * **$ZM** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$TLRY** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$XRAY** \n> * **$SE** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$FOLD** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$STNE** \n> * **$BLDP** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$ALBO** \n> * **$MAXR** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$ITCI** \n> * **$FNKO** \n> * **$JWN** \n> * **$EPRT** \n> * **$VIPS** \n> * **$GTT** \n> * **$CORE** \n> * **$BNFT** \n> * **$LVGO** \n> * **$EVRG** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$EGRX** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$TGLS** \n> * **$ATRS** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$NWN** \n> * **$WVE** \n> * **$WSC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/x29nduD.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WpXhdqA.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ycdhPpa.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VIBwP3J.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0CU1CX3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BCVHMu2.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6EsJdZf.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3YUYSb9.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M3Hifok.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0W1FLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n# Target Corp. $103.00\n> **Target Corp.

Here's the important part:\n\n> \"In China, the overall CFR was higher in the early stages of the outbreak (17.3% for cases with symptom onset from 1-10 January) and **has reduced over time to 0.7% for patients with symptom onset after 1 February** (Figure 4).

These are JUST my thoughts and extremely very far from established facts lol so apply a huge grain of salt:\n\nIt’s possible that in the beginning local officials were hiding the true number of infected cases, but of course they had to accurately report every death. This made the death rate look artificially high. But when people kept dying China had to step in and take things over from the local officials. Once China itself took over they started reporting accurate data which of course made the death rate look lower in the data.\n\nIt’s also likely that in the beginning the death rate was artificially high because as you say – they didn’t know how to treat it. A lot of people may have been treated with steroids which suppress the immune system and increases death rate.\n\nAlso, the more rapidly the disease spreads the more percentage of people who die from it, for the following reasons:  -hospitals get hopelessly overloaded and simply don’t have beds or doctors or medication to treat the sick. So a lot of people who wouldn’t have otherwise died do, simply because they can’t get appropriate medical care, despite the fact that they are expending all their energy to try to go to the hospital and/or look for someone who can treat them.  -when the virus is so widespread, many people may get infected from multiple sources simultaneously. This means that the virus is able to exponentially multiply much more quickly inside the body, meanwhile the immune system is operating on a set schedule. So getting infected with one single virus particle means the virus has much less of a head start than if you get infected with, say, 10 virus particles at once. Meanwhile, it’s best basically a dedicated three week period that your body needs to develop it’s resistance. Because you started with 10 viruses in your body, your body is getting hit very hard before that three week period.  (This also may explain why such a seemingly high % of medical workers end up dying.  That combined with the fact that they’re not able to rest as they should be.)\n\nThe absolutely amazing and draconian measures China has taken is obviously slowing the virus, which is allowing at this point almost everyone who needs it to get the true medical care that they need. A 0.7% death rate is fantastic compared to 2%! And as time goes on treatments will continue to get better and better, and hopefully yes – they can get that death rate down to 0.1% which would be fantastic. That being said, I have concerns that that won’t happen - mainly because I don’t see any way possible the west will be able to get the R0 down to the same level that China has. They’re going to have to do something similar as China where they shut entire cities down and lock people in their homes and I simply don’t see any way that they will be able to do that. So a lot of people are going to get sick all at once and not have access to medical care. That being said there are a couple treatments that are looking very promising right now, let’s hope that they can be fast tracked into hospitals in the next month or two so that people can come in, get tested, get the drug that they need, and then just simply go back home and wait.\n\nBut in the meantime this virus spreads FAST, so let’s hope that the west can slow it down enough so that a treatment or vaccine can be available before it truly becomes a huge issue. I don’t have much faith in a vaccine being available soon but I do think a treatment could be on the horizon.

It has a case fatality rate somewhere between 1-2% and is extremely contagious, with an R0 somewhere in the range of 2.4-5 (for context, influenza has an R0 of 1.4 odd and kills approximately 0.1% of people annually. The Spanish flu had a case fatality rate of approximately 1.7%). This means that each person that gets infected on average infects 2.4-5 more people. So it spreads extremely quickly (see what's happening in Iran, South Korea and Japan right now as examples). Importantly, 20% of people who get this virus require hospitalisation.\n\nThe data coming out of China is false (they are communist) and Imperial College London has proven as much mathematically. So no, the rate of new people being infected is not decreasing, contrary to what I've seen some people say. \n\nWe are now seeing the first outbreaks globally in most countries. This is a big deal. Imperial College London estimates that the number of people infected worldwide is doubling every 5 days. Most hospitals already operate at close to full capacity, and will struggle to cope with this. I worry what will happen when this hits the USA, where people won't go to the hospital because it's too expensive - Instead choosing to go to work (thereby increasing the infection rate) because they don't have any sick or employment leave and don't want to risk losing their job.\n\nWhat consequences does this have for Tesla?\n1. The odds of a recession are now very high. Supply chains are fucked because China produces so much of the world's goods. Companies will have to cut back staff to survive during this period, and it will create a multiplier effect that results in less overall consumption and higher unemployment in the global economy.\n2. People do not buy expensive luxury cars during a recession. Why? Because they may lose their jobs, and will cut back spending accordingly to survive. Even if they don't lose their job, they will feel poorer because their pension/superannuation will now be worth less, and any stocks they own will be worth less. People who feel poorer don't go out and spend $35,000 on a new car.\n3. Tesla is a growth based momentum stock. It is highly likely that it will not grow as fast, if at all, in a recession. It is more volatile than the market on average, so can be expected to decline more as a result. \n4. Tesla was already fundamentally overvalued and has experienced a parabolic run up. The run down will be just as severe (see 2).\n\nIF scientists manage to develop a vaccine, the absolute quickest it will take to come to market is 18 months. This is what the experts have said.

First you need to make sure you infect every country before any of them close their borders. Then you need to mutate and increase the infectivity to make sure you get most everyone. Then you need to mutate and increase the lethality so that it kills enough people before they can get too far with a cure, but not too lethal so that you don't kill off everyone before they infect everyone else.\n\nUnfortunately plague inc has a significant flaw in that people can recover from viruses and then they are immune (if it doesn't mutate). And the mutations in plague inc are way too fast and unrealistic in how it's applied.\n\nAnyways it looks like things are really accelerating with coronavirus in Italy/Iran/S.Korea. It might already be incubating in most countries. The CDC already said it's going to be a pandemic and it is just a matter of how bad. I didn't believe them but the acceleration in the 3 countries is definitely troubling. The incubation period is too long to catch it. \n\nIf everyone gets infected (impossible case) then 100M people die which is insane. If every country contains it at the same level as China, then we have maybe 20M people get it resulting in 400,000 deaths. That's probably more realistic but I would expect many countries to be an order of magnitude better than China, bringing total deaths closer to 40,000. These aren't world changing numbers.\n\nHopefully it's not that bad but this will definitely cause a significant short term delay in the world economy due to border closures, and shutting down marketplaces, which will continue to affect Tesla stock. \n\nThe question is whether this inevitable continued drop in the market will in itself induce larger long term issues and ultimately a crash. Hopefully most institutions are smart enough to not let this happen, but even if it does the market historically comes back in time.\n\nI won't be selling, and with my margin account I can survive down to about a $350 stock price.

They come by periodically to check if the tape was broken and if you broke confinement they take you to a containment center.\n\n-One person is allowed to leave each home every two days to gather supplies.

Worst case if I lost it all, it was for my basement, no big deal.\n\nI watched probably 30 hours of video around options, read nearly every discussion on here, and observed the discord for a while. I started trading around the Ally / AMD spam, was up 2k on my way to work and down 1700 by the time i got there. Lesson learned.\n\nI reached out to some of you for advice in the discord, was called a retard (thanks, I know it's a term of endearment) , and was given some really great advice and guidance. I asked probably 100 stupid questions, but was always given some really strong answers (and sarcastic abuse)\n\nEnd of today I sold my last group of SPY puts (right before the stupid 2.5% upswing) . I ended up around +2000 total . Far from the likes of a lot of you, but 2000 more that will immensely help back home.\n\nI just wanted to take a minute to say thank you to everyone here, even the psychopaths that sometimes blow my mind.\n\nNot sure if I'll dive back in next week - I think Im just going to take the money and run and do what I can to continue helping out - but again, thank you, retards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of your replies, private messages, well wishes, and \"awards\" .

Every recession is different, and many people make the mistake of fighting the last war, instead of looking at the specifics. \n\nOne of things that will likely make the next recession different is more decoupling of the stock market and the economy. Although there is always going to be some feedback between the two, the stock market is WAY OVERVALUED due to all the money the fed dumped in. A correction is going to make the stocks hurt much more than the economy at large this time. A big reason is because all that money being pumped in didn't actually reach half the people in the country. This is why inflation hasn't gone up. This also means pumping more money in won't do squat for the economy.\n\n  \nWe will also likely see more cracks in in equality separating the have and have nots regions. The parts of the country doing bad will get hit worse, as their fragile local economies crumble more. Some parts of the country doing best might even bottom out with still slightly positive (but much smaller) growth.   \n\n\nThe one part I disagree with OPs list is inflation.
