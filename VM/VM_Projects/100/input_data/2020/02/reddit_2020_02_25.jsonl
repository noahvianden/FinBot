{"title": "Quick analysis on the $SPCE bubble", "selftext": "So everyone here probably knows that Virgin Galactic has their earnings coming out today, and I believe that their stock will take a huge hit from the news.\n\nFirst thing first, Virgin Galactic has almost no future with competition squeezing them from both sides. While Blue Origin is slowly making progress with their rocket, starting in 2021 SpaceX will be offering week-long space flights to paying passengers.\n\nThat is a huge problem for VG, why would anyone pay for a 5 minute trip that doesn't even take you to orbit when they could spend almost a week in space, and get a limited edition model x with that too.\n\nNext, there is the risk. VG currently only has one spacecraft, which is their second one total. Their first spacecraft was lost due to pilot error, killing one of the pilots and seriously injuring the other. Of anything happens to that one spacecraft VG will be out of business for a while and will lose customers to safer companies.\n\nFinally I come to the profitability. When passengers pay 250k per flight, using the maximum capacity of the spaceship their yearly revenue will only be 700 million, but that's only if the other costs didn't exist. VG has to pay money for fuel, maintenance, airport access, training, pilots, insurance, rnd, and many more operational costs. This leads me to believe that VG will never become a profitable company. There is too much competition closing in, and the small launch market is already cornered by Rocket Lab.\n\nVG has no special technology that no other company can replicate, their spaceship is basically just a plane with a rocket motor attached, and their lack of innovation will probably be the end of them.\n\nIn conclusion I believe that unless they have a change in plans VG can never become a profitable company, and that their market will be stolen by the likes of SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n\n\n\nHey guys,\nThanks for reading! I'd love to hear your opinion about VG, and if it will be able to hold its current $7 billion valuation or if it will come crashing back to earth.\n\n\nUpdates:\nEstimated revenue is 0.75 million\nEstimated loss of -0.21 c per share\n(Their valuation is 7 billion)\nFixed autocorrect spelling", "id": "f9e7gu", "created_utc": 1582653493.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "You’re right, but does that mean it will go down tomorrow?

The reason why COVID-19 got out of hand is because:\n\n1. China is the manufacturing capital of pretty much the planet for a variety of things that play into development *and* production of *other* products and technologies.\n\n\n2. Chinese labor is cheap, compared to other nations.\n\n\n3. Chinese factories are practically small cities into themselves.\n\n\n4. Chinese labor laws are garbage. This means that people work insane hours, in very large groups, and as a consequence their body health is bad. This makes it easier for the virus to infect and propagate.\n\n\n5. By being small cities, with people crammed together both with in-house and out of factory housing, the probability of virus jumping from beyond factory scope is very high.\n\n\n6. China is an authoritarian state.\n\n\n7. To make matters *insanely worse,* Chinese culture has a *huge* notion of 'face'. It's similar in concept to tribal honor we see in middle eastern areas and other parts of the world where you have similar doctrines. As such, anything that leads to a loss of face is stamped out quickly rather than the problem be addressed. The doctor who first reported it and ultimately died by it, got cracked down hard and suppressed for trying to bring to attention that COVID-19 was **SERIOUS AS FUCK.**\n\n\n8. As a result, quarantine did not go into effect fast enough, and 5 million people left Wuhan before the Chinese military came in and locked down the city.\n\n\n9. One after the other, the dominoes fell, and now half of China is basically in lockdown.\n\n\n10. China on top of that continues to misrepresent the number of infected and dead.\n\n\n11. Anyone who dissents and tries to bring the truth out disappears.\n\n\n12. Western corporate entities have as a result of majority of factors above, tooled their entire supply chains in China. It's the perfect state to have cheap labor, and where the state will basically disappear anyone that complains or tries to expose the dirty truth of how completely fucked up the value of human life is there.\n\n\n13. And now like a Rube Goldberg machine, the rest of the world is starting to see more and more and more cases of the virus.\n\n\n14. The CDC hasn't called it a pandemic yet, but the situation is at Defcon 2 with that.\n\n\n15. It's a literal people problem from top to bottom.\n\n\n16. Automation of the entire chain as much as possible removes majority of the people. Robots don't get sick. Yes, you need people to maintain those robots. But it's *easier* to quarantine a few ten thousand people and prevent them from infecting the entire planet vs a country of over a billion people.\n\n\n17. I could go on, but there's only so many ways to say that this is predominantly the fault of China and the planet putting all it's eggs into one basket and then shitting the bed out of horror as the basket falls and 90% of all the eggs smash and splatter.

{"title": "$SPCE 4th Quarter Earnings Call - Discussion and Updates Thread", "selftext": "WILL BE PROVIDING EDITS/UPDATES ON WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE CALL HERE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5:00pm -** Introductions and some legal forward-looking statements bullshit. CEO, George Whitesides takes over and states the following: 600 current reservations, $80m in deposits representing $120m in potential revenue. 7957 people interested in purchasing flights (doubling since last update in 2019). More than $1b in investment behind the company. 2021 is expected year for ramp up and cash flow. Currently no debt on the balance sheet.\n\n**5:10pm -** CEO George Whitesides going over company milestones (attempting to get investors wet). Boeing has invested $20m in the company and will become an important future partner. Now discussing Under Armor space suit partnership. Some talk about the merger with something something Sofia(?) that allowed them to go public in 2019.\n\n**5:15pm -** Whitesides still going on and on and hasn't told me if moon or no moon yet. Talking about new build milestones for the second \"space\"ship. Achieved weight on wheels with the new spaceship 9 months faster than the first spaceship. COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ON THE LAST STAGE OF LEGAL LICENSE BULLSHIT TO FLY CONSUMERS TO SPACE.\n\n**5:20pm -** BIG DICK BRANSON WILL BE FLYING TO SPACE CONFIRMED. POSSIBLE STRADDLE PLAY IF HE DIES/SURVIVES? Whitesides now discussing Flight Test program (more time is needed apparently to do consumer launches). \"While we would like to have some initial commercial revenue this year, our main focus is to prepare our spaceships for long-term commercial space flights.\"\n\n**5:25pm -** Commercial space flight is expected to reach a market value of $1.5T by 2040 (according to Whitesides). NEW INITIATIVE CALLED \"One Small Step Initiative\", Whitesides says he will speak on this later in the call. Expected to expand the fleet of spaceships to 5 ships by the end of 2023. Research payload trips are being investigated in addition to commercial spaceflights, 8 payloads have currently been conducted (working with COVID-19 riddled Italy on this). Potential spaceports are being considered worldwide, currently in talks with Italy and the UAE (remember, UAE has invested big dick money already in SPCE).\n\n**5:30pm -** Now talking about \"The Spaceship Company\". The vertically integrated manufacturing company within Virgin Galactic building and testing the spaceships. Starting to get juicy... Talking about other applications of the launch technology they own: Defense capabilities, research purposes, etc.\n\n**5:35pm -** Transitioned 70 VG employees to new base in Mojave, bringing total employees in Mojave in 140. Achieved 50% completion of the third spaceships structure in 2019.\n\n**Call being handed over to CFO who said some financial bullshit none of us will understand.**\n\n**5:45pm -** Whitesides takes over again and goes over the \"One Small Step\" initiative. This is basically a complicated way of saying \"WE'RE RE-OPENING SALES TOMORROW LADS\". Basically, for a refundable deposit of $1000, tomorrow you can save yourself a ticket on the spaceship. HOWEVER, they will be raising (full) ticket prices as the year progresses.\n\n**5:50pm -** Q&A time! Someone asked what CEO Whitesides what he thought of the current share price, Whitesides deflects deflects deflects and says it doesn't matter and the company will continue to focus on the fundamentals and engineering. Another question about being on schedule for a first commercial flight this summer... Whitesides deflects and says the first priority is safety, not speed.\n\n**6:00pm -** CALL CONCLUDED.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - 600 current reservations, $80m in deposits representing $120m in potential revenue. 7957 people interested in purchasing flights (doubling since last update in 2019), $1b in investments behind the company, commercial space flight is expected to reach a market value of $1.5T by 2040, balance sheet is healthy at a little over $500m in assets, no debt, and finally ticket sales are re-opening tomorrow for a low refundable deposit of $1000.", "id": "f9i9ns", "created_utc": 1582668666.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 192, "comments": [{"body": "I just got a notification that it missed its esrnings by 95% lol", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "Same that’s why I’m here I only listen to the professional autists", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "Only 3 analysts made estimates tho", "score": 27, "replies": []}, {"body": "it could have been 96%. that would be discouraging.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Imagine that, a company with no revenue misses earnings.
