I've lowered the EV/EBIT multiple for the AMaaS-excluded sheet to 15x, this is far below current total market and automotive averages (24x for both) last time I checked. the P/S multiple is also lower that what I expect it could be, with the AMaaS-excluded sheet having a 2030 P/S ratio of 4 only slightly higher than the current market's ratio of 3.8. The AMaaS-included sheet I think is actually valued quite conservatively, its 2030 EV/EBIT of 27 compares to MSFT's 25 currently, last time I checked. I think that Tesla would be valued much richer than Microsoft in 10 years time if it continues the level of growth predicted.\n\nthinking about it now, you're right on the AMaaS profit share.

I guess that is the problem of trying to follow Elon's thinking when he thinks on a planetary scale.\n\nI guess that's the big thing around gross margin and AMaaS rev share, it's how much competition there is. So from that Ark article\n\n>Wright‚Äôs Law suggests that it would be able to manufacture the Model A today for \\~$1,500. The original Model A had 8 horsepower (hp) and a top speed of 28 mph. While Ford no longer sells an 8 hp car, the Tata Nano and Mahindra‚Äôs rickshaw ‚Äì both at 8-37 hp and a weight similar to that of the Model A ‚Äì cost \\~$2,100. If auto buyers still were willing to pay $23,000 for an 8 hp car in the US today, then Ford‚Äôs gross margins would approach 90%+.\n\nSo yeah I agree totally with the Wright's law analysis (I think Ark should probably rename themselves Wright's Investments ha ha) and I guess those efficiency gains are shared between price cuts due to competition and improving margins. So a monopoly would be able to keep all those gains for themselves but if there is competition with other manufacturers they have to keep reducing prices to get sales, which is why Ford's ICE cars don't have 90% margin today.\n\nI guess with the Tesla Network it's really hard to work out how much of a cut they can take. I think that's a big unknown. Your points are interesting.\n\nRe the energy division I think one thing with it is it doesn't need to grow organically. For example if they just sold battery packs they would need to wait for income to grow the company so they could get new money for capex to expand. However as they also have the vehicle division and a large cash pile I don't see particularly why Elon couldn't expand it by 4-5x over a couple of years just by building new lines / factories.

The weakness started in Q4 and is likely to continue this quarter due to the impact of Covid19 in Asia. \n\n[There is nothing pretty about this picture](https://preview.redd.it/msovbzlcffi41.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c4cc9abbb630cd12ce2faec172adda5da6381ad)\n\n**Reason #3**: The Bank of Japan has been the global leader of stimulative monetary policy because of Japan's long history of anemic growth and deflation. They were the first major central bank to reach 0% interest rates, and also the first to do quantitative easing. However, it's clearly not helping the economy right now, so what is Japan to do? The only answer is to increase fiscal spending by issuing more debt, and let the central bank buy the additional debt! There are several names for this - modern monetary theory, monetizing government debt, quantitative easing etc...but they all mean one thing - debasing the Japanese yen. No wonder institutional money is getting out the fuck out of their local currency like rats trying to escape a sinking ship! \n\n**You say: \"Ok, I'm convinced that usd/jpy is going up, but so is a lot of other shit that I'm trading at. So what?\"**\n\n**Wait, there's more!**\n\nImplied volatility is near historical rock bottom lows. When I put this trade on a few days ago, 1 mth vol was even lower at 5. It's perking up but nowhere close to where it could be heading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jf75308aifi41.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=003aa0691e2176cfda84e7647ec64c2fb8c24cd4\n\nNot only that, but options skew still favors puts over calls, which means the market is still more worried about usd/jpy going down than up! Silly options traders...\n\n[Difference between 1mth 25 delta puts and 25 delta calls. You can see that back in 2012 when Japan embarked on its big quantitative easing campaign, this was \\>0](https://preview.redd.it/b2iq206sifi41.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ace5fce8b916fb016b63e7cbf9a7a8e7e98903)\n\nBecause the market is so off sides on this trade and hasn't completely gotten its head around the idea of JPY losing its safe haven status, there is potential for an explosive move both in usdjpy upside AND usdjpy implied vol. How explosive? Think 114.00 in 2-4 weeks, 118 within 3 months (were are at 111.55 today). This trade is best expressed by buying usdjpy calls with strikes 114-118 and expiries 1-3 months out. \n\n**How do I put this trade on?**\n\nIf you have a futures trading account like Interactive Brokers, you can trade JPY futures listed options. The code in IB is JPY, then select Futures Options. Unfortunately the contract trades at an inverse price to how FX is conventionally quoted, so the current price of 111.55 = 0.008964. Pain in the ass, but that's what a calculator is for. Since the Mar contract is close to expiry, your underlying would be the Jun contract, which closed at 0.009014 on Friday. Each tick of 0.000001 is worth $12.5 per contract, and the value of 1 contract is 12.5m JPY worth, or 112k USD. The equivalent of usd/jpy calls are actually JPY contract puts on IB. \n\nI put these trades on three days ago, so they are already in the money as price and implied vol have moved quickly in my favor, but there is a LOT more room for this trade to go. I ended up going with 0.008900 JPY puts expiring Apr 3 and 0.008750 JPY puts expiring May 8. \n\n[What it looks like in IB](https://preview.redd.it/4nfr7z3knfi41.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=167201f63f1baa529b35aa6ddd6d7257a81640a3)\n\n[Another account where I have $80m USD of a 111.50 Mar 19 call and $150m USD of a 114.00 Apr 17 call. These are OTC options and not listed futures options, therefore quoted in conventional terms.](https://preview.redd.it/lxs8vcmdpfi41.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb365d8e2aab6da6c023529cc8504b49fdab2a62)\n\n\"**Oh, what's that position that's up $614k?\"** \n\nI bought gold calls (GC in IB) two Thursdays ago when it was at 1577 and it's at 1645 today, so that option has gone up 4.5x. Gold has been going up batshit crazy for the past 6 months because the market sees the writing on the wall - that central banks will react to weak growth and inflation by pursuing stimulative and reflationary policies that will debase fiat currency in favor of hard currencies like gold. Gold is a great addition to your portfolio as it is the one of the few safe havens left in the global macro world right now. Having a long gold position allows me to size up my usd/jpy position by a factor of 2-3x because when usdjpy sells off like it did Friday, gold goes up a lot. I'll leave discussion on gold for another post in the future.", "id": "f7pwvq", "created_utc": 1582360277.0, "score": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "God I wish I understood this", "score": 144, "replies": [{"body": "I'm just a simple retard who only yolos with no market research.

Famed fake meat purveyor and beloved meme stonk of 2019, $BYND, experienced massive moves from May through July over two ERs then proceeded to cuck everyone after announcing a secondary. \n\nThis no moat nothingburger ran up to $14 billion market cap on the $1T worldwide meat TAM and a hail marry partnership from $MCD. If this $TSN assassin can pump 14B market cap then truly anything is possible. Buffet like moat. No one got a moat bigger than $SPCE. (Yes, I‚Äôm all in SpaceX and Blue Origin whenever they list - but they probably gonna IPO via Wall Street and those bastards will suck up all the tendies.)\n\nEven if you don‚Äôt believe in the $SPCE story recognize that $SPCE is the meme stonk of 2020. It doesn‚Äôt even matter if you buy the story. By the time Sir BDB is done pumping his first flight we all gonna be eating space ship Cheerios. The noise has not even begun. Branson is the undisputed master showman of his generation. He‚Äôs neck deep in aviation and knows exactly how to print money in that industry, not to mention virtually everyone he‚Äôs been in. \n\nChamath, who is sitting on a cool $1B in $SPCE tendoids, is about to roll up to a 1 hr free HSN advertisement on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk day after earnings. If you think this king maker gonna volunteer to take fire for an hr on live tv while his stonk crashes 20% you‚Äôre already in space cause you ain‚Äôt living on this planet. He knows the news is gonna be stellar. That‚Äôs why he agreed to show up. He‚Äôs gonna pump his bottom line another cool billion. I expect an announcement on first flight timeline and opening up reservations including a price hike auction system for first movers. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/chamath/status/1230182805541466113?s=21\n\nInstitutional investors. Take a look at the millions of shares folks like Vanguard are buying up. These people have teams of PhD number monkeys figuring out whether or not they should get into something and put those somethings in their portfolios. Your (and my) baby DD ain‚Äôt even in the same airspace. Just follow their money. \n\nWhy 50? Market cap. For those of you who can‚Äôt math you take the shares outstanding and multiply by price per share. If you‚Äôre like me you think of companies in terms of market cap. If you stick your finger in your mouth and hold it up in the air that feeling you‚Äôre feeling is all the negative interest rate free central bank money sloshing around the world looking for a home. Hence 10B market cap for Virgin Galactic easier than your sister on prom night. Ergo 50 per share. \n\nMedia blitz. Just getting warmed up:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/B83pn1-F4El/?igshid=wahwj4qsgjg7\n\nAnd finally, $BA needs a win. They already in for $20m which is basically toilet paper money for these aviation monopolists. These guys are chomping at the bit to own commercial space. Expect an announcement where $BA is contracted to builds a fleet of next gen $SPCE ships. \n\nDisclaimer: I‚Äôm in for about 5m+ in 2021 and 2022 leaps so my money is where my mouth is.

His price target assumes Virgin Galactic's space-tourism business will produce nearly $1 billion in revenue by 2030 from nearly none this year, which could be extremely optimistic in itself.\n\n>In an earlier report, Jonas also noted the risk of fatal accidents, regulatory issues, and \"insufficient economics.\" Under those scenarios, the shares could trade down to a $1 stock price.\n\n>The analyst also attributes more than half his valuation target to the company's opportunity in hypersonic [above five times the speed of sound] air travel. He estimates the hypersonic market will generate $800 billion in annual sales by 2040 and Virgin Galactic may be able to capture a 10% share.\n\n>These pie-in-the-sky forecasts for markets that do not currently exist may be overreaching, given that Virgin Galactic has been trying for over a decade to get space tourism off the ground. It will also have to compete against larger, well-capitalized aerospace players if hypersonic travel does take off.\n\n>Investors need to assess Virgin Galactic's risks, given rising competitive threats, high expectations for a space tourism, and a spotty record for meeting deadlines.
