{"title": "The GOAT Hedge Fund: Renaissance Technologies", "selftext": "Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.\n\nFounded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average annual gross return of 66.1% since 1988.\n\nWith an average annual net return of 39.1% after fees.\n\nThe Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.\n\nSince, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.\n\nNow, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).\n\nMedallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.\n\nNotice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.\n\nIn 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%\n\n**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.\n\nThat certainly beats inflation...\n\nSo, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?\n\n**PART 1: The Early Stages**\n\nEarly on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.\n\nRemember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,‚Äù Simons said. ‚ÄúA pure system without humans interfering.‚Äù\n\nSimons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information\n\nStraus‚Äô was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.\n\nHe became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.\n\nOver time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.\n\nIn fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!\n\nAt the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.\n\nThe return in 2008 is a prime example of that.\n\nCommodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.\n\nThe fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.\n\n**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**\n\nNow in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the \"best math department in the world\".\n\nTherefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.\n\nWe are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.\n\nRenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.\n\nThe strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).\n\nSimons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.\n\nIn 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.\n\nThis test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.\n\nIt had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.\n\nMagerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.\n\nFinally, the simulator‚Äôs algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.\n\nThe resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman‚Äôs calculations.\n\nOnly then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....\n\n**PART 3: Infrastructure**\n\nNow I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.\n\nBig data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.\n\nThe problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:\n\nBuilding a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.\n\nTo then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.\n\nRenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.\n\nThey have completely automated the process of signal discovery:\n\nThey don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.\n\nRenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.\n\nThe data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.\n\nThe mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**\n\n**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**", "id": "f1o73u", "created_utc": 1581328649.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Rentech is around the block from me, but you would never know it unless you were looking for them.

I look at the big numbers first - total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered. I then look at the graph at the bottom right. Is the orange line (Mainland China cases) plateauing? Is the green line (recovered cases) trending up? Is the yellow line (international cases) staying flat? Yes, yes and yes. All good news.\n\nNumber of deaths in Shanghai where G3 is? Still only one so far and an increasing number of recovered patients in Shanghai. This is one is really important. If there's a sudden spike in cases in Shanghai, that will be an issue. If you zoom into the map, Shanghai has 299 confirmed cases so far which is the lowest or one of the lowest in the entire region of all major centers. Hubei, the epicenter, is about 1000 km from Shanghai and is heavily quarantined so transmission shouldn't be a concern at this point. Out of the two closest cities, Zhejiang has more cases at around 1000 and is 300-400 km from Shanghai but from my understanding is also quarantined so transmission to Shanghai is not likely at this point. I expect there will be a few more deaths unfortunately in Shanghai as time goes on but also a slowed increased rate of confirmed cases and a trend upwards with recovered cases which are all reassuring.\n\nAs long as these numbers are fairly accurate it's looking good so far as long as there is no further focus of infectivity somewhere in China or elsewhere. There's a good chance cases are under reported due to milder cases and/or poor or lagging recording/testing/diagnostic methods but overall things should be ok based on what I have been seeing. It's also hard to mistrust international data as we can be more sure of the numbers the US, Canada, etc. are reporting and those numbers have all been reassuring so far.

The margins after building out a fairly conservative model, seem to be it would add at the very least 700 billion dollar market cap to the company, if you believe the assumptions below:\n\n* Traditionally, past software problems that were solved like map navigation spread to other companies fairly rapidly. Algorithms like Dijkstra could be proven and implemented by anyone once understood. Neural nets that solve problems will not be like this. If an engineer from Tesla goes to Uber and implements the same neural net, it's effectively useless without Tesla's proprietary data. The point here is, Tesla, if first to market in this area, will gain a very considerable majority market share >50% globally.\n* Using Uber's financial numbers, an expense of 75% of revenue goes to drivers. Assuming Tesla halves Uber's prices, it quickly becomes not very economical, especially for those living in cities, to own a car. This means the Tesla network will grow very rapidly as its economic value is immediate. A conservative assumption is 50b in global revenue after the first couple years. There's now at least a 25% margin, which is 12.5b in profit. As a comparison, Microsoft made 40b in profit in 2019. Assuming a revenue growth rate of 50%, that would value this section of the company at least at 600 billion dollars, but likely a lot more given such a dominant position and pricing power the company would have.\n\nThere's more to this, but just wanted to share.

That however is AC, whereas the car is DC; not sure if same principle applies.  Also, transmission losses must be much more of a concern when you are moving electricity 100s of km vs 10s of feet.  That being said, perhaps it is more efficient to keep the system at the highest voltage possible until it reaches the components using that electricity, at which point you would transform the voltage down.\n\nAnother advantage, I think you can run thinner, and thus lighter weight, wires when at higher voltage.  This is assuming that current is the main determining factor for how thick a wire you need to use (I could be mistaken).   Specifically, for any given power P, it is a product of current I and voltage V:\n\nP = V x I\n\nThus, if I double my voltage, I can half my current, all without losing power.  The caveat is that if the charger and/or motors are designed for a different voltage, say 400V, then I have to use a transformer to up/down scale my voltage at the source/destination.  This transformation itself suffers losses, and the transformer unit has a non negligible weight.   \n And of course, every extra unit adds cost and complexity.  So perhaps factoring in the weight, losses, and complexity of transformers is how 400V was determined to be a sweet spot for Tesla.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, transmission losses apply to AC and DC equally.  Resistance is resistance. You are right that the total resistance is much higher for houses because the wires are longer.

Their costs have not really changed significantly, they aren't really delivering more cars but each share has appreciated by almost 300% in just over six months. Cost of raising capital is insanely cheap compared to not that long ago.   \nOne of the things I love about Elon Musk is that he shits all over the sunk cost fallacy and has the ability to make big decisions rapidly as soon as it becomes clear which option is more advantageous.   \nAn example of this was in late 2018 when SpaceX changed the primary material for their Starship rocket from carbon fibre to stainless steel. They had spent many years and millions of dollars developing a carbon fibre rocket and pivoted on a dime the second it became clear stainless was the superior choice. With time this seems to be showing itself to be a brilliant move.

Thanks. If you don‚Äôt want to it‚Äôs cool. Have a great night.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Alright, so the point of this sub usually is speculation, right? Big returns for a small investment is the Grail. But options as an instrument can be used for a few things, and one of those things is to capitalize on movement without using the capital for the underlying asset. \n\nYou should really look up some explanations of the Greeks (https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/ is one) but what we're looking at today is Delta. What the Delta value tells you is how much your option price will change when the asset price increases by $1.00. For calls this value ranges from 0 to 100, for puts -100 to 0. \n\nThe further in the money an option is, the closer to parity (Delta 100, 1:1 increase) with the underlying it is. So, if you want to get x100 leverage without buying 100 of the asset, what you do is buy deep ITM calls and pay a fraction for the leverage. Little risk of losing your premium because it's very unlikely to expire out of the money.\n\nBut wait! Why buy short-dated calls if you just have to be in the money? Well, I'm glad you asked. That's where the other Greeks have a hand in it. Theta, time decay, does two things: the biggest piece is that it eats away your premium's *extrinsic value* (uncertain value, value that can't really be calculated) every day. You could say it's an uncertainty tax. The longer dated your option, the more time you have for movement, so you're punished less for holding. As you approach expiration, theta increases and your premium gets chunked into oblivion. But the other function of theta is to bring Delta into line as less of a curve and more of a binary cliff, 0 for OTM and 100 for ITM. Where two months out a $50 call for a stock trading at $51 might have a Delta of .68, a day or two before expiry it might have a Delta of .98 or .99. This is related to Theta because with two months left, a change of $1.00 makes less difference than the same change with a day left. \n\nSo! Putting it all together, why to buy a short dated in-the-money call? Maybe you want to speculate on an event upcoming like a court ruling or earnings call, or some other event that can't be predicted but you're *very sure* of the outcome. You want maximum exposure to movement, the highest Delta possible, but you don't want to lose money to Theta while you wait. So you pick up the option when as much extrinsic value has been eaten away as possible and you're trading on *intrinsic,* or measurable value. These are not meant to be held. \n\nHope this helps some! Delta and Theta are most of what you have to worry about, but Vega is important too, just not so much for this situation. Seriously, take half an hour and give a couple articles a look to make sure you understand what the Greeks have to do with your plays, if you do that you're already doing better than half of the traders out there. Somebody is left holding every option at expiry, and if you know why then it's less likely to be you. \n\nBesides that article I already linked, check out this one: https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You are awesome.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Up 84% on 7/17 $200C.

At 4pm, the market closed and your order was never filled. You might still want the order to be filled whenever it can the next day (in which case you'd want \"Good Till Cancelled\"), but maybe not - maybe by the time your order is able to fill the next day, the whole reason you wanted to buy would no longer be valid (say, MSFT is back down to 185, but now that it peaked and came back down, you're nervous).

LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor) is announcing earnings tomorrow and is worth your consideration as a YOLO for two reasons:  \n\n\n1.) Jim Anderson, the CEO  \nThis fucker used to be my boss (corporate overlord, I never met him). Our company was sold to AVGO back when they were trading at $65/share and Mr. Anderson made out like a bandit on the increase in value in his shares. Then in May of 2015 he went to become a VP for A-M-Fucking-D. In case you were too young to remember what AMD's stock price was back then I'll remind you. It was $2.30. Motherfuckin' Jim stayed on until August of 2018 and then peace'd the fuck out to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor. You know what AMD's stock price was in August of 2018? Twenty-Five-Fucking Dollars. Homeboy literally worked for three goddamn years and 10x'd on AMD.  \n\n\nSo August of 2018 he goes to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor when their stock price is around $7.50 and sneaky Jimbo goes and delivers a terrible earnings, tanks the price all the way down to $5 bucks so he can accumulate shares like the sly multi-millionaire fucker he is. Then the stock proceeds to fucking skyrocket up to a peak of $24 over the next 12 months.  \n\n\nSo that's reason number 1. Follow the money. Follow Jimbo.  \n\n\n2.) TeCHNiCAlS  \nLSCC closed at $19 flat today, which is in the middle of it's $17.50 to $21.50 range over the last 5 months. However it peaked at $24.2 just 3 weeks ago.
