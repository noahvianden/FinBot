Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.\n\nShort-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.\n\nOn Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company’s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday’s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla’s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.\n\n\nhttps://thecoinrise.com/tesla-stock-hits-780-raising-more-than-80-since-the-start-of-the-year/", "id": "eyohyk", "created_utc": 1580814475.0, "score": 821, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 393, "comments": [{"body": "Looks like this post is already outdated.
