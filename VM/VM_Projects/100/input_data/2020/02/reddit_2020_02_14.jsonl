Tesla will pay to the bank 2 to 5% of the 2-2,3 billions resulting of the offerings\n2. the banks managed yesterday to drive down the price down to $720 with a control action and made money.\n3. they bought back at the opening bell, just needing to signal that big $$$ is there buying and drove back the price $ 100 up without big efforts. Lot of day-traders joined when they saw the action\n4. they easily allocate the share with a few contacts. Suscriptors are happy to get a $40 to 50 discount per share + upwards potential.\n5. meanwhile the banks did money on the option side for today expiration, as they already have decided on the strike price last week.\n\nin one week, when the operation is cleared and completed, the banks might support the price above $800 for a while, then hand over to Tesla to provide the news flow. So the share price go either way, but the job is done and Tesla has got cash to strengthen the balance sheet.  \n\nEventually short selling to be authorized again, I guess it's set out during  the offerings.\n\nOn my side i just did profit to accumulate on step 3 for the time-being.

I expect Heather Bellini, analyst at Goldman Sachs, to raise PT for Microsoft very soon. Here's [her take on FastMoney yesterday](https://youtu.be/YxhlZ0EQANU?t=72) stating she's not only bullish short-term, but long-term as well.

A resistance point is basically a ceiling the stock hits and bounces off of, because there are more than enough sellers to cover all buyers at that price, but not enough buyers interested in going above that price (yet), so the stock reaches that point but then comes back down. A support point is the opposite - the stock drops to a point where buyers are so attracted, the stock has trouble falling beneath that point, and eventually comes back up.\n\nThey can also flip - if the momentum of a stock sends it beyond a previous resistance points, it can become a new support point, which is what happened here with Microsoft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey're entirely descriptive events, you don't know they exist for sure until they happen, but after they happen, you can use them to predict things like where a stock might fall if it dips, among other things.

I started building my position Dec 02 through like mid Jan. Ie. when $SPCE was between 7 and 12 ish. As you can see, all leaps. As I‚Äôve said in other posts my DD is that this stock sees 50 this year, 100 next caveat no crashes, no dead people. It entirely has to do with market cap. Had this stock gone through tradition ipo investment banker, underwriter route these gains would have been realized by those people. The stock would have ipo‚Äôd north of 20. \n\nThis play was not an overnight thing. I‚Äôve been following the markets for more than 20yrs. Was watching CNBC the morning of 9/11. RIP Mark Haines, CNBC. I had a humble childhood and we didn‚Äôt have a lot of money. Never had big capital to put on the line. About 5 years ago I switched jobs and was able to roll over about 250k in 401k retirement funds. That allowed me to directly manage the capital and invest in whatever I wanted. Passive investment is a scam for the sheeple. Yes it works, but you‚Äôre on the escalator in the slow lane. I only trade options. Stocks do not adequately  fulfill my personal risk tolerance. I got up to about 3m+ from bets on BYND (up and down), TSLA (missed the recent move), DIS (in before nov earning and sub announcement but held too long and gave a ton back. Eat shit mouse). X (at one point had over 1m delta). FB, NFLX, AAPL, ROKU, MSFT, BA and a whole bunch of other moves too many to recount. \n\nI‚Äôm posting this for all you poors out there who are struggling. Keep fighting. Keep learning. Go deep on your own DD. I did it. You can do it. It might happen quick like Tesla. It might not. But the key is to realize that when a Tesla or VG come along, be ready and positioned with a plan to make it happen. \n\nGd bless.

I might have to sell some Tuesday to buy short term puts while maintaining the rest of my long. Will evaluate on Tuesday. Seen this pattern many times. Beyond in June 2019 and most recently Tesla.
