Tesla will pay to the bank 2 to 5% of the 2-2,3 billions resulting of the offerings\n2. the banks managed yesterday to drive down the price down to $720 with a control action and made money.\n3. they bought back at the opening bell, just needing to signal that big $$$ is there buying and drove back the price $ 100 up without big efforts. Lot of day-traders joined when they saw the action\n4. they easily allocate the share with a few contacts. Suscriptors are happy to get a $40 to 50 discount per share + upwards potential.\n5. meanwhile the banks did money on the option side for today expiration, as they already have decided on the strike price last week.\n\nin one week, when the operation is cleared and completed, the banks might support the price above $800 for a while, then hand over to Tesla to provide the news flow. So the share price go either way, but the job is done and Tesla has got cash to strengthen the balance sheet.  \n\nEventually short selling to be authorized again, I guess it's set out during  the offerings.\n\nOn my side i just did profit to accumulate on step 3 for the time-being. Saw sell pressure  around 815 to 820 yesterday and day-traders selling the top then. Will see if I wire more cash to my brokerage account next week in order to buy on a built support.

Keep your eyes out for these black swan opportunities. \n\nHuge moat - 10 yr dev, IP, billions in r&d\nNew industry - commercial space\nNew market - space tourism, hypersonic travel. \nNew tech - reusable shuttles\nHuge backers - Virgin, Branson\nSmart money - Chamath\n\nI’m up 3m on the position, 750k+ today, as of a few min ago on an initial buy in of 480k. I started building my position Dec 02 through like mid Jan. Ie. when $SPCE was between 7 and 12 ish. As you can see, all leaps. As I’ve said in other posts my DD is that this stock sees 50 this year, 100 next caveat no crashes, no dead people. It entirely has to do with market cap. Had this stock gone through tradition ipo investment banker, underwriter route these gains would have been realized by those people. The stock would have ipo’d north of 20. \n\nThis play was not an overnight thing. I’ve been following the markets for more than 20yrs. Was watching CNBC the morning of 9/11. RIP Mark Haines, CNBC. I had a humble childhood and we didn’t have a lot of money. Never had big capital to put on the line. About 5 years ago I switched jobs and was able to roll over about 250k in 401k retirement funds. That allowed me to directly manage the capital and invest in whatever I wanted. Passive investment is a scam for the sheeple. Yes it works, but you’re on the escalator in the slow lane. I only trade options. Stocks do not adequately  fulfill my personal risk tolerance. I got up to about 3m+ from bets on BYND (up and down), TSLA (missed the recent move), DIS (in before nov earning and sub announcement but held too long and gave a ton back. Eat shit mouse). X (at one point had over 1m delta). FB, NFLX, AAPL, ROKU, MSFT, BA and a whole bunch of other moves too many to recount. \n\nI’m posting this for all you poors out there who are struggling. Keep fighting. Keep learning. Go deep on your own DD. I did it. You can do it. It might happen quick like Tesla. It might not. But the key is to realize that when a Tesla or VG come along, be ready and positioned with a plan to make it happen. \n\nGd bless. Feeling grateful and thankful. 🙏🏼\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LSTUCOM\n\nps. For those of you who think this is paper. It’s not. I already spoke with one of the mods.\n\nUPDATE: \nEnded the day up 961k. Here’s the dd. A 20% move is squeeze territory. This will squeeze further Tuesday and drop Wednesday. (Monday closed.) I might have to sell some Tuesday to buy short term puts while maintaining the rest of my long. Will evaluate on Tuesday. Seen this pattern many times. Beyond in June 2019 and most recently Tesla. Squeeze is usually a two day run followed by giving it back. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AsFwbRV", "id": "f3vq4a", "created_utc": 1581702253.0, "score": 402, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "I'd tip my hat to you if that was Robinhood and I knew what I was looking at.", "score": 195, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Not right now holding MSFT calls.

That 25 was the key line. Should see 40 by Tues or Wed. The chart is playing out like all those before it at similar price point levels. The fact it closed at day highs means the gap up on Tues is going to be a monster. These things hit 40 then tumble back to 30 before a move to 50. (ACIA, GPRO, JMIA, ROKU to name a few that crossed the 25) Your 50 target probably hits before end of Feb. Knowing when to take profits will be your hardest decision. Every point move is $200K.
