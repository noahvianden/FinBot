I had previously bought a GLD call last week to hedge against any kind of drop in the markets but after Monday, I realized that this virus scare is gonna be more intense and longer than I had previously thought. So I went in on more GLD calls when the markets recovered on Tuesday which served me pretty fucking well the rest of the week. I’m not a bear, just an opportunist, and I have a feeling that we’re in for a 10% correction from ATH just simply because of the amazing run up the markets had for the last several months. But to all the bears screaming about how this is the start of the recession, calm your tits. This kind of thing isn’t new, and it’s an amazing buying opportunity. I’m moreso in this for the short run so I can capitalize off people’s fears but for those playing the long game, you’re getting prices that we were at over a month ago. Look at the market impact of all previous viruses like SARS, MERS, and Swine flu. They’re just small blip in the total history of the market. Just fucking buy the dip and set your expirations a couple months out if you’re so worried.
