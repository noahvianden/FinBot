{"title": "The liquidity trap: how QE and low rates might be inadvertently causing deflation", "selftext": "“Don’t fight the Fed.” That mantra is repeated as fact amongst almost every market participant across the globe (other than Davey Day Trader, who doesn’t know what a central bank is). Based off of that logic, one could reasonably assume that the Fed and Jerome Powell are the reasons for this recent market rally. All of WSB is bullish, and you can’t go more than four posts on WSB without seeing some exhausted money printer meme or a pro-Powell love fest. After a week of reading economic research papers nonstop, I think I have stumbled into something that the market and the Fed won’t see until it is too late to stop.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not an expert and this post should not be construed as anything other than my opinions and theories. This will be an extremely long and conceptual post (with a lot of references to research papers) that focuses more on economics than any financial analysis. It is not hard to understand, but be prepared to read.\n\n**Fed Reaction to Coronavirus**\n\nThe Fed’s reaction to coronavirus was extremely quick. After seeing what worked to stop the financial crisis in 2008, the Fed used the same playbook. Lower rates to near zero, buy treasuries (quantitative easing), buy mortgage backed securities, cut the reserve ratio to 0%. That playbook didn’t work though, the market kept selling off though. The Fed then did something unprecedented, they started buying corporate bond ETFs. They only bought high grade corporate bonds at first, but quickly realized that they had to buy junk bonds in order to keep the corporate bond market stabilized. Recently, the Fed [quietly announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-mainstreet/fed-eases-terms-of-main-street-loans-tells-banks-to-start-disbursing-idUSKBN23F2N8) a ramp up of their Main Street lending program, along with guaranteeing 95% of the loans instead of a range of 85-95%. This implies, to me, that banks don’t want to give out loans unless the Fed backstops them more. That will become important later in this post.\n\nThe Fed has also been buying commercial mortgage backed securities. These CMBSs are facing [extremely high levels of delinquency](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/cmbs-delinquencies-climb-in-may-with-hotels-and-retail-faring-worst-58714661). According to that article, 7.6% of all CMBS loans are delinquent as of May, along with 19.3% of hotel loans and 10% of retail loans. A [whistleblower report](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds) indicates that the loans in these securities did not go through much scrutiny and could be massively overpriced as well. These assets are so toxic that the Fed [won’t even take that many of them](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations). In fact, the Fed has quietly [reduced their asset purchases](https://i.imgur.com/zlMFwbr.jpg) since the last week of March. This is just background information so I can explain what the Fed has been doing to the market so people can stop attributing the rally to Jerome Powell.\n\n**Reasons For the Rally**\n\nNow that I have explained what the Fed has been doing, I want to explain the reasons for this rally. This rally is driven by retail. How? Delta hedging. Some of you know about delta hedging, but for those who don’t I will explain a quick summary. A retail investors buys a call from a market maker. That market maker, being more risk averse than we are accustomed to, doesn’t like to sell naked options so the market maker will buy enough shares to become delta neutral. That means that as the call they sold goes up in price, they have shares that will cover most or all of their losses. Options are highly leveraged instruments, which is important because it gives retail the leverage that they need to get market makers to pump the market for them.\n\nThe important thing is that the analysts and value investors that are crediting the Fed for this rally don’t understand the options market as well as degenerates like us do. Retail has been [piling in](https://i.imgur.com/xuzFRSw.jpg) to the stock market at an astounding rate, especially into everyone’s favorite [broker](https://i.imgur.com/mNve5Mu.jpg). This data is as of the beginning of May and I suspect it’s a hell of a lot higher. \n\nBloomberg published some more up to date data recently regarding small option traders buying calls. Take a look at [the graph](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixvGtK3QI_Aw/v0/1400x-1.png) for yourself, it has gone parabolic. The [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/speculative-fervor-in-u-s-stocks-surges-to-stunning-levels) states, “Traders established fresh bullish positions last week by buying 35.6 million new call options on equities, according to Sundial founder Jason Goepfert. That’s up from a peak of 28.7 million in February, when speculative activity was rampant, he wrote in a note Monday.” The volume from small options traders is estimated to be 50% in that same article, the highest since 2000. Google Trends for [“how to trade options”](https://i.imgur.com/6nf8LTw.png) and [“robinhood trade options”](https://i.imgur.com/4NJwVfh.png) have gone parabolic recently as well. The put/call ratio across all equities is also at [historic lows](https://c.stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=%24CPCE&p=D&b=5&g=1&i=p77530317141), indicating a mass wave of euphoria and a lack of hedges. \n\nAfter seeing all of this, it is clear to me that this is a retail driven bubble and not driven by the Fed after April. Where is retail getting the money for this? The answer lies in the [savings rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT). According to the Fed, the savings rate “is calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI. Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.” As you can see in the graph, the savings rate is now significantly higher than it has ever been before, coming in at 33%. This means that consumers are not spending money, they are saving or investing it. Consumers are also paying down [credit card debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSL) at much higher rates than anticipated. In the month of April, consumer credit had the [largest decrease since tracking began in 1968](https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/06/april-consumer-credit-indicates-recovery-challenges/). Remember the data in this paragraph, I’m going to refer to it later in regards to deflation.\n\n**Effects of Quantitative Easing**\n\nBefore talking more about the bubble, I am going to outline some data that shows the impact of QE on our economy since 2008 up until now.\n\nThe main effect of low interest rates along with quantitative easing is an increase in the money supply. You can see that increase [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2). Typically throughout history, an expansion in the money supply has lead to an increase in the inflation rate. That [has not happened](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA), the Fed has struggled to hit the target inflation rate since the crisis. With such an increase in the money supply, hyperinflation is stopped by the velocity at which the money moves. In 2006, Ben Bernanke noticed this phenomenon, [stating](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fed.3490493.html), “the empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable.” A recent [research paper](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v182y2019icp23-25.html) has also found a significant positive correlation between wealth inequality and monetary growth.\n\nVelocity of money is defined by the Fed as: “the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.” This velocity has been trending downward in a big way since 2008 (and before), not just in the US but everywhere. Velocity of the M2 money supply in the US broke through the previous low (tracking started in 1960) by 2012. Velocity is now [significantly lower](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). M2 velocity includes bank reserves though, so let’s take a look at the [velocity of M1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V) (which is physical currency and checking account deposits). [Demand deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNS) (checking account balances) have been exploding since 2008, with another massive jump starting in March. This means that cash is not being used and not adding to consumer prices or any economic productivity. I believe all of this to be an effect of QE and a prolonged period of low rates.\n\n**Liquidity Trap**\n\nThere has been a safe asset shortage since the advent of QE, as central banks of developed economies accumulate safe government bonds and US treasuries. This has lead to a shortage of safe assets, driving prices up and yields down artificially. Ricardo Caballero, an MIT economist, said [this](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.31.3.29) (warning: PDF) in 2017: “The ongoing pressures driving the imbalance in safe asset markets has in recent decades helped to drive the steady decline in interest rates on safe assets. However, interest rates on these assets cannot fall much further. When the equilibrium full-employment interest rate needs to be negative, but cannot adjust sufficiently downward, then (other things equal) the equilibrating mechanism is an endogenous decline in safe asset demand through a reduction in aggregate income and wealth. That is, equilibrium is achieved through recession.” At the end of 2019, the Fed owned [36% of all US treasuries](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/funding-covid-19-debt-splurge-risks-the-independence-of-major-central-banks-58610836), with that number only set to increase after their open market operations this year. of April 21st, central banks around the world have bought [5 times](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/central-banks-buy-trillion-financial-assets-g7-march-federal-reserve-2020-4-1029113160) the value of treasuries as they did in 2008.\n\nThis shortage of safe assets has pushed yields down and made it so that banks have no desire to make loans to decrease their reserves. Take a look at the [excess reserves](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS) banks have been holding. Since the 2008 crisis, excess reserves have exploded. This means that the bank is sitting on cash that they are doing nothing with. The common belief is that lending goes up as rates go down, since banks have to make more loans in order to sustain the same amount of profit. However, the data does not show that to be the case since the introduction of QE. The key thing that I have noticed in regards to excess returns and loans is that banks do not want to make loans at these low yields, possibly due to the massive unpriced systemic risk of our debt bubble popping. In Q1 2020, banks tightened their loan standards at a rate [comparable to 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-are-tightening-lending-standards-like-it-was-2008-again-51588881348).\n\nA liquidity trap is created when low interest rates are low and consumers and institutions decide to save money instead of investing in low yielding bonds. The Fed started paying banks a [small risk free interest rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER) in 2008, which moves along with the Fed funds rate. I theorize that the shortage of safe assets and low interest rates has gone past the “reversal rate” and accommodative monetary policy has become contractionary. In these uncertain times, banks would rather collect the small guaranteed risk free interest rate instead of introducing their balance sheets to any more risk, especially underpriced risk. The Fed believes that they are stimulating lending by cutting rates to 0. However, banks appear to not want to make non-guaranteed loans and instead are content to sit on their excess reserves. This means that the expansion of the monetary supply is not working as intended and that the money sitting in bank reserves is becoming contractionary. If loans aren’t being made and that money isn’t being spent, then that money may as well not exist in the money supply at all. According to a [Princeton economist](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/25b_reversalrate.pdf) (PDF), quantitative easing raises this reversal interest rate and should only be done after rate cuts are exhausted. This means that the Fed could be unknowingly contracting the money supply, even though it appears that they are massively expanding it on paper.\n\n**Deflation**\n\nDeflation occurs when institutions and individuals don’t spend their money in the real economy, whether by purchasing goods/services or making loans to businesses. The Fed’s [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF), which is the possibility that personal consumption expenditures price index change will go below 0 in the next 12 months, spiked from .001 in January to .763 in May. The [probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPM) that we have inflation over 2.5% over the next 12 months has crashed down to .002 as of last month. As shown in the data above, consumers aren’t spending and banks are stockpiling their reserves. This is deflationary and will lead to lower prices, lower corporate earnings, and lower asset prices.\n\nAs mentioned in the data further up in the post, consumer credit dropped at a much quicker rate than expected, even with projections taking coronavirus into account. Economists expected consumer credit to fall by [$14 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-consumer-credit-plummets-in-april-as-credit-card-use-tumbles-by-record-amount-2020-06-05) in April, but it fell by $68.8 billion instead. This was the largest one month drop in consumer borrowing since 1943. The core consumer price index (CPI) also [missed expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/us-consumer-price-index-may-2020.html) of a 0-0.1% jump, instead falling by 0.1% for last month. This came after April was the largest drop (-0.4%) on record since data started in 1957.\n\nAccording to [research from the Netherlands central bank](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecosys/v42y2018i1p45-63.html) (PDF), QE encourages risk taking by market participants and creates asset pricing bubbles. We are seeing bubbles across all asset classes thanks to the levels of debt in the economy (the stock market being an example). We even see debt bubbles too, like the $9 trillion of [corporate debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/theres-a-9-trillion-corporate-debt-bomb-bubbling-in-the-us-economy.html) (as of 2018) which help fuel these asset bubbles. The research from the Netherlands central bank also shows that asset bubbles popping are worth -4% inflation. An asset price bubble does not signal inflation either. I have picked out some quotes from the researcher that show QE might be leading to deflation:\n\n>Overall, the results suggest that the signaling value of asset prices for inflation is weak and unstable, implying that while QE is effective in boosting asset prices – one of the main transmission channels of QE − higher asset prices may not always lead to higher inflation. High asset prices may even precede a low inflation regime. For policymakers this is useful information because, based on the outcome of our models, one cannot presume that QE by definition leads to higher inflation.\n\n>If […] a surge in asset prices is not supported by real economic developments and therefore becomes unsustainable at some stage, the subsequent asset price collapse may cause a recession. \n>While central banks intend to raise inflation by purchasing government bonds to reduce bond yields, our results indicate that this policy can have the opposite effect on inflation.\n\n**Conclusion: The Fake V-Shaped Recovery**\n\nI conclude after doing this research, that there is no chance of a V-shaped recovery in the economy, despite what the market is signaling. I believe that we are about to enter into a massive deflation cycle that is being assisted inadvertently by the Fed’s policy of QE and the near 0% interest rates. Consumer credit is contracting and banks are stashing extra reserves, meaning that the real money supply is contracting. Default risk on commercial mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds (thanks to lower earnings), and other forms of debt will continue to rise as the economic effects of coronavirus and monetary policy undertaken by the Fed continue to be revealed. Defaults will rise even more if we get prolonged and sustained deflation as the weight of our debt crushes our financial system. I believe that, due to the historically high levels of retail activity in the market, it will crash soon as well. The wealth inequality effect of QE (which Powell denies the existence of) will make it increasingly harder for the economy to recover.\n\nAll of these things will feed off of each other as we get further into a deflationary cycle. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Fed to get out of this crisis when we get into it. Deflation is rare historically and makes monetary policy ineffective, it is a central bank’s worst nightmare. Deflation will dry up economic activity and cause us to go into a depression which will be difficult to get out of.\n\n**tl;dr**: Powell thinks he is injecting money into the economy but it really isn’t going anywhere, the stock market is in a bubble that will pop very soon, corporate bond and CMBS default rates will increase over the coming year, deflation will make debt a heavier burden and cash more valuable, the Fed is powerless to stop it. Our economy enters a deflationary cycle that will be hard to get out of, until the bank reserves find their way into the real economy.\n\nI’ve spent a very long time researching this stuff but I am not an expert in economics or monetary policy, just another idiot on WSB.

I think what the above is getting at is that people need a certain % or safe income for a rainy day funds. What the write up above almost touches on, but doesn’t quite get into, is the banks lending practices to consumers vs institutions. As a disclosure that I probably shouldn’t make, I do have a career in the industry (I need to disclose to cover myself that this is all my opinion & observations and not based on non public information). Consumer debt has been getting riskier in the form of student loans and car loans, etc. While rates have been low, the inflationary cost of these “assets” has led to near oppressive levels of debt. My theory for a while has been that low interest rates have hurt part of the money supply, as referenced above, due to the need for people to have a certain % or ratio of free cash to obligations owed. As such, when rates are low a phenomena can occur where more funds are held in savings accounts and depository accounts in order to earn the same guaranteed interest as they would have when rates were higher though with less money (i.e. if rates were 5% you could earn $5 with $100; if rates are 1% you need $500 to do so, a $400 decrease in money supply).\n\nNow to the bank side. Part of what has hurt banks is non financial lenders. With the access to capital and seemingly rising economy over the past ~3-4 yrs, a lot of NFI’s and small banks even have been lending like crazy to undercut banks with essentially minimum ROI’s due to regulatory measures. (They’ve been acting like some of the RH investors here tbh lol). In a growing economy, this is easy money, but you lose hard in a recession as they are now. This has led banks to hoard cash, in conjunction with an oppressive panic over the next recession (gotta think about people’s careers. Most decision makers right now watched everything evaporate early in their careers with 08, they have a natural risk aversion). This too has led to a decrease in money supply. Banks won’t lend that while their assets (FYI, loans are the banks’ assets) keep degrading.\n\nIt is an interesting theory. Most of the money from the fed is ending up in the banks coffers and they don’t want to lend unless they are covered because the assets are toxic. These recent loans from Congress make no money for the admin costs but water down bank’s ratios.", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t know if there is necessarily anything to look at or whether I’m even qualified to say. I think you covered the theory very well above, but until time passes, we can’t really know whether it was fact or theory. \n\nThe only thing I’d add that’s only tangentially relevant to the theory is that there is truth towards people trying to park relatively “free” money of theirs in the market. I think one big thing people are overlooking rn while trying to meme and prove themselves right is the, for lack of a better term, capital structure of the markets right now (by markets I mean Dow, S&P, Russell, Nasdaq, etc). Also, in case people don’t know, the Russell index actually follows the true state of the economy much better and that has been showing more volatility than the others - part of it is because it contains the most companies. Anyways, the Dow and s&p prior to today and somewhat still are way overweighted with tech. That’s why it’s so dumb when everyone is talking about the s&p only moving 5% or like 8% on the week when you’ve got pretty much everything but tech & grocers down 30%+ on the week. I sold out today the moment I saw tech slip because I knew it’d enter a free fall. \n\nWhat I’m getting at is that there is something there that requires more due diligence. People are treating these like safe havens and pumping them up without actually trying to dump. I’m not sure what it indicates for the markets as a whole though. Not sure if it’s a good sign that there is still parked cash somewhere in the markets or a sign that the bottom truly is falling out for most industries and tech is just a Hail Mary play for now. Also, whatever the unemployment effect is, we won’t see for a while. Not sure if the markets will care as shockingly I do actually think most companies have adjusted and are profitable from scaling back. They’re just not doing the volume profits. Obviously doesn’t apply to every industry.\n\nLastly, and I’m kind of rambling, but people really really need to grasp that institutional funds are the ones moving the markets. If they want the troll RH investors out for messing up the metrics they need for millions of retirees, they’ll do it. Similarly they can pull out the rug quick too if they see something coming.

If you're willing to hold long term then this is pretty much as close to guaranteed as you can get.\n\nYou can also do something similar by writing cash backed puts like 2-4 weeks out at a lower strike that you're cool with buying spy at, then do the above if it gets exercised. If it gets exercised or expires worthless despite the market continuing to drop, then that would be more profitable than the above, but if the market bounces before your expiry and actually starts a recovery, then it would have a smaller profit overall.\n\nAgain, the insane volatility makes options go crazy expensive, which is great for responsible option writing on solid long term things like SPY if you know what you're doing.

I'm not sure what the problem is by selling ATM (slightly OTM) puts that expire within <2 weeks, to capture the exponential theta decay as the option becomes worthless\n\nThis depends on what your goal is. If you want assignment to go long, then yes, buy a weekly ATM put and collect a fat premium.\n\nMost people selling puts are selling OTM and don't want assignment.

The risk, particularly gamma risk is what you're missing here.\n\n>Also, often times a put sold a month out will have less premium than double the put premiums sold 2 weeks out.

Most aren't held longer than a couple weeks. I sold a monthly on SPCE a week ago on a Thursday which I closed at my targeted profit the following Monday. Had that been a weekly I would have made less.\n\nIn most cases the monthlies you sell can be closed after a couple weeks, so you can sell 2 contracts in a month.

Because I can make twice the trades and make the same amount of money by closing early, and avoid the risk of holding open positions. This increases your probability of success even further. It also generates more trades which evens out your odds. If you flip a coin you have a 50/50 chance. If you flip it 5 times, you may get tails 4 times. If you flip that coin 1000 times, you'll get 50/50 results. \n\nThe same applies to trading. If you have 30 delta positions so 70% odds of success, sell monthlies which are easier to manage, close them early to reduce risk of the trade turning back against you, and trade more often, ladder your positions (spread out trades through a week rather than all at once to catch different market ranges), etc. - all of these things together increase your odds of success and making money long term.\n\nPlay the odds.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I close monthlies within a couple of weeks.

In the most troubled property sectors, 19.3% of hotel loans and 10.0% of retail loans were delinquent, up from 2.71% and 3.67%, respectively, in April.

Take a look at [the graph](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixvGtK3QI_Aw/v0/1400x-1.png) for yourself, it has gone parabolic. The [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/speculative-fervor-in-u-s-stocks-surges-to-stunning-levels) states, “Traders established fresh bullish positions last week by buying 35.6 million new call options on equities, according to Sundial founder Jason Goepfert. That’s up from a peak of 28.7 million in February, when speculative activity was rampant, he wrote in a note Monday.” The volume from small options traders is estimated to be 50% in that same article, the highest since 2000. Google Trends for [“how to trade options”](https://i.imgur.com/6nf8LTw.png) and [“robinhood trade options”](https://i.imgur.com/4NJwVfh.png) have gone parabolic recently as well. The put/call ratio across all equities is also at [historic lows](https://c.stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=%24CPCE&p=D&b=5&g=1&i=p77530317141), indicating a mass wave of euphoria and a lack of hedges. » \n\n\\-> Agree, even if it is very hard to understand because small traders usually don’t have that much buying power even leveraged, I don’t think that this leverage is actually hurting such a volatile market because of the IV, prices of deep ITM/ITM options are very expensive, so delta edging is actually not that high. So I don’t think that the market rally can be explained completely by small trading accounts, I think that we are in a very emotional market that is mostly event driven, and small accounts are just giving more momentum that could result for some stocks to rally further than they should have, I am thinking about Hertz, Boeing…\n\n« As you can see in the graph, the savings rate is now significantly higher than it has ever been before, coming in at 33%.

If the banks are keeping all the cash, but corporations/stockholders keep seeing their businesses crashing, something's gotta give, and he has to please them both somehow. So what could happen next?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my deliberations so far:\n\n1- Trump does nothing: SPY continues freefalling to 220-250. We get an extra couple weeks in the red. Aside from a few bumps here and there, economy doesn't get that much value, especially as some states may still keep stay-at-home orders. People still want to save money, but very, very slowly, people start buying, and perhaps banks start lending as well. This may take years to come back to last Monday's levels. Sucks ass for Trump, as he needs a win before elections.\n\n2- Trump hands checks to people: more money to the people? Most may end up just saving again. Most stores are closed anyway, so there's no easy liquidity here. At least it may keep people happy very temporarily. Hard to see this happening with the current negative press, but there may be enough room for him to be pushed this way. Jeff Bezos grows an extra boner.\n\n3- If the money's with the banks... would the Feds even think of giving them a negative interest rate? In the banks? They are holding all the money after all, and need to push it out as it gets de-valued. Makes contracts and loans more valuable for them to hold, and now it's kind of their problem. INSANE idea, as we're going complete ass-backwards as to how loans should work to begin with, but fuck it, everything goes. How the fuck would this even work? That would incredibly antagonize the banks, for sure, but at this point Trump can't please both banks and other big corps.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Jesus wept this is a fuckin book....

So most of the money created from QE never made it into the actual economy, and just stayed within the banking system. The intention was to allow the banks to get free interest payments from the Fed to make up for their losses from bad real estate investments. Since that special Fed facility that allows banks to park money and collect interest at no risk still exists, I am sure something similar may repeat again - low inflation and low money velocity. However, all that needs to be done is remove that Fed facility, and the banks will be forced to make loans into the real economy again, and deflation chances would be eliminated.\n\nEnjoyed reading your well composed post with useful links, pretty good for an idiot on WSB.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am a massive rookie and I found this really interesting.

If anything, in normal times, this might mean that banks could increase profits due to more people wanting to take out loans.\n\nThe issue is that we are not in normal times. Banks being reluctant to lend in times of crisis is not unusual and is expected - esp. with central bank prudential authority eyes looking at them more closely than in 08. Even with CBs pumping money into overnight markets, there is still a risk of a significant rise in haircuts - which could seriously fuck banks.\n\nIn short, of course banks are reluctant to lend.\n\n\n\n**Reasons for the rally:**\n\n> After seeing all of this, it is clear to me that this is a retail driven bubble and not driven by the Fed after April.\n\nSo a few cunts buying spy calls on robinhood is behind the recovery? Nothing to do with the trillions the fed has injected into the financial system and markets? Even if robinhood users all left the market, the fed would, as they made clear again yesterday, essentially buy all their shit.\n\n\n**Effects of Quantitative Easing**\n\n> The main effect of low interest rates along with quantitative easing is an increase in the money supply.\n\nNo, this is the wrong way round. The main effect of increasing the money supply is to decrease short term rates. QE looks to reduce longer term rates.\n\n> Typically throughout history, an expansion in the money supply has lead to an increase in the inflation rate. That has not happened\n\nBecause we're in a crisis AND have hit the zero lower bound!!\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n> I believe that we are about to enter into a massive deflation cycle that is being assisted inadvertently by the Fed’s policy of QE and the near 0% interest rates.\n\nThen I believe you do not understand the power of the fed or the willingness of the US gov to introduce unorthodox measures to ensure this does not take place!\n\n> Consumer credit is contracting and banks are stashing extra reserves, meaning that the real money supply is contracting.\n\nThe real money supply isnt contracting though, is it? Ms is increasing and if deflation is occurring then p is decreasing. Therefore, Ms/p is increasing on both counts?\n\nThe stuff on QE causing deflation is interesting but I don't think we will be heading into a deflationary spiral.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Imo I wouldn't freak out too much if you're only invested in index funds as the funds always trend upwards in the long run - the saying goes you should invest for 5 years which gives you enough time to ride out many bumps.
