{"title": "Get the fuck out of Intel and get out immediately.", "selftext": "https://www.anandtech.com/show/15846/jim-keller-resigns-from-intel-effective-immediately\n\nGoddammit, this reminded me why I never take vacations. I've had limited access to the Internet and I was catching up on my news feeds. Apparently Jim Keller resigned from Intel one week ago, effectively immediately.\n\nI know a lot of you here suck Lisa Su's dick nonstop because you think she was the captain that turned around AMD, and while she does deserve a lot of credit, I have argued on this very subreddit that if it had not been for her bringing back Jim Keller, AMD's unparalleled comeback would not have been possible (I also think the reason Intel is putting out press releases about shifting away from benchmarks is because they know that Zen 3 this fall will utter destroy their lineup - they will be faster in literally every single category of benchmark, not just multicore performance).\n\nJim Keller is well-known in the CPU industry as a legendary chip designer. He designed chips for DEC (Digital Equipment Corp), Apple (A4 / A5), AMD (K6, K8, Ryzen, etc.), Tesla's Autopilot hardware, and others.\n\nThe official press release was \"for personal reasons\". That often translates to health-related issues. I don't buy it. His brother-in-law is Jordan Peterson (yes, that Dr. Peterson), but Jordan's on the mend and recovering from his benzo addiction. Keller himself is healthy as a fucking horse. I think this is related far more to Intel and the managerial clusterfuck that the company has become over the past decade and a half. I think Keller realized he can't do what he did at AMD, which was really shake things the fuck up in order to put together the best possible team for engineering a new line of CPUs.\n\nWhy do I think this? Various reasons, listed below.\n\nCharlie Demerjian of SemiAccurate has long detailed Intel's problems with their 10nm process, along with their management issues. Glassdoor.com has dozens of company reviews from employees of Intel where they talk about blue badge vs. green badge employees (blue badges are full-time employees that are directly employed by Intel; green badges are contractors which far less benefits). You can Google search these terms - \"Intel blue badge green badge\" and read literally page after page of material about how utterly dysfunctional Intel currently is, due to idiotic management practices. Some of the stories are laughably sad.\n\nIntel as a company has a culture of arrogance. How could they not? They've never had a serious competitor in the x86 space, and while they missed the boat on mobile processors for smartphones and tablets - even after Steve Jobs personally approached them and told them to fix their power management issues and improve their power consumption because he wanted to use Intel x86 chips in iPads and MacBook Air lines - they didn't really care because their desktop and server market was so entrenched and they were so dominant that they figured they could live without those markets.\n\nWell now AMD is fucking destroying them on all fronts. Desktop? Yes. Zen 2 is more power efficient than Intel's most recent desktop parts, by far, and approaches almost the exact same performance. Server? LOL, don't even making me fucking laugh... Intel's highest-end server chips are drawing almost half a fucking kilowatt for a 56 core chip. Epyc is pulling 261 watts under load for 64 cores. Laptops? AMD is ahead there now as well, with the Ryzen 4700U chip pulling **half** fucking ***HALF*** of the wattage of its competing Intel chip.\n\nIf you're a bagholding 🌈🐻 you better watch the fuck out because Intel is going to go nowhere but downhill from here. Its clear that their 10nm process is a steaming pile of hot garbage, with absolutely atrocious yields. You don't believe that? Ask yourself why they haven't shifted production of all chips away from 14nm++++ (however many fucking pluses they've added since 2014) and to 10nm? Ask yourself why only a handful of parts are currently 10nm, and why all those parts are either low-power laptop chips or high-power server CPUs? Simple. Low-power laptop chips are small and there's less chance of shit being fucked up during lithography. Server chips are huge and expensive, because Intel puts all 28 cores on a single chip, instead of \"gluing together\" the chips like AMD does. So out of a single wafer, they may get 300 chips. But with yields so low (in 2018, Intel's 10nm yield was than than 10%, most industry insiders don't think they've even cracked 50% yield yet), they're lucky to get 150 functional chips out of that wafer, and if you believe sites like SemiAccurate, it could be far... **far** lower. Out of those, you have to put 2 of these 28 core chips together to get Intel's high-end Platinum 9200 series CPU, which sells for $10,000 (and which practically no one is buying). AMD has 93.5% yield on Zen 2 process. That means out of a potential 840 chips, 785 of those chips are fully functional. If AMD wants a 32 core chip, they just glue together 4 of them. Problem solved. Congratulations on your 32 core server CPU.\n\nWait for AMD's Zen 3 launch this fall. If you're bold, short the shit out of Intel. If you're risk adverse, buy AMD and hold. Abandon ship on INTC. This fucker is going to crash and burn until at least 2023 (on average it takes 5 years to create a completely new CPU architecture, Intel hasn't done that since the Core series, which was 10 years ago, and when Keller was brought on in 2018, that's what everyone thought he would do).\n\nEDIT: Corrected Intel's ticket symbol from INTL to INTC, sorry autists.", "id": "hbr1ol", "created_utc": 1592528662.0, "score": 1884, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 594, "comments": [{"body": "Nobody sucks my dick.", "score": 1088, "replies": [{"body": "Just take matters into your own hands and suck other people's dicks", "score": 141, "replies": [{"body": ">Just take matters into your own ~~hands~~mouth", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "But have you ever tried sucking dick with your asshole?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "No. As someone who soft broke his dick while fucking (not myself), let me also add that there are limitations to how much a hard dick can safely bend.

If you find yourself sleepy or groggy, take this and you'll be wide awake and ready to tackle your day. If your sleep schedule is good and not off-balance, it dramatically improves focus and function.\n* **Phenylpiracetam 100 mg capsules** - This is my alternate for Adrafinil. I usually rotate these every three to four months. I had a trader friend at Merrill Lynch to whom I introduced this and he took 3x the amount I take (300 mg). He compared it to cocaine, without all the negatives. Make of that what you will. I find it puts me into hyperdrive for creativity and focus. Take 30 minutes before you need to be high octane.\n* **Alpha-GPC 150 mg softgels or capsules** - Promotes brain choline levels, which improves cognitive function. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter, Alpha-GPC is a precursor molecule. Higher levels = higher Acetylcholine in the brain. Take when you wake up in the morning, take it again 6-8 hours later.\n* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine 500 mg capsules** - Boost mitochondrial function by way of improving fatty acid intake into cell mitochondria. This has the effect of improving energy levels. Take one per day, ideally when you wake.\n* **Multivitamin** - Doesn't really matter which one. A good solid multivitamin is all you need, you don't need a bottle of $60 Mega Men from GNC. I use Sam's Club Men's Multivitamin. Like $16 for a year's supply bottle. Take one per day.\n* **7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF) 25 mg capsules** - Binds to TrkB receptors in the brain, improves dendrite function, which improves synapse function. Some people report it gives them a positive outlook on life. I just care about the mental flexibility and creative thinking I tend to get on this. Take twice per day, once upon waking, once again 6-8 hours later.\n* **CoQ10 100 mg capsules** - This provides quite a few benefits according to studies, but I've noticed it amplifies the DHF effect, which is why I use it.\n\nFor sexual performance:\n\n* **L-Arginine 1000mg** - Increases erection firmness. Take this daily, in about a month, all these Diamond Hands mother fuckers will fear you because you can chop their fucking paws off with your white dwarf star dense dick. Take one daily.\n* **Zinc 80mg *TOTAL*** - Watch your multivitamin's zinc amount, usually its about 30-40 mg. Add in a cheap zinc cap, they're 50mg. That should get you there. This increases the volume of seminal fluid you produce.\n* **Pygeum 100mg** - Increases the amount of seminal fluid you produce. Take twice daily for a total of 200mg, once in the morning, once in the evening or before bed.\n* **Lecithin 1200mg** - Massively increases the amount of seminal fluid you produce. Increases orgasm intensity.

The key words to say to your doctor or to the person who interviews you on Lemonaid are: \"I'm having trouble with penetration\" and \"My erections aren't as hard, and don't last as long as they used to\". Yes its embarrassing, but who gives a fuck? Ironically, if you want to legally juice, you can get a testosterone cypionate prescription saying the same things, just add the following symptoms, \"I feel tired much more often than I used to\" and \"I've been gaining more body fat, even though I've reduced my calorie intake and I continue to do moderate weight training\".\n\nThe performance stack basically allowed me to double my load size, which is fun for young girls because you're just blasting all over their tits or ass or face and their reactions are priceless.

Programs written for Intel x86 architecture chips do not run on ARM chips. Switching chips requires all the software vendors to make minor modifications to their programs to work on the new architecture. Given that the programs typically took years to develop, even a minor modification might take weeks in the worst case. More problematic (in terms of marketing, which is most of what Apple thinks about), this will require that consumers making the transition obtain new versions of their programs.\n\nThe point is, it's a hassle, and not one that Apple would undertake unless there is a **major** advantage to moving to Intel.\n\nThe advantages are power and (surprisingly) speed. Intel chips have always been power hungry, which is not good for laptops. In years past Intel offset this by being faster, but surprisingly that gap had started to disappear by 2017\n\n[iPhone 8 faster than intel Core i5](https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/22/iphone-8-geekbench-test-scores/)\n\nand it's only gotten worse since then: on Geekbench the A13 (Iphone11) has the same single core performance as an I9. That's a tiny *phone* chip compared to the top-end *desktop* cpu targeted at gamers.\n\nWait until Apple introduces an actual desktop-oriented ARM chip.\n\nSpeed has started to become debatable, but the trend is more clear and important. One key problem is that Intel is struggling to move to 10nm, whereas Apple is already shipping 7nm and moving to 5nm next. Smaller nm (nanometers) means less power and somewhat faster.\n\nThe ARM advantage over Intel has become too compelling to ignore, and other PC makers will be making the switch in coming years. **Microsoft** has already been trying (several times), with mixed success:\n\n[https://www.androidauthority.com/windows-on-arm-review-1074547/](https://www.androidauthority.com/windows-on-arm-review-1074547/)[https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20887386/microsoft-surface-event-pro-7-arm-windows-laptops](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20887386/microsoft-surface-event-pro-7-arm-windows-laptops)\n\nPeople are also trying to replace Intel on **Servers**, [https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd)\n\nAnd (for different reasons) Intel is also losing some ground to AMD.\n\nAll these efforts are having (or will have) mixed success initially. But the point is that ***everyone*** **is trying to get away from Intel.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe might think, *\"OK, Intel is losing on their core business (desktop+server CPUs), but they have other segments\".*Not really.

{"title": "[Chart] Voodoo & [Options] Chains - $NVDA and $SQ", "selftext": "I want to get this off my chest before I begin. Two posts in two days is a big no-no. A deadly sin. It should never be attempted and I don't recommend it... BUT that never stops me. Prayers up that this DD doesn't flop and go south. If you've never read my posts, welcome to the club. I'm a pretty technical guy and my DD reflects that, but I understand fundamentals and I will speak to those from time to time. If you don't know what I mean by voodoo and chains you probably don't know much about options. Stick around and find out more, nerd. Also, if you missed last night's DD on $HD and $SPOT it's right here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb80hc/chart\\_voodoo\\_options\\_chains\\_hd\\_and\\_spot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb80hc/chart_voodoo_options_chains_hd_and_spot/)\n\nI put the offer out there today to do some DD on any ticker for whatever lucky autist replied to my comment. I got a few requests, but $NVDA and $SQ caught my attention for several reasons. Let's dive into these over-hyped, millennial stocks and discuss why both could definitely moonshot in the near term.\n\nFirst come, first serve. The first retard requested FB and NVDA. Everyone's second favorite chip maker gets the spotlight: **$NVDA**\n\n[6 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/a6sn6qrubs551.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f79f2b6863f12bdfd3aac10335ea54f2f203417)\n\n[3 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/lorxrwtwbs551.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4ef07337cb1196cfa8890b9b19f0da61c65bc1c)\n\nI would like to share a quick story with you: $NVDA was my first love in the stock market. Back before I knew how to trade options I picked a few shares up and flipped them for disgusting returns. This was during the 2017 run so I'm sure you can imagine the endless green candles. Today, $NVDA was trading near $370. ATHs is exactly $380.00.\n\nIf I have learned one thing from $NVDA it is not to doubt it during ER. That being said, just because the monster stock beats earnings doesn't mean the price will follow. Recent EPS has fallen between $.60 and $1.80. I have no reason to believe the chip sector will outperform this market given the macro risks, but I've said this before and been dead wrong. ER falls on 8/13 so watch out for this.\n\n$NVDA faces a competitive market among $INTC, $MU, $AMD, and others... The stock boasts a $227B market cap that could easily go to $275B in a delusional bull market. Financials are solid and healthy and the FCFs are increasing faster than you can sell a 10 bagger after a big red candle.\n\nTake a look at the graph since March and you'll see that $NVDA already traded a bullish flag pattern and confirmed the trend mid-May when it shot up to the $360 price level. $NVDA is trading in a tight and flat trading channel with high volume that is starting to taper off.\n\nRSI is signaling that the stock is nearing overbought, but this is $NVDA, so this stock could keep pumping. MACD is slightly bearish but it's a weak signal. Let's watch the price action tomorrow and see what happens - momentum doesn't lie.\n\nThe options chain is pricing in a $30 move on both sides after ER with high volume and open interest on this expiry.\n\nLet's get to the plays... debit spread on the short term and OTM calls on the intermediate term:\n\nFor 7/17 I like the 385c/400c debit spread. To enter this, you go long on the 385c and you short the 400c. This will result in a net debit on your account allowing for a relatively cheap entry and a wide window for tendies.\n\nIf you want to play earnings, try the 8/21 420c. 400 of these contracts sold right before the market closed today so someone is expecting a big gap up. I like the exorbitant strike price. I like the recent momentum. I'm going to watch for continuation and play accordingly.\n\nSecond on the list is Jack Dorsey's very own: **$SQ**\n\n[YTD chart](https://preview.redd.it/0cs9eth9cs551.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=5039f65807f21b9d868512b39b956a126bb10aca)\n\n[3 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/450gpv9ecs551.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c7778c7f68533a4eb63fbed87ad32b52a268bb7)\n\nThere isn't much I can say about $SQ that I didn't already say about $SPOT last night. The autistic fellow that requested this DD made a great point. This $SQ play is essentially the same play as the $SPOT play but we're looking at $100 price levels rather than $200 price levels. What we have here is a speculative company that is nearing profitability and ready to burst above resistance levels.\n\nThat's the tightest trading channel I have seen so far since March. $SQ has a goal and it knows how to get there. My advice? Don't buy puts. $SQ climbed over 100% steadily - I mean really steadily - since March and is starting to show an ascending triangle pattern off the short term support level at $75.\n\nRSI is screaming overbought, but honestly with volume this supportive I think it can hover at these levels.\n\nThe options chain is pricing in a $4 move on both sides for the 7/2 expiry.\n\nOther than ER on 8/5, we're missing a big event that will move this stock up. $SPOT had it's podcast deals and other news. I said I was going to play this like $SPOT, though, so let's get to the play: barely OTM 1-2 week calls.\n\nI'm going to pick up the 105c for either 6/26 or 7/2. How to play this? Monitor the stock for continued momentum - if the stock breaks out above $100, buy the 105c. If the stock price leaps tomorrow for some reason I'm going to watch the 6/26 and 7/2 110c and 115c. I probably won't be playing earnings on this one.\n\nTL;DR\n\n$NVDA deep OTM calls - 8/21 420c\n\n$SQ weekly calls - 6/26 105c", "id": "hbt5b6", "created_utc": 1592537014.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "I know this is a total side note but I feel I have to ask you after posting an absolute all time DD with great insight that I’ll be following and playing.

{"title": "AMD analysis and why you should sell big blue", "selftext": "**Abstract**\n\nHello all, today we are going to be discussing everyone’s favorite meme stock, ~~Tesla~~ AMD! Before we get into the meat of the arguments for AMD and Intel, this is intended to be a follow up of another pretty crappy post I made a few months back, as such we will go into much further depth than before. Also I will not be providing price targets due to macro environmental circumstances.\n\nIn this post I will first have to cover some terms needed to talk about both companies’ products, and some history. Then I will talk about how both are positioned in the present and the near term (next 6 months to a year), followed by long term speculation which I’ll release later (next week maybe). Please note that I will briefly touch on NVIDIA and their products in the future speculation, but I will not go into depth due to there being a lot of misinformation circulating. I will most likely make another post doing a deep dive into the relation between NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD in late October/December.\n\n*Also note that I do not hold any shares or derivatives in AMD, Intel or NVIDIA.*\n\n**An introduction into the semiconductor industry**\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a massive industry currently valued at a massive 433b1, it is what powers all electronics ranging from the weakest smartwatch all the way up to the largest supercomputers. Semiconductors are made out of silicon oxide with transistors on them which perform logic functions and the likes. The semiconductor market has two large segments, that being the CPU market and the GPU market, with CPUs being used to compute a wide ranging set of data, whereas a GPU is used to perform lots of very repetitive tasks such as rendering. There are four primary companies in this space, that being Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM (note that Qualcomm and Samsung license their core architectures from ARM).\n\n*Some important terms that are needed to understand basic things that will affect performance/competitiveness.*\n\n1. Architecture: Refers to the design of a product think about it like how a house is built from a frame.\n2. Clock speed: How many cycles a CPU/GPU can perform, each cycle is the effectuation of a certain number of calculations.\n3. IPC: Instructions per clock refers to how many calculations a CPU/GPU can perform per clock cycle.\n4. Core: The “processor” in a CPU/GPU that performs the calculation\n5. Thread: present only in CPUs, allow multiple code paths to access a singular core at once thereby ensuring that the core is always fed with information.\n6. Monolithic design: A CPU/GPU using only 1 piece of silicon.\n7. MCM: Multi-chip module, a CPU/GPU that is composed of a multitude of pieces of silicon.\n8. Wafer: A disc of varying size in which the transistors are inlaid on, this will later be cut up into chips\n9. Chips: Smaller pieces of silicon which are typically a final product\n10. Node: Refers to how small a transistor is, measured in nano-meters (NM). Note however, it is more of a marketing term and the real size of the transistors are typically much larger, furthermore different nodes are intended to compete with each other, such as Intel’s 10nm node being intended to be on parity with TSMC’s 7nm node.\n11. Reticle limit: The maximum size a chip can be made on a certain node.\n12. EUV: Extreme ultraviolet, is the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing, uses high energy ultraviolet light to imprint the transistors on the wafer, allows for increased efficiency and better yields.\n13. Yields: Defect density of a wafer, if there is a defect on wafer the corresponding chip may be compromised and have to be thrown out or binned lower.\n14. Binning: The practice of sorting chips by how many defects they have, a chip with a lot of defects will have lower performance then one that has none.\n15. Cache: Small, low latency storage that allows for cores to quickly access data. Further divided into L1, L2, and L3 cache, with L1 cache having the lowest latency and lowest storage and L3 having the highest latency and the highest capacity.\n16. Memory/RAM: Fast storage that a CPU can directly access, note that it can not store as much data as traditional solutions, but latency and transfer speed are much higher. There are currently four generations of it, that being DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4, with DDR4 being the newest. Memory also has clock speeds which indicates indirectly how fast the data transfer is.\n17. Fab/Foundry: Where wafers are made, the three largest ones are TSMC, Intel and Samsung.\n\n**A brief history of the relation between Intel and AMD**\n\nIntel was founded in 1968 by a few people you may know about, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Arthur Rock. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductors with Arthur Rock providing the initial capital. Together the three made the first commercial CPU, the 4004.\n\n[Intel 4004](https://preview.redd.it/ejutymn6lt551.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02c5bf57614fa67345e09a92a138189f510d718c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAMD was founded a year later in 1969 and initially produced memory, but in 1981 they entered in a 10 year partnership with Intel as a secondary supplier as requested by IBM. At the time, most OEMs required a secondary supplier to ensure that they would not become too reliant on one company and to ensure that they would have enough supply should one company have issues. This meant that Intel licensed their technology to AMD so they could produce them at their own fabs.\n\nThis partnership did not last long when in 1984 Intel broke the partnership, and violated the terms which in and after numerous appeals and cases of discovery abuse on the side of Intel resulted in the court's ruling in AMD’s favor in 19902. Because of this AMD was forced to set out and create their own chips, initially copying Intel’s 80C287, which would have been shared under the 10 year partnership. This resulted in Intel suing AMD for patent infringement, however the courts ruled in AMD’s favour citing the previously mentioned case.\n\nAs the decade progressed, and the 2000s rolled around AMD came out with their own products, which handily beat Intel’s own offerings, but the damage was already done. Intel was able to make so much money that they essentially had a monopoly on the CPU market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Old benchmark demonstrating AMD's advantage over Intel](https://preview.redd.it/nj6i1pi8lt551.png?width=222&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c1e79f3701a998f90ec82697399c59c3705d5b)\n\nBut despite having the performance crown for about 7 years, their market share never came close to that of Intel, and the reason behind this would be revealed in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, the European commission fined Intel $USD 1.4b3. The reason behind this was Intel had bribed OEMs with cash incentives to not use AMD processors. This was to the point that Intel paid Dell 1b per year to not use AMD4. These bribes were so significant that when in 2006, in order not to be laughed out of business, they started to use AMD products, resulting in a massive 50% decrease in profit in 20065. That being said the damage was already done once again, and AMD was relegated to being a secondary competitor to Intel as they had simply run out of money. AMD released the Phenom in 2008, which was thoroughly crushed by the Intel competitors and after three years of refreshing the product with minor improvements, they released the horrible Bulldozer in 2011 which was legendary for its horrible performance, and insane power consumption. In 2016, they were near insolvency, with a share price bottoming out at 2$ per share.\n\nAll the while, Intel made small iterative performance upgrades while making all the money they could ever want. This is why your computer from 2010 is still very serviceable in 2020, 10 years later.\n\nIn 2017, AMD released their new Zen architecture with a massive 40%+ leap in IPC bringing it back into competition with Intel. Furthermore, Zen was an MCM design meaning that you could pair a few small chips to act as one large chip via Infinity Fabric, an interconnect that acted as the highways permitting multiple chips, or chiplets to communicate with each other.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the modern age**\n\nA lot has happened in the last 5 years. Currently, Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation. For example, Intel’s primary product, Intel’s current offerings are a mere 7% better in applications that only use 1-2 cores, than those of AMD’s while using 50% more energy and having vastly inferior in the increasingly important applications which leverage more than four cores. Intel’s highest end desktop product, the w3175x, coming in at 3k only has 28 cores, whilst the highest end AMD cpu the 3990x, has over double at 64 cores. The performance disparity is clear, AMD is the only viable option for productivity. The story continues in servers where Intel is outclassed in a similar manner to that of the desktop with performance on the AMD side being well over 200% higher. The slaughter continues into laptops where AMD’s 4900HS, completely embarrasses the highest end Intel competition while consuming ⅓ the power. The only performance crown that Intel can claim is gaming, and even then it is a mere 7% higher, due to extreme clock speeds with their newest architecture, when compared to AMD’s design, which is over a year old.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why Intel is so behind in performance, the primary being nodes. Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. Earlier on I mentioned that AMD had fabs and was a secondary supplier, however as they were approaching insolvency, they sold off their fabs and partnered with Global Foundries, and later TSMC. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm, which was designed to compete with 10nm, extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, volume 10 nm will most likely hit the market by 2021, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm, which was designed to compete with Intel’s 7nm hitting markets in 2020. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end of Intel’s fabs. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel.\n\nThis is also compounded, though to a lesser extent by there being little to no IPC improvements in 5 years, meaning that AMD was free to catch up and in many cases surpass them.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin when it comes to Intel in the near term is their security vulnerabilities. Before 2018, all security vulnerabilities were mainly from software attacks, but that changed with the discovery of Meltdown and Specter. To show how important these issues were, let me illustrate an example. *Say you are a CEO of a major investment firm (lol), and you are using Intel servers to do whatever you need to do, you go about your day, the server is 100% secure from a software standpoint. Night comes, and you decide to look at how profitable your company was this quarter (again lol), but on the front page you see “Major leak at X company all confidential data was leaked,” you panic and call up your IT guy and he is in a panic, the head lines are correct all company data stored on any server that you own has been leaked and there is nothing you can do about it.* That is the danger of these vulnerabilities. There is absolutely nothing you or your staff could have done, and worse yet, there are over a dozen similarly dangerous vulnerabilities, and over 600 more minor ones. The only way to try and prevent these leaks are to apply patches from Intel, but this results from anywhere between a 10% to a 60% loss in performance, which needs to be made up by buying new servers as you are already at 90-100% capacity. Then you hear that a certain company, AMD, was immune to this attack and their products are vastly superior. This is the major issue plaguing Intel at the moment. For the time being you will see a major rise in server sales as people scramble to buy up servers to remain operational, but in time they will switch to AMD, with AMD forecast to take 10% in Q2 20206, up from near 0% in 2016.\n\n**Intel VS. AMD in the near future**\n\nAt the moment AMD is uniquely positioned, their competition has yet to compete truely with their 1 year old tech, and they are on track to release brand new CPUs this year in late Q3/Q4. As a warning, we are entering grounds of speculation, but do note that this speculation is based on reliable leakers like AdoredTV7 (correctly leaked entire AMD CPU product stack from last year with only minor errors), Moore’s Law is Dead8 (correctly leaked entire CPU product stack form Intel that was released this year with near 0 errors thus far).\n\nAMD: Intel(New product titled Zen 3, releasing this year) (New product released this year)\n\n16 cores with 32 threads N/A\n\n12 cores with 24 threads 10 cores with 20 threads\n\n8 cores with 16 threads 8 cores with 16 threads\n\n6 cores with 12 threads 6 cores with 12 threads\n\nThings to remember\n\n\\- Zen 3 \\~13-15% IPC bump7, with maybe 100ish MHz clock speed bump7, which will allow AMD to claim the final performance crown of gaming from Intel, this coupled with Intel being nowhere in sight will allow AMD to reign supreme in all faculties for a while.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nAMD is in an excellent position to capitalize on Intel’s stagnation. The security flaws could have not come at a better time, accelerating the world’s adoption of AMD CPUs and their new products will beat Intel in gaming thanks to the IPC and clock speed increase improving their gaming performance by at least 15%. Overall, Intel is a precarious spot, that being said they have vast sums of cash and they had a few key developments in the past few years which could allow them to catch up in 2022 or 2023.

{"title": "[DD] Ride HOG into the fucking ground on Monday", "selftext": "Listen up retards because I have the play of the week for you: **HOG puts.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I may be autistic but I'm not your fucking rain-man, do your own DD, this isn't financial advice it's gambling.*\n\n#The play\n\nIn case you didn't know, everyone's least favourite boomercycle manufacturer is finally getting the boot from the S&P 500 on June 19th after market close.\n\nsource: https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/2020/06/15/milwaukee-based-harley-davidson-removed-s-p-500/3194719001/\n\nI don't need to tell you why HOG is garbage, you've read all the posts by now and you know that they're zombie boomer shit. Loud bikes, way too expensive, no one has jobs and all their customers are dead now from batsoup flu. **DOG SHIT.** What's new about this play is that we now get to play the rebalancing between the huge S&P500 funds and their relatively small S&P400 counterparts.\n\n**Big ETF indexes are rebalancing on June 22nd.**\n\nsource: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/state-street-delays-shaking-up-world-s-biggest-etf-on-volatility\n\nThis means that on June 22nd your biggest ETFs and passive funds are going to dump HOG like the hot garbage it is. We're talking capital outflow from HOG heavier and wetter than your wife's panties when her boyfriend rolls up on his Ducati.\n\nLet's take alook at the total HOG holdings of the top S&P 500 ETFS and mutual funds (VFINX, VOO, FXAIX, SPY, IVV and SWPPX). **The total number of HOG shares owned by these whales is ≈14.2 M shares. Average daily volume for HOG is 4.6M, that's 3.2x avg volume which has to be dumped because robot says sell.**\n\nYou say:\n\n*Wait a minute Mr. Thicc, won't all those shares be picked up by the mid-cap ETFs when HOG moves into the midcap S&P 400?*\n\nI say:\n\nFirst of all that's Dr. Thicc to you, and second of all no they won't because mid-cap ETFs are little virgin $10B funds next to the $500B Chad funds that are the S&P 500 ETFS. Limpdick S&P400 doesn't have the market cap to absorb all of the outflow from big-dick VOO and SPY. They're smaller because retail investors don't want to put their 401ks in loser mid-caps when they can invest in the FAGMAN S&P 500.\n\nAdding up some of the larger S&P400 midcap funds (MDY, IJH, VO, WIR, IJK, IJJ, SPMD) you get ≈$122.8B in AUM. **HOG's $3.9 B market cap divided through the $1.63T market cap of the S&P400 means it'll capture 0.23% of those funds, so that rolls up to around ≈11.7M shares leaving a deficit of 2.5M shares that the big boys have to sell, but the mid-cap ETFs can't eat up.** For those of you still counting that's half of the average daily volume that will need to be sold at a discount.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? It means short-dated HOG puts will print on June 22nd when the indexes rebalance by dumping HOG shares and pumping the IV through the roof. And once that happens you can bet your last Adderal that the Marketwatch and CNBC robo-writers will be there to keep the pain going with their negative sentiment \"HOG Shares Down On Exit From S&P500\" headlines.\n\nDogshit company, garbage bikes, and they're about to get personally buttfucked by Vanguard and BlackRock.\n\nHOG 6/26 22.5p and HOG 6/26 23.5 p are the plays, grab a plate, clench your ass over the weekend, and join me for the HOG roast on Monday.\n\n\n**TL:DR** Big dick S&P500 ETFs have to dump HOG on June 22 when it gets demoted. Limpdick S&P400 ETFs can't absorb the capacity, so buy HOG 6/26 23.5p and HOG 6/26 22.5p and make it rain tendies of boomer tears.", "id": "hc0tu4", "created_utc": 1592573869.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Does playing rebalancing ETFs ever actually work?", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "Short answer no, long answer sometimes.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Damn look at the daily volume on today.

{"title": "Florida and Arizona have no other option but to shut down and nobody is paying attention.", "selftext": "**TLDR:** Some states have grown complacent and don't take social distancing and mask wearing seriously. From Memorial day onward, some of these places have started seeing exponential growth in cases which is guaranteed to overwhelm hospitals. Because the citizens don't think the virus is a serious threat, the only way to stop it will be statewide shutdowns. Governors won't acknowledge this because its politically inconvenient and will keep their states open as long as possible. That will make it much worse.\n\n**# Background**\n\nDuring the first wave of coronavirus, some states got decked, the citizens were scared shitless, and everything was shut down hard. The virus spread like wildfire throughout the North East, and everyone stayed home, socially distanced, and mostly wore masks. Because of this, the virus has faded dramatically in places like NY, NJ, and MA.\n\nOn the other hand, we have places like Florida and Arizona. They mostly shut down because of what was happening elsewhere. The citizens in these places interpreted the shutdown as unnecessary and job-killing. They're fatigued from the shutdown and nothing even really happened in their states.\n\n**# Catalyst**\n\nSo why does it matter? On June first, the 7-day moving average of case counts in Florida was 726. Right now the same 7-day moving average is over 2400. For some reason, April and May were boring. But starting in June, exponential growth started coming back. Perhaps Memorial Day served as a sort of kick-off event. Remember, this explosion in growth is a window into behavior 2-3 weeks ago.\n\nWhy can't they just continue life as usual and let the weak die? Because the entire population needs ICU beds. If there are no ICU beds available, they can't treat anyone with life threatening illnesses or injuries. Death rates will skyrocket for everyone, even those without COVID. Florida already has [less than 25% capacity left](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/icu-beds-short-supply-across-florida-state-struggles-coronavirus-spike-n1231451) and the new trend in case counts literally just started.\n\n\\# **Forecast and Timeline**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2urh0bdx4y551.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe806c67bd712f378150e313cd3455fad86339c\n\nThis is a forecast using exponential smoothing. I can provide all the code to run this forecast in the comments. The black line is the last month of cases. The purple is the forecast for the next 14 days. For context, New York, at its worst had roughly 10k cases a day. Italy only had around 6k/day at their peak. I'm too lazy to graph Arizona, but they're in the exact same situation.\n\nThis madness is going to be made worse by the fact that governors are choosing denial as their containment strategy. In both states, the governors are blaming increased testing as the reason for the spike. This hypothesis is easily disproved by the fact that hospitalization rates and % of positive test results are both increasing as well.\n\n**# The Play**\n\nRight now the market is pricing in a rosy recovery. I believe we will start seeing rolling statewide shutdowns this summer, starting with Florida and Arizona in the next month. This might bring the market back down to reality. So what is a realistic price for spy?\n\nThankfully a world-renowned valuation expert and NYU finance professor [just did a DCF valuation of SPY](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-viral-market-update-ix-do-it-yourself.html) at the beginning of June. Further, he did it for a variety of input values via Monte-Carlo simulation to give us a range of fair values. Here is the output:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot07whaz6y551.jpg?width=1498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b124e4dff48623327933db6050a7bd8f625e1b6a\n\nThe market closed Friday around the 75th percentile of what could be fair value. To be conservative, we could assume once rolling shutdowns are priced in, it will drop to the 50th percentile. This gives us a great opportunity for a 310/300 or 310/290 put spread for July/August. If that's not autistic enough, buy naked UPRO puts. I bought most of my positions this week. If we are down big Monday, I'd wait for a mid-week rebound to buy into this play.\n\nEdit: someone called me out for assuming the exponential trend. That was bad science. To remedy this  I did model selection of nested  polynomial models via anova. The quadratic trend was statistically  significant, so I used that trend to extrapolate future case counts. Its not as bad, leading to around 7k cases/day in 14 days. The effect of  this lower case count could delay the day of reckoning for a couple weeks. They'll still be at 10k cases a day by mid july.\n\nUpdate on 6/28: Spy was 308 when I posted this (on 6/19), it bounced up to 312 a few days later, and then, shockingly, the 'rona hit the news cycle and we breached 300 on 6/26. There's much less of an opportunity now, but if sentiment shifts and we get some more bad news we may break 290.

Florida hospitals were at 87.5% capacity average before the virus.  They kicked out anyone who didn't absolutely need to be there when the virus hit and then realized they had completely empty hospitals and not many virus cases.  Per Desantis the reason for most of the uptick in hospitals is because of the groups of non-covid patients that they have allowed back in.\n* Median Age:  Median age of positive tests in many FL counties was in the 29-32 range.  This means half of positive tests were from  people who most likely showed no symptoms and were just caught in mass testing (tested everyone in the office). These people would not have been tested 3 months ago, so most likely we had many more cases than preciously reported.  There weren't overcrowded hospitals then, also could mean is less deadly than thought.\n* Remdesivir: While this inst the cure and and may not even be that useful, it is something.  3 months ago hospitals had nothing and were completely unprepared.

Combined with the extra hospital beds, which the article posted admits weren't accounted for, the hospitals are not that close to overcrowding.\n\nOnce again, Florida may still have to close, but I would bet it would be a temporary close, like maybe close July 15 and then reopen Aug 15.
