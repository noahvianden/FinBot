Your max loss is the width of the strikes minus the credit received.\n\nThis isn't entirely true. It's only defined risk if both legs expire ITM and can be exercised. Long/debit positions are completely safe. Short/credit positions are not. Completely different beast and people don't seem to understand this.\n\nIf you have a $100/$105 call credit spread, and the stock closes at $103 on Friday, your short position is exercised and your long (which covers your ass) *expires worthless*. Now you are short/naked $10,000 worth of shares you agreed to sell and don't own. You have to buy shares to close the position on Monday, and hope to God the price didn't move up.\n\nIf you have a $100/$95 put credit spread, and the stock closes at $98 Friday, same thing. Now you have an obligation to buy $10,000 of shares, and hope to God the price doesn't fall over the weekend. Again, you're naked. You thought your max out of pocket was $500. That's only if you can exercise your long position.\n\nCredit spreads are not defacto defined risk, not unless the whole spread is firmly ITM. Robinhood should have retard safeguards in place, so all you see is a scary message, or bitch because they closed your position for you, but most brokers don't hold your hand like this. You'll get a margin call because you don't actually understand the mechanics of your trade, or have any idea what pin risk is.\n\n*Don't carry short positions to expiration.* Just don't. Close them out. The only time I carry short positions through expiration is to go long on shares. The risk is simply not worth it (especially gamma risk).

You can only lose your premium so letting those expire is no big deal. Options buyers have *options*. Options sellers have *obligations*.\n\nIf you're paying a debit to open a spread position, you're generally ok. Your long leg is closer to the stock price than the short, so the long covers the short in a spread and that's why it's a debit, as the long you buy is more expensive than the short hedge you sell, hence a net debit.\n\nCredit positions are the opposite, where the short leg is closer to the stock price than the long (the short leg you sell is more valuable than the long you buy hence providing a net credit), the short leg will always get ITM before the long leg does. The risk is your short leg is assigned ITM and your long hedge you bought expires worthless.\n\nDebit positions are safer. But odds are terrible which is why most people here lose money. Credit positions have better odds and are better strategies long term IMO, but are more difficult to manage.\n\nWatch the Tastytrade whiteboard series on YouTube.

Because the odds of SPY going lower than $290 by end of the week in this case is 15%. So instead of paying $190 for unlimited profit beyond SPY 190 strike, you're only paying $76 to make a maximum of $500 (the width of the spread 295 - 290).\n\nBeyond that, always trade small positions so you don't blow up your account on a single bad trade. And learn about volatility. Options are expensive when volatility is high which is good for sellers and bad for buyers. Basically it means being wrong is more expensive right now than in normal times.\n\nThe difference between people who make money with options and those who don't is knowing different strategies and what works in different market conditions, and also knowing probabilities.

Sound familiar, it's not. But it was 70 years ago.

What does all this mathematical commodity manipulation by hard assets backing? People that did what I did kept inflation under control, reduced public debt., increased consumer confidence, brought back war torn American from the brink, carried out Andrew Jackson's legacy too make mineral wealth the monitary entitlement of any working American Citizen, a right many people don't realize was less recognized than protection from slavery and indentured servitude, which was forced slave labor of indebted forfeiture of contract or tax evasion. Slavery would not have been the problem it was if it had been considered wrong in American Agricultural industries and industrial development. There were usually more white slaves than black slaves in Europe and the Americas, for the same reasons. People perceived to forfeit on terms of one kind of mutually acceptable contract and when terms were struck, witnesses bearing testimony, signatures placed on dotted line, and the point of no return--- firm, bareskinned, spit or blood shared between clasped hands too hands, or hands too wrist. Everything involving humanity was governed and regulated by the wealth of universally accepted hard assets. Even though everyone usedvcash and coin too quickly transfer wealth, no one trusted cash, accept the Chinese Culture that invented it. And only then, when the economy was so strong, that the steady flow of goods seemed virtually self sustaining. Where am I going with all this? Smart, ethical metal commodities speculators legitimized the Federal Reserve in America and backing and leveraging these assets irresponsibly made people worldwide confident in the infallibility of American paper currency. Too tighten this all up, speculators know how too control the markets they developed and protect and make an honest fortune doing so. Oh oh!! What's that? Honest fortune. As in oxymoron. Today's immoral financial system. Not back then. Anyway, endless story short. Honest speculation works when fair trade regulations are observed and ferderal antitrust legislation backed by harsh penalties for treasonous activities. Yes. In Rockefeller's day, monopoly sentiment was treasonous and I'm not aware of any changes too that legislation. Not all convictions of treason were punishable by death. Unfortunately, financial tycoons were the only indispensable people in this country, so hanging them made less sense than golden goose genocide campaigns. I'm running out of space, so hear it is.

People at church need too stop trash talking Satan, because no one worships him in this country, but he definitely worships all of us.

{"title": "Bull, Bear, Or Something Else? Define Your Entire Trading Identity With This Helpful List Of Animals", "selftext": "From bears to bulls and everything in between, aligning your market strategy with an animal is an easy way to stop thinking and start winning. Why stay agile in variable market conditions when a singular thesis works just as well? Whether you feel directionless, despairing, or just angry at the Federal Reserve, we have the animal to represent you:\n\n\n1. **Bear Gang** – A relic of the Wall Street where men were men and companies had to earn money. Adherence to bear philosophy comes with a natural self-righteousness in the confidence that western civilization is an unsustainable debt bubble. Just a few more coronavirus deaths and you’ll be content, you promise. You lose money, but you’re morally right.\n\n\n2. **Bull Gang** – Your only regret is that you didn’t buy more. You sleep well at night because you are invested in the engine of the country you love. Your faith is rewarded when stocks only go up. Your wife may not love you for your intelligence, but she’ll be content with taking half of the investment account in fifteen years.\n\n\n3. **Kangaroo Gang** – Thriving on market volatility, adherence to the principles of the Kang Gang means that you attempt to execute multi-legged options strategies. No matter which direction the underlying stock moves, you’ll still lose to the computers who do it better. Like a kangaroo, you’ll bounce right out of this gang when you fully realize that profits are capped and you’re too poor to give up gambling so young.\n\n\n4. **Sloth Gang** – If you hadn’t slept through market open, you might have made a really good play today. You’re sitting mostly in cash, because nothing is a sure thing. Often, you hover over the limit buy button until the price of the underlying moves up (and becomes too expensive) or down (that was probably the top). Even though you rarely ever make moves, you still hang around every day. \n\n\n5. **Tortoise Gang** – You invested your pension in a broad index of stocks fifty years ago. You never came close to paying the taxes that you’ve taken out in social security. You’ve been receiving deliveries of physical gold bullion for years to better weather the downturn that won’t come until after you’re dead. At least your offspring will provide liquidity in the options market for a time with their inheritance.\n\n\n6. **Housefly Gang** – Persistent, annoying, and attracted to whatever excrement the market dumps out, you breed freely in the corpses of Hertz, Ford, and JCP. You are numerous, but never alive for long.\n\n\n7. **Vampire Bat Gang** – Known commonly as Theta Gang outside of the taxonomic hierarchy, you gain from siphoning the profits of other gangs. Your toxic presence is a carrier for harmful options that infect bulls and bears alike. You are perfectly content to bide your time in the shadows, clinging to large outcroppings of capital. You might eventually sell naked and get turned into soup.\n\n\n8. **Opossum Gang** – Primarily nocturnal, you feed on futures and pre-market movements from Tokyo to Frankfurt. You’ll eventually end up run over and dead on the side of the road, which is an excellent indicator for other gangs to trade on.\n\n\n9. **White Rhino Gang** – Still technically alive but teetering on the brink of extinction, your account is down 99% all-time after getting blown up by a play on a Chinese stock nobody remembers. After the Reddit upvotes fade, you’ll still be there. Alone, and with no hope for the future.\n\n\n10. **Yang Gang** – All you ever wanted was the Coronavirus stimulus checks, but with fewer steps.\n\n[Source](https://reddit.com/r/thehedge)", "id": "h9ent6", "created_utc": 1592221273.0, "score": 2297, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 248, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 379, "replies": [{"body": "Sloth gang here, trading (and this place) is just a distraction from my boring office job and the realization that despite a really comfortable life, I'm existentially unsatisfied and generally empty inside\n\nUgh, maybe I should just get a girlfriend or something", "score": 166, "replies": [{"body": "Market can't kill you if you're already dead inside.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Most of us just need a hug at this point but covid-19 says otherwise.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can't kill me I was born dead.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B\\_SXZ4JdaE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B_SXZ4JdaE)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "I'm pretty entrenched in the Harley Davidson Lives Don't Matter gang\n\nThere's some boomer fuck that drives around my quaint neighborhood with a loud ass one", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "I hate Harleys so much, I once opened a naked short on HOG to vent.

As long as you have a stable job, and a consistent paycheck, it's all you need. If you need to build a quick paper trail, go to your nearest credit union and apply for a $10,000 loan. When they ask what for? Ask them you need a reliable car for work. Tell them you're looking for a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry, or Corolla. Tell them you need something cheap, affordable, and reliable. Aim for a 2 year, 3 year loan. You can obtain a 2010+ model in each of these models at 5K-10K, EASY. \n\nNow that you have your fucking Camry looking ass, it's time to move into your parents if you can, or is you already are, it's time to penny pinch your asschecks for the next year and a half (besides paying the car payment.)

Even tell them your looking to pick up a trade school course once you're settled to brush up on your education. Now you a 20-something (assuming), toyota camry driving, working 1 or 2 jobs, going back to school to further education looking ass, and they know (the credit union) just baited another customer for 30 years.\n\nUnlike college loans, they KNOW they can repose the house to reclaim equity they lent out. It's why it's so popular to mortgage as the bread and butter, besides cars (deprecated cars are fine, it's new car loans that fuck people over)\n\nNow, with your bankroll, you use that as \"collateral\" by showing them bank statements showing you've been saving money, and won't be late with your mortgage. \n\nHook, line, and sinker.

Rising sea levels are another thing and really not going to be a concern in our life time from \\~1900s-2016 the rose an estimate 6.3-8.3 inches and from 1993-2017 they rose 3 inches.

So even if I paid cash for a place like that the insurance and taxes would be almost 2/3 of my take home per year XD Where as a okish lake house in kentucky will run you like 250k, taxes will be a few thousand a year and insurance will be like 700 bucks a year. Florida is just to pricey on the coast line, but property search is public record so if you can find a cheap beach front property better than my example show me.
