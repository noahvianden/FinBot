{"title": "You Versus The Bots", "selftext": "#You Versus The Bots (Discussion)\n\nI'd like discuss the trading algorithms that we are trading against; I encourage anyone with thoughts on this to hash it out in the comments... the bots are winning, and they'll get better, so we need to think like humans and play our strengths. This is big: it's estimated that we humans are part of 10% of the active market volume, large holding groups do 40-60%... and the rest is the algorithms. \n\n.\n\nI'm going to be general; while I'm not a serious programmer, I've taken second in a black badge team contest at Defcon... so I'm not *the* shit, but I do know something. I've also had a few drinks because I felt it would help make this word wall more interesting. Anyone involved in these systems that can provide whatever information they can safely say without the bomb up their ass going off, we'd love to hear from you.\n\n.\n\nLet's talk about our slightly less autistic competition, the algorithms, their programmers, and the systems they run on. I've attended talks in the early 2000's about the black box systems, and then, it was all about speed... getting to a trade imbalance between two markets before the other guy. If your latency was over 20 ms, you weren't ever going to win. They were ripping out everything unnecessary, moving components as close to each other as possible, and (part of the talk) infinitely insecure. Apparently people would fuzz them and ask for a million dollars to stop, and they'd pay. If you guys that were doing that are still alive, great stuff... hope it worked out for you. But the point is, the competition trades infinitely faster than we can. By the time you see a great deal, they're on it. Reverse doji handstand with a McTwist, they're playing it. Scalping and averaging... you can fit so much scalping and averaging in these babies. So we're not faster than them, we can't be. \n\n#They also get the news faster...\n\nSince the 2000s, we've had a flash crash... suspected to have been caused by a hacked news outlet twitter account announcing a bomb blast in the white house and the president injured. And I'm sure you've seen many other sudden turns in the market that have been timed to news announcements in the market. Much like you can assume anyone that says \"kang gang\" hasn't finished their GED, you can assume these events are tied to key words scraped from the major news outlets twitter feeds or web sites. \n\n.\n\nAlgorithms will take these headlines, and assign a new value to all the stocks they play based on the news. It's not perfect, because computers like a simple cause, and a simple effect... \n\n| \"If SPY = 302.8, buy order 1000 shares, tick, querry SPY.\" \n\nGet more complicated, and the computer needs guidance... while *you* might be able to ballpark if a hot dog is too expensive and decide if you should buy it, an algorithm would have to querry all hot dog prices in the area, average them, and see if this one is in a certain range of average. It can't tell that the guy selling $200 hot dogs isn't legit, unless you secifically set a range to avoid robot hot dog price manipulation. So when a unique event happens (global pandemic), they can't respond immediately to the event unless they've been trained to look for those key words. \n\n.\n\nBased on the fact that something was looking for a white house terror attack and insta-sold, they've been pretty thorough in the key word lists. I would have to assume that these algorithms are tested against news headlines all the way back to the 1800s to see if they respond correctly to the market's movement. And the programmers are staying on top of things... watch for lock down news right now and watch these systems dive to a new price, probably inputted by a programmer in a nice office getting paid a lot of money. Although, maybe they're picking their own prices now, or at least will be in the future. One good point for us, the meat investors can use common sense, and respond to novel situations better, just not faster.\n\n#So, pseudo tin foil hat time. \n\nNeural nets are programs you make that you let randomly make choices and kill off the stupidest ones, and then repopulate (my apologies for the simplistic explanation to any neural net computer programmers with kill bots under development... but fuck the rest of you). As the smarter neural nets that \"bred\" keep trying, they make better and better choices, and if anyone is not developing a kill bot AI right now, they are probably lying about their research goals as they try to make a system that can predict the stock market. \n\n.\n\nThere is a ton of data out there, but there is also a very chaotic cause-effect relationship to the data and the market. Something that last week would have caused bull shambles can cause bear shambles tomorrow, or maybe even cause a theta to cock his hat with a jaunty aire. At some point (and I would love to be corrected if it has already happened), the trading systems will be able to look at an event, type it by class, and assign a new trading value to all its stocks and dive/climb to that number. I don't believe we're there... maybe in small subsets of the market, but they would have to be very niche. Part of the magic of the stock market is every stupid decision is made with the long tail of every other stupid decision that has been made up to this point. \n\n#They also appear to be learning off each other\n\nWhile direct collusion would be illegal, as the algorithms process stock data in the last 10 years, a lot of that is trading against other computers, either cooperatively or competitively. And as that data is parsed by all the systems, they will start to \"think\" the same ideas are good based on the market they're helping generate. I'm not saying that algorithms held 300 while one seemed to jump in early at 302 last week, but as they see the same data they cooperatively generate, they will start to act the same if the programming is similar.\n\n.\n\nI would predict we see more and more dampened harmonic behavior on an algorthimically generated target price in the future, but this is a blue sky prediction and I cannot base it on anything.\n\n#Emotions\n\nTrading algorithms: none.\n\nUs: Ever FOMO? Ever go \"oh my gawd everything is crashing my calls are worthless I'm going to sell everything and go eat from a dumpter in the rain!\" only to find everything clears up in 10 minutes (especially lately)? \n\n.\n\nThe counter to this is the fact we can say, \"would a trading algorithm sell right now,\" and clear our head, look at the data, and make good trades, which is much easier on our side than some poor fool with 8 research assistants and a huge budget trying to teach a robot how to tell \"the general traders are afraid\" and how long it will last. Your \"gut\" is a human supercomputation made with imperfect data to achieve the best answers. The sabretooth tigers ate the ones that figured things out the slowest, and then let the good brains repopulate. Unfortunately the brains got too smart and took out the tiger researchers. But I'm sure we're fine with AI.\n\n\n#So we r fuk or wat?\n\n\nWell, we probably will be hosed in the long term... anyway, here's Wonderwall. We do have a few advantages we need to be playing to out-perform the algorithms: \n\n* We can call out bullshit faster than they can. If you watched Pete Navarro say the China trade deal was off, you would have said the acting was worse than the Twilight movies (I'm very offended that I searched for \"stupid teenage vampire movie\" and it didn't come up first hit). It was clearly an act... but the algos read a headline that said \"~~About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a part of him-and I didn't know how potent~~ White House says China trade deal off.\" Okay Wrrrrrr (it's not a printer)... White + House + China + trade deal + off... SELL SELL SELL. If you'd seen Navarro freak out before his line, you would have been buying everything in sight, because you'd know it's a fake. We can win where the news is manufactured and fake on purpose.\n\n* We go outside. Their world is comprised of information scraped off news feeds. If you notice a trend everyone else isn't seeing... like a product showing up everywhere, *especially without a lot of press about it*, you have a leg up on the robots. \n\n* They still make a lot of mistakes. In areas that are relatively new, they have trouble finding good valuations. In areas where the past data *similar* to the event is no longer relevant, they get really lost. Think like an algorithm. Okay, cure for coronavirus... I'm going to pull up data on all companies that have created virus vaccines and model their performance to current companies. I'm going to model the AIDS vaccine work because Faucci was involved. Some of that will be relevant and some won't. They're getting better, but for now we can make loose associations better than they can.\n\n#But\n\n* They are faster at trades when they are right.\n\n* They have a lot of volume they can trade.\n\n#And here's a but not directly related to algorithms\n\n* Bad news is now released at night, good news is released during the morning. This means the algorithms will be having their sharp negative swings when most of us can't trade, but will respond to good news during the day. There also appears to be a decay on the value of a key word, so if it doesn't keep showing up, it effects the target stock price less. This means you say everything bad in the world on Friday at 8pm EST, and by Monday 9:30am the electronic slate is clean.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWell, thank you for coming to my TED talk. Please discuss. \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**Super tl;dr PCG 100c 7/4**", "id": "hfzsev", "created_utc": 1593140458.0, "score": 332, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 186, "comments": [{"body": "Another CS major here, focused on AI.

The opportunity for alpha there is not deep enough for their level of capital. Most quants trade on a slower timeframe (still rapid for humans) and attempt to anticipate correlations in time for the market to absorb them.\n\nYou see, they don't just care about finding alpha systematically. As the amount of money you trade increases, you need to venture into beta territory. Look up risk parity, smart beta, factor investing, etc. All different flavors of alpha + beta. Part of the challenge becomes optimizing your risk within a sliding scale of idiosyncratic profit making opportunities, each with different risk/return profiles. \n\nThese guys are on a whole other level from what you can even imagine. \n\nThey don't just tinker with \"a model\" and feed it webscrapes.

Wuhan is under quarantine for 3 weeks. Apple, as the first big company, announces that it won't meet revenue guidance, because of supply chain disruptions. Market still reaches ATHs.

They want to do this for a few reasons. 1.) They want to make trades on both sides of the book so that they can capture the spread. If they’re at the top of the book, they get the taking. 2.) They want to avoid getting picked off. When the market is volatile, the swings in underlying price cause quotes to slide in either direction rather quickly. If you’re slow, your bids/asks at the top of the book becomes stale. This results in either A.) getting fills at a bad price because the market moved in an unfavorable direction (e.g. quoting at 1/1.05, market moves to .95/1 and your bid gets hit, now you’ve over paid) or B.) the market moves in a more favorable direction, however now you aren’t at the top of the book, so you won’t be generating fills.)\n\nAlso, if you’re quoting and accumulating delta, you want to hedge that delta by trading the underlying to achieve a position delta of 0 (generally speaking). If one used the underlying price as one of the variables in the equation of calculating a fair price, then it makes sense that speed is relevant to hedge your position when reacting to your quote-fills.\n\nI have almost no idea about other algorithms such as those parsing news, but my guess is that while they still probably want to be fast to capture good prices, they won’t complain about nanosecond latency issues.

That just confuses the issue.\n\n> one third of Americans are at a high risk of death\n\nNo, the article you linked states high risk of \"serious illness\", not death. So again, Fearmongering and not true. You're framing the issue in a way for maximum possible fear, uncertainty and doubt. \n\nThe death rate is clear at this point; 0.8% to maybe 3% (max) overall for those under 65. With over 100k dead the facts are incontrovertible. Sure, some groups are at more risk than others, that's obvious, but overall the risk of dying IS 0.8% to 3% TOPS for those under 65. So if you have HIV, asthma or diabetes obviously your risk is higher so stay home and wear masks etc.\n\nbtw the data on the worldometer page I linked is cited as WHO and CDC. So, it's valid. \n\nAnd I realize Anecdotes aren't data but I know a dozen people personally who've tested positive and most had no illness at all.

When I say high risk of mortality or death, it is relative. We have an overall mortality rate in this country of 7.5 deaths per 1000 people per year.

This just means that of that 1000 people that are infected, the 7 deaths will most likely be in the 1/3rd of people at higher risk.  I didnt say that the data was incorrect. I said that you are.

If your risk was up to .8 to 3% of dying from this as a healthy person under the age of 65, it would be apocolyptically devastating.  We'd be talking somewhere in the range of 10 to 30 million deaths if that were true. Right now we are looking at around 1-2million over the next year or so with a large portion of that in the fall to winter this year.  Your overall risk is likely 10 times less than that. They are using confirmed positive cases and looking at the case mortality rate here. There are likely 10fold more infections than there are confirmed positive cases. Weve known this since the beginning, and thats where we got the .5% to 1% fatality rate from when our case fatality rate was ~5%. \n>\n>So, without covid, we normally experience about 8000 deaths a day in the USA.
