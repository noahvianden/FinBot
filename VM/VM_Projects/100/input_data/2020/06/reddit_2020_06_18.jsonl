{"title": "Bet it ALL on BEAR!!! A true DD story - SPY GAME IS RIGGED", "selftext": "Get your tin foil hat because we got a story for you...\n\nSo basically back in 5/22 I thought SPY would break 280 and start dropping but the head of the Discord channel I was on bet me it would rebound and rise up to 300. We both took opposite positions and I lost out.\n\nAfter that I formed a DD group with all the other traders who also thought the market was gonna crash and one of us mentioned a trader who came up with an Algo that basically predicts the S&P futures each time. It made 4k to 408k.\n\nSo here's basically the idea. Markets are rigged by market makers. What makes a movie a good movie? A plot twist. The Directors are the Market makers.  Each episode has a false open and then a true direction in the opposite way. Here's an example:\n\n[The Algo to rule All Algos](https://preview.redd.it/pdm8ze8iak551.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df5156ebc50753796747b438e17b0bf248212f6)\n\nSo basically after a consolidation (Blue) there is a episode, starting with a false open (Red) and then a in the case it gets over-extended (Yellow) or near it and starts reversing buy the call / future. Then it goes into the (Green) where the episode plays out exactly the same size as the \"intermission\" (Blue). The Cliffhanger (Purple)\n\nSometimes it's unclear and you need to sit on your hands to while the intermission happens:\n\n[Happened today 6\\/16-6\\/17](https://preview.redd.it/hnpg87xdck551.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=04eef1d978d979ad426f74d2e02c42bbf502a672)\n\nAnd it found a direction\n\n[Down is the Future](https://preview.redd.it/u39p3dnkck551.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60298f8c132006aa1e2de58a545bc912dc5192d)\n\nBut all this is a \"FALSE\" pattern built by the Feds (JPOW) QE and followed buy most of the Kangaroos, and in the speeches today (testifying to the House and Senate) he mentioned switching from ETFs and bypassing the markets all together to buying Corporate Junk Bonds.\n\n[Here's a possible plan for tomorrow.](https://preview.redd.it/85wqf9r8dk551.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d6f1e00147176d0368b1d3b63017456c48fbd8)\n\nWe are ready for a serious crash coming soon. We're getting off the QE benefits. Bears get your puts! Bulls go for the VIXes! Kangaroos, pick a side.

{"title": "Pfizer call will get your PP harder than viagra", "selftext": "TLDR - PFE 35c 7/17 for the r/investing crowd and PFE 38-39c 7/17 for the true WSB autist\n\nI know many of you have a bad taste in their mouth when they hear the name ‚ÄúPfizer‚Äù, but all of that is about to change.  You see, Pfizer will be releasing data on their coronavirus vaccine within the very near future, and as we all know, stocks with COVID treatments skyrocket on even the slightest hint of good news.  Look at GILD, MRNA and NVAX.  You might say that Pfizer is bigger than all three of them so will have less volatility and you would be correct, but GILD has a 93B market cap, so while PFE is twice as big at 187B, if inconclusive data on GILD can send it up 10% plus, think about what positive data on a coronavirus vaccine that will actually hit the public in September will do.  \n\nThe best part about this is that PFE options are pricing in extremely low volatility, so they aren‚Äôt even expecting much of a move which is quite surprising given how the market has reacted to coronavirus treatment news in the past.  This means that instead of IV crush, there will be an IV spike if PFE takes off after the data is released.  So not only will you make money from the stock price increasing, you will also be making money from IV as well.  Money + money = TENDIES.  \n\nLooking from a technicals standpoint, the play becomes even better.  After a pretty poor performance over the last few weeks dropping PFE from over $38 on 5/29 to now $33.70 at the time of this post, the RSI has fallen quite a bit down to 35. Momentum now seems to be shifting upwards, and positive coronavirus data might be just the play to send it soaring as there is a ton of room to run before RSI gets even close to overbought.\n\nNow you may be thinking that this sounds nice and all, but what if the data is bad.  Well let me put your mind at ease. It won‚Äôt be. They are testing four different vaccines in the largest vaccine trial to-date involving the 18-80 age group and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China).  Pfizer is so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates ahead of results.\n\nAnd no one should forget that the second data is released, Donny Pump will be all over this.  Tweets will say that a cure is almost here thanks to Pfizer, and boomers will pile into PFE stock for that juicy dividend and retail millennials will fomo into it because Pfizer will become the next hyped up corona play.\n\nTo add icing on this cake, did I mention that Pfizer‚Äôs new diabetes drug was just discovered to make people lose over 17 pounds, improves blood sugar tremendously, and will be an oral agent to replace existing injectable options within the class? Every diabetic man, woman, and child is going to be asking to be on this weight-loss drug (typical diabetes drugs cause weight gain). They are about to announce this information today at 11:30 EST in a conference call with analysts to review data presentations at the American Diabetes Association held on June 12-16, 2020 on their oral small molecule GLP-1R agonist (PF-06882961).\n\nThe market has not reacted to this yet, as there have been no articles by any major news sources on the data, nor has the stock price reacted at all. Pfizer not only has the COVID vaccine going for them, but also extremely promising data for their diabetes drug. The momentum from these upcoming headlines should push PFE back to a normal valuation; it is currently selling at a discount lower than any price in 2019 and has recently been oversold from May valuations. \n\nPositions:  I have $38 and $39 PFE calls, as I believe at the current price they have huge potential to be at least a 10 bagger at minimum if not more and I picked 7/17 as the expiration date because of the liquidity and because of the IV spike that will accompany positive data next week.", "id": "hbe7qf", "created_utc": 1592485508.0, "score": 252, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 267, "comments": [{"body": "Nice! 07/17 38,39 calls are cheap af.
