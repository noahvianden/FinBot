It's feasible- have to show this is a real possibility and not fantasy through real world numbers and illustration. Detail the rolling of entitlement programs minus WIC coupled with an option of: defense budget reduction; marginal tax rate increase; closing of corporate tax loopholes such as paying money to off shore subsidiaries in Ireland to eliminate domestic profit; and promotion of efficiency in government procurement. Have it paid to citizens 18 or over. Marginal tax rate used to be 90% now mid 30s should be increased. Economies of scale which are gained by not having 10 different administrations from different agencies managing different entitlement programs - can cut down on bureaucratic costs and have that in one agency. Think of all the social security disability claims and judges and snap program including enforcement and stuflike housing allowances etc from hud social security etc and on and on.\n\nII. Why it's needed. Talk about the errosion of the middle class and student loan debt availability leading to salaried slavery. Talk about how corporations contribution to the tax revenue in the United States has declined as the contribution of middle class has risen - this exacerbates the rich poor divide. Talk about how as America has generated record amounts of wealth it has been concentrated in the hands of the few. This is unsustainable and the many have the capacity to ensure that the baseline of society is provided for.\n\nIII. It's beneficial - How UBI fixes the issues identified in II - outline the ways in which UBI resolves systemic socioeconomic disequality through empowering people and freeing them from the wage slavery so they can more better actualize their existence. Helps boost the economy from having the lowest wealth people now spend the money they receive so that creates the exponential benefit of having extra money circulate in the economy instead of having it aggregated by the ultrawealthy few. Future proofs economy so we don't have to worry about segments of the population being made obsolete through technological advancement.\n\nIV. Why the Rich would want it. Prevents large scale socioeconomic distress. Greed knows no bounds. Actually will increase the economy which will ultimately make up on the back end what they lose upfront in corporation share value declines and marginal tax rate increases. Creates a stable American economy which will again provide long term benefits as our nation returns to preminance in the global economy. Basic humanism and the fact that anyone could have been in a different situation through the circumstances of their birth and that should not restrict them from the full enjoyment of their life. Will reduce crime as now the for profit motive of some crimes is ameliorated by the widespread distribution of UBI.\n\nV.

Prior to bankruptcy, the vehicles had to be worth at least that much for equity to have a chance of being worth anything. That's because HTZ is required to pay cash into these ABS facilities to make up any shortfalls, either when the used car is sold or based on current used car values. The latter method triggered a clause where HTZ would have to infuse more cash in May than they even had in total, which is why they filed bankruptcy. You can look at the Manheim Used Vehicle Value index to get a sense of what might happen from here for these investors. May's value and the shortage of new vehicles from OEMs materially increases the probability vs. even a week ago that these people will be made whole. \n\n2) There is about $6B of other debt and probably about $900M of cash today, burning maybe $100/month. Because HTZ filed bankruptcy, all of these people are owed their money IMMEDIATELY (other than about $800M of European debtholders who agreed to waive until 9/30). On average, these people think they'll only get \\~55% of what's owed to them. That's up from about \\~35% when HTZ filed bankruptcy on 5/22 - this is clearly because of the general economic rebound showing up in most data sets. There is certainly some value across the business: the Hertz brand has value, they have some valuable airport concessions, they have a profitable fleet management company called Donlen that has some obvious strategic buyers, they have not-insignificant tax shields from NOLs, they own some buildings and desks and things like that, etc. All of that value belongs to these people. \n\n3) Lastly, any remaining value will accrue to equity holders. This happening is extremely unlikely, but anyone who owns shares today is currently betting that there will be at least $365M of that excess value on top of the \\~$2.7B that debtholders do NOT believe they'll get. Said otherwise, these people are explicitly betting that debtholders are wrong by \\~100%.

It is against the FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION RULES (laws regarding car rental facilities, and other businesses, but a specific clause is dedicated to rental car companies because they so egregiously take advantage of unsuspecting customers by claiming a reserved vehicle is unavailable in an effort to get more of your hard earned money by upcharging for a different class of vehicle).THIS IS ILLEGAL AND CALLED BATE & SWITCH FRAUD! If the reserved or promised vehicle class is unavailable then the rental car company - no matter what one in the United States is required to upgrade you to the next available vehicle class at no additional charge, PERIOD. If they refuse to do so contact the FTC AND your state Attorney Generals office to file a complaint. If you do not file a complaint to the appropriate regulatory authority then they do not have a record of it and in turn are unable to see the patterns being used by these companies to levy appropriately deserved fine and fee‚Äôs including but not limited to the loss of business licenses, closure of businesses and arrest of company representatives illegally lining their pockets with your hard earned money. I too fell for the lies on websites like this but HERTZ has been so outrageous in my scenario that I continued my search to find the Lakewood Ohio Uber rental location, corporately owned and operated, illegally allowed me to reserve a vehicle they knew was not available, verified said vehicle and costs less than an hour before my appointment then Bate & Switched me to an upgraded vehicle I could neither afford nor did i want but was forced into taking because of necessity. I have the staff recorded 3 weeks into the rental period admitting they had a waitlist that had people ahead of me proving they‚Äôre not only liars but also that they are knowingly committing fraud. This is also against Hertz corporate policies which is why I verified it is a corporately owned branch during my process and the video recordings, already provided to my attorneys office and investigative news teams locally and nationally, to substantiate my claims. They do this to Uber drivers at this location to the tune of thousands of dollars each month and even after being called out locally and corporately Hertz continues to allow people to book unavailable cars and charge for them for an upgrade when, to no one‚Äôs suprise, the vehicle is unavailable the day of the reservation. My story will be on the news and I plan on suing as well because of the hell Hertz CONTINUES (3mos) to put me through.  I video recorded every communication with the local rental office, corporate customer service, security guard (yes, they even tried lying to their own security - unsuccessfully I might add because my interactions are recorded with gps records to boot - in an effort to once again file false charges against their customers or in this case to ‚Äúshut up the whistleblower‚Äù) Hey Hertz - told you I was going public and this is just the start. Once the complaints start rolling in to the FTC and state Attorney Generals offices I genuinely hope the fines and lawsuits from those who have been scammed put you out of business permanently and lead to a change in rental car company procedures across the country. I can‚Äôt think of a better corporation to make an example out of than yours since even after being informed of this behavior (verifiably) you continue to allow it to proceed and instead try to intimidate the customer by having your customer service representatives and  corporate security threaten them with legal action while providing no cause for said threats, in hopes of shutting them up.
