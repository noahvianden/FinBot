That's why so many companies are ramping the hell out of batteries and we've seen like a 10x growth in battery production capacity over the last 4 years.

{"title": "My misery can now be your gain - Quick tips from my options trading", "selftext": "Hi Fellow Autists,\n\nI've been trading options (badly) for a few months now and figured I'd put down some of the things I've learned. I've lost a lot of damn money because I didn't know enough but now I've managed to find some stuff that have helped me stop losing money. \n\n* **Indicators** \\- I thought I could just fly the market by my \"gut\" feelings and win. This... is... BULLSHIT. Math is > than your stupid feelings / gut. Get over yourself and your feelings and start using the math that has decades of work behind it. They've already done all the hard work you just have to turn them on and learn what they mean. The biggest indicators I've found that help me are: \n\n**MACD** \\- This is your best damn friend on determining Up / Down swings in a stock. Use this across different charts (1 min, 5 min, 10 min etc) to see which direction a stock is moving. See more here: [https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical\\_indicators:moving\\_average\\_convergence\\_divergence\\_macd](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd)\n\n**tl;dr** \\- If the 2 lines cross that means the stock is shifting direction in the time interval you have selected. (Do NOT just depend on the 1 min chart unless you're day trading)\n\n**Bollinger Bands -** This will overlay a \"blob\" over your chart that shows a moving \"Resistance / Support\" window for the stock. If a candle on the chart pops out of the bubble in a direction that may indicate the stock will move in that direction. There are a number of different known \"patterns\" for the BB that you can watch for that can signal a specific shift in the stock. See more here:\n\n[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical\\_indicators:bollinger\\_bands](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:bollinger_bands)\n\nQuick BB Patterns chart - [https://i.redd.it/u7pxhg28lszy.png](https://i.redd.it/u7pxhg28lszy.png)\n\n**RSI** \\- Here if a stock is \\~70 and the end of the chart is pointing down the stock should start heading down. If it is at \\~30 and the end of the chart starts pointing up the stock should start heading up. \n\nUse all of these together to help determine up / down trends \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **200%+ Gainz GTFO -** I know this is going to be a hard one for most of the people on this board and you may be able to get more out of something if you are using the aforementioned indicators above and do not see an upswing / downswing in any of them. In any other case or a change in direction is indicated **GET THE FUCK OUT NOW YOU DUMB ASS SELL SELL SELLLLLLL.** There have been a number of times where I was up 250% on an option and didn't sell because \"THERE IS MORE TO GO\". There is (usually) only so far up / down a stock price can go in a day. So if you get to those kinds of gains either sell part of your lot to lock in some of the gains or sell them all. No matter what FUCKING SELL SOME OF THEM so when the rest crashes into the dirt you can at least buy yourself some tissues with the profits you made selling 1 of your 100 (now worthless) options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DO NOT FIGHT THE TREND -** This was another really difficult item for me as (mentally) I've been a hardcore 🌈 🐻since the whole virus thing started. Why? Because it makes sense, logically speaking since the whole country is seemingly burning down around us, but as we all know with JPOW and his damn printer the market makes **NO FUCKING SENSE.** The sooner you learn this the sooner you'll start making money and stop cursing the shitty FED and their shitty money printer. If the market is moving in a direction **GO WITH IT**. Use the indicators above to help determine direction. If you keep fighting in the opposite direction you're just going to get broke. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **HEDGE YOUR BETS -** I think this is definitely the hardest for most folks on here to grasp but you should learn it and learn it well as this is the best way to save your ass from massive losses. This involves different options strategies like Spreads (Verticals), Condors etc. If you are selling options you **NEED** a **credit spread** to protect yourself from huge jumps in the wrong direction. (Once again fuck you TWLO) If you are buying options you can do a **debit spread** to lower the cost of the options you are buying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DO NOT BREAK Credit Spreads / Verticals -** This is where I learned shit the hard way. If you are doing credit spreads DO NOT EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER (Did I mention ever?) BREAK THE FUCKING SPREAD. I don't give a shit what kind of voodoo magic bullshit you have conjured up in your head to give you a reason to sell one leg of the spread DO NOT FUCKING DO IT. The second half of a credit spread is there to protect you from miserable shitty soul ending losses. It also limits the margin requirements needed to sell / buy the spread. So if you break the spread you open yourself up to massive losses and instantly much higher margin requirements.\n\n**tl;dr** \\- DO NOT FUCKING BREAK THE SPREAD!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Avoid buying options on Friday -** This mainly depends on the expiration date of the options you are buying but this is WSB so no one is buying long dated options right? You have two days to lose option value. No matter what you have 2 days of no trading where your option price will decay. Two days for bad / good news to impact your option prices. This can be good or bad, but still adds a large window to lose money if it swings the opposite direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Daytrading** \\- If you still have your 3 free day trades or are lucky enough to be flagged as a PDT (Pattern Day Trader) I have found that the most volatility in a stock occurs in the first few hours of open. What I mean by this is that the stock should have it's highest swing high or low within those few hours. In other words, if you buy in, in the direction the stock is going at open you should get out within those first few hours as that is where you will make the most money and have the lowest chance of loss. The rest of the day doesn't seem to move nearly as much (albeit with some variations due to big news alerts etc).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Prices only move so much up / down in a day** \\- This links up (more) with DayTrading but still applies to everything else. Like most of the people in WSB I started off super fucking greedy and kept expecting my option buys to shoot to the moon for 100001234123% gainz. This of course never materialized because this is the real fucking world where that doesn't happen every day on every stock. Generally speaking this applies 99.9999% of the time. The only time this doesn't apply is when soul crushing news happens that murders a stocks price or sends it to the moon (Fuck you TWLO, you know what you did). So if you made a shit load on an option sell that shit!.\n\n**tl;dr** \\- Price only moves so much in a day, get gains GTFO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Fed Repo Schedule -** One last item that I found recently is the Repo schedule for the Fed. Whatever you do, do not be a 🌈 🐻 on the week when the fed has a double repo (Overnight and daytime repo). I've gotten hit in the nuts two different times because I didn't know the schedule. The next schedule releases on 7/13. So once it goes live you'll know what days / weeks to avoid.
