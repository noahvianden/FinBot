{"title": "Principles for Trading", "selftext": "Instead of my regular weekly DDDD (Data-Driven DD), this week I'll be going over principles to follow when trading. Principles is how you make sure that you trade based on logic instead of emotions, and prevent yourself from entering stupid positions that you'll regret later on when your portfolio drops 69% in a week. Developing your own principles, based on your own risk tolerance and preferences, and the being disciplined in following them, is the most important thing to ensure you learn from your mistakes and become a better trader to come out profitable in the future. Here are some of the principles I've personally developed over the past few years that I try to follow.\n\n* Don’t YOLO (i.e. long options) with more money than you can afford to lose. Imagine going to an actual casino with the same amount of cash - would you be comfortable betting that much money? If the answer is no, don’t do it.\n* For short term plays, always come in with a thesis, which should contain\n   * A target price\n   * Stop loss price to start exiting strategies\n   * Justification for the thesis using fundamentals\n* Don’t neglect your exit strategy, both for when you’re right to take profits, and when you’re wrong to stop losses. In both cases, define price levels where you will sell a certain portion of your positions if it hits it and commit to it\n* You should only enter trades when the reward (i.e. target price) is significantly higher than your stop loss. In other words, the potential reward should be much greater than the max loss, especially for risky trades. If the potential reward is 5x the max loss, you only need to be right 20% of the time to come out ahead.\n* Time your entries and exits using price levels and technicals; buy at supports and sell at resistances.\n* A market can be irrational longer than you can remain solvent; If there’s some obvious price dislocation, obvious arbitrage opportunity, or a stock (eg. HTZ, NKLA) where the fundamentals clearly do not meet the current price, don’t try to take advantage of it. In the short term, the only thing that drives stock prices is sentiment and not fundamentals.\n* Avoid illiquid securities. They typically lead to large bid-ask spreads, which will significantly impact your risk / reward, and can also make it very difficult to exit your strategy, especially when you’re trying to stop losses.\n* Consider the meme factor of a stock. Just because fundamentals and a company will beat earnings, it doesn’t necessarily mean the stock price will shoot up, especially if the stock is unknown and held mostly by insiders and institutions. On the flip side, stocks that are well known and are actively traded by retail investors will find every reason to skyrocket in bull markets, even if fundamentals do not make sense for it to do so.\n* Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. Use market sentiment, especially with retail investors as a contrarian indicator, with extreme fear or greed as a sign of a reversal. On the other hand, you never want to short a bubble before it’s clear that it has started to pop.\n\nComment below on any principles not mentioned here that you personally follow!\n\nAlso, for people who are curious, I'll be posting comments on this post throughout the week my own thoughts on the short-term direction of the stock market and trades that I'll be making.", "id": "hdeavg", "created_utc": 1592772772.0, "score": 401, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "The most valuable purchasing advice  I ever got was for real estate, but it matches stocks and options perfectly.\n\nYou're never buying the return, you're buying the underlying assumptions.\n\nIf you go long right now, you're not buying a 10% return to SPY 333, you're buying either JPOW prints or FOMO or TA.
