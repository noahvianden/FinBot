I could buy 1 share, and if the stock goes up by 10% I've made $10.\n\nIf I want to increase my leverage though, I could buy a call option for $100 with a strike of $105 (it lets me buy 100 shares of the stock for 105). Now if the stock goes up to $110, I still have the right to buy it for $105, so I can ask my broker to exercise (buy those 100 shares) at 105, and then sell them at 110, and get $500, which minus my initial $100 cost for the call, means I end up with a 400% profit.\n\nThe problem here is, if the stock doesn't go above 105 by the time the call expires, it's worthless, and that $100 I spent disappears, while if I'd bought that 1 share, I might have something worth $104.\n\nOn the opposite side, you can buy a \"put\" which gives you the right to sell 100 shares at a given strike price, so if the stock goes below that mark, you can buy them at market price, and then sell them for more than they're worth\n\nNow that's a very simple explanation, and the value of the option contract itself changes with the price of the underlying stock, which is what people here on /r/wallstreetbets are counting on. Most of us buy the contract with the intention of selling it when the price goes up, with no intention of actually exercising the right to buy those shares.\n\nIf you want to try \"investing\" with them, make sure you do enough research to understand them.

So you saying you want to buy them with the idea they will go up. It allows you to get the value of the stock when it goes up but without the cost of the actual stock or the value of the stock. You get the difference between the 2 values. So for me right now. An example would be Carnival which I got 3k off of today. Instead of having bought the 512 shares at 9300 I could have done these options? For cheaper, and then get the difference between the values if it goes up. If it goes down though you lose only what you put up though. Cant take away more than what you put up? Hm. So how do you do this on robin hood? I'm wondering if I should do this with Carnival. They have been doing fantastic. Got a coworker who put in when they were 12.74 and hes doing great just stock wise. Also your selling the option you say?

With shares, if you guess wrong you have a chance to recover if you keep holding. With options, it's true you can only lose what you put in, but there's no holding till it recovers once you reach expiration. And options have a value \"Theta\" which is the time value, so given absolutely no movement of the stock, they automatically decay in value over time.\n\nGiven that you are holding shares, you should at least try selling some covered calls. Watch that video I linked in the last comment for the benefits of it. It's let's you make extra money with shares you own.\n\nIf you want to do Carnival, which I think is a totally decent play, buy options with dates far out.

Generally at expiration, if your option is \"In the Money\"(for a call, if the strike is below the current stock price) then your broker will exercise it for you, and give you the profit. Because options have an extrinsic \"Time value\" (theta), it's often worth selling them before expiration.\n\nLooking at the current options prices.\n\nCCL is at 22.39\n\nA 21 strike call expiring 6/12 costs $1.73 (this is per share, in units of 100, so it really costs $173)\n\nSo if you were to buy that, then exercise it immediately, your cost would be $22.73 per share, which is higher than the current market price. You're paying a premium for the right to buy those shares, so you're hoping that the price rises above what it's currently at, if it stays the same, you'll be losing money.\n\nWhat most people here do, is buy that call, or a higher up one(anything above the current price is \"Out of the Money\" OTM, which means it will be worthless at expiration if the stock stays below it). Then they wait for the stock to go up, and then sell the option itself.\n\nI mentioned the greeks before.

For that 21 strike CCL call, Delta is .59 right now(they change)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks. Ok. So it adds the cost of the options contract to the strike price. So even though it (strike) is below the current cost. Once you add the Contract price ÷ 100 to the shares it not actually lower than the current price.  So the lower the strike price in general the easier it is to go above the break even range. Thus the lower return %. I still dont understand the percentages though since some say 600% some say 23% but if the stock value goes up 1$ it's still 1$ x 100 shares = 100$? So I dont see how the percentages play into it. Unless theres some sort of.. multiplier? That the higher risk/higher % means that the 1 dollar increase is increased by let's say 200% for a 2 dollar reward per 1 dollar increase in the stock?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah so options have a value called delta (one of the greeks), which is how much the option price increases for every $1 move the stock makes. The further ITM, the closer to 1 delta is, but the less the increase is proportionally.\n\nFar OTM options have a low delta, but the have a low value already, so any big move in the stock means huge proportional moves for them.\n\nWhile we're talking about delta, the other 2 really important greeks are Theta, and Vega.\n\nTheta is time decay, for every 24hours, the option price decreases by theta. And theta gets bigger the closer the option gets to expiration, look at theta when buying an option because you can see how much the stock has to move for delta to offset theta decay.\n\nVega is the measure of volatility value. You can see when looking at an option what the Implied Volitility(IV) is. IV is a measure of how much the stock could potentially move. So after huge jumps, such as today, IV is really high. You multiply vega by the change in value in IV to see how an option's price will change. IV gets high around events like earnings, where the stock could make a big move. Buying options right before earnings is dangerous because even if you guess the direction of the stock correctly, IV drops once the earnings are revealed, and the options loses value. So the change in stock price has to be large enough for delta to offset vega. It's known as IV crush.\n\nSo with CCL 22.5c 6/12 as an example again. IV is at 121% right now and vega is .01\n\nSo if IV were to drop to a normalish level (which for these times is probably something like 50%) that would be a 70% drop in IV, *.01 = $.7 lost on the value from IV crush alone. Of course it can work for you too, and if IV increases, the value of the option goes up.

The problem with the second approach is that few people will willingly risk their health to get infected and (hopefully) tough it through to acquire immunity.\n\nNow a huge number of young people are going out and unwittingly infect each other. Some of them may die, but the vast majority will recover and form the bulk of the required “herd”. Even if the herd is not big enough to control the pandemic, the convalescent plasma from the numerous recovered people will drastically decrease the mortality rate. In fact, the decreasing mortality rate we have seen is at least partially due to the increased availability of convalescent plasma.\n\nUnlike Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir, the effectiveness of plasma therapy is pretty clear cut with 76% of the patients showed improvements in clinical trials.\n\nhttps://news.utexas.edu/2020/06/02/covid-19-convalescent-plasma-therapy-is-safe-with-76-of-patients-improving/\n\nWe may see an uptick, but I think the outcome from this turn of events may actually be better.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Herd immunity and vaccine are literally the same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSPY6969", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for the well researched response.

People will rightfully blame the protests for causing it, and the backlash will fall on the left.\n\n2. Universities won’t have in-person instructions in the fall, which means the left-leaning students won’t be concentrated in college towns in the swing states. Many of them won’t even have time to change their voter registrations. Without this concentration, Dems will lose many Congressional seats and almost certainly lose Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota. They will likely lose Virginia, Michigan and even Colorado. We are already seeing this in Dem primaries, progressives are losing due to the missing student votes.\n\nSo from a political point of view, a second shutdown is highly unlikely. \n\nWith that said, I do believe a correction will take place in the near future. However, I don’t think it’s going to be more than 10%. Likely Dow will go back to 24K for a brief period of time before going up again.
