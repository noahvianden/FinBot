Plz. \nBut really, that's awesome. I'm working on improving mine; it's been steadily improving but it's still not where I'd like it to be.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "quick tips that help me with both budgeting and can help build credit.\n\n1. Set an alert when you pass X amount on your card. This isn't just to control spending but let's you know where you are at. Mine is at $200 and I get an alert about the same time every month. I buy everything on my card (gas, groceries, phone bill, etc). If I get that alert a little bit early it lets me know I've been spending a bit faster than normal.\n\n2. Go through your credit card statement online or paper and look at everything you are spending money on. Why? Because you are probably wasting a lot of money on stuff you don't really want. I have surprised myself a number of times think how did I spend X amount!? Oh yeah I spent $20 here, $35 here, etc. It all adds up.\n\n3. Figure out what you really want to buy! This is two things, firstly see #2 and stop buying stuff you don't actually want. Under $10 purchases don't feel like much but they add up fast! AND When you want something, don't buy it. **Even if you know you really really want it don't buy it!** This helps with your impulse control which will save you tons of money. \n\n3. continued: What I like to do is keep an Amazon wishlist and add stuff to it that I want. I then wait generally about two weeks and 90% of the time I don't really want it any more. I don't like having a lot of stuff, and don't understand how people just accumulate so much but waiting to purchase things can help you separate what you really want, and what you want in the moment.\n\n4. Spoil yourself with some of the money you saved. Nothing makes good habits like positive reinforcement. Once you have gotten your spending under control and hopefully realized what you actually want go and buy it with some of the money you have saved (so long as it is still in budget).\n\nI bought $1,500 road bike 4 years ago, I just built a $1,000 computer, and six months ago I got a $350 drawing tablet. That's so much money! (if you are broke like me) But by controlling my spending and stopping all my dumb purchases I saved up a ton of money and even after buying that stuff (not all at once, those are big non-typical spending). I saved up about 9k as a public teacher in NYC paying 1k a month in rent an 7k in grad school tuition. \n\nThese purchases don't have to be things, but vacations, expensive restaurants, or anything that you usually would think is a silly waste of money. The key is to control yourself so that you can get what you actually want, and not what your stupid monkey brain wants right now.\n\nI believe all the above applies no matter how much money you make. Stop wasting your money on dumb junk that you don't really want and invest in yourself.\n\nSECOND: Your credit card is not free money and you should never spend more than what you have in your bank account. Always pay off in full. Yes that advice **sucks** but hey life is hard. I lost 20 lbs once because I couldn't afford a lot of food so I literally ate potatoes, carrots and other cheap root vegetables for three months in Belgium. 10lbs of potatoes is really dang cheap and a lot of good food.\n\nLastly: All the above is also true about your TIME. Take a week and keep a little journal writing down everything you do. You probably waste a lot of time on things that you don't really care about doing. Write down a list of things you actually want to do. Spend your time and money doing want you actually want to do.\n\n**TLDR**: Keep track of what you spend, find out what you actually want. Don't buy it because you probably don't want it. Now buy the few nice things you have actually been wanting for the last two months. Delay the instant gratification and do what you actually want to do and not want your body thinks it wants right now. It's often quite wrong.\n\nedit - TLDR part 2: After all, you're going to need that saved money to buy puts so you can loose it all fighting the FED.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "20 lbs is 9.08 kg", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sir, this is a debit card line", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hey, I just wanted to say thank you for this excellent comment.

Early pricing discussions on the deal had been in the 12% area.*\n\n*The sales process closed at 3:45 p.m. in New York.* ***The deal was originally expected to be about $1.5 billion in size but was increased to $2 billion after*** ***canceling a leveraged loan sale******.***\n\nFor the uninitiated leveraged loans are typically bought by smart money only and is not available to qualified buyers. They likely cancelled the loan sale because smart money was not interested at all and if they are, they were probably looking for an even higher spread. Instead they opted to go all bond market because it is rife with \"relatively dumb money\" yield chasers like pensions, insurance companies etc. The other issue with leveraged loans is that they take a long time to settle. So whoever wants to buy it will have to hold it for a long time before it even settles. Bonds on the other hand are easier to flip. A hedge fund can subscribe to the bond and flip it after issuance to someone willing to hold that risk.\n\nBut wait theres more...\n\n*Proceeds from the bond offering will* ***refinance a $1 billion 364-day term loan the company raised from banks*** *in March, and bolster liquidity. The debt is part of a larger financing package that also raised about $1 billion in a share sale and $1 billion in new convertible bonds, both of which were increased from planned offerings of $750 million each.*\n\nThe banks know they are in trouble. They are insiders.
