And technically, as it may have come from printed money, eating that loss would essentially be a net of zero for the Fed (it's actually a loss according to their balance sheet), deflation in the economy, and a bankrupt company somewhere that couldn't pay its bond. With the treasury backing these bonds, it results in the fed getting reimbursed so an actual net of zero on their balance sheet, taxpayer dollars lost, and a company going bankrupt. So rather then take a loss, these higher risk bonds are being backed by the treasury so the Fed can profit or net zero in a worst-case.

Money is constantly vanishing from the market through things like depreciation, outside economies, consumerism, and defaults. If I lend you 5 dollars that you default on, I can try and recoup it through taking your assets, but I'll likely get back much less than 5 dollars, so there's a net deflation in the economy (dollars lost that can never be spent again). If the fed buys a bond that gets defaulted on, then they've lost dollars that can never be spent again. It's a trivial amount of deflation in the scheme of things, but it's there nonetheless. The Fed, of course, prints money which can create inflation, but the 2 aren't necessarily linked, and it's more complex than saying a print dollar plus a default dollar = no net inflation/deflation. In any case, a default dollar would normally add to deflation, particularly at the level of money being printed. But if the government comes in and reimburses a default dollar, it's now once again a net gain of money in the economy, with the treasury having to ultimately utilize more deficit and issue more of their own bonds.\n\nIn summary: I print 5 dollars and lend them to you, you use them on something intangible I can't recoup 5 dollars on when you default, so I'm down 5 dollars. Keep in mind I have to annually print 5 dollars just to keep enough money in circulation (because money is constantly vanishing), so let's say if you hadn't defaulted, my 5 printed dollars would only have been enough to sustain 1-2% inflation. Now we have deflation because of the 5 vanished dollars, until the fed comes in and reimburses me, and then goes and sells another 5 dollar bond to cover their budget deficit, putting us back at 1-2% inflation.\n\nBig caveat: things are infinitely more complicated than this, and there's tons of ways this example breaks down in real life, or simply doesn't factor in to the economy anywhere near a significant amount.
