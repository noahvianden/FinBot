Therefore, central bankers have chosen to pursue a target of 2% inflation as that would mean the federal funds rate can fluctuate within a fairly large band to maintain that target\n\nCurrently the federal funds rate is essentially zero and inflation is at 0.12% (BAD).  \n\nthe way the federal funds rate increases inflation is by going down. it now has no more room to go down, as in theory it can't go below zero. but its already nearly zero and we have 0.12% inflation. which means we're DANGEROUSLY close to deflation at the present moment, and the most effective tool at our disposable has been rendered useless. \n\nObviously I've over simplified this but its a passable explanation\n\nsource: MA in macroeconomics from Autistic University", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think it has a high chance to break the dollar as THE world currency.

His wife's father is a primary care doctor in Wuhan. They take the virus VERY seriously.  They are foodies but never eat out now. They let their packages sit for 2-3 days before bringing them in side. They wears masks to walk their dogs in the suburbs. It's partly because of talking to them that I went all cash in January to better ride out the storm.\n\nSo why do they take it so seriously? Because Wuhan go real bad. Like bad in a way I'm not sure we're really ready to talk about yet. You remember the photos of mass graves? The hospitals they put up in literally days? They locked whole cities up. And they locked people up. In their homes.\n\nLike this: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKek0Y30Ctw\n\nAnd sometimes welded the doors shut like this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsjniPOtTNg\n\nMy neighbor said that many of the quarantined didn't make it - they were pulling the dead out of apartments for weeks. Often they found people's children still alive but sadly orphaned. \n\n**But what about India?**\n\nWell they took it much more seriously than we did and that was enforced by the law. So it was a *nation-wide* lock down mandated by law where travel was heavily restricted.\n\nYou can read about it here if you like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_India#Janata_Curfew\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo let's put it together...
