Therefore, central bankers have chosen to pursue a target of 2% inflation as that would mean the federal funds rate can fluctuate within a fairly large band to maintain that target\n\nCurrently the federal funds rate is essentially zero and inflation is at 0.12% (BAD).  \n\nthe way the federal funds rate increases inflation is by going down. it now has no more room to go down, as in theory it can't go below zero. but its already nearly zero and we have 0.12% inflation. which means we're DANGEROUSLY close to deflation at the present moment, and the most effective tool at our disposable has been rendered useless. \n\nObviously I've over simplified this but its a passable explanation\n\nsource: MA in macroeconomics from Autistic University", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think it has a high chance to break the dollar as THE world currency.

{"title": "Some real DD from Wuhan and India on the virus", "selftext": "Bear here.\n\nI happen to be in a position to have either first or second-hand knowledge of people in both locations. \n\n**First Wuhan.**\n\nMy neighbor is a Chinese national over on an education Visa. His wife's father is a primary care doctor in Wuhan. They take the virus VERY seriously.  They are foodies but never eat out now. They let their packages sit for 2-3 days before bringing them in side. They wears masks to walk their dogs in the suburbs. It's partly because of talking to them that I went all cash in January to better ride out the storm.\n\nSo why do they take it so seriously? Because Wuhan go real bad. Like bad in a way I'm not sure we're really ready to talk about yet. You remember the photos of mass graves? The hospitals they put up in literally days? They locked whole cities up. And they locked people up. In their homes.\n\nLike this: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKek0Y30Ctw\n\nAnd sometimes welded the doors shut like this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsjniPOtTNg\n\nMy neighbor said that many of the quarantined didn't make it - they were pulling the dead out of apartments for weeks. Often they found people's children still alive but sadly orphaned. \n\n**But what about India?**\n\nWell they took it much more seriously than we did and that was enforced by the law. So it was a *nation-wide* lock down mandated by law where travel was heavily restricted.\n\nYou can read about it here if you like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_India#Janata_Curfew\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSo let's put it together... COVID-19 is not fake news and it's lethality is obviously higher than the average flu (we passed that a long time ago). The U.S. did nothing comparable in terms of lockdown to China or India or any of these other countries that are successfully reopening now. We can see that in the numbers where we have more cases than any other country despite having like 5% of the world's population. And now we are unsurprisingly starting to see a resurgence. \n\n**tl;dr** \n\nThis isn't a second wave folks... this is still the first wave and our half-assed, yee-haw lockdown didn't do much good.\n\n**Positions**\n\nVIX calls and TQQQ puts all over July with a sprinkle of SEAS and SNAP puts (same expiry) - all props to /u/dlkdev", "id": "h86z3y", "created_utc": 1592052737.0, "score": 232, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 284, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 268, "replies": [{"body": "Spy down 6% at the end of this last week?

It's a very common sense thing that I think most of us should have just assumed would be happening but always good to hear from somebody who's dealing with it personally.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of comments not just here but in the sub writ large that make it seem like Trump won't \"allow it to happen\" in regards to a recession or another round of lockdowns. This assumes a capacity to have any impact on either of these things, which he obviously does not because he didn't want them to happen the first time but they happened anyway. There are states already putting a pause on their phased reopening because of new spikes and cases. Donald Trump has absolutely no power over whether these governors decide to reinstitute a total lockdown or not. He is utterly powerless in this regard and can do nothing.\n\nRegarding the recession piece, he didn't want the market to drop before. I remember holding calls for 3M in the midst of the pandemic and every time he or pence would do a press conference standing in front of a big 3M sign talking about how great 3M was and how they were going to make all this money off of these government contracts they were going to get I would think to myself \"bring on those sexy trendies\". It never materialized. Trump can't even pump the stock of one company for more than a couple hours.
