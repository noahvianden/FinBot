Plus the site I was looking at (Ponoko.com) seems to be a legit business for working with industries and what not so I doubt they care to steal your card but I checked with a quote from them and it seemed it would cost about 20 dollars to have something the size of an Apple Card engraved with the PNG provided by OP (If you try to use the PNG you have to convert it to an SVG first I have now learned). \n\nThere are a shit ton of other companies if you just google laser engraving though, but for what it is that doesn't seem like too bad of a price. I would email first though to make sure it would work for an Apple Card because I have no idea how laser engraving works but they only offered stainless steel/aluminum and the Apple Card is Titanium and I have no idea if that makes a difference to a laser. \n\nEither way best of luck getting a sexy card engraved and google is your friend.
