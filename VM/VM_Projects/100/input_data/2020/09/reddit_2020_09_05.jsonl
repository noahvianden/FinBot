This effect is much stronger than the price you pay for the initial purchase (ie. your average tends to increase as the time progresses, rather than decrease).\n\nIn a downtrend it's beneficial to dollar cost average, since the next price you'll pay is more likely to be less than the previous one.\n\nI have confirmed this by simulating purchases in a lump versus purchases scattered between various instalments. In around 60% of all cases buying all at once beats dollar cost averaging. If you remove downtrends it becomes even more dominant.

Is this what the kids would call a \"yolo\"?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, even if it is unlikely to hit that price by that time, the contract can still go up in value over the next few days/weeks/months, and while it can still be OTM and have no intrinsic value, it can have value derived from the implied volatility? Like, say the SP is at $650 by December 1; it would be an incredible run, but still an absolutely incredible feat to hit $800 by the time the contract expires. Would the option still be, as the kids say, \"printing\"? Would this depend on the price being at $650 on the way down from, say, $750 a few weeks before, or up from $550 in the same time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, even still being way OTM and close to expiry, the call can be massively profitable because of the supposed trajectory or momentum of the stock price?

I would argue that this is a general axiom.\n\nThe legitimate question for an investor would be: is Tesla a niche enterprise or not. The answer to this question is key to my personal understanding of Tesla share values. There is clearly something that is astray with the production numbers and the capitalization. \n\nI fully understand the case that Tesla is not a car company, with my financial advisor framing it as an Energy and SW company. However their most visible line of products, besides battery packs, are automotive in nature.\n\nI am also looking at evaluation of other car companies and they are following a steady or downward trend. I have to believe that there are plenty of real analyst behind many ETF that look at these numbers and do not go for the media appearance, and have moved the stocks for what seems long term investment. Bubbles are always possible with heard dynamics, but what if there is another storyline? \n\nThe only one I can think is that analyst do not see anymore Tesla as a car maker but as a factory maker. This is a much bigger deal then having just a good car or an innovative technology. Let’s explore the facts and the consequences.\n\n3 Gigafactories popping up in 18 months or less, all with the same basic design would  be Impressive by itself. The capability of completing these in accelerating record time is even more impressive. Factories bring immense political power, with jobs, paychecks and economic development that quickly outpace any tax break. \n\nSuddenly the earth is shifting under the feet of the incumbent manufacturers. The social strength of their position and even their status is no longer unquestionable. With an extreme simplification, They are no longer too big to fail, because a new factory can pop up by the time two board of directors convene to ponder the situation and realize it is too late.\n\nI now believe that the terrifying product of Tesla are factories. The machine that build the machines is here and Tesla is the now swinging a huge club smashing political and social structures in place for centuries. \n\nIf Tesla, next year, has 4 gigafactories producing cars, and start 2 or 3 new ones, it will be terrifying for the incumbents... by the next board of directors they will not have anybody to talk to. \n\nOf course, I am probably grossly wrong, my wife and kids will confirm this statement anytime.

{"title": "Royally Screwed - Here is my story", "selftext": "Dear Tesla investors i'm sharing my story with you not to make you feel bad for me but just to open your eyes. I was an investor of tesla at 600 a share pre split ( a price that would make your mouth water at these levels right now). During COVID crash i panicked and sold at 500 and took a considerable loss (-800). I ended up investing that money in VTIQ at 17 and over 4x'ing my money on the merger with NKLA so I ended up okay, but i still have regrets to sell.\n\nI re entered Tesla at 1350 on day of stock split announcement. I gave myself a 10% target and after less than 2 days i sold at 1615 and taught i was super smart (1500 dollar gain). I watched it hit  over 2000 and had the worst fomo ever, so pissed at myself (AGAIN). I re entered the friday before the split and got stopped out, and proceeded to watch the shares go over 20% up on monday on split day and was super pissed again. I felt like this stock could only go up and got clouded by fomo, i chucked my entire portfolio in at 480 for a swing trade and the rest is history. Insider selling (including executives, Elon's brother and institutions), 5 Billion equity raise and now i'm down over 6 grand on my 55 shares at an average cost basis of 481.5 (2400 pre-split).\n\nI am stuck, refuse to sell at a loss but also realize that I could be looking at much more pain in the weeks to come if s&p inclusion doesn't materialize or battery day dissapoints.\n\nI dug deep in the rest of  my savings and the most i can scrape is 5.5k, but even with that investment the best i can get my cost basis down to is about 460-465 (still terrible). Maybe i should use the 5.5k to swing trade  other stocks instead to make some of the money back.\n\nImmagine investing for a swing trade, not setting a stop loss or selling at break even (i could have done it many times during the day) but kept telling myself that a repeat of the previous times was going to happen and the next day was a 10-20% day. Every time i played it conservatively, i missed out on 20% runs, the one time i stay  in the stock i get hit by a -20% 2 day span. Cursed.\n\nI am royally screwed now and will probably not break even for months or years but there is not much i can do. Selling at a -6k loss isn't really an option, especially not on a stock like tesla.\n\nLessons i've learned:\n\n\\- Stick with companies u love (dont sell at 600 pre-stock split adjusted)\n\n\\-Set stop losses if you want to swing\n\n\\- NEVER chase the FOMO, or u might as well get stuck near the top ( like me) and never be able to recover again.\n\nI know most u have cost basis in the 60-175 range so these drops dont matter and you guys are still up 200-700% on ur investment, and i'm happy for u all.

{"title": "Why we will see SPY 400+ by the end of October", "selftext": "The past two days have been traumatic. Bulls had months of gains wiped out in mere hours, while cocky, righteous bears came out from hibernation and made 3000% returns on 2DTE puts.\n\nWhat you might not realize is that this kind of violent pullback is completely normal (and even beneficial) as we approach the top, and I'm going to give you three reasons why what we just saw on Wednesday (Nasdaq 12.4k, SPY 358) is FAR from the true top of this move:\n\n1. Many bulls will admit that we are in, or approaching, \"bubble\" territory. But consider what happened near the peak of the DotCom bubble. In January, 2000, the NDX experienced a 13% move down in 7 days, a sharp, violent correction that likely wiped out a lot of short-term longs (sound familiar?). Then, in the next 1.5 months, we saw a massive \\~35% run up to the very top. \n2. Interestingly, the peak of bullish sentiment happened around early January, 2000, while the actual index peaked in March. (Notice how bullish sentiment peaked in this sub on Wednesday? We might not get back to that euphoric sentiment ever again--but that doesn't mean the markets won't go higher.) It's often said that markets are good at \"climbing the wall of worry\", and that is precisely what we will see over the next two months as a variety of intangible fears grip investors.\n3. There was no real fundamental catalyst for the NDX dump; it was more of a technical pullback closer to the long- and medium-term moving averages. The next two months will see a lot of buzz about election fears, second wave fears, civil war fears, protest fears, trade war fears, etc etc, you name it. This is a great wall of worry to climb. None of these fears will actually be realized until November (at the earliest) which is exactly why the market will not fall until then or thereafter. Stimulus news in the next two weeks will help push this final leg up.\n\nTl;dr We will moon in the next 2 months; SPY 400-450 depending on level of delusion, NDX 14k+\n\nPositions: SPY 400c 10/16, 410c 11/20, then around the election switch to long-dated SPY puts, e.g. SPY 200p 09/17/2021", "id": "in2dch", "created_utc": 1599317426.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, take your unemployment check and let the next person come to the window.", "score": 177, "replies": [{"body": "But wait, there’s more...", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "At least I know you’re in deeper shit than I, if it drops again", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Jesus dude, just buy straight stonks on a dip through a Holiday weekend.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "My god", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Same here brother, god speed", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "damn, we'll probably retest the highs at some point before the election so hope the expiry is long enough,,", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Well the heavy selling looks to be done.

So, if I'm a business wanting to expand, take a risk, etc, I now have the ability to do that. If I'm a MM and I want to take out some leverage, nows a great time to do so seeing how low interest rates have gotten. If I'm a large company I probably also dont want to tie up much capital in bonds or other traditional savings, as my money could earn more interest (or value, I guess) elsewhere.  Its not so much that the fed is actually going out and propping the market up directly, it's making the environment one in which it's more advantageous to invest capital rather than save it in a traditionally safe way.  \n\n\nDon't fight the fed means simply don't go short when the people who control the money supply are furiously pumping market conditions, because assets can continue to illogically rise for a long time with this support and bankrupt shorts.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I understand all that, the indirect effect. How does that translate into buying tech at any price however for you or people you know? This is the part I don’t understand.\n\nI’m a CFO for a private equity firm so see various aspects in various companies/industries. One of our CEOs invested in a 20 unit cycling (fitness) operation four years ago. He did so because he needed to put his money somewhere and debt was cheap (and was utilized by the company). When Covid hit, it became clear that demand was gone. He, along with the other passive investors, had a decision to make, support the business with further cash which would support additional debt or shut it down. Even though debt was cheaper because of the Fed’s actions, they chose to shut it down because cheap debt meant nothing. What mattered was whether they could produce enough revenue (i.e. paying customers) to provide a return on their capital. And they concluded that wouldn’t happen.\n\nThoughts on that as it relates to publicly traded companies? I get that Amazon will gain additional business when the four corner stores in small town America go bankrupt.

Ford just laid off over 1000 salaried workers. Cruise lines are still pushing dates back. AMC theatres are still empty. \n\n\nBut I think there are a good deal who see the actions of the fed and the federal government as guarantees. Hey, take those risks, we're rigging the table to be heavily in the black. This trickles down to retail, as they watch a fire sale on stocks proceeded by ATHs. After all, if the government is going to guarantee my payroll, why not invest? After all, if the government is just going to give me $1200, why not invest in Apple? All the idiots on WSB are posting 1000% gains after all.  I think a lot of people underestimate how much retail has gotten into the game with all this free time and desperation. \n\nLook. I'm not saying the market is behaving rationally. I'm just pointing out how people get caught up in narratives backed by some kernels of truth. I think if you're trying to find a logical reason behind every move you're forgetting (even for a moment) that markets are heavily influenced by the  psychology of the masses and that doesn't always make sense. There are trends, and some trends have patterns. This is one that has netted me some profit: when the fed decides to prop up the market, people are generally convinced it will work. When people think things will be ok, they buy, and self fulfill their own prophecy. And the cycle continues. Sometimes this is a line of thinking taken by individuals, sometimes a firm.\n\nThe key is realizing this is incredibly risky, and catching that wild wind in your sail may tear it.
