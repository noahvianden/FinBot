I was constantly reading how we are piling up debt globally, the GDP drops, recession, unemployment etc and was quite fearful overall.\n\nI was a bear for the entirety of the summer, and then decided to flip my thesis around in late July/August.\n\nCurrently sitting at a net loss of 8% in my portfolio, which I expect to grow before I see upside honestly.\n\nThe fact is though, **time in the market beats timing the market**. The biggest thing that hurts new investors (and myself a lot) is impatience and an inability to grasp that a stock can drop 50% in value in a micro period but then in a more macro scale still yield profit for you eventually.\n\nYou build that macro lens with experience and experience only I find, and for myself, these kind of corrections/crashes really help build that experience. There is no other way around it.\n\n**Think of it as an education loan you pay now, which you will eventually receive back if you stick to your learnings and theses.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that (what I have come to appreciate and learn, even if I'm struggling to apply it sometimes).\n\n1) When fear builds up and the greedy become fearful, that's when you should start considering buying, or if you have bought already, average down your positions.\n\nA purchase of 5 stocks at ATH and 5 stocks near the bottom is a pretty good average for long term growth\n\n2) The stock's price is sheerly demand driven and lags a lot. Out there is still an Apple, a PayPal, an AMD, etc. creating value. The price will always catch up eventually if your thesis is strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't believe that we have seen the top of tech. Granted, it will bleed from an influx of fear and/or profit taking, but tech still has the macro traction to grow a lot more. A painful correction/consolidation is an integral part of this growth.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n1) Time in the market beats timing the market. The worst mistake you can make is selling after a few days of loss because of panic. That's when you actually lose money.\n\n2) During these moments you build strong experience for your future investments. Savour them and remember your learnings.

Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $2500 pre-split).\n\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split).

CREE, NTAP and QCOM still exist and are doing very well.  SEBL was bought by oracl maybe 7 to 10 years ago.\n\nBut companies can do very well and still lose 90% of their stock value.  Every one of those stocks, and in fact the entire NASDAQ lost 90% of its value from its peak in the 2000 NASDAQ bubble.  Some of those companies have not seen their 2000 bubble stock prices despite running perfectly good companies and experiencing 2 more 'tech bubbles' in the preceding 20 years.\n\nNTAP has reached about half its 2000 stock price in the preceding 20 years, CREE about the same it looks like.  QCOM has done the best-- it just recently exceeded its 2000 all time high, but it took 20 years to do so, meaning if you bought the stock any time near its bubble peak and held through the crash thinking it would someday return a value, you would have been right.  After 20 years of holding,  in the last couple months you would have finally seen a small return, a much worse return than holding treasuries bonds, but not a loss I guess.\n\nThe point is valuation does matter, and a business can be a good business and run perfectly fine and in a great environment for what it sells, but if you buy at an extreme premium you may not see a return on your money, even after holding for 20 years and that company performing its business well .\n\nTSLA may very well be a great company, but it seems like it is priced like as if its going to be the only car company in the world with high margins to boot.  It feels very much like QCOM to me- in fact QCOM split 4-1 after a relentless run up and then immediately began to tank, bringing the market down with it shortly after.\n\nQCOM had a patent on a tremendous and pioneering technology that other companies had to pay (and still do) royalties on, this was challenged and won in many court battles.  A technology that would go in billions of phones eventually and was/is a very well run business.\n\n  I don't even know if the same could be said for TSLA honestly, they may be well run, but they don't have a patent that they can force other companies to use or pay on..but in any case, that's beside the point.  The point is that valuations really do matter.  The average investor in 2000 because people were so heavily weighted in technology lost 85% of their portfolio value.

{"title": "The dollar rally is going to kill you all.", "selftext": "You know all that nonsense from the Fed about average inflation and how they'll plan to let the economy run soooo hot that they break through the 2% target they never, ever achieved?\n\nWell guess what, there's no fucking way that happens, and the dollar index pump we're seeing right now reflects that. I think a lot of people here think that if the Fed prints money, more money = inflation. But actually that only happens when the average person has more money and increases their spending. But what's happened is that 100% of the money they print gets tied up in the banking system and never spent. This is the same reason there hasn't been significantly inflation in a decade: income inequality. And covid has only made that worse, which is why what we're up against is actually deflation.\n\nAnd why is deflation so shitty? Lower prices are awesome, right? Well, the reason inflation is so great for the US equities market is because (1) equities are inflation neutral and (2) companies are in shitloads of debt. Deflation makes the enormous debt bubble impossible to pay off. (In reality the relationship between the dollar and stocks is pretty complex, which is why you retards are only getting the ELI5.)\n\nIn short, the Fed's move is the same as saying \"we will no longer tax income over $5T.\" It sounds nice, but it doesn't fucking apply. The dollar tanking is a mirage and the bounce back will be swift and merciless. \n\nSPY 325p 11/20", "id": "iorqbw", "created_utc": 1599563822.0, "score": 786, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 365, "comments": [{"body": "Sir this is a gamblers anonymous", "score": 687, "replies": [{"body": "Meeting at taco bell.", "score": 131, "replies": [{"body": "Before they all have to leave for their route at Cutco", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "Wait were not doing the Kirby thing this week?", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "No. That was *last* week\n\nKnives bro.

Maybe not immediately, but in retrospect, it will be seen as the moment a new era of economics took hold.\n\nThe situation is like this. The fed has printed and will print more money than could be recaptured and destroyed in a generation.  Taxes are impossible right now politically and economically and austerity in the next 5 years would be fatal. Therefore there's really only one tool left and it's kind of a dirty trick: the fed, and the country, needs inflation on the order of 8%+ a year for a decade, even if that seems like a crazy target - it's the last way to get control of the debt mess.\n\nMeanwhile all this printing and zero interest rate (which was historically low for a decade leading into this virus) has not inflamed the labor market or stimulated consumer confidence to the extent needed.  It's only effect has been to inflate or buttress assets (equity and real estate, commodities to some extent) - i.e. concentrate wealth.  But that's all dead end money.  The vast majority of that type of wealth doesn't DO anything day to day, or even year to year.  It's sedentary, albeit deceptive due to highly visible paper liquidity, which is really just money sloshing about between elites providing little to no amperage for stimulating the engine of growth, which is what is needed.  On the face of it, stimulus is the right strategy, but it's not having the same effect as it has historically. The tools the fed can use are therefore somehow broken.  But why?\n\nPicture the economy as a landscape with water standing in for wealth, concentrated in the low areas, forming lakes and rivers.  When it rains, all areas are wetted equally, which stimulates growth.  However gravity (macroeconomic factors) inevitably pulls the water downward, and without consistent rain the highlands would become arid and dry.  Usually there's nothing wrong with this - the water evaporates out of lakes and rivers and falls again as rain (taxes, spending, circulation).  The lakes hoard the majority of water, but there's a natural equilibrium so nowhere is completely dry.\n\nNow imagine the water cycle stalls for some reason (economic crisis).  The highlands, which are the majority of the lands surface, cry out in pain from drought.  Growth is at a standstill and things dry out and die.  The rivers run dry and even the lakes drop a few inches.  The answer should be to bring everyone water, right?\n\nThis is where monetary policy has failed, and 'trickle down' policies are a fallacy.  It imagines an inverted landscape where lakes sit on top of mountains.\n\nThe yardsticks are brought out and it is clear the lakes are getting more shallow.  If the lakes are gone there will be no water anywhere!  So water is poured directly into the lakes and rivers.  Job done, stimulus achieved. But no rain.  And because water inexorably flows DOWN, the land stays dry.  More water is poured until the lakes are deeper than ever, but nothing is happening.  There's now flooding and drought at the same time.  The dams are creaking.\n\nLocal towns and small communities had local economic foci - factories and local commerce would capture the water like a well.  But now the water, if it comes at all, flows past quickly as if it never came - through market-efficient canals to lakes far away, in New York and Houston.  Without constant rain (good economic times) they become unviable.  The landscape has been altered and now the tools don't work.\n\nThe fed can't make rain because it's not in their charter.  They can deal with flooding and manage reservoirs.  But Congress controls the rain.  Not all of it if course since at least the latest crisis has a huge natural component, but they are the only ones with any control at all.\n\nMetaphor murdered, back to the question.  The fed hasn't fixed the problem but it's created a problem.  There's now a bubble and a debt crisis, and yet people are still suffering.  The fed if it is to do anything at all needs new tools. Embracing inflation is one - the extreme case is negative interest rates.  This is like punching a hole in the dam.  Institutions and the wealthy have to use it or lose it.  JPM and others are hedging this with silver etc.  Others are doing or would do share buybacks, putting cash in the hands of institutions that themselves don't want to hold it.  The stock market would continue to moon, M&A would be off the charts, and maybe unemployment would finally be impacted enough for wage growth and inflation, which would start to erode the feds balance sheet.  It might even help with wealth disparity which needs to be addressed for the economy to move again.  But the banks would be under constant threat, and the question of the intrinsic value of money would go even more to the forefront as the entire economy is dragged kicking and screaming into new behaviors and wild equity valuations.  Loans and real estate would bubble, threatening a constant new financial crisis.  A new tension would build up that could lead to an inflationary spiral - but again that's kind of the goal now.\n\nThe other tool would be to enter into purchasing new classes of securities beyond mortgage-backed, treasuries, and AAA corporate debt.  Buying up states debt would be ideal, but politically impractical.  However this exacerbates the already bad balance sheet and raises the need for inflation.  Long term they would essentially be nationalizing today's corporate debt with the plan to inflate it away, which  is kinda neutral for the no-asset class people.  Weakening the dollar is also a stimulus to the economy but it won't happen in a vacuum, and China and Europe are going to feel the pain.  America is precipitating a global financial crisis/inflation spiral in other countries against their will.  That's the dirty part.\n\nWhat will Powell do? Continue to issue forward guidance that a higher inflation rate is the new target and that 0% interest will be maintained as long as needed.  And maybe they will float the idea of negative interest rates being considered to wield that soft power - actually doing it would be revolutionary.  And they will probably extend bond buying further into corporate junk. Yawn and fear.  Either way I'm sure he's not sleeping tonight.\n\nWhat should the government do instead, IMO? Let the fed take a break.  Forgive student debt, issue a huge stimulus check(s) in a financially progressive way, enact huge infrastructure spending and a New New Deal, stop unemployment benefits, give the lowest/no tax bracket an annual credit instead, cut corporate taxes but raise the minimum wage to $20/hr (or let companies deduct payroll up to a certain limit), and institute nationalized healthcare funded by a tax on the top 5% (or a huge estate tax).  Why not cut out the middle man and stop pretending that reducing the cost of corporate debt is a necessary intermediate to getting money into the economy?  You still tank the dollar and accomplish the same needed inflation but actually get some results out of it.  Let it rain.\n\nYeah metals may moon a bit but it won't be the best asset class to ride out inflation, and that fact will keep a downward pressure on it.  It will move in the same direction as the market (with lag) because in the end it's not silver backing the USD, it's the USD backing silver.  Silver is just another global currency that depends on the USD - there's no independent exit if you're holding.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Great outlook.. history will tell that trickledown is the dumbest policy ever..

My initial thoughts are that we are already in a shadow deflationary period but the effects are spread unevenly.  Due to the way government spending/QE and taxation are allocated in the current period, efforts to increase the money supply don't translate to increasing the effective monetary base, leading to a constrained economy that is struggling to keep increasing production against an ever tightening consumer pocketbook.  If the currency were backed in gold, it would be the equivalent to taking half of fort knox and reburying it in the ground.  In reality, the current method of stimulus maintains the purchasing power of the currency against deflationary pressures, but that 'buried gold' exists in bonds, real estate and equities, which are buffering the availability of money to the active (i.e. producing) parts of the economy.  \n\nSo, while some institutions are perceiving inflation in their part of the economy, the vast majority of the economy is behaving as if entering deflation, compounded by the contrast between the velocity of money in these two circles.  Now ordinarily if you own all the corn in Kansas you have to worry about it expiring, but if inflation remains low there's no reason to let go, since money doesn't expire.  If policy doesn't change, I believe you will continue to see downward pressure on consumer prices AND the market mooning, which sounds good until you consider that downward pressure is the result of hardship in large swaths of the economy.  The biggest squeeze will be where people need access to inflating assets (via education, retirement savings, rent or buying a home) but draw their income from a deflating economy.  Yet a tiny slice of that locked up wealth will buy the same, or more, labor than it did before, suppressing wage growth and maintaining unemployment.  The best place to be is to ride that asset train, but that's only possible if you have access to significant capital to supplement or replace income with growth.  Long term the worry is that most people will be in the position of pigeons begging for bread crumbs, which will drive demand down further until the entire economy grinds to a halt and the intrinsic value of money becomes uncertain.

The FED's prime directive is maintaining the worldwide Dollar supremacy, if they devalue it too far, they risk that supremacy, and in the process, would give China the opening they need to replace the USD with the CNY. The idea that the Fed is going to willingly give up the exorbitant privilege of being the world's reserve currency is utterly hysterical.\n\nThe Fed would happily obliterate US-based debt holders to maintain the USD reserve currency status.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Obliterating the debt holders would forfeit the reserve currency status.  The Fed has no mandate about reserve currency status.  Its dual mandates are maximum employment and control of inflation.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Let me slightly rephrase, US-*citizen* debt holders. Foreign debt holders are different. Think of the USD as operating in two different economies. The first is the US economy, the second is the world economy that uses the dollar as a medium of exchange between states, but does NOT use it for local exchange. The two have fundamentally different use cases for the dollar, and therefore have fundamentally different views on the purpose and thus outcomes of a currency.\n\nThe US economy primarily uses the USD as a store of value as the result of labor that is then transacted in exchange for goods and services, this is fairly standard high-school economics stuff.\n\nThe second economy is where we typically find what we refer to as the \"reserve currency\". A quick primer on reserve currencies: A reserve currency is a currency that is used as a third-party medium of exchange when two parties do not wish to trade in one of the local currencies. The Brazilians have about as much use for Thai Baht as the Thai have for the Real, so instead of using either of those, the Brazilians convert the Real into USD, give the USD to the Thai, who then convert it into the Baht. This entire process is almost entirely mediated through credit markets as both will accept US denominated credit-debt.\n\nThis status as a reserve currency gives the US Government two critical (exorbitant) privileges.\n\nThe first is what allows the US to issue seemingly limitless amounts of debt without apparent repercussion. The reason is very simple. Per the BIS, there is somewhere between 750 trillion and 1.4 quadrillion in global USD-equivalent derivatives debt (futures, options, etc). The Fed can print endlessly for the simple fact that somebody somewhere needs it's dollars to transact on the credit markets. There is functionally bottomless demand for the USD.\n\nThe second is the ability to regulate trade between two foreign nations (see the Iranian sanctions) via controlling access the USD at the Fed via SWIFT (which the Fed owns and operates) and gives the US the ability to wield nearly unlimited geopolitical power. And wield it it does. It was this power that functionally ended the Soviet Union, is currently being deployed against the Iranians, and is being threatened against the Chinese. It is difficult to understate just how enormously important this power is the US Government. The ability to financially obliterate your geopolitical competition before they can ever achieve the ability to threaten you physically is an *existential* concern.\n\nThe value of your mortgage is of no concern to those whose job it is to prevent any nation from becoming so powerful as to be able to bomb said mortgage. When push comes to shove, the Fed absolutely will let the dollar deflate to protect it's status as the world's reserve currency. The power that status represents is simply too important to risk attempting to inflate away your mortgage, and there are other ways to handle the Government debt, all of which involve completely fucking the average US citizen.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh I fully understand what a reserve currency is, and the Fed has done a good job of ensuring liquidity and access.   But someone has to continue to accept your currency as the reserve, and just because it has in the past does not mean it forever will.  Nations and institutions all over the world hold and transact in US$ as you mentioned.  But they do so because of the US perception as a strong, free, and responsible issuer.  If you have a government printing endlessly and a Fed which guarantees you zero\nInterest for “years” with guaranteed devaluation, as a third party you might start to look for alternatives.  Note Goldman and others have started to question the reserve status role.  There hasn’t been a good alternative but we are forcing people to look.  And Buffet and others have been somewhat confounded that all this hasn’t led to inflation.   My guess is that it wont be a problem, until one day all of a sudden when it is.   And a rush to the exits here, with the amount you mention and the onerous debts at all levels of government and institutions could be intense.  With the debt levels as they are, we have absolutely no alternative other than monetizing the debts.  Maybe things will just roll along, but my guess is I doubt it.  Its great to have the reserve status, but if push comes to shove they will go with their mandates if there is a conflict.  And if its gradual all the better for the Fed.  Imported inflation is still inflation, and they have explicitly told us they want much more.  Thanks for the comments.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "While I agree that there is no future guarantee that the USD will be the reserve currency for all time, let's look at the current crop of competitors. Let's start with the currencies that are simply too illiquid to the task: AUD, NZD, CHF\n\nNext up is the GBP. While it might have enough liquidity, in the short term Brexit uncertainty is going to weigh down on it. In the long term, one of the very few things that the vast majority of countries agree on is that returning to the Glory Days of the British Empire is an experience they'd all rather not repeat.\n\nJPY. It certainly is liquid enough, but Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio is 200%. Any attempt to switch to the JPY as the world reserve currency would result in hyperinflation in Japan. Given how closely they are walking that line as it is, I strongly doubt the Japanese will sanction such a move.\n\nEUR: Definitely has the liquidity, and the ECB would love to unseat the USD for the same reasons that the USD wants to stay in the reserve seat. They even set-up a special program to allow EU countries to purchase Iranian oil in EUR without touching the USD. Since the program was created in 2015, there has been precisely one transaction. It turns out that after confiscating Cypriot bank deposits in 2012, nobody trusts the EU to not actively meddle with it's currency. Which gets at the fundamental problem with the EUR, the EU. Look at how long it took them to agree to print more money, or how willing they are to meddle with the currency even offshore, or the rising problems on the Eastern frontier.\n\nCNY: This is the big kahuna, the one that everyone is convinced will rule the world. The reality is much less picturesque. According to an SCMP article published in May of 2020, China's Debt-to-GDP ratio is an eye-watering 310%. The only reason that China has not had hyperinflation is the ironclad USD Peg they maintain on the CNY. The moment they release that peg, they have to endure an inflationary explosion that would rival Zimbabwe. Remember a few days back the Chinese said they would begin a limited unwinding their UST exposure? The next day another report comes out saying that their UST holdings increased significantly that day to offset movement from the peg. Furthermore, to be a reserve currency, a nation must allow it's currency to trade with relative freedom beyond it's borders. Which of China's recent actions is calibrated to give anybody any confidence that they will allow *that* to happen?\n\nYou are 100% correct that imported inflation is still inflation. But the US is only at 160% of GDP post stimulus. The USD is the cleanest dirty shirt in the hamper.\n\nAfter the 2008 crisis, the Fed has been desperate to create inflation from anywhere. And China delivered. The bulk of the inflation we've experienced over the past 12 years has been imported from China. If it wasn't for imported inflation, the US would've experienced a debt-deflation depression starting in 2008.\n\nBut today, the problem is that there is no more inflation in the world left to import. Even the mighty China is struggling to inflate it currency any further. That rocketship of a Debt-to-GDP ratio is preventing it from printing it's way out of the CoVID deflation. The EUR is already signalling a deflationary bust as the second-wave kicks off. And no other markets are big enough to generate meaningful supplies of inflation for the US to import. All that's left to import is deflation, and import it we shall. Because being the worlds reserve currency is an existential concern, and if you can import inflation, then you can import deflation as well.\n\nInterestingly enough, we've seen this before. In 1929.

You’ve just been suckered in by the glamour of getting rich quick.\n\nI’m guessing nobody is going to read this and/or take this seriously, but because I’m bored, here’s an idea of what’s happening, in essence:\n\n- Pretend I’m going to roll a fair, 6-sided die\n- Every time you roll the die, I charge you $1 (this is your initial investment)\n- If you roll a ‘6’, I pay you $5, or 5x your initial investment. \n- Winning 5x your investment feels amazing, and of course, when you win 5x your investment, you have to share with the world on Reddit to show how amazing you are at making money—thus attracting others to the game.\n\nThe problem is, however:\n\n- Pretend you roll the die 6 times\n- Probability states that on average you will land on each number once (though this is unlikely to be the actual case).\n- By adding up the net profit/loss from each expected roll (‘1’=-$1... etc) and then dividing by the number of rolls, we get our overall expected value per roll (EV).\n- EV = ((-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1) + (-$1 + $5))/6 = $-1/6\n- In other words, we are losing about $0.16 per roll.\n\nNow, because of the way probabilities work, you might roll a ‘6’ a bunch of times in a row and become rich. Or, you might roll the other numbers and lose your house—all short term, of course. If you roll the die a ton of times, you’re basically guaranteed to lose just about $0.16 per roll.\n\nAnd finally, imagine, say, a billion sided die, with much more complicated payout rules—this is akin to what you’re doing when you’re investing uneducated. So, while you might see the occasional person making a lot of money, on average, the people here who are “YOLOing” are losing tons of money because the EV of their trades is negative.\n\nThis is exactly the way a casino works, and is the reason why casinos make money. The difference is, of course, that, in skill games such as poker, you’re playing against other opponents. If your strategies are stronger than your opponents’ on average (hint, they’re not) you can effectively take their money. \n\nThe only way to correctly invest is to make trades with a positive EV. And even then, you might still lose a ton of money short term. This is exactly the way poker works and is why, if you’ve ever played, sometimes you feel super lucky while other times you can’t win anything. To win at poker, you need to make decisions that are more +EV than your opponents’.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can thank WSB for only teaching you options.
