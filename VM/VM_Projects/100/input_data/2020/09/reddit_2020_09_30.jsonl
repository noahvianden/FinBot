I know one person who did that.\n\n> maybe we should let people decide their own risks\n\nThat makes sense, but the problem with an infectious disease is that people are not deciding only their own risks, since if they get infected that increases the risk to others. It makes sense for society to have a say in matters that affect infection rates of potentially serious or fatal diseases.\n\n> What if this vaccine takes another year or two to get there, I'll have gone insane by then.\n\nSorry, hope you don't go insane. The main Chinese and Russian vaccines are likely to be up to about 60% effective, the US is aiming for 50% or better, though it's possible that one or more of the many vaccines being tested will turn out to be highly effective.

But I will reiterate what people talk about any time AMD is mentioned in the past two months.\n\n1: AMD's CPU leaked yesterday. And to say the least, it looks promising. Article below as I will not go into depth on this. In summary, Intel has had a better CPU for years but this looks like its changing. If priced similarly to previous CPU's, AMD will no doubt be the leader in this price range. \n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-leak-shows-a-powerhouse-gaming-cpu-that-could-embarrass-intels-core-i9-10900k\n\n\n\n\n\n2: AMD/NVIDIA battle. For a long time, NVIDIA has been the leader in the GPU battle. With the horrid launch of the 30xx series and recent leaks about AMD's GPU price to performance, its looking more and more like AMD will take market share from NVIDIA.\n      -Many retailers report not even getting 3000 series cards\n      -Huge driver issues making games unplayable\n      -Scalpers/bots taking all the available cards and reselling\n\n\n\n\n\n3: AMD is selling both XBOX and PS5 their Zen and RDNA chips. There is no other competition and production numbers are being met. \n\nhttps://www.pocket-lint.com/laptops/news/playstation/153151-amd-chips-xbox-series-x-playstation-5-ps5-schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4: Lisa Su (AMD CEO). This summary below linked by u/Souskei about how she revived AMD is why I personally have so much faith in the company. \n\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@jyjayy94/dr-lisa-su-the-living-legend-of-amd-7e0173d3a4a4\n\n\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DATES**\n\nAMD ZEN 3 reveal October 8th\n\nAMD GPU reveal October 28th\n\nAMD earnings announcement November 3rd (expected $.31 compared to $.14 for last year same quarter)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-announces-keynote-dates-for-zen-3-and-big-navi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next month is one of the most important months AMD has had in years. I am fully expecting them to crush it and finally be on Intel/Nvidia's level after years of playing catch up. \n\n*We don't need to bring up previous AMD driver issues* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**My recommendations for options**\n\nFull disclaimer. I am in for 20 Nov 90C. Now let's look at Bid/ask spreads, volume, and the greeks below.\n\n\nI will only look at option chains expiring after November due to all the announcements in October. \n\n\n\n\n\n**6 Nov** is not worth it for reasons below.\n  \n - the average bid/ask spread is 40 cents for OTM/ITM calls. Personally I usually buy close ITM calls for the delta/theta movement as it is safer. \n  \n -Theta for closer OTM calls are already at .11\n   \n-Delta is hovering at about .5 which is okay, but preferably since its a month away, we would want it a little more. No doubt it will move up as AMD increases. But so will Theta for an option expiring a week after the announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n**20 Nov**\n    \n-My position of choice due to much smaller bid/ask because I'm not a fan of losing money to MM's. \n   \n - Theta of .6/.7 right now which buys us more time. \n   \n -Since I plan on selling the options during early November, I still have adequate time to not get wrecked by theta and let delta move in my favor. \n\n\n\n\n\n**15 Jan 21**\n\n- Another recommendation of mine. Earnings will be about to be fully reported. VOL will be high and so will the expectations. The play is up to you here. But i recommend anything over $95 at minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: As of 5 October, I closed out my contracts last week when we hit $84 and waited for the dip at $81.

They mute themselves, turn off the video, and run fucking the washing machine. Lockdown and shelter-in-place has led to an explosion in household chores to include washing and drying clothes. Guess what everybody is wearing at home? Not their fucking dress clothes but casual clothes that are now being redirected to the home washer/dryer rather than out-sourced to dry cleaning services. Literally, the only headwind to P&G's fabric care business is you greasy fucks refreshing the daily thread and sorting by new posts hoping to secure early entry on the next big pump have probably stopped doing laundry altogether.\n\n**Family Care (Charmin, Bounty, Puffs)**  \n[Why toilet-paper demand spiked 845%](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-toilet-paper-demand-spiked-845-how-companies-kept-up-2020-5).\n\nSelf-explanatory. Toilet paper, paper towels, and even tissues have been perpetually out-of-stock. And it's not because we are out of trees to chop down but because pantry loading and consumption have exploded. At home pantry levels are increasing due to fear of another panic buy. Working from home and shitting on company time means you are now using even more toilet paper than before. Staying at home more means you are cleaning more which leads to higher paper towel consumption. Kids learning from home instead of at school means more messes which means more Bounty sales.\n\n**Dish and Air Care** **(Febreze, Dawn, Gain, Cascade)**  \n[Dishwashing Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Supplies Expected to Grow by 275%](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/23/2020697/0/en/Dishwashing-Amid-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Supplies-Expected-to-Grow-by-275-Leading-Manufacturers-Include-Unilever-Procter-Gamble-Henkel-Lion-Corporation-and-Reckitt-Benckiser-Among-Ot.html).\n\nStaying at home and restaurant shut downs means an explosion in home cooking.

Families are stocking the fuck up on diapers and wipes cause they're afraid of rampant out-of-stocks.

In March of 2020 - this fucking year - right when the pandemic hit. P&G launches a new brand that disrupted the sanitization and antibacterial space. A consumer sanitizer that has residual, long lasting, kill and effective on SARS-CoV-2. Competitive santizers only kill bacteria on contact and Microban is able to protect the surface for a 24hr period. This is a groundbreaking product without any competitive parities that launched at the start of the pandemic. Guess what matters to stockholders & the share price? Growth vs. prior year. Guess what blockbuster brand didn't exist in P&G's portfolio in the prior year - Microban. The keyword here is *incrementality*. This killer product, launched at the most serendipitous time, is going to be completely incremental to P&G's revenue and profit and has been completely sold out since the first week of launch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do we know P&G's supply chain can supply all this growth potential?**  \n[The New Construction Approach That Helped P&G Build Their ‚ÄúPlant Of The Future‚Äù](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2020/02/21/the-new-construction-approach-that-helped-pg-build-their-plant-of-the-future/#7fa5b0d5714d).
