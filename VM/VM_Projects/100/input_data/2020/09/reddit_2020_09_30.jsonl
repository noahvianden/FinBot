But I will reiterate what people talk about any time AMD is mentioned in the past two months.\n\n1: AMD's CPU leaked yesterday. And to say the least, it looks promising. Article below as I will not go into depth on this. In summary, Intel has had a better CPU for years but this looks like its changing. If priced similarly to previous CPU's, AMD will no doubt be the leader in this price range. \n\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-leak-shows-a-powerhouse-gaming-cpu-that-could-embarrass-intels-core-i9-10900k\n\n\n\n\n\n2: AMD/NVIDIA battle. For a long time, NVIDIA has been the leader in the GPU battle. With the horrid launch of the 30xx series and recent leaks about AMD's GPU price to performance, its looking more and more like AMD will take market share from NVIDIA.\n      -Many retailers report not even getting 3000 series cards\n      -Huge driver issues making games unplayable\n      -Scalpers/bots taking all the available cards and reselling\n\n\n\n\n\n3: AMD is selling both XBOX and PS5 their Zen and RDNA chips. There is no other competition and production numbers are being met. \n\nhttps://www.pocket-lint.com/laptops/news/playstation/153151-amd-chips-xbox-series-x-playstation-5-ps5-schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4: Lisa Su (AMD CEO). This summary below linked by u/Souskei about how she revived AMD is why I personally have so much faith in the company. \n\n\n\nhttps://medium.com/@jyjayy94/dr-lisa-su-the-living-legend-of-amd-7e0173d3a4a4\n\n\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT DATES**\n\nAMD ZEN 3 reveal October 8th\n\nAMD GPU reveal October 28th\n\nAMD earnings announcement November 3rd (expected $.31 compared to $.14 for last year same quarter)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-announces-keynote-dates-for-zen-3-and-big-navi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next month is one of the most important months AMD has had in years.

I am in for 20 Nov 90C. Now let's look at Bid/ask spreads, volume, and the greeks below.\n\n\nI will only look at option chains expiring after November due to all the announcements in October. \n\n\n\n\n\n**6 Nov** is not worth it for reasons below.\n  \n - the average bid/ask spread is 40 cents for OTM/ITM calls. Personally I usually buy close ITM calls for the delta/theta movement as it is safer. \n  \n -Theta for closer OTM calls are already at .11\n   \n-Delta is hovering at about .5 which is okay, but preferably since its a month away, we would want it a little more. No doubt it will move up as AMD increases. But so will Theta for an option expiring a week after the announcements.\n\n\n\n\n\n**20 Nov**\n    \n-My position of choice due to much smaller bid/ask because I'm not a fan of losing money to MM's. \n   \n - Theta of .6/.7 right now which buys us more time. \n   \n -Since I plan on selling the options during early November, I still have adequate time to not get wrecked by theta and let delta move in my favor. \n\n\n\n\n\n**15 Jan 21**\n\n- Another recommendation of mine. Earnings will be about to be fully reported. VOL will be high and so will the expectations. The play is up to you here. But i recommend anything over $95 at minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: As of 5 October, I closed out my contracts last week when we hit $84 and waited for the dip at $81.

They also manufacture, sell, and manage some of the most premium and best performing consumer staples out there. With a focus on baby care, fabric care, family care, feminine care, grooming, hair care, home care, oral care, personal health care, and skin & personal care. Yeah, that's a fuck ton of categories they play in. And yet, they have market-leading brands in each of these categories.

Without needing to wait for vaccine rumors, travel restriction alleviation, stimulus rallies, & election bullshit P&G has been fucking the proverbial shit up by selling to the 130,000,000 American households a fuckton of toilet paper, paper towels, multipurpose cleaners, dish detergent, laundry detergent, air fresheners, etc. fr the past 7 months. That's right, the empty shelves induced by panic buyer has an undisputable winner - P&G.\n\n[Bath Tissue Aisle - Walmart](https://preview.redd.it/kef2ms10rcq51.jpg?width=730&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a87b705b6341d41c96c63b77f2757cd1ae68cf5)\n\n[Household Cleaning Aisle - Walmart](https://preview.redd.it/bcu3fz31rcq51.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=741f906f6e0aea74bb5f7fa39b96ddde6a78460c)\n\n[Diaper Aisle - Kroger](https://preview.redd.it/wrb186jtwcq51.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2a1aaea739c8b8e65ba93a2ec86944fe607393b)\n\n\"*But hurr durr panic buying has stopped\"*\n\nDon't be a fucking retard.

They mute themselves, turn off the video, and run fucking the washing machine. Lockdown and shelter-in-place has led to an explosion in household chores to include washing and drying clothes. Guess what everybody is wearing at home? Not their fucking dress clothes but casual clothes that are now being redirected to the home washer/dryer rather than out-sourced to dry cleaning services. Literally, the only headwind to P&G's fabric care business is you greasy fucks refreshing the daily thread and sorting by new posts hoping to secure early entry on the next big pump have probably stopped doing laundry altogether.\n\n**Family Care (Charmin, Bounty, Puffs)**  \n[Why toilet-paper demand spiked 845%](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-toilet-paper-demand-spiked-845-how-companies-kept-up-2020-5).\n\nSelf-explanatory. Toilet paper, paper towels, and even tissues have been perpetually out-of-stock. And it's not because we are out of trees to chop down but because pantry loading and consumption have exploded. At home pantry levels are increasing due to fear of another panic buy. Working from home and shitting on company time means you are now using even more toilet paper than before. Staying at home more means you are cleaning more which leads to higher paper towel consumption. Kids learning from home instead of at school means more messes which means more Bounty sales.\n\n**Dish and Air Care** **(Febreze, Dawn, Gain, Cascade)**  \n[Dishwashing Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Supplies Expected to Grow by 275%](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/23/2020697/0/en/Dishwashing-Amid-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Supplies-Expected-to-Grow-by-275-Leading-Manufacturers-Include-Unilever-Procter-Gamble-Henkel-Lion-Corporation-and-Reckitt-Benckiser-Among-Ot.html).\n\nStaying at home and restaurant shut downs means an explosion in home cooking.

Families are stocking the fuck up on diapers and wipes cause they're afraid of rampant out-of-stocks. And I know this one will be hard for your virgins to understand, but once we are 9 months into the pandemic (Dec/Jan) we will see an explosion of new births due to all the stay at home baby making leading to another boom in daiper sales.\n\n**Surface Care** **(Swiffer, Mr. Clean, Microban)**  \n[Sales of cleaning products are skyrocketing during the pandemic](https://www.businessinsider.com/cleaning-product-sales-surge-procter-gamble-pandemic-2020-7).\n\nThis is the big one.

Mommy blogs are fucking writing about how to efficiently clean. Late night talk shows are talking about cleaning. Swiffer and Mr. Clean have been out of stock since March and consumption is through the roof. But that's not even the biggest sign that we are on our way to tendie-town...

In March of 2020 - this fucking year - right when the pandemic hit. P&G launches a new brand that disrupted the sanitization and antibacterial space. A consumer sanitizer that has residual, long lasting, kill and effective on SARS-CoV-2. Competitive santizers only kill bacteria on contact and Microban is able to protect the surface for a 24hr period. This is a groundbreaking product without any competitive parities that launched at the start of the pandemic. Guess what matters to stockholders & the share price? Growth vs. prior year. Guess what blockbuster brand didn't exist in P&G's portfolio in the prior year - Microban. The keyword here is *incrementality*. This killer product, launched at the most serendipitous time, is going to be completely incremental to P&G's revenue and profit and has been completely sold out since the first week of launch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do we know P&G's supply chain can supply all this growth potential?**  \n[The New Construction Approach That Helped P&G Build Their “Plant Of The Future”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2020/02/21/the-new-construction-approach-that-helped-pg-build-their-plant-of-the-future/#7fa5b0d5714d).
