Power is very costly though at like 10x, but if you're doing overnight storage for solar it's fine. \n\nThe biggest thing I think is just this,\n\n[https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=6312](https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=6312)\n\nYou can see they put current energy grid needs at 2.3 TWh/year. That facility is 24 GWh, \tover 800 acres in reservoirs. The project took 7 years to build. To get 2.3 TWh/year that's 96 of them finishing per year (in the entire world to be fair), and 700 projects on that scale being under construction at any time. There's 4 being completed in 2020, a total of like 25 under construction on [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pumped-storage_hydroelectric_power_stations). \n\nIn the same way as with normal hydro power, you build it where you can. It's an awesome natural resource to take advantage of but not plentiful enough to cover the entire grid. And actually, you can build a battery, Now. Tesla built the Australia one in 100 days, if you add on 10% interest for 7 years on construction that turns the $150/kWh to $292/kWh. The battery storage could have been making you a ton of money during those 7 years. \n\nBut current solar prices are best case $0.0135/kWh ([in UAE](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/04/28/abu-dhabis-2-gw-tender-draws-world-record-solar-bid-of-0-0135-kwh/)) I don't think it matters that it's the absolute ideal conditions. Tesla is a worldwide company and customers with ideal conditions will pay the most, we're comparing with ideal locations for pumped storage anyway.\n\nIf you want 12 hours solar, 12 hours batteries then just in UAE you have demand for 128 GWh of batteries (from their current electricity consumption \\* 12 hours). \n\nSame cost for Tesla, \n\n$60/kWh (cells) + $62/kW (installation, inverter) = $122/kW.\n\nWith 8% margin that's $133/kWh customer price. \n\nThey also said 10 years replacement time on battery day, so one cycle per day gets you $0.0364/kWh selling stored battery power. \n\n$0.0135/kWh day time power cost,\n\n$0.0499/kWh night time power cost. \n\nAverage electricity cost: $0.0317/kWh for Tesla battery & current solar. In the US average electricity cost is $0.1/kWh. I guess since we're talking about the UAE it's $0.12, and worldwide average is $0.14/kWh. \n\nBuilding a megaproject and finding reservoirs, 7 years construction is hard. If all you have to do is log into Tesla's website, drag a slider to select how big you want your Megapack, drag it up to 128 GWh, press order, Tesla sends one Ultra Large container class ship loaded up with 520,000 tonne of Megapacks, say 250 Wh/kg, that would be 130 GWh worth of batteries, install it in 100 days or money back. That's the entire UAE done and battery powered. \n\nElectricity cost reduced from $0.12/kWh to $0.0317/kWh. \n\nYou can keep charging $0.12/kWh since maybe you don't even offload the Megapacks from the container ship, you just plug in to your grid and you're done, people won't notice. You paid $17 billion for the batteries off Tesla's website, first year you make $4.1 billion from difference of $0.12/kWh to $0.0317/kWh, it pays itself off in 4 years, ridiculously good. \n\nTesla would be getting TWh worths of orders if they actually sold grid batteries at $133/kWh. They only got like 30 GWh now and they still need to make cars. They said themselves, it's going to be 10 years until they can do 3 TWh, out of the 10 TWh demand. It's supply/demand curve, only way to keep demand in check is by charging 60-80% margins, like they're trying to run a car company here.

Yes it hurts to see the big negatives.  But on the other hand, it just feels so positive to support Tesla. Tesla has matured greatly and is moving to another level.

To speed up adoption the credit should be offered for all electric vehicles, which will make Tesla's a lot cheaper and drive up demand (i.e. instead of an ID.4 netting to $36,500 after its purchase price of $44,000, you can buy a Model 3 SR+, with a purchase price of $38,00, which will net to $30,500 a far more significant thing in terms of affordability...

{"title": "To all of you thinking Tesla just screwed you.", "selftext": "Attention to all. For those of you who are trying to process what is happening right now let me break it down for you. \n\nTesla= What Netflix did to Blockbuster. And blockbuster is currently ever vehicle manufacture on the planet right now. You just don’t see it yet. \n\nThe other day I posted a thoughtful question regarding the long term consequences in the event that Elon created a new ground breaking battery and what that effect that would have on big oil/other vehicle manufactures. The responses varied. \n\nSome of you are mad about this solely because you lost money on the stock in the short term. You failed to account for the fact that Tesla is already worth 40% of the entire ***market cap*** which means the market has already priced this day in. The good news is it's only going to get better from here. \n\nAny company that did not already make the necessary pivot to the EV world is completely fucked. Any of them that did make the pivot will now have to forget everything known about battery tech and start from scratch. This 25k vehicle with the advanced battery and imporved recharge time, extended range, and the fact that it's all made in house and from an abundant resource is going to change the game forever. Also, very few people go from electric back to gas driven so that means every person they grab is a permanent EV driver. \n\n***This is going to decimate the vehicle market.*** and by cornering the market this will make Tesla reign supreme and lord over all. Every vehicle manufacture CEO right now is already planning their ten year exit from the space and the oil industry is about to take a Rochambeau like kick in the nuts. \n\nTesla owns the patent tech on the new batteries so in the event another manufacture tries to compete they will have to license this battery tech from Tesla = money for Tesla. \n\nEvery time Tesla drops its price by 5k it doubles the available matket. They will soon produce a vehicle for 25K which will open the market up to 4x as many people as compared to today = money for Tesla. \n\nTesla will push other auto makers out of business by manufacturing a cheaper vehicle. This will consolidate market share = Big money for Tesla. \n\nEssentially this is the best news you will ever hear as an investor. It's the best 10 year play you could ever make.\n\nSo hold your position, stop crying and look at the big picture so you can be fucking rich! \n\nFor those of you still confused think about the history of the flat screen TV. The first one was damn expensive which only allowed for a select few to purchase it. Those select few that purchased it brought in money which allowed for further R&D and price reduction which opened up an even bigger class of people to afford it. That process occurred over and over and now everybody has a flat screen TV in their house. Tesla just changed the vehicle market forever.\n\n***edit on % of Market Cap***\n\n***2nd edit- With the information of how this will not be out until 2022 and probably late 2022 if not later and how everything in this market is inflated I think I'll share what I'm doing and it's either going to be selling calls on my existing shares to collect the premiums or I'll work out a put play.

This means that consumers *stop* buying energy from utilities entirely, cut their lines, and power their home with solar plus a Tesla powerwall.
