Since every option is a contract that can be sold up until its expiration date, you could technically profit just by timing your purchases and sales of different options contracts. This likely wouldn't be considered market manipulation. \n\nOn the other hand, any time you buy or sell an option, the person you sell to or buy from needs to adjust their positions in the stock markets to maintain a neutral exposure. Many time, it's market makers who are the other guy - and this 'forcing market makers to purchase ... ' will happen even if you're just trying to arbitrage options contracts (and don't have any of the underlying stock, and so won't benefit from its price changing, which is pretty much a prerequisite for market manipulation). \n\nI'm keeping things simple b/c ELI5 but am happy to go a bit more detailed if anyone wants.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "You're reading that from someone who didn't even know that an options contract is a contract for 100 shares. They didn't \"force\" GSCO to buy anything. GSCO is a market maker that exists to provide liquidity including liquidity in the options market. When people trade options, the market maker hedges against that trade with the opposite trade by buying/selling shares or opposite options contract strategies in order to remain neutral to moves in the stock. This is how all market makers function and the only reason it caused a huge move in tech is cause SoftBank is a whale and bought 10 billion dollars worth of amzn, TSLA, googl etc. There's nothing illegal about it, it's just aggressive and it was profitable.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You are right and wrong at the same time. Market makers do take opposite positions, but not in full sized. They may sell a call to you, and buy only 10 or 20 shares. As the stock goes up, they are \"forced\" to buy more shares. \n\nThis effect is compounded a lot when the market makers sold deep out of the money calls. First, they got less premium for selling them. Second, the changes in option price as the stock STARTS to rise is small and seems almost negligible on their balance sheets. However as the call moves closer to in the money or even at the money, the delta starts increasing. When the options get in the money the delta starts to approach 1.  \n\nThe fact that delta increases as the stock heads up into the money is a big problem and makes the market makers trapped. They MUST buy more shares, even if they are delta-hedged. Why? Because the rate of change of delta starts increasing. \n\nThis is the important part. Even if they are delta hedges (hedged against the stock moving up) they are often NOT gamma hedged (hedged against delta itself increasing). \n\nZero hedge and others pointed out that the last 2 week of explosive upward movement was due to the market makers and others being short gamma... In english, the out of the money calls started moving in the money and delta (how much an option moves when the stock moves) began increasing to such an extent that the market makers were ALL behind the curve and couldn't keep up. Just trying to stay hedged was pushing the market up more which made them need to hedge more.\n\n It's essentially a short squeeze. All the market makers were in a short squeeze.

If they didn't do it and thus ended up trapped in a gamma squeeze/convexity squeeze then that's their mistake. \n\nAgain I'm not saying SoftBank is innocent in all their trading activities. This was an incredibly aggressive and well-timed bet, but it wasn't illegal or manipulative IMO. The fact that market makers ended up trapped in a squeeze is due to their own poor risk management. Also, it's not like it was ONLY SoftBank that caused this.

There's significant ring-fencing that occurs in almost all financial services companies these days (whether they are banks, brokers, asset managers, rating agencies, insurance companies, etc). I'm not just talking about Chinese Walls, I'm talking about total and complete legal indemnification. It's meant to REDUCE risks. The securities operations of a bank is very different from the lending side. You can (and do) have banks lending to a company utilizing their balance sheet, while their equity analysts have sell ratings on the same company. That does NOT create legal jeopardy for them. \n\n2. Rating analysts have broad, and sometimes complete, autonomy in their take on the rating they attach to any INDIVIDUAL credit (there are numerous committees that set general overarching standards, then others that set levels for specific sectors, and so forth). You have absolutely no concept of the number of layers that separate an individual VP/MD assigning a credit rating on a company and the President of the institution itself (and I don't mean seniority levels, but layers of insulation) . I GUARENFUCINGTEE you that there are no conflicts of interests, real or imagined, between the credit ratings side of the business and the Index side of the business. They can ABSOLUTELY have contrary views on the same underlying business. Analysts don't strive for cohesion in views. I can't explain to you just how frustrating it is that someone can't grasp this basic principle. IF things worked the way you suggest (i.e. that there must a unified view on a company across the multiple business lines) then you would see analysts being pressured to change their ratings on companies all the time. An example is when a bank serves as an underwriter for an IPO but their research arm gives the same IPO a sell rating. The industry isn't close to perfect and I genuinely do hate sell-side research, but by your standard, anyone investing in an IPO would sue the underwriter that's PROMOTING the IPO by pointing to their research desk that gave the company a sell rating. You know why these lawsuits don't happen literally everyday? Because the businesses are stand-alone entities, the opinions of research analysts is their own and there is no cross pollination of business side decisions (amongst many, many other reasons). \n\n3. Beyond just that, there is no real contradiction here to begin with. The S&P Index committee is mostly comprised of people that have NOTHING to do with the S&P, the corporate entity, itself. Not only that, the committee gives itself ample wiggle room in its charter. Here's something you might want to read: https://www.indexologyblog.com/2014/08/07/inside-the-sp-500-an-active-committee/\n\n4. Not including TSLA into the S&P does not mean that the credit of the company is terrible or that it's insolvent. The S&P 500 is an index. Just because YOU believe that two (i.e. index inclusion and credit rating) are linked, does not mean that any reasonable person would. \n\nI get it, you're emotional about this issue, and you've been consistently wrong on the facts. You thought the decision to split and do the $5bn stock issuance was a liquidity event that Musk undertook because the Index asked them to create liquidity. I get that you don't get that that is insane and would never, ever, ever happen. But as I said earlier, the current share price of the company and the bull thesis implies that TSLA will sell more and more cars (at least 500k this year), so eventual addition to the Index is inevitable. \n\nPlease stop with these trashy and ill-conceived conspiracy theories.

Panasonic has 30 GWh/year right now which at an average of 60 kWh per battery pack delivers capacity for 500k units per year. The semi would get only 30k units per year out of that production.\n\nSo we know Panasonic plans to increase battery density (which reduces the number of cells) and added some lines recently but long term I don't think they'll cross 40 GWh/year long term. The original plan of over 100 GWh/year for GF1 will probably not be done by Panasonic alone, if only it is because the additional capex is huge, it would cost Tesla/Panasonic nearly $10B to get there. Luckily those 40 GWh support 2/3 of a million units per year for the US continent so the 3/Y can be supported a little longer. \n\nLong term to get beyond the battery deals and expand into semi and compact car they'll need an insane amount of batteries. The capex/GWh/year at GF1 was around $150M and I expect them to need an additional 100 GWh/year to keep up with just the automotive requirements in 2024. That would cost $15B in capex just in batteries alone, which is insane. \n\nSo what price do I expect for battery day?

On a long enough timeline that stock will rise.  \n\nCombine this with fiscal responsibility, i.e. only using money you don‚Äôt need, and it‚Äôs hard to do it wrong.  Even if you bought at a peak the valley your heading into will get erased over time.\n\nOptions have an extra layer of complexity in that you have a ticking clock.  A short timeline will expose you to more peaks and valleys, now your mistake of buying on a peak has very expensive consequences that you can‚Äôt avoid.  \n\nThe only reason I‚Äôm doing options is because I already have enough shares that, if a moderate bull thesis is correct, I can retire on, the options plays are just extra.\n\nThat said, I like your choice of 2022.  It is far enough out that it gives you time to avoid short term capital gains tax and still choose a nice peak to sell at.\n\nThe thing I‚Äôve noticed is that choosing a strike price above your current price is still profitable.  The steady climb to your strike price, still translates into profit on the climb, but not nearly as much as once you cross the price, then your gains begin to become multiplied.\n\nSo you are sitting on a pile of money that you don‚Äôt need.  You are looking at options.  As far as I see it there are three factors that seem simple but are not:\n\n1: Current price:  if you can wait for a valley you can lower your risk, get the option at a cheaper price and improve your choices on 2 and 3.  So patience is the key here.\n\n2: Expiration date.  This has been covered, and the obvious answer is further into the future is better, but there is such a thing as too far.  If you don‚Äôt have the patience to wait, or your funds are limited, too far can use up all your cash and force you to choose too high of a strike price.  Don‚Äôt let too much #2 limit your #3.\n\n3: Strike price.  The lower the better.

{"title": "TSLA the biggest pump and dump in human history", "selftext": "Softbank put huge amounts of money on tech calls to drive up the price. I decided to find out how much this would effect the stock. There's currently about 50 billion dollars in calls on Tesla and 5 billion on puts. A call ATM has about .5 delta which means the market makers are force to delta hedge about 50 shares. The total delta hedge on Tesla should be about 77 billion which is about 20% of the market cap of 389 billion. Now 20% is significant, however Tesla has already fallen by 20% this week. \n\nTheres also a possibility that HFT is chasing the momentum and affecting the price. \" It is estimated that 50 percent of stock trading volume in the U.S. is currently being driven by computer-backed high frequency trading. Also known as algo or algortihmic trading. \"\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/h/high-frequency-trading](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/h/high-frequency-trading)\n\nEveryone knows the tech price are high. Elon sent prices into overdrive with the split. Then he announced a 5 billion dollar public offering to pay off there debt (worried about future cash issues?), which the shares will likely be priced below market value due to the volatility sending prices even lower. Elons brother sells right after the split knowing it would be ATH.\n\nMy thought process? Negative news will cause people to close there call options. TSLA won't be added to S&P. People are already anticipating high volatility during election, so large institutions will hedge with puts, causing more delta hedging of the stock downward. Market makers already have low gamma exposure, which means rather than focus on reducing volatility for long term profits, they will have to sell when others sell and buy when others buy causing increased volatility which leads to lower prices. Also the dark pool index is low meaning its becoming illiquid and a crash could cause large corporations to have to sell on the actual stock market causing huge price movements. The public offering on TSLA will likely cause the stock to creep lower as well. \n\nSo a possible timeline: \n\nTuesday: TSLA drops 2-5% due to the S&P news, as well as the insider trading news.

Just warning you guys that the methods majority of this community use are totally unsustainable, in case you haven't already realized that by now.\n\nI had to lose a shitload of money before I figured out what works for me, and being a former autist like yourselves, I can assure you that the methods employed on here are NOT FUCKING IT. Seriously, TSLA can cover up how much you actually suck at trading for only so long.\n\nEven the minority lotto winners on here whose YOLOs hit and made 50k, 100k, 500k, and so on...will inevitably give nearly all of their tendies back (if they haven't already)...unless they walked away with their gains and completely stopped ~~gambling~~ trading. A very small percentage of them have the discipline to liquidate majority of the profit and start over again from 5k, though it's very unlikely given the general nature of addict..err...autist behavior.\n\nI don't swing trade anymore because that style of trading has cost me tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, I take small risks and gains each day and come back for more tomorrow. Over and over and fucking over. Nothing exotic or sexy like a 0day YOLO FD you can brag about to your wife's boyfriend, but I will tell you that over a few months, the small ball tendies add up, and the days of my account seeing blood are now far and few between.\n\nFact is, swing trading options only works in the long term for a very small fraction of the trading population who posses all of the following: a keen eye for digging through news, filings, tweets, unusual options activity, and data to foresee where a stock or the broader market is heading before the market does (DD wizardry); frighteningly accurate technical analysis acumen for candle reading, identifying support/resistance, moving averages, overbought/oversold conditions, patterns, etc (meticulous chartist); and last but not least, knowing when it's time to get into a position, add more to it, and when to gtfo (risk management pro). Sure, a little luck comes into play as well, but with those other 3 bases covered, these guys have their risk/reward and probabilities down to the point where they know which strike and expiry is most likely to ensure a home run, even if shit gets choppy.\n\nI am not one of those people and I have accepted that. Have YOU? Or are you still going to continue to delude yourself into believing you are, fooling yourself into believing you will eventually reach that elite level status of being a profitable, professional swing trader? (That was a rhetorical question, you autist fuck.)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nUPDATE: Just woke up and have too many comments to respond to so I'll just add a few words right up here. I also took down the two week 85k --> 100k account balance history pic and links to my August & first week of Sept performance because it's coming across the wrong way and it was not my intention to flex, just to further prove my point.\n\nFirst off, to those of you who replied and stated this thread doesn't belong here...fuck off and stfu. I dedicated MONTHS of my time following this sub this year and digging through the myraid of absolute fucking garbage posted on a daily basis, trying to find what I thought were gem posts and brilliant ideas hidden in the midst, and it really fucked me up. I'm talking an amount of money that is soul crushing and depresses the fuck out of you. And unlike majority of you, I have nothing to hide or prove. I have used this same reddit handle for years and you can search my post history to determine if I'm legit or not. And if I came across as a total fucking asshole, it's because this sub makes me angry af, kind of like when you bump into that skank at the grocery store you were with for years who cheated on you the entire time (besides your wife).\n\nAnd yes, August was absolutely one of the easiest months to trade in years. Not denying that at all. I'm not trying to sound like I'm holier than thou coming off a great month, because I've had months where it seemed like anything I did made money, and months where I gave it all back and nothing worked in the past, and then nuked my portfolio. The difference is, before, I was throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, and now I go into each day with an actual plan and a handful of stocks I intend to make plays on, as well as a few outliers when needed. On my bad days I don't give back a month's worth of gains anymore. Those days are over. I'm prepared for a correction, another kangaroo market, or a bounce back up. That's the difference between having rules in place and the blind following the blind.\n\nI am not theta ganging as I can assure that has a nasty side to it as well when it goes wrong (already been burned with that too, just not as bad). I rarely hold positions past a day so those of you asking for me to post positions as proof, I have none. But I'm not even going to go into the tactics I use because what works for me may be a total disaster for you, so I'm just not going there. That's exactly how I fucked myself on here. Just address the things I mentioned above, find a style you can be consistent with based on your personality and risk appetite, maybe even seek out and talk with people who have had consistent success, and the rest will come over time. When you are in a rush, that's how you get totally fucked by the market.

When I started employing these rules I would focus on making $500 each day, and once I did I would stop. I would close the day in cash almost every time. Most days I would only make 1-2 trades, and some days I made exactly $500, some days I made $2000 on one trade. If I lost $500 I would stop and try again tomorrow with a clear head. Now that daily limit is much higher. It‚Äôs all about discipline. I have a notebook where I track all my trades and evaluate them, and the days I lose are the days I break these rules nearly every single time. Here are the rules:\n\n\n1. Only trade with general trend. Example: if trend is bullish only buy calls at support and sell at resistance or ride up as it breaks resistance. Don‚Äôt buy puts at resistance and ride down to support when the market trend is bullish. \n2. Never risk enough to fall under $25k. \n3. Always set stop loss at -20%. Never ever ever ever hold a position past -20%. Sell it and put the remaining capital to work in a winning position. \n4. Never trade in the first hour. Let prices get established.\n5. Take gains as soon as the trend breaks, the first break. \n6. 1-2 positions at a time. When I started this system it was 1 at a time but now I have 2 going some days. \n7. Focus on winning each trade and making a net gain, whatever that gain is. Do not focus dollar amounts. \n8. Diamond hands only applies to the winners. Cut the losers short and don‚Äôt baghold a losing position hoping for a turn around. \n9. Never get sucked into a meme. Do your own research. \n10. Order flow and volume are all that matter\n\nEdit: to clarify I am daytrading with this strategy and only buy ITM calls/puts with high delta. I don‚Äôt buy OTM unless it‚Äôs a position I am holding long term, and in that case I only buy 60+ DTE and then only 5-10% OTM. I rarely do this anymore, I almost exclusively daytrade ITM.

I learned a lot about TA since the beginning and have applied it to swing trades and let me tell you, I‚Äôve never been more successful in trading options.\n\nMy worst moves have come from holding options over the next day.\n\nI use MACD indicators and bollinger bands on the 1, 5, and 15 min to time my entry for the day. 30 min-1 day to be on the lookout for any potential shitshows. I.e when AMD was severely overbought and the daily/weekly was indicating a potential sell off, I sell calls at low gains but my puts I would hold longer if there was a sharp red 1 min candle cause I felt there was a better chance of a continued drop.\n\nHowever, I don‚Äôt let my emotions get a hold of me in my trades. So far I‚Äôve settled for 20% gains. This has screwed me in only one way so far: I could‚Äôve made so much more money.\n\nHad a Moderna call profit $1000 when it could‚Äôve netted $6000\nAnd two ZM puts that made me net $3400 that could‚Äôve made me nearly $40,000 if I held to the bottom.\n\nBut see, by trading out when I‚Äôm profitable, I have gone from $500 to $7300 in three weeks. When I used to hold options over till next day, I would lose so much money. Buying long dated puts in this market was silly because you could never time a big drop that would make the premium worth it, and the calls scared me because if it dropped so hard I might never recover the delta.\n\nSo, hence day trading options. I buy ITM weeklies, and when I‚Äôm not feeling confident about the move, I just trade stock with more of my portfolio. Example was end of the week going into Labor Day. I waited for an entry point on SPY and bought some UPRO. And even during a continued sell off, I was able to time an entry that was only 1% off from the actual bottom of the day. \n\nI recommend more people try day trading. I do however agree that most people here buy and hold and hope for giant leaps to offset their losses. I lost $16k in the market with that attitude and the only consistent winning streak I have had was using technical indicators and support/resistance.\n\nEdit: also, if you‚Äôre not willing to learn the hard tricks of trading successfully, you shouldn‚Äôt trade.

{"title": "Intel : the big picture and why I'm bullish on it", "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple‚Äôs stock shouldn‚Äôt obsess with near-term iPhone sales. ‚ÄúThe idea that you‚Äôre going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,‚Äù he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader‚Äôs methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely o solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm‚Äôs acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye‚Äôs could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel‚Äôs operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel‚Äôs PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm‚Äôs Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel‚Äôs pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\n\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.\n\n\nEdit : positions 74000 in Intel Jan 2022 55 calls. https://imgur.com/GxExa8T.jpg", "id": "inrj01", "created_utc": 1599418079.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "Not bad at all.

You're focusing on the wrong aspect. Here's a link that shows the real shake up.\n\n \nSANTA CLARA, Calif., July 27, 2020 ‚Äì Today, Intel CEO Bob Swan announced changes to the company‚Äôs technology organization and executive team to accelerate product leadership and improve focus and accountability in process technology execution. Effective immediately, the Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group (TSCG) will be separated into the following teams, whose leaders will report directly to the CEO:\n\nTechnology Development, led by Dr. Ann Kelleher.¬†An accomplished Intel leader, Kelleher has been head of Intel manufacturing, where she ensured continuous operations through the COVID-19 pandemic while increasing supply capacity to meet customer needs and accelerating the ramp of Intel‚Äôs 10nm process. She will now lead Intel technology development focusing on 7nm and 5nm processes.¬†Dr. Mike Mayberry, who has been leading Technology Development, will consult and assist in the transition until his planned retirement at the end of the year. Mayberry has a 36-year track record of innovation at Intel, during which he has made key contributions in technology development and as the leader of Intel Labs.Manufacturing and Operations, led by Keyvan Esfarjani.¬†Esfarjani most recently led manufacturing for Intel‚Äôs Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG), in which role he set the vision and strategy for Intel‚Äôs memory manufacturing and led a rapid expansion of capacity. He will now lead global manufacturing operations and continue Kelleher‚Äôs work driving product ramp and the build-out of new fab capacity.Design Engineering, led in the interim by Josh Walden while Intel conducts an accelerated global search to identify a permanent world-class leader.¬†Walden is a proven leader in technology manufacturing and platform engineering. Most recently, he has been leading the Intel Product Assurance and Security Group (IPAS), which will continue to report to him.Architecture, Software and Graphics will continue to be led by Raja Koduri.¬†Koduri has responsibility for driving the development of Intel‚Äôs architecture and software strategy, and dedicated graphics product portfolio. Under his leadership, we will continue to invest in our software capability as a strategic asset and further build-out software engineering with cloud, platform, solutions and services expertise.Supply Chain will continue to be led by Dr. Randhir Thakur.¬† Thakur will report directly to the CEO as chief supply chain officer, recognizing the ever-growing importance of this role and our relationships with key players in the ecosystem. Thakur and his team are charged with ensuring supply chain is a competitive advantage for Intel.\n\nAs a result of these changes, Murthy Renduchintala will leave Intel on Aug. 3, 2020.\n\n‚ÄúI look forward to working directly with these talented and experienced technology leaders, each of whom is committed to driving Intel forward during this period of critical execution,‚Äù said Swan. ‚ÄúI also want to thank Murthy for his leadership in helping Intel transform our technology platform. We have the most diverse portfolio of leadership products in our history and, as a result of our six pillars of innovation and disaggregation strategy, much more flexibility in how we build, package and deliver those products for our customers.‚Äù\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-changes-technology-organization/", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1.
