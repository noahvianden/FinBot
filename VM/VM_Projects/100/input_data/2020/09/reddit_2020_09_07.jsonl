The reason that there is no guarantee is that you need to consider the cost of closing the trade. It's a short position, so you have to cover the short. You will collect the full $1.90 up front, but you might have to pay $0.50 to close, so you'll net $1.40 when all is said and done.\n\n> If the price goes above $60, let's assume someone exercises. So now I've made $21,660 + (114 * 100 * 60) = $705,660. Question 2: Is this math right?\n\nNo, because you will have exited the trade before that happens. But let's say you fell into a coma and couldn't exit. If that scenario happened, your total P/L would be ((60 - 24.75) x 11400) + (1.90 x 114 x 100). Essentially, you get the gain on the stock put up for collateral, up to the $60 strike, and you keep the credit from the calls. \n\nIf SHLL actually goes up to $70 on expiration, you don't get the extra $10 gain. You get the gain described above for $60. This is the biggest downside to CCs when it comes to rising stock value. $60, $70, $100, you get the same amount of money no matter how high it goes above $60.\n\n> Question 3: If the price never reaches $60, I keep the premium?\n\nYes, less the cost of closing.\n\n> Question 4: the only \"risk\" here is if the price goes way above $60 and I miss out on those gains, right? Or if the stock plummets below 24.75\n\nCorrect. The latter is the big risk. If SHLL falls to $2, the credit you earned on the calls won't make up for the loss on the stock.\n\n> How the fuck is this not free money? $60's goddamn fine by me. In order to find the strikes with the highest probability of getting picked up, should I be looking at just straight volume/OI, or should I factor any Greeks into the planning?\n\nIt's not free money for the reasons already mentioned: capped gains, all the downside risk of the shares by themselves.\n\nDon't worry about \"getting picked up\". It's an auction. You'll get a fill if you offer a price that someone else is willing to pay. You'll just need to make sure you have a broker that can handle trades of that size and not charge you an arm and a leg to do it.\n\nYou should indeed consider the expiration date (9/18 is too close to today, IMO -- try 30 to 45 days out, you'll get more premium that way and will have more time to adjust if bad shit happens), volume/OI and greeks. They are all important. You want high volume, narrow bid/ask on the strike, just like trading stocks. You want IV to be as high as possible, without taking on too much risk -- IV is usually higher closer to the money, but closer to the money is higher risk for a short call.\n\nDoes SHLL pay a dividend? If it does, some additional care is needed around the exdiv data. Google \"options dividend risk\" if needed.\n\nI would recommend doing a trial run first, with just one contract. Get a feel for how CCs work before committing that much money. As already mentioned, plan on exiting early, don't hold until expiration. It's not as much of an issue for a covered call, since you are okay with getting called away, but say at expiration SHLL is $59.80 and you think you are going to squeeze by with max credit and keep your shares, but after hours SHLL jumps up to $80 and your calls are assigned and you only get $60 a share.

I've never let one expire.\n\n> Doesn't the option buyer still expect my 100 shares to be available until expiry?\n\nIf they don't own the contract any more, because you bought it back, they have no say in the matter. Remember, if you are buying back for a lower price, *they* lost money on the deal. So they might be very happy to unload a losing contract for whatever they can get for it.\n\nThe above is an oversimplification -- you never interact with an individual on the other side of the trade. Who you sell to and who you \"buy back\" from could be two different people/institutions. But those details don't really matter. All that matters is that you can close the trade at any time before expiration, as long as you can do it for a price you find acceptable.

You can estimate that by looking up your current delta. Relative to the ATM strike at that expiration, your position has a current delta of around 43.

On the flip side, what if AAPL moons to $200 next week. What profit is a good enough profit to exit, so you can buy in again at a lower cost of entry and ride up some more? If you decide to hold, you should write down those up and down targets and stick to them. Also, decide an a maximum wait and see time. If you hold for X more days and nothing changes, time to bail.

If you tell them to invest and it happens to go down, they will blame you. If you want to boil this rule down to its core maybe just this you don't need to tell anyone how large of a position you have in TSLA and doing so might create more problems than its worth.\n\n**2) ~~You don't talk about $TSLA~~, sorry habit**\n\t\nFight Club Reference, for the lulz\n\n**3) Never write covered calls against $TSLA**\n\t\nThe few times I've written covered calls even when I thought they were \"safe\" or \"who cares I can just buy back in on Monday\", They have failed me, shares ripped from my hands and growth so large that I couldn't afford to get back in. Also, if your calls are ITM at expiration you might have to deal with tax implications because you were not really planning on having the shares sold you just wanted that sweet premium. This rule also covers naked calls, but I would think that is a no brainer.\n\n**4) Don't FOMO buy in after stock doubles in 1 month**\n\t\nJust beware of FOMO in general, the stock afterhours about a week ago was 540, people were FOMOing hard and as of now it’s down 150 points or so (750 presplit), those people could have just waited a little bit for a pullback instead of piling in at the top last Monday the stock went up 70 points during trading hours (350) presplit that is unheard of, most people should have assumed there would be a slight pull back if nothing else just some consolidation.\n\n**5) Do the opposite of whatever the mainstream media declares about $TSLA**\n\t\nThis rule is a little old, It comes from a time when everyone was bashing on TSLA, but basically the news exists to sell advertising, and when they aren't doing that they have an agenda. Back then, the powers that be were making tons of FUD about TSLA, so it was imperative that you ignore what they were saying and in that case invert what they were telling you, They say sell probably a good time to buy. This rule may become more useful in the coming days as I feel the FUD is ramping up again.\n\n**6) Don't compare $TSLA to bitcoin**\n\t\nBitcoin is worth whatever people think it is worth it does not provide any value. Tesla produces a lot and will produce much more in the future, and the stock reflects that. People might be paying more than fundamentally worth but as long as the future continues to pan out as it is looking to then the shares should continue to appreciate.\n\n**7) Buy low, Don't sell, well ok if you have to, sell high (stock price)**\n\t\nPretty straight forward, if you need to sell to deleverage, buy a house, etc. that’s fine, but are you selling because you think the stock price is high, it \"was a bubble at 800 bubble at 1500, bubble at 2000, bubble at 2500\", just because you think its high it can always go higher, besides what are you going to invest in if not TSLA, GLD?\n\n**8) If someone claims to be a bull, but their posts don't align, you know whats up**\n\t\nMany people would post in the subreddit and they always looked the same. \"I'm Elon's biggest fan, [insert FUD]\". \"I'm the biggest bull on TSLA, [Insert FUD]\" basically it is a warning that if a person has a disclaimer, they might not be genuine.\n\n**9) After-hours on TSLA is for chumps, pay no mind to after-hours (Only applies to down-movement)**\n\t\nExtended hours trading trades on low volume, options market is not available. The real action is during standard trading day.\n\n**10) If this is your first post on TIC, you have to buy stock**\n\t\nAnother fight club joke, but probably good advice, you need some skin in the game to have a real opinion IMO.\n\n**11) Don't use a stop loss on $TSLA**\n\t\nWhen you enter a stop loss its registered in the system the brokerages can see where its placed, and TSLA is very volatile, so there have been historically swings that can shoot the stock down trigger stop losses and then extreme buying pressure comes in and blows out the stock. Now you are out of stock, sold low, and will have trouble getting in. Also, many people putting in stop loses exacerbates sell offs creating avalanches on the tiniest little downtick.\n\nedit: Thanks for the gildings, likes and comments all", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "These rules are WAY better with the explainations.  10/10, would read again.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "These deserve to be carved out in stone tabs", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I give you these 17 rules **SMASH***, 11, 11 rules for all to obey", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "All good points. 👍", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good stuff esp #1.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "For #3 I've been wondering if pushing the stock price up has been an intentional strategy to buy the shares off of people who wouldn't otherwise sell them.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve done okay with selling covered calls.

Time and more independent testing will provide more details. \n\nMore Frunk space-Not the top priority for most people buying  EV’s especially at the $150,000 level. Any company can produce a EV with an even bigger Frunk if consumers demand it in the future. \n\nI can see it now Lucid driver pulls up next to a model S driver and points to the larger Frunk.

The car is the nicest looking EV I’ve seen and it has to be to sell in the high end luxury vehicle market. They will sell every unit they produce especially at low production rates at first.

Intel’s NEW mobile products are 4 core vs amd’s 8 cores at the same tdp (under 28w category). Intel doesn’t have a single 8 core sku in the low power segment. This is on paper- they haven’t even released the product and they are behind. It may be slightly faster per core but they haven’t released concrete benchmarks!! [In reality the only bench they would do better on is probably gaming. Plus the benchmarks they did do with word and PowerPoint weren’t with other crap like irl but JUST one app at a time.] (Opinion)\n\n2. All nvidia perf graphs compared xx80 versions. So even though the graph had 3080 being twice as fast as 2080 - - it’s not 2x 2080 super. (So, 2x 2080 actually means 2x 1080ti in 4K gaming- which is a 3-4 y/o card)\n\n3. Nvidia’s presentation charts look good perf wise and they will deliver- - at 4K.  They ran all benchmarks at 4K and with rtx on if possible.\n\n4. One of the reasons the 4K perf is so high is the next gen memory arch. which allows for more memory bandwidth. This is one of the big sources of gains this time- but only on higher resolutions. Read: at lower, more common resolutions, those chips may not be near as fast.\n\n5. The gpus run hot and are some of the largest chips to date. They went with Samsung 8nm and cheaped out instead of Samsung 5 nm or tsmc 7 nm. They are also (Self-admittedly) sensitive to old psu so many people upgrading may experience issues. (High return rate)\n\nRegardless of all this there are plenty of people who will buy these brands regardless of performance - and that remains to be seen once people actually bench the cards. IMO these cards only look good because the 2000 series was a tiny improvement and the prices were high. However rtx titles and exclusive features and fomo peer pressure will probably drive most decisions.\n\nI can’t know what competition will be like- but for the first time AMD is super tight lipped, and nvidia was afraid enough to bring out the big guns with smaller prices.

It's always \"wait for AMD's this\" and \"wait for AMD's that\" and at the end of they day they don't deliver and even if they have something competitive FROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT **noone buys their shit because 1) NVDA's marketing is light years ahead 2) NVDA's software is light years ahead.** The AMD fangang seems to believe that just because AMD *could* deliver something competitive in terms of $ for compute that means they are going to \"eat market share\" or initiate a \"shift of power over time like against Intel\". $ for compute neither means $ for FPS nor $ for the overall experience (eg not getting broken ass drivers). Just look at the size of r/AMD_Stock and the size of r/NVDA_Stock and then look at the market and mindshare and what's actually going on. This cult-like following of AMD's stock has emerged because AMD is/was the underdog, because competition helps consumers and because AMD's share price is/was affordable for the kind of loser that would buy a Radeon card. Noone that isn't an AMD fanboy is unironically waiting for RDNA2 when they need a GPU now. In fact the average consumer doesn't even know what RDNA2 is, they may not even know that AMD also produces GPUs. The tech-community-bubble greatly overestimates the knowledge of a consumer that buys a new pre-built PC every 4-5 years. The mindshare tax that NVDA paid with the expensive Turing cards didn't even translate into less market share, just less overall GPU sales and this all during a time AMD's products we were supposed to wait for had already arrived. Furthermore with that Turing release NVDAbuilt USPs that will secure market share for the foreseeable future. If you think raytracing you think RTX and believe me there are many consumers out there that would either think that NVDA invented raytracing or that RTX literally means raytracing. DLSS 2.0 has emerged as an equally if not more important feature to which AMD has no answer to and if they're going to refer to any non AI upscaling method they don't know what they're talking about because DLSS 2.0 is a literal game-breaker. Then there's innovative software like RTX broadcast (formerly RTX voice) and NVIDIA reflex. Every single streamer will want to get RTX broadcast and these streamers have a lot of influence nowadays. Even if AMD had any answers to all the stuff NVDA has pulled out the last 2 years NVDA was first to the market and built brands before AMD even had any, and this is just talking software/marketing.
