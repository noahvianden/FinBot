{"title": "How to be Wrong and Still Make Money: A comprehensive guide to selling credit spreads", "selftext": "So I first dipped my toes into options trading a few years ago. I had previously been swing trading stocks so I had a couple years of experience before that, but the leverage and potential returns that options provided really piqued my interest. After it was all said and done, I lost almost $20,000 buying options. After realizing that someone was getting all of this money I was losing, I learned about option selling and haven’t looked back since.\n\nI recently posted my YTD performance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/i0mkv3/10k_to_100k_in_5_months_23k_in_deposits_and_67k/), and received a lot of questions about how I did it. My strategy changed over time, but I first started with credit spreads, which may be applicable to more people since it’s a strategy that works with smaller accounts too. I got a lot of questions about how I played credit spreads and it’s tough to completely explain what I do through a comment here and a comment there so I created this guide explaining my exact approach to trading credit spreads. Here you go:\n\nThis is a wall of text, so if you're a more visual learner, here's a link to videos explaining all four parts:\n\n[Part One](https://youtu.be/J12HR1Ax2k0)\n\n[Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mlknat5qA)\n\n[Part Three](https://youtu.be/Uu7_8856nZw)\n\n[Part Four](https://youtu.be/2p5nlczCcFo)\n\n#Part One: The Basics\n\nSo what is a spread? A high level conceptual explanation is that you’re essentially betting on a stock to finish above or below a certain price upon expiration. One of the advantages here is that you can set this number out of the money, so if a stock is trading at $100, you can bet that it’ll remain below $110 by a certain date. This is a bearish position, so if you’re correct and it goes down, you’ll make max profit. The catch though is that even if you’re wrong, you basically have a 10% upward cushion before you start to lose any money. So the easiest way to describe it is a strategy that lets you make money if you’re right, but also make money if you’re slightly off.\n\nHow does it work? So in the above example, if we were bearish on a stock we would open what’s called a call credit spread. We could set it up where we sell a 110c for a credit of $1.50, and buy a 115c for a debit of $0.50. This means that in this transaction we receive $1.50, and pay $0.50 for a net credit of $1. That credit is your max profit on the play. If you’re familiar with options you’ll know that if the stock finishes at or below $110 upon expiration, both of these calls will be worthless. That’s great news for us because the long leg we bought (115c) for 0.50 will be a loss, but we’ll get to keep the full $1.50 from the short leg (110c) that we sold, resulting in us realizing our max gain on the trade of $1.\n\nWhy not just sell the 110c and collect the full $1.50? While it cuts into our profits, the reason we buy the 115c in this example for $0.50 isn’t to cut into our profits when we’re correct, but rather protect us when we’re wrong. If the stock in the example stays below $110, we’re good to go and we’ll hit max profit. But what if it goes to $120, $150, or something crazy happens and it hits $200. If the stock hits $150 upon expiration, that 110c that we sold for $1.50 will be worth $40, meaning that we’ll incur a $3,875 loss in pursuit of a $150 gain. We’ve seen crazy run ups from the likes of TSLA and ZM lately, and people who sold what we call “naked options” got absolutely killed. With our spread, yes our 110c will be worth $40 meaning we’re down $4,000 on that position, but the 115c we bought behind it will be worth $35 meaning we’re up $3,500 there for a net loss of $500. Additionally, we get to keep that $1.00 credit we received up front no matter what, so our loss with this spread is actually $500-$100=$400 as opposed to the $3,875 loss that we would’ve seen had we sold the 110c by itself. THAT is the value in selling a spread as opposed to a naked option.\n\nWhy are you multiplying everything by 100? Each options contract is worth 100 shares, so a contract that is trading for $1.50 actually costs $150 to purchase.\n\nAnother high level point I like to make is that there are really 5 different things that can happen when you make a play. Let’s say you think a stock will go up. It can (1) go up a ton and you’d be correct, (2) go up a little and you’d be correct, (3) trade flat and you’d be incorrect, (4), go down a little and you’d be incorrect, or (5) go down a lot and you’d be incorrect. With a bullish spread, you’d hit max profit on 4/5 , or 80% of the possible outcomes, whereas if you bought stock or purchased an option you’d only be profitable on (1) or (2). Obviously the actual outcomes are a little more complex, but for a base-level understanding of the advantages a spread provides, I think this is a good way to look at it.\n\nSo that’s the value of a spread. A lot of traders are introduced to option selling and are scared of the prospect of incurring a huge loss like we mentioned above, but using credit spreads is a great way of receiving the benefits that selling has to offer while limiting a lot of the risks. So let’s move onto actually opening a spread.\n\n\n#Part Two: Making the Trade\nSo for actually opening a spread up, we have a four-step approach we take: Pick a Stock Pick a Direction Pick a Strike Price Execute the Trade\n\n**1: Picking a Stock:**\n\nOne of the most important things I tell people is to trade what you know. I have a watchlist of 25-30 stocks that I watch and get familiar with during the day. That way if I recognize a good opportunity, I’ll have a decent base of knowledge to rely on to make what I feel is a smart play. It’s super easy to get caught up in the “stock of the week” and try to jump in on a play because a ticker is in the news. If you’re not familiar with a stock, don’t trade it.\n\nFor this example (the one used in the video), Wayfair was trading in a 195-210 range for a little bit and then had a big day where it broke up out of that range and up towards $220. This was an unusual move that I noticed since it was on my watchlist, so I decided to make a play.\n\nSTOCK: WAYFAIR\n\n**2: Picking a direction:**\n\nSo if we look at Wayfair’s YTD chart, it has exploded this year. A clear upward trend, but a recent trend that I noticed from following the stock was that every time it broke out like this, there would be a little bit of a pullback afterwards. Additionally, I felt the stock was overvalued on a fundamental basis (had a negative book value at the time of the trade) so I wanted to play this stock back down. This is probably the quickest and easiest step of the four, since you’ll likely already have an opinion on most of the stocks that you follow.\n\nDIRECTION: DOWN\n\n**3:Picking a Strike Price:**\n\nSo we know that we’re going to be playing Wayfair back down, but now the question is what spread are we going to set up to do that. In this example Wayfair was trading at $218.42 at the time that we decided to make this trade. In the video we illustrate a trading channel that Wayfair was at the top of. It was also approaching the ATH of $221.54. A lot of the time that will act as resistance for a stock, meaning it’ll bounce down off of it. So in order to give ourselves a bit of a cushion we decided to set our short leg at 222.50, meaning that we’re playing the stock to stay below $222.50 by the end of that week.\n\nSo with this play it means in plain English that if we’re correct and the stock goes down, we hit max profit. But if we’re wrong and it goes up, we still have a $4.08 cushion before we’re not hitting max profit anymore. So we could be a little wrong, have the stock go up a few dollars, and still walk away with max profit.\n\nSTRIKE PRICE OF SHORT LEG: $222.50\n\n**4: Executing the Trade:**\n\nI’ll be the first to tell you that when I started trading spreads I didn’t realize you could open both legs of the spread at once. I was stupid. I would like to think I’m at least a little bit smarter now. If you look at the options screen for most brokers, you’ll just see single legs. Switching over to “vertical” allows you to set up the entire spread in one trade. If you use something like RH, there’s a feature that allows you to select multiple options, so you’ll select the one you wish to sell (short leg) and the one you wish to buy (long leg).\n\nIn this example we selected the 222.5/227.5c spread, meaning that we sold the short leg of 222.5 and the long leg of 227.5. The net credit was 1.45, which is our max gain on the trade. A wider spread gives a larger credit but also increases max loss. This is a $5 wide spread but we could have made it a tighter spread with a $2.5 width. Typically the best risk to reward ratio is on the tightest spreads, but a slightly wider spread will raise your breakeven price and studies have shown that it actually results in better expected value long term.\n\nCircling back to the credit we received of $1.45, this means that our max profit was $145 and our max loss was $355 for each spread that we sold. We know that because our broker tells us that, but a quick way to calculate it is the width of the spread minus the credit. A $1.45 credit on $5 wide spread means a $5-$1.45=$3.55 max loss.\n\nWhen I evaluate trades like this I look for a max profit to max loss ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. Based on different scanners I’ve seen, the best expected values tend to fall on spreads within that risk/reward ratio. The ratio on this trade is 1:2.44.\n\nSo we put our order in for a credit of $1.45, it filled, and now we get to sit back and watch. Sometimes your order won’t fill right away. In fact, most of the time it won’t fill right away. It’s important to be patient with your fill price and not chase it downwards. We want the highest credit possible. So if the credit on these spreads dropped to 1.30 when I was trying to place an order, it usually isn’t a great idea to drop my order price down to 1.30 just to get a fill. The only time I would recommend that is if you’re trying to open a spread right before the market closes. Otherwise, hang tight. Patience pays.\n\n#Part 3: Managing the Trade\n\nSo now that we’ve made the trade, it’s time to manage it. In my opinion one of the best parts about trading spreads is that they don’t require active management. You get to sit back and watch the price. Once the trade has been opened, which is also quick, it takes very little effort.\n\nSo with the Wayfair example we used, our analysis turned out perfectly, as Wayfair touched the ATH and dipped back down to end the week safely at $214. We hit max profit on that trade, but what if the trade goes against us? That’s what we’ll take a look at in this section.\n\nOne thing we didn’t address in part two is when to open the trade. We like opening spreads on Mondays and Tuesdays, and monitoring them during the week. This is the part of my strategy that is a little bit controversial, as there is a (legitimate) school of thought that selling spreads about 45 DTE is better value. I like that idea and if you would rather do that then absolutely go for it. It’s important to trade what you’re comfortable with. All of the lessons in here still apply to that strategy. With that said though, I stick with the weekly strategy of opening them at the beginning of the week and look to close them throughout the week.\n\nThe way I see it, your % of max profit should be the metric you’re looking at when deciding what to do with a spread. Divided up equally, that means if you progressed through the week to max profit in a linear fashion, you would be at 20% of max profit on Monday, 40% on Tuesday, and so forth. A good rule of thumb I use is that if you’re ever on the fence about whether or not to close something out, do so if your return exceeds the linear return for that day of the week. The market can move quickly and I’ve had several times where I have regretted not closing a spread out. It’s important to take profit.\n\nAnother thing I’ll add to this is that this weekly strategy gets a little risky on Thursday afternoon headed into Friday. If your spread is remotely close to being in the money on Thursday afternoon, close it out. Now that I type that out I realize that may all sound a little convoluted, but it’s better visualized in the video I’ve linked for this section.\n\nNow let's get into what happens if a trade really starts to move against you. With the strategy we use there are really two options: (1) Close the trade for a loss and move on, or (2) Roll the strikes higher.\n\nThe first option is pretty self explanatory, but a quick note I want to add here is that you can have a stock move way against you but still be able to close the trade for less than max loss. The example I use in my video is I played FB earnings, thought it would go down, but it shot way above my spread and well into max loss territory. We opened a 245/247.5c spread for a credit of $0.54. FB was reporting earnings on a Thursday night and we sold this spread that expired the following day, so there wasn’t a ton of time to manage it. Long story short, FB killed earnings and shot up to $256 that morning. Really not a prayer that it would come back down to the spread I opened by the end of the day. But despite the fact that this trade went way against us and we had almost no time to manage it since it was a Friday play, we were still able to close out for a debit of $1.90. Yes that’s a loss of $1.36 per spread, but we SAVED an additional $0.60 cent loss by avoiding a max loss debit of $2.50. That’s another benefit of spreads.\n\nLet’s talk about option two. This is the best option to use if you’re confident that you’re correct about the ultimate price action on a stock, but you need a little extra wiggle room on the trade. For this example we’ll look at a TSLA call spread that I opened. TSLA was trading at $1542 after an incredible run, so I figured I would play it below 1600 with a 1600/1610c spread that offered a credit of $2.52. As is the theme with this section, TSLA exploded the following morning (Tuesday) and went all the way up to $1794 at one point. My spread was literally almost $200 out of the money. One of the biggest possible moves against myself that I had ever seen. Despite this crazy move, it was only Tuesday and we were able to close the first spread for a debit of only $5.25 (as opposed to a $10 max debit). We opened 6 of these off the bat so this was a loss of $1638. From there we “rolled” our strikes higher, opening 10 1750/1760c spreads for a credit of $3.45. So the closing and subsequent opening of a spread like we did here is what we are referring to when we say we “rolled the strikes higher”.\n\nBy the end of the week TSLA had finally crashed a bit and it finished at $1506. This meant the second of spreads we opened were easily max profit. And while we lost $1,638 on the first set of spreads we opened here, we profited $3,450 on the second set of spreads so we were able to still finish the week with a $1,812 profit on TSLA. The funny thing with this one is that the original spread would have hit max profit since it dropped all the way back down to 1500, but we would have had the same result had TSLA finished anywhere below 1750.\n\nRolling the strikes higher gave me extra breathing room and turned a potential disaster into a profitable trade. One thing I’ll add though is that with this method you do run the risk of increasing your potential max loss. Because of that, I’ll only roll my strikes higher ONCE. Anything past that is chasing a losing trade. If I roll my strikes higher and it’s still going against me, I’m at the point where I need to accept the fact that I don’t fundamentally understand a stock as well as I thought I did and move on. There is always another trade out there.\n\nThe final point I’ll add to this is ALWAYS CLOSE OUT YOUR SPREADS. The only time I’ll let a spread expire worthless is if my spread is OTM by a crazy amount and it would quite literally take a historic after-hours move on Friday to take me back ITM. Other than that, close your spreads out. Even if it’s just for a $0.05 debit. It may seem annoying but I’ll tell you why in the following section.\n\n#Part 4: Additional Risks and Considerations\n\nI will start this section by saying I’ve never been impacted by any of the following risks, but it’s important to be aware of 100% of the possible outcomes of your trade before you enter it. They’re infrequent but this really wouldn’t be a comprehensive guide if I omitted them. They are as follows: (1) Early Assignment, (2) Dividend Risk, (3) Pin Risk.\n\n**1: Early Assignment:**\n\nThe best way to start this section is by talking about why your max loss is actually your max loss. We know it’s quickly calculated as the width of your spread minus the credit, but why is that?\n\nLet’s use a 110/115c spread as an example. We’ll say we received a credit of $1. We know that if the stock finishes anywhere below 110 then both legs are worthless and we’ll hold onto that $1 credit. But what happens if we’re in a max loss position. Let’s say the stock finishes at $120.\n\nIn this situation the short leg (110c) we sold would be worth $10 (120-110), meaning that we would owe $1,000 on that position. The long leg we bought would be worth $5 (120-115), meaning we are holding a position worth $500. The net effect is a $500 loss, but remember that’s netted against the $100 credit you received, so it’s a max loss of $400. That math checks out as the width of the spread is $5, the credit is $1, so the max loss is 5-1=$4*100=$400.\n\nSo that’s how it works upon expiration. But lets say this position moved against you, you still have a few days until expiration, but the stock is at $120. Since there are a few days left, you probably could close the contract for a debit of $3.50 rather than the max loss debit of $5. However, since your short leg is ITM the person you sold the option to may choose to exercise their option. As a result, that would require you to take on a short position of $110*100=$11,000 per contract sold. You may not be able to afford to cover that, or your broker may not let you hold that position. So what happens is your long leg gets exercised as well resulting in you taking a max loss early. So while on paper you received a credit of $1 that could have been closed for a debit of $3.50 and your loss was only $2.50, early assignment results in you prematurely taking a max loss.\n\nWhen does this happen? It typically doesn’t, since it requires the buyer sacrificing the remaining extrinsic value on the option, but it’s more likely with certain stocks. There are three different classifications of a stock that relate to it’s borrowing ability: Easy to Borrow (ETB), Hard to Borrow (HTB), and Not Available to Borrow (NTB). The harder a stock is to borrow, the more likely it is that a call is exercised early because it gives the buyer a way to acquire a stock which may not be available to them through their broker. So if you’re selling call spreads that are close to being ITM, make sure to check out the borrowing status of the stock.\n\n**2: Dividend Risk:**\n\nThis risk relates to the first one discussed, as it’s just another way you risk early assignment. If a company is announcing a dividend, there will be something known as an “ex-div” date, which means that all shareholders as of that date are entitled to receive the divident, which will be distributed usually at a later date. Because of this, call buyers may exercise an out of the money call option in an effort to acquire those shares.\n\nRemembering that exercising an option means that you sacrifice all remaining extrinsic value, another reason a buyer may exercise a call option before an ex-dividend date is that the value of the dividend announced is greater than the extrinsic value remaining in the option. Say a 100c is trading at $2 and the underlying (stock) is currently at 101. The extrinsic value is the value of the option in excess of what it would be worth upon expiration. So the extrinsic value in this situation is $1, since the 100c trading for $2 is just $1 in excess of the current strike price. If the company in question here announced a $2 dividend, an option buyer would likely exercise their call option because the $2 dividend is greater than the $1 of extrinsic value.\n\n**3: Pin Risk:**\n\nWe know that if your spread finishes out of the money it’s a max gain and if both legs of your spread finish in the money it’s a max loss. But what happens when the price of a stock finishes between the two legs of your spread? Let’s take a look.\n\nSo using a 100/110c spread as an example, let’s say that the stock finishes at 105. Your long leg, which is there to protect you, is worthless so you wouldn’t exercise it. However the short leg at 100 that you sold will be exercised by the buyer since it’s ITM. As a result, you’re now short 100 shares at a price of 100 and you’ll be holding that position over the weekend. This can go both ways from here, but since we’re focused on risk let’s say that this stock you’re now short shoots up over the weekend and some sort of news/event brings it up to $120.\n\nWith this short position of 100 shares at $100 you’re borrowing $10,000 worth of stock. Now that the stock is worth $120 this position is now worth $12,000. Over the weekend you’ve sustained a $2,000 loss. If we received a credit of $3 when we opened this spread, we may have thought that our max loss was 10-3=$7*100=$700. Since we failed to close the spread out, this position has now resulted in a $2,000 loss net of the $300 credit that you received when you opened the position. So on a trade where you thought you could lose at most $700, you’re now down almost $2k.\n\nI can’t repeat it enough, but THIS IS WHY WE CLOSE OUT SPREADS BEFORE EXPIRATION. That is the single most important takeaway I can give you here. Spreads are great since they’re defined risk and defined gain. When you’re buying options you have a defined loss but a potentially infinite gain. This can make it really easy to get greedy and I’ve seen countless traders lose big profits because they keep holding out for more. When you have a defined gain and defined loss it makes it easier to make smart decisions, take profits, and continuously build on those profits over time.\n\nThat was an enormous wall of text but I hope it helps explain, from a base level, what spreads are and how they work. Switching from buying options to selling options has dramatically changed my performance in the market so I hope sharing this can do the same for someone else.

Snowflake is great, they have top-notch veteran engineers, their product is also top-notch. But this is how it goes generally:\n\nA company that is not making any profit yet.

Fast-forward 2-3 years, Redshift narrowed the gap. Still, Snowflake is better but not like before. Companies like Amazon, Azure, GCP have resources, $, a lot of time they don't have the right product, to begin with, but they put all their resources and some time even they copy-paste competitor's product feature.\n\nOn the other hand, many of those veteran engineers will move (that's what they do, they go for the next challenge), they will also do dilution. While they are doing that, competitors will keep narrowing the gap, and big enterprises prefer to go with biggies when they don't see much feature difference, also they love credit which Snowflakes cannot offer at that scale.\n\nRemember Hortonworks or Cloudera? A few years back, companies used to go with Cloudera, Hortonworks (for their Hadoop platforms) and they didn't pick Amazon EMR or Azure HDInsight as the gap was huge.

Up big time. The reason those beat down stocks are beaten down, is because they've suffered massive losses that will make a comeback, even under perfect conditions, very difficult.\n\nSure, there will be some sort of a pop when they announce there's a vaccine, but these stocks you're holding aren't TSLA, or penny stocks, they won't double/triple overnight. And when people realize that it will take ages for the vaccine to be available everywhere, and that a ton of people won't want to take it, and that even if all goes well and covid is gone within a couple months these companies still have to dig themselves out of a massive hole. And some customer habits may have changed forever.\n\nIt's easy to say \"these stocks are down because covid, so vaccine = covid over = stocks back up to pre-covid levels\". But it's actually much much more complicated than that.\n\n\nHere's an analogy for you. If you compare a person's life with a company. You have a great job, lots of savings, a nice house, 2 cars, etc. You get sick, lose your job, get massive hospital bills. Blow all your savings, build a bunch of debt, lose your house, cars, other assets. You get healthy, get a new job, but not quite as good as your old one, and now you have a mountain of debt, no savings, no assets, no safety net. It will take you years to just dig yourself out of the hole, and even more to get back to where you previously were. And if something bad happens again while you're climbing out? You're fucked. This is pretty much what these beaten down companies are facing on a massive scale.\n\nWhat you're expecting is like after 6 months of being sick in the hospital the doctor is like hey there's a new cure, they shoot you up with it and you're instantly healthy, all your debt goes away, your old job hires you back, and the bank gives you back your house.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "lol rip", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am feeling you a lot.

If they get the price down to $70/kWh they can get a 120 kWh battery pack for 24% less cost than current Model S/X packs. More importantly, the pilot line allows the cost to be slightly higher initially and not turn a loss because of the high ASP of let's say the Model S plaid. Also 12.8 GWh/year divided by 120 kWh/pack leaves us 106k units per year, which when compensated for a slightly slower rate in the beginning, should perfectly cover the unit sales of S/X that have a max production rate of 90k/year. Also S/X are built in Fremont, which compliments the location.\n\nAt the same weight or slightly lower weight of the 100 kWh pack, this basically gives a range boost of 20% while lowering the manufacturing cost.

There is usually one on the top and one one the bottom, they need to be spot welded and the current goes through a very small piece of material, so it heats up quickly. \n\nWhat the tabless battery is doing is make a connection point along the whole top and bottom of the battery, letting the current flow from top to bottom rather than make it go all the way through the rolled strip.

If price climbs closer to call strike would use proceeds from puts to increase call strikes and if price tanks would buy shares at discount with call proceeds. If price really goes crazy I would sell call options that I have held for over a year to buy back calls prior to getting them assigned. I would have over $1M in profits from those calls at that stock price so would be able to continue to hold the calls that expire in 2021-2022 as long as stock price stays reasonable. Worse that could happen is that price goes to $800 but at that point I could close out all positions at $5-6M+ in profits. If stock tanks likely all my current calls would stay in the money so would have those proceeds plus the premium on calls that would be used to buy extremely discounted shares and I would hope the price would recover by mid next year.

In fact some very talented people will \"leg in\" and out of spreads, buying when the stock is low, selling the call when high, or buying the put when the price is high, selling a put when it bottoms, basically playing the price fluctuation.\n\nBuy low, sell high. And this goes for options as well. You want to sell into strength, meaning selling calls when the stock is soaring, and puts after it has bottomed, because you make your money when the stock reverses and those options lose value.\n\nSo how do you feel about AAPL? It went down more this afternoon. It's trading around $112 now. Me? I'm waiting on a reversal. But I have 2 months with little theta decay. If your strike is really out there now, and expiring in a month or sooner, you need a reversal soon just to counteract the daily theta decay. So you might be better off cutting losses if you think AAPL goes lower. If you think that reversal will come in the next week or so and you want to hold, sell the call. All you lose is upside profit beyond $130, which is a slim chance right now. If apple continues down, you'll lose less holding to expiration in a worst case scenario if you want to hold, by turning it into a spread. In fact I would say the worst thing you could do is sit on a single leg call as the price falls. Either cut losses or hedge.\n\nIf you don't think it's coming back, then cut your losses, wait for some better price resistance or a floor on this tech sell-off and then re-enter with calls. Or gamble on puts the way down. Or sell a call credit spread above the $130 and collect more premium, assuming there's much you can collect at strikes that far away. You could even sell a $120 call and have a call credit spread and collect more premium. That's a bearish position where you're betting apple won't rise to that level as you'll start losing money if it does.\n\nI can't really tell you what to do. The strategy depends on your own sentiment/bet for where AAPL is going and what your strike and expiration is, as well as what happens and nobody knows.\n\nOctober earnings and good iphone news is all I can figure will pump options prices back up.

I sold a put on Intel following their drop post earnings and am bagholding them waiting for the stock to rise, so I know you pain about sudden drops.\n\nI would say only sell the call if you want to hold and chance a rebound, and mitigate losses if you're wrong. That's all it will accomplish - reduce your losses if the stock continues to fall, and you're trading that for limiting upside should it shoot way back up, but that's less likely. At this point you're selling a lottery ticket covered by the call you already bought, so it isn't naked.\n\n>if the price rises in a months time but not enough, and I decide to close the whole position, my sold call would further the losses?\n\nIf the price goes back up, the hedge you sell will gain in value, which isn't good as it's now worth more than what you sold it for. But, since the original call you bought is closer to the strike price than your hedge, it should go up in value even more. That's what makes spreads net positive. So if I bought a $10C and sold a $15C, and a stock rose from $5 to $8, both calls are closer to the money, so both are worth more. But the $10C is always worth more than the $15C because it's closer to the money.\n\n>in general I get the idea that its always better to buy spreads rather than simple calls/puts because of theta etc?\n\nYes, I rarely buy single leg options because stocks trade in a statistical range they rarely move out of, like a bell curve, and I don't like to pay premium for theoretically unlimited profits. If TSLA has good odds to hit $550, and terrible odds of hitting $750 in a given time period, why buy a $550 call which is going to be more expensive than the $550/$750 spread? You're paying extra money for the limited chance it goes higher. And some people get really lucky, never sell and make 1000% gains. But for most people it's a waste of money which further raises the break even point.\n\nRecently my favorite strategy is to sell puts on stock I'm long on, take the premium and buy a call spread. If I'm wrong and the stock falls, I'll sit on 100 shares and the calls expire. If I'm right and the stock takes off, the put I sold expires worthless and I get to ride free calls to tendy town. That worked great recently on WDC.\n\nThe only other time I end up with single leg options is if I buy a spread, the stock moved the wrong way, which brings the cost of the short leg hedge I sold down to nothing, and if I expect a rebound, I'll buy that hedge to close it and let the unhedged long leg ride back in the correction at a discount. But that's rare.\n\nThe only benefit of single legs is they're easier to close since you only need to sell one leg. Easy. I wouldn't trade spreads on illiquid stocks with low volume. One strike may have lots of buying and selling while the other doesn't, and your broker can't close both until they get a buy and sell on both legs, at whatever price you set. So closing spreads can be more difficult. Generally you don't need to worry on anything like AAPL.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">if I bought the call well ITM when the underlying price was high, and sold a call once it lost value and well OTM, in order for the spread to become net positive I would need the underlying to go well past the strike prices right? \n>or have the sold call strike price much further up from the bought call?\n\nLet's say XYZ is trading for $10/share. You buy a $10C and pay $2 for it. So your break-even is a $12 stock price at expiration when all that is left is intrinsic value and all the extrinsic time value has decayed away.\n\nThe stock dips to $8, your break-even hasn't changed. If you sell a $15C when the stock is at $10, you lower your break-even by $0.50 down to $11.50 at expiration. If you sell it at $8, your break-even is say $11.80. The spread remains the same. The only thing changing is the premium price based on where the stock is.\n\nI suppose if you managed to screw up legging into a spread in the worst possible way, like buying the $10C the day before earnings when volatility is high, and you paid $6 for that, and then selling a $15C a day later after volatility and the stock crashes, for $0.50, your net debit is $5.50 on a $5 spread. So if the stock shot back up and expired at $25, the spread should be worth basically $5 when sold, bringing your loss to $0.50. Had you not spread it, the $10C would be worth intrinsic value, or around $15 at expiration or a $1,500 profit. If the stock stayed at $8, you would lose $50 less by selling the call as it all expires.\n\nI would say this situation where your total debit is greater than the spread width is extremely unusual. You would have to really F things up to wind up in that situation.\n\n>how does one figure out the breakeven point in this scenario?\n\nStrike price, plus your debits minus your credits. Long spreads like described here will be debit spreads where you pay money because the ITM leg is long and the OTM leg is short.\n\nCredit spreads puts the ITM leg short and the OTM leg long, so you have a net credit. Never take those to expiration and read about pin risk before trading. Short spreads carry unique risk as the hedge you buy is a stoploss you don't want expiring OTM while the short leg is ITM. Then you're sitting on a naked call where the sky is the limit for losses.\n\nI do recommend if you start selling contracts to collect premium, keep a spreadsheet to track your premiums. You can effectively use those to lower your overall cost basis or break-even and most brokers don't calculate that.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">can I ask whats your strategy for credit spreads, few strikes in the money and few strikes out or? \n\nTake a look at this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/iv9izr/help_for_a_new_theta_gang_member/g5r2v9i\n\n>would a spread still work well if you for example wanted to scalp a quick movement in the stock price rather than wait around until time works more in your favor? \n\nI don't scalp because of the PDT rule and because selling contracts offers positive theta, so you make money as the clock ticks.\n\nMost of my short spreads are 30 - 45 days to expiration contracts, but are automatically closed with a GTC order I have on as an exit. The winners automatically close, usually in 2 weeks.\n\n>and you mentioned that your favorite strategy is to sell puts on stock I'm long on, take the premium and buy a call spread.\n>how do you choose the strike price for the sold puts, few strikes OTM?\n\nIt really depends. There's no right answer, because if you sell at the money, and the stock goes up, you make a lot more than if you sell an OTM put and the stock goes up. In fact selling ATM puts in a bull market like we've had the past decade has turned out to be a fantastic strategy. But if our market goes the way of Japan in the 90s, this would be a terrible strategy, whereas being short the call side would work better.\n\nYou can make money no matter which way the price goes. But no one knows which way it will go, though the bias is to go up.\n\n>when it comes to cutting your losses, do you have a general rule? \n\nDepends on the trade. When I was selling puts and using the premium to buy debit spreads, they were free so I didn't really care. If I was wrong I lost nothing except for holding the stock at a given price if assigned. So no worries there. On credit spreads, you're generally ok as long as the price doesn't move against you right after opening. Remember, the value goes down due to theta decay. So if the stock sits there a week, then moves against you, you've already made money from theta and can close your position basically flat if you're feeling uneasy, or roll for another credit to give yourself more time. And rolling is just closing your position and reopening at a later date, hopefully with more credit so your break-even is even better. That's one way people manage losers, is rolling and waiting for a reversal. Rolling is generally for net short positions, not long positions.\n\n>say for example I have a bunch of long calls expiring in october in tech sector, all down around or more than 50% after the dip we had. was holding as this week seemed better but the outlook today is pretty bad again and tomorrow being friday.. at this point throwing in the towel seems a good idea.\n\nYeah sorry I didn't respond sooner. My AAPL spread has taken a beating. But I don't think it will last. My theory is people have been using big tech names as a piggy bank to park money, and given the flurry of IPOs, they sold out of those equities so they could buy into the new tech names. That's very different from selling tech because the top is in and people are running for the hills. I don't buy that so I don't think this will last much longer before people buy the dip and ride these names back up.\n\nBut again, no one knows.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "No you are stupid", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Aw, did you also buy weekly FDs?", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "FDs man, they'll getcha.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sell whatever it’s worth tomorrow AM", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "First thing too.

There's only so many Gucci bags these people can buy and banks aren't doing shit with Fed liquidity, because they don't want to lend money to an economy of people without jobs and a $1200 Robinhood account. \n       \nNew mortgage lending has gotten tight as fuck and remains out of reach for most people despite low rates. Top 10% will likely continue to move wealth into prime residential property to keep valuations high and extract rent from the rest of the population.       \n\nSPY will pump in the next two hours leading up to the announcement and then tank right after, as hedge funds and other big fuckers use this liquidity to get out. Every Joe Bob and Harry expects rampant inflation in the coming years but most people are fucking idiots, and smart money knows deflation is actually the problem due to the reasons listed above. Smart money just isn't ready to talk about it on CNBC yet.      \n\nKeep an eye on the DXY leading up to the U.S. election. Historically it pumps, and has an inverse correlation to asset prices. After Trump wins the markets might go nuts for a couple months to mirror expectations of a repeat move from the 2016 election.
