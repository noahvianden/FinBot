{"title": "When do options expire? (Important)", "selftext": "It seems that options expire at market close on Friday but this is not the case. Options can be exercised until 5:30 pm the Friday of expiration. That means most traders have an hour and a half Friday after close to exercise their option. The reason this is important is because an option seller might think he’s clear of any obligation once the market closes. He is thinking about how much ice cream he can buy with the premium he has received but little does he know it can be exercised much later. The short put he sold at $100 seems to be expired but some bad news after hours leads the stock to tumble from $105 to $90 and the person who bought the put exercised it. Now the Option Writer has to take responsibility for these shares and is assigned shares at $100 when the underlying is trading for $90 for a loss of $10 per share.

In addition, the media keeps running stories about the “death of cable” and such. On the surface, I would say that the traditional cable company’s days are numbered. But the opposite is true. \n\nWhen presented with the reality of how much they’d have to spend to get their cable channels and the amount of time they’d have to spend to discover which service carries the new show they want to watch, they quickly change their tune.\n\nThis is an example of the value cable companies deliver. Disney owns ESPN, Disney channel, etc. In today’s world, Comcast wants to carry ESPN, but doesn’t really care about the Disney channel. Disney tells them, look you want ESPN, you’re gonna need to carry Disney Channel too. Comcast bundles these in one package so if you want ESPN, you get Disney Channel too. Essentially the users who want ESPN are subsidizing the users who want Disney channel. Fast forward to a potential ala carte world. Comcast allows you to pick either ESPN or Disney channel. Disney still demands to make the same amount of money. They aren’t going to make it by selling Disney channel so they have to raise the price of ESPN. You’re right back to paying the same amount, plus you have to track the channels you’re watching. If Better Call Saul is premiering next week, you’d be damn sure to add it before otherwise you may miss out (may not be available to stream if you miss it). If it’s really supply and demand, Disney would charge $50 a month for ESPN, $4 a month for Disney Channel, etc. I don’t see that happening. \n\nThe cable companies do what a lot of retail stores do, basically buy 3 (even if you don’t want 3), get one for free. \n\nFast forward to now, too many choices, people are paralyzed and confused on which service to pick, too many $10 a month payments. When you present these people with cable like packages of streaming services, they love the idea, until you mention the word cable like. \n\nIMO people hate the idea of cable not because of their business model, but because of the geographic monopolies that were formed in the 80s.

The ratio of commercials to content is simply too high. And to make matters worse, channels often weight the frequency of commercial breaks towards to climax of movies.

I'm sure that there are some real interesting shows on some obscure channels, but I'll never find them.\n\nFinally, the shows on the major networks have become very formulaic. When you're competing for a few prime time slots, you have to design shows that have maximum appeal. This results in bland repetitive cookie cutter series. Good storing telling requires breaking that mold.\n\nWhen I look at my complaints, early Netflix streaming addressed each of these issues. Netflix has no commercials. Streaming lets you watch shows when you want. Netflix's search tool helped you find new shows based on other shows you like. And early on Netflix was willing to take risks with its early shows. However, modern Netflix has started to falter on my last two complaints. Their search algorithm has gone downhill and clearly prioritizes Netflix produced content. And as Netflix has been forced to rely more on their original content, they've been less willing to take risks.

{"title": "Oracle Chosen as Winner in Deal for TikTok’s U.S. Operations", "selftext": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-drops-out-of-bidding-for-tiktoks-u-s-operations-11600039821?mod=mhp\n\nEditing to post in updated article:\n\nOracle Corp. ORCL -0.58% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, a person familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.65% in a deal to salvage a social-media service that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.\n\nOracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the person said.\n\nMicrosoft earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd.\n\n\n“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement said. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.”\n\nThe move by Beijing-based ByteDance comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.\n\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn’t sold to an American company by Sept. 15, though it isn’t clear if that is the operative deadline.

The Bytedance \"algorithm\" is best-in-class.

A view on this depends on a view of how much of the advantage comes from the short-form video format advantage vs. other content forms.\n2. A view of the above also depends on how much of the \"secret sauce\" is the \"know-how\" of the Bytedance team, vs. scientific vs. practical applications of AI/ML\n3. The algo/AI advantage is also relevant bc Bytedance has already demonstrated that it can repurpose the algo for news, e-commerce, etc.....not just social media. They turned an $800MM Vine also-ran in Musically into an operation that's fire-saling for over $30Bn. If it wasn't a fire-sale, I would be surprised if it didn't fetch at least $75bn. That's WSB-levels of upside on real-money in a replicatable, sustainable strategy. The \"algo advantage\" is of real, demonstrable economic value regardless of what you think of the nature of the algo.\n4. AI/ML has been designated as one of the top strategic priorities of the CCP.....and when you have a Chinese-company that is not making junk for its product that's getting actual traction, the CCP is going to define your advantages as a matter of national priority.....especially if they view the area (AI) as being one where it's purely P2P competition, rather than potentially cooperative like EV's. Bytedance might be willing to do a \"partnership\" where some tech gets shared....the CCP will not...especially when it's a bunch of Boomers who only understand buzzwords and not technical details and know that \"AI is dangerous\" like Xi leading the CCP.\n5. Being outed for \"Spyware\" on the other hand requires multiple leaps in logic that depend on the following aspects in majority or full, (A) it requires that the CCP care if it gets outed as having spyware in TikTok, (B) it requires that TikTok offer a differentiated spying capability vs. other data sources, and (C) it requires whatever backdoors the CCP is using if it is using them as \"giving it away\" that the CCP is looking in\n6. A is demonstrably false if you pay attention to CCP policy in the past few months, C is what it is, and B has been repeatedly debunked. Stop reading reddit, and start reading real tech analysis on either Hacker News or Stratechery.\n7. If you said that it would reveal that the CCP uses TikTok as a propaganda outlet.....that at least can make sense....especially as it would be the real political value of controlling the black-boxed algos as time goes on....and that's an actual differentiated capability that comes from TikTok that the CCP does not get elsewhere already.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You just said outright that China doesn’t care for getting outed for spying.
