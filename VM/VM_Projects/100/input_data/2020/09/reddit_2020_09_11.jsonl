{"title": "Options Calculator", "selftext": "[Options Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)\n\nIf you like options, this is such a useful tool. Let's say you want to get on the TSLA hype and buy some short term calls. You enter the ticker symbol, select the date, and the option you want to buy. It'll tell you when you start making/losing money. For this one I selected a long call that expires 10/30 and is just barely under the stock price.\n\nAs you can see, the window for you to make money is very, very small. Different options have much bigger green areas, but this tells you that if you don't hit the prices (left) by the dates (top) that are in the green you will most likely lose your money. \n\nOptions aren't bad, although they are a riskier. You just have to make a smart decision. Use this tool, click on the price/date you're shooting for and it will tell you how much you'll make if it hits by that date (obviously this is a snapshot in time, so numbers may get a little squishy if stock velocity changes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1obdjpkecjm51.jpg?width=825&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa7035af4d746bf5103b46a73712cf735b10930c", "id": "iqsfo1", "created_utc": 1599837393.0, "score": 347, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôve always been a long term investor but got interested in options recently due to the COVID boom.

Thats not me being a bear, its just basic DD - do they have a working product?  \n\nThe lack of RCTs is the real worry - how do they plan to get FDA approval? Medical devices require evidence also.

On the matter of the 501(k) I found this (bold emphasis mine):\n\n> We expect to take a multi-step approach to the regulatory clearance process. As a first step, we submitted a 510(k) application **to an accredited Review Organization** under the Third Party Review Program for a single-source version of the Nanox.ARC in January 2020. In response to the feedback we received from the reviewer, we are conducting standard functional and safety tests to support the 510(k) application and **expect to submit the results from these tests in the third quarter of 2020**.\n\nSo it sounds like they are in the process of developing the 501(k) to submit it to the FDA and part of that process was submitting it to a review organization for feedback.\n\nFor anyone interested in this company I'd recommend checking out the risks section of the SEC filing linked above. Warning: it's 45 pages long, but just reading the first few sections gives a great overview of where the company stands currently.\n\n> We are a development-stage company with limited operating history. We may never be able to effectuate our business plan or achieve any revenue or reach profitability. **Therefore, at this stage of our business, potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment.**\n\nThe risks section gives some hints as to the current status of their tech:\n\n>*Our efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our digital X-ray source technology for commercial applications.*\n\n>We have developed our X-ray source technology and a prototype of the Nanox.ARC. Even though we believe our X-ray source has achieved commercial applicability, our technology has not been tested over extended periods of time and therefore no meaningful data exists regarding the durability, safety and effectiveness of our X-ray source over extended periods. **Although we have produced a working prototype of the Nanox.ARC, we may not be able to successfully integrate our X-ray source into the Nanox.ARC or any medical imaging system.**\n\nNote their wording: they have developed an x-ray source, and they have also developed a Nano.ARC prototype, but it sounds like they haven't yet integrated their X-ray source into the Nano.ARC and so have not yet built an actual medical imaging system.\n\n**So let's be clear:** this is a highly speculative play on a development / proof-of-concept stage startup that may never even reach the stage of having a working prototype. Still potentially worth a small position but with a play like this you expect that the most likely outcome in the long term is losing the whole investment. If they can get their tech working and get the cost of manufacturing low enough, their MSaaS business model with Nanox.CLOUD could be hugely profitable.

Even if we assumed that AMD‚Äôs revenue would grow at 20% a year perpetually, and Intel‚Äôs at 0%, AMD wouldn‚Äôt surpass Intel in revenue for 13 years. That, in addition to their phenomenal balance sheet and high profit margins, gives Intel a significant time buffer to modernize their product line and become competitive again.\n\nAMD being fabless is a competitive disadvantage for them, not the other way around. Intel spending more on production each quarter than AMD earns in a year goes to show, again, just how massive Intel is in comparison to the competition. While INTC‚Äôs foundries have been a source of problems recently, they‚Äôre a major competitive advantage in the long-term. AMD will have much higher operating costs per unit sold than Intel, and as such, a much lower profit margin (and probably higher unit costs, so there‚Äôs that). Lower profit margins mean less flexibility in poor markets, less excess cash to invest in growth, R&D, share buybacks, dividends, etc., and higher entry costs when expanding your product line. Intel is currently entering the dedicated GPU market, and already having access to foundries at a low cost will give them a strong competitive advantage in this market segment (and should they burn out in the GPU market, it at least won‚Äôt cost them too much).\n\nAs for the server market, AMD did not jump from a 1% to 8% market share in a single quarter.

It‚Äôs fair to have some real gripes with the company, but for argument‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôll go down the list and address each issue you mentioned.\n\nThe security issues, while unfortunate for both consumers and investors, should be a thing of the past. Intel has made efforts to mitigate security threats which have so far been reasonably effective, and having identified these issues should cause management to be more proactive in preventing these scandals in the future.\n\nI refuse to believe having fabs is a liability in and of itself. While Intel has certainly had its fair share of well-documented manufacturing issues, having ownership of their own foundries contributes to a very high-margin business model, giving them a significant buffer against poor market conditions as well as the flexibility to invest heavily in growth and R&D, which they‚Äôve been doing. The risk comes from mismanagement of said foundries, and while it‚Äôs speculative on my part, I do hope that replacing the chief engineering officer will catalyze some real change in that department.\n\nIn my post I addressed why the loss of market share in the broader desktop market wasn‚Äôt a huge concern for me, and that applies to the more niche market of DIY PCs as well. As for data centers, as far as I can tell, Intel hasn‚Äôt been losing market share at all. They control nearly 100% of that market, and that‚Äôs been the case for over half a decade.\n\nTerrible working conditions don‚Äôt make for attractive headlines, but they also don‚Äôt detract much from investment value.

It pains me to see major corporations treating their consumers like idiots, but it feels like that‚Äôs what Intel is doing. Pointing to blatantly rigged benchmark data in a last-ditch effort to convince your consumers that you still have a superior product is poor practice, especially in an era where reliable independent information is only a few clicks away. The first step to marketing is having something decent to market, and right now Intel is stuck marketing an inferior product line due to their aforementioned manufacturing issues. Even still, it makes more sense in my eyes to be candid about what your product actually is, as opposed to getting a reputation for dishonesty and sleaziness through practices that border on false advertising. Here‚Äôs hoping a new CCO can fix this.\n\nWhile entering the dedicated GPU market is a risky move, it‚Äôs also a synergistic one, which is the hallmark of quality company expansion.

It also shouldn‚Äôt be as much of a money hog as one would think, as Intel already owns their own manufacturing plants. There‚Äôs that competitive advantage coming into play, lol.\n\nA lot of debt by what metric? 46.1% debt to equity is actually quite low, and the debt they do have is extremely well-covered by EBIT and operating cash flow. $26 billion in cash/cash equivalents also gives them a huge balance sheet buffer if earnings take an unforeseen hit.

In the post-Covid monetary policy regime, interest rates are so low that there is very little discount to future earnings due to the lack of good safe alternatives, so stocks are now being priced a lot more on their earnings 10-20 years out than earnings 5 years out.

ARK mentions people splitting the bill when going out to eat as a possible explanation for the network effect; my feeling is that there'll be less of that. Still, even if it's not as strong as it would be during a normal year, it does seem likely that the college network effect will still exist.\n\nI'm definitely going to give this some serious thought. I have a bit of cash sitting in my brokerage account I've been trying to find a good use for; might even sell some TSLA shares to buy calls depending on how strong my conviction ends up being once I've digested this a bit more (thinking about selling enough to cover my initial investment in TSLA back in May/June of last year).\n\nThat said, I'm still fairly new to options.

I've heard \"time in the market beats timing the market\" so many times now, but I'm not sure if that applies to options. They seem like a more fickle beast hahaha.\n\nMy first thought is setting several price targets at which point I'd sell a portion of the calls (such as 1/5 of the calls every X percent they're up). If there's a run up, I can lock in some profits in case there's a correction. But, it prevents some of the timing the market game where you're sure this is the peak, sell it all, and then it goes up another 30%. I guess it would just be a matter of deciding what the minimum profit I'd sell it for is and what point I'd be happy cashing out all of it to wait for a dip.\n\nI don't know. Going this route would definitely leave money on the table in the case of a runup. I'm just thinking about Tesla and the crazy runups it's had, when do you sell, and when do you white knuckle it?\n\nOne thought that comes to mind is still setting points where 1/5 or whatever of the calls get put on the chopping block, but--instead of selling them right away--waiting for the start of a downward trend to sell. As an example, let's say it goes up enough that I'd consider selling 3/5 of the calls. Even though it passed the 1/5 and 2/5 points on the way up, none of the calls would be sold until there's a downturn. At that point, all 3/5 get sold at once. I mean, sure, I could've sold all 5/5 of the calls, but keeping them is insurance in case it reverses course and continues to run up. \n\nThe question then becomes: when do you buy back in? Is there something you look for when trying to decide if it's corrected enough to get back in? And do you tend to buy in for the same date, or get even further out leaps?\n\nThis might be a case of me needing to be honest with myself about the kind of person I am, which is generally someone that likes to systemize things like this and remove emotion from the equation. Doing this would definitely help me detach emotionally from it, which I think is important from a mental health perspective.
