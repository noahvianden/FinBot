You are leveraging the *price movement* of the underlying, not the underlying itself. \n\nIf you are doing a fair comparison, Test A would buy 100 shares of XYZ and Test B would leverage 100 shares of XYZ through call options and then exercise to end up with 100 shares. Apples to apples, shares for shares. \n\nIn this case, leverage needs to include the cost of exercise, and in many cases, using a call to leverage ownership of shares *costs more* than just buying the shares earlier, because exercise is premium + strike + fees. If Test A is buy 100 shares of XYZ when it is $80 and Test B is buy a call with a strike price of $100, with the forecast that XYZ will hit $100 before expiration, Test B is a leverage win only if XYZ ends up substantially higher than $100. If it is only $101 and you spent $2 on the call, your net cost to own those shares is $102, which is a loss, relative to Test A.\n\nIt's apples to oranges to compare leverage of shares vs. leverage of price movement only. Given the same Test A and B as before, but now, Test A leaves you owning 100 shares of XYZ for a $21/share profit (because XYZ is $101 on expiration) on $80/share investment vs. Test B which leaves you with a $21/share profit on a $2/share investment. B looks like a win, but it's not a fair comparison.\n\n> Delta Value of Option x Price of Underlying Security / Price of Option\n\nThe first part is the dollar delta calculation. If you want to know what the \"share equivalent\" of your call is, you calculate delta x price of underlying. So if XYZ is worth $100 and your delta is 50, you would have the equivalent of 50 shares of XYZ, in terms of dollar price movement.\n\nThen dividing by the option cost would give you cost of the option in terms of shares per dollar.

You choose the profit target for early exit. There is no guarantee that profit level will be hit, since some trades are just going to be losers no matter what you do, but on average after hundreds or thousands of repetitions, you'll average out to whatever % target you set.\n\nYou should choose a loss limit and max holding time for early exit as well. Keep in mind that you don't want to choose a loss% that is so many times the profit% that you have negative expected value. For example, if you have a 60% chance to profit on a $100 max profit spread, and you want to bail out at 20% of max profit, the highest loss% target you should pick is 30%. Anything higher and you'll net an average loss, because if max profit is $100, (.60 x $20) - (.40 x $30) = 0, or break even. Any loss larger than $30 will be a negative number.\n\nBTW, Option Pricing Calculator has a short link feature.

If it is late on expiration day, yes, it will very quickly get assigned. If it is weeks away from expiration, no, it will not get instantly assigned.\n\nThe closer you are to expiration, the higher the risk an ITM short call will get assigned. This is because the extrinsic value shrinks to nothing at expiration, and that ex value counts as a sort of \"exercise fee\" that owners don't want to pay. The farther from expiration, the higher the ex value, the higher the ex value, the higher the \"fee\" the owner has to pay to exercise.\n\n> Also, is the person that bought the call the only one that can exercise it?\n\nThat's not how it works. When a contract position is opened, a buyer (owner) and seller (underwriter) are paired. But after that trade is filled, they have nothing to do with each other, it no longer matters. If later the owner decides to exercise, that exercise is *randomly* paired with an underwriter that has an open position at the same strike/expiration. It is most likely not the same \"person\" that filled the owner's order to buy.

The wider the strikes, the higher the risk.

Better ratios, like risking $400 to earn $500 are more desirable, but harder to find. Starting with one whole strike width is safe, like $121/$122.

Like most people, I own index funds in retirement accounts.  These aren’t readily accessed without penalty, however I would still like to create cash flow while these appreciate.  \n\nHere’s the strategy:  Allocate 2.5% of portfolio for selling call spreads, ~30 Delta, ~30 DTE on SPX, collecting 1/3 of the width of the strikes.  \n\nThe idea is that even if the spread loses, I gain in the remainder of the portfolio.  I also subscribe to the theory that the market takes the stairs up and the elevator down, meaning in most cases the main portfolio may appreciate a little bit, but not enough to challenge the spreads. \n\nI have a few questions/assumptions about running this strategy.  \n\n- How much should I allocate to this strategy?  I was planning on allocating 2.5% to this strategy because, at current IV levels, a ~30 Delta, ~30 DTE spread is generally about 2.5 - 3% above SPX’s current price and any loss from spreads would result in an equivalent or greater gain in the portfolio.  \n- Should I close these early, at 50% profit?  If I were only selling spreads, I would think this is the correct approach, however, in this particular situation, I am thinking about holding until expiration.  If the market declines after entering the position, I gain the full amount from the spread.  If the market increases such that both legs are now ITM, I will accept the loss, enjoy the gain, and sell another spread even higher.  \n- Should I roll losing positions?  \n- In this particular scenario, spreads seem superior to naked calls.  Personally, I like the defined risk.  The margin requirements are also lower.  With spreads, I can allocate a lower % of the portfolio to this strategy.

{"title": "Musk Sets Sights on Selling 20 Million Teslas by ’27. That Means 70% Annual Growth.", "selftext": "Tesla ￼ CEO Elon Musk tweeted Monday morning that his company might sell 20 million cars by 2027 and he sees 30 million electric vehicles sold across the industry.\n\nThe numbers are almost too big to contemplate, no matter how investors dissect them, and dissect them they will.\n\nTesla (ticker: TSLA) is expected to deliver about 141,000 cars in the third quarter of 2020 and 483,000 cars for the full year. That amounts to about 30% growth compared with 2019—an impressive achievement given the global pandemic. Ford Motor ￼ (F) sales, for comparison, are expected to dip about 20% in 2020.\n\nA few numbers were being tweeted. “Seven years for sure to 30 [million plus] new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe,” said Musk. “Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.”\n\nThe 20 million stretch goal is more than 40 times higher than this year’s production and works out to an average annual growth rate of roughly 70%. There is precedent. Tesla increased deliveries by about 100% a year on average in the seven years from 2012 to 2019.\n\nBut Tesla was starting off a base of fewer than 3,000 cars. What’s more, it invested about $11 billion from 2012 to 2019 to produce more cars. It has become more efficient over time, but raising production to 20 million vehicles could take up to $100 billion. That is a rough estimate and, again, hard to contemplate.\n\nToyota Motor ￼ (TM) sold about 9 million cars in 2019. It spent roughly $100 billion over the past decade renewing its capacity and retooling plants as new cars were introduced. In the global auto business the numbers are huge.\n\nNone of this accounts for the ramp-up in the supply chain that will be required to take EV penetration globally from roughly 2% to 30%, based on Musk’s comments. He spoke to that issue at his company’s Sept. 22 battery technology day. “We’re not getting into the [battery] cell business because we—just for the hell of it,” Musk said. “It’s because it’s the fundamental constraint. It’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth.\"\n\nAt the event, Tesla laid out plans to cut battery costs by more than 50%. It also outlined plans to cut the amount of investment required to build new battery capacity by about 75%.\n\nObviously, 20 million out of 30 million vehicles works out to market share of 67%. Tesla’s share of EV sales in the U.S. was about 55% in 2018 and 2019. Those are the first two years of significant sales of the Model 3, the company’s lower-priced model.\n\nMusk also said he thinks battery improvements will enable the company to profitably sell a $25,000 car. The Model 3 starts at $35,000.\n\nIt is worth noting that Tesla achieved 55% share selling cars with an average price of about $75,000. Ford’s average selling price is closer to $30,000 per vehicle.\n\nIf Tesla were to reach 20 million sales, it would mean the company is generating, perhaps, $800 billion in sales and $100 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nThere is a long way to go to get there. Investors may be inclined to believe Musk. He’s had a good year. Tesla shares are up 387% year to date, as of Friday’s closing price, far better than comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nGains have made Tesla the world’s most valuable auto maker.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "j1e5th", "created_utc": 1601307077.0, "score": 1593, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 237, "comments": [{"body": "This is a **highly** misleading title.\n\nFor those who aren't reading the articles or tweets on this:\n\n* Musk **did not** set a 2027 date for Tesla to sell 20 million cars, he said that would likely happen in **2030**, a 3 year difference.\n\n* The 2027 number was that the **entire** BEV market would see 30 million produced and sold in 2027, **not** 20 or 30 million BEV's by Tesla in 2027.\n\n* Musk was largely agreeing a tweet someone else made about ARK invest's belief that the BEV market would see 30 million sold around 2027. Elon's original tweet agreed (mostly) with that estimate, while stating that it's not completely outside of the realm of possibility that we'll hit the 30 million number by 2026 or maybe as early as 2025 if things really go right.

I’ve spent a non-insignificant amount of time in China so I would like to weigh in to this discussion for the benefit of this community.\n\nChinese people engage in conspicuous consumption at a higher rate than their western counterparts. Most people of means, if not all of them, live in high-rises. The neighborhood home is simply not really a thing over there and tier one cities. What does this mean? Imagine financial success was twice as important for your social standing and prospects as it is now in the west. Possibly even more. It is everything… And you can’t simply buy a house to show off because it’s simply not as visible unless you send pictures of your address to people online. Of course that happens, but what I am getting at is that for most Chinese people their choice of car is the number one indicator of their financial status.\n\nBecause this isn’t as important, even though it is important, for Westerners, many of you frequently talk about various Chinese electric car companies as if they are going to dominate the Chinese market in the future.\n\nIf this was the case, why our iPhones still being sold in China? Think about that. They are literally produced in that country alone, it is an extremely valuable product, and it features predominantly in the way the people interact with the world. It is also a quintessential American company… And yet, iphones are still selling in China. \n\nAsk yourself why that is. There’s nothing special about an iPhone. Other phones have extremely equivalent capabilities. The reason why they still sell is because of conspicuous consumption. There’s only so many ways the Chinese can show off the wealth, and having a nice car is arguably number one, with travel, clothing and purses being secondary.\n\nTesla has an excellent brand image. If Chinese millennials are anything like us, tesla is the new BMW, Audi, and Mercedes combined. It is also a western brand, with a larger than life CEO. Even if the Chinese auto manufacturers are able to produce equivalent cars for the equivalent cost, Tesla is still going to have significant sales in the country in the future. Why is that? I’ll tell you. You have no idea the number of Audi in range rovers that are being driven in Beijing right now. No idea. Chinese show wealth by buying among the prevailing luxury brands, and over there at least when I was there eight years ago, those brands were very specific. Land Rover and Audi. Chinese sales are so important to these brands that when she jumping started clamping down and corruption, it led to huge financial issues for these companies as I recall.\n\nSo what does this mean? This means that even if Chinese companies are able to produce a competitive vehicle at a competitive price to Tesla, the gradual shift in luxury consumption habits in China given the context of Chinese consumption cultural phenomenon means that Tesla will begin to slowly replace the market share for luxury vehicles in the country.\n\nA caveat to all of this is the assumption that Chinese millennials have similar luxury brand choices as their western counterparts. I am relying heavily on this. But I also think that there is a degree of western trendsetting when it comes to luxury brand choices, as indicated by Chinese luxury brand consumption in the first place.\n\nBasically, the gist of this is to flat out ignore any article that points towards Chinese domestic electric vehicle consumption as indicative of a future where tesla does not have major Chinese sales in the future.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "China’s President “She jumping”.

Tesla wants to scale its own production to 100 GWh/year in 2022 in addition to batteries coming from existing suppliers. Will those supplier  batteries incorporate any of the 5 innovations that Tesla mentioned (cell design, cell factory, anode materials, cathode materials, cell vehicle integration)? Cell factory probably not.\n2. Do all 5 innovations apply to all 3 battery types (iron based, nickel  & manganese, high nickel)? If yes, will there be different levels of  improvement by type?\n3. Does the 54% “range improvement” directly translate to 54% more Wh/kg (i.e. larger capacity for the same sized pack) or does some of it also improve the efficiency of the car (less Wh/km)?\n4. Model S Plaid will probably include all those innovations – will the regular  Model S (and X) also get those improvements at the same time?\n\nThanks!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "1. No I get the idea that they will continue to make packs for their supplier cells the way they do now. They might get Panasonic to change the chemistry to match theirs, but other than that you need to create entirely new production lines. Vehicle integration with 7x the cells is also very difficult.\n2. All the advantages except maybe some of the chemistry apply to all Tesla cells.\n3. The cells themselves get 40% more density due to form factor and chemistry, the remaining improvement is due to weight reduction in the car itself. \n4. Over time I think all the high range cars will need to have the Tesla high nickel cells. It depends on cell availability but given their relatively low volume I'd say S/X are pretty high on the list for changing out the batteries.

As far as I am aware there is no significant charging advantage for the pack as a whole so customers won't even notice the difference. I think even Fremont will switch to 4680 for their LR models to make them in line with Texas and Berlin. \n\nThey're pretty vague about it and the timelines suggest a number of things can happen earlier than they told. You don't go from 0 to 100 GWh/year in a second, it's likely they'll be at a decent capacity in the beginning of 2022.

The reality is essentially a superposition of all possible outcomes, until the state is collapsed by one of them becoming the reality.\n\nThere are basically three parameters to the valuation: The expected value, the deviation from it, and the external alternatives.\n\nExpected value is what I described in the beginning. It’s the probability of every outcome multiplied by their corresponding stock price.\n\nThe deviation is what describes risk. The way I use it to define valuation is by looking at how much the price needs to be discounted in order for the expected return to be 90% certain. This should also take into account all possible errors in defining all the values. This is also known as the margin of safety.\n\nExternal alternatives create relative value between assets. There's also opportunity cost associated with investing in any single asset. This means, that if you invest in asset A, there could be missed higher returns in other assets.\n\nThe way this affects the price is like how the sea level stays relatively flat despite a bumpy seabed. If there's a higher return associated with any asset, it will be levelled by the price increasing. Therefore all assets should have an equal potential for gains. \n\nHowever like the ocean has waves, also the stock market has it's dynamic inbalance, meaning that the real levels fluctuate around this ideal. Information isn't always perfect, and emotions play a part.\n\nWhy Elon says the stock is overvalued might be because he isn't fully grasping the third element.

{"title": "Capital Efficiency Theory", "selftext": "Okay so when Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger say they never owned more than 3 stocks to get rich but warren had/has one stock (Coke) and Charlie had 2 (Bank of America & Wells Fargo) in their personal portfolios. their take on diversification is, its for idiots. Because a really good business is well protected from the bear markets and competition over the long term. Basically one good company that you understand everything about. I get what hes saying but to me it feels alot like an \"all in\" or a \"yolo\" play to me. But I also understand that investing $10,000 into 50 companies (some you dont fully understand) is worse than, and you wont make as much profit if you were to put that same $10,000 into 1 good company you completely understand and like.\n\nSide note:\nWarren did use to say no more than 7 when he was younger, then started saying no more than 3 when he got older. But he personally recommends less than 3 EXTREMLY good companies and he personally only invests in ONE.\n\nAnother side note:\nThey say you lose capital efficiency when you go past 13 different companies, that you could’ve compounded money into less and better company’s making you more money over time. Warren thinks you lose capital efficiency with more than 1 and munger thinks more than 3 your losing capital effefficiency. They also say that the finance institutions are basing their curriculum not to get you rich but to maintain decent growth and protect your money. But as an argument to that, you are protected because a really good company just has the market in their palms and the other competitors will only get a small slice of the pie. And they also say when that “huge dip” is inevitable it gives them a better buying and return opportunity than someone that is buying into a lot of different companies.\n\nLast side note:\nYou have companies like Amazon who if the e commerce industry were to burst or go to shit they have other business ventures to fall back on for revenue like Amazon prime, twitch, etc which would make them broader and better investing opportunities than some other blue chip companies that might not have those assets.\n\nLast thing:\nMark Cuban says the same thing saying diversification is for people that don’t know what they are investing in.\n\nJust trying to see you guys’ take on that, im also wanting to figure out how I can calculate capital efficiency. Aka the “sweet spot”\n\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are very sure of a company, so sure that you would invest half of your life plus into that single company. Then yes, but they would have to be the biggest in their industry, no chance of competition. You need to fully understand their business model inside and out, how they got to be where they are “did they change or innovate in order to get there?” And “how are they positioned for the (contactless) future, you need to know EVERYTHING about their financials, understand and compare past growth to other companies. Andddd, they should have other assets to fall back on if their primary business were to fail. Then yes, it could be a great investment. Side note, when that one company eventually drops hard you’ll have a better buying and profit opportunity putting all your money in that one company, than you would have if you invested into a lot of different companies.\n\nTL;DR: better companies = better investments, less companies = calculated investments and more profits. \n(Still don’t know if I want to yolo into 1 company tho) \n\nGive me your insight on this*", "id": "j1dk32", "created_utc": 1601305156.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "Ok thank you for this now I own Coke", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "I dumped about half of my portfolio into a few dozen kilos.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Kilos of?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Coke.

[Many people misquote him however he does support diversification for the small retail investor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbjPiYE-F4Y) Most of the people who are in this sub and on reddit as a whole *should be diversifying* and using indices because they are not professional investors. \n2. One of the problems with \"diversification\" to begin with is a failure to understand what it is. Diversification can be achieved (literally and academically) with very few positions; if you took one position in XOM, one in TSLA and one in GLD for instance you've chosen three distinctly separate market segments that don't overlap and thus are diversified. That's all it takes. You can mix this up a million ways but basically it's about correlation, not number, so anyone who dilutes their positions is suffering for it.\n3. Large position owners have a lot of perks that the average person does not so it is not best to fail to understand this. There's just more to it such as taking on part of the revenue of the company on your own books and so forth and so on. Most people are not large position holders (5%+) so thusly most do not ever get this type of investment power which in turn means that most do better not doing this.\n4. Hardcore compounding does work but it requires skill and a lot of time *however* you must start *cheap*. You have to have a lot capital upfront and a very good idea that is very cheap at the time. For instance what Berkshire bought $KO for is in the Berkshire letters and it was below market for one and then the fact of the matter is that $KO was just stupidly cheap at the time and had extreme brand value that was not properly valued. This is *significantly* harder today due to crowding; you can't come up with a great idea that isn't arbitraged away very rapidly in the markets because today people jump on things very quickly. WSB is evidence of this. Generally speaking you're better off not trying this approach because again what happens now is large gains are made in quick instants versus long-standing outliers.
