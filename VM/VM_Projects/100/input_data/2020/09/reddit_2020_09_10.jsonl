{"title": "IMPORTANT FOR NEW TRADERS: UNDERSTANDING HOW MARKET MAKERS WORK", "selftext": "Given that there seems to be a large misconception of what market makers are, I felt it prudent to share some information. I often here the phrase \"the market makers just want to take your money and keep the stock away from $X price.\" This is inherently incorrect.\n\nMarket making is the identification of buyers and sellers with the intention of allowing them to consummate transactions. It is all done algorithmically.\n\nExchanges offer rebates to market makers in exchange for those market makers providing liquidity in different markets – they will pay MMs to hold short or long positions that provide liquidity in the market\n\n**Example:** A person wants to sell her stock for $51.00, but the current best offer (bid) is $49.00. If another market participant was desperate enough to purchase the stock, they would just move the bid to the ask. In this case, the liquidity provider is the participant who posted the $51.00 ask, meaning that they provided supply of that stock, which was sold.\n\nIf the algorithm decided that the fair price was $50.75 and the buyer was satisfied enough to purchase the asset at $50.75, the transaction would be consummated, and the seller would receive a rebate (in the form of a payment for their order flow)\n\nSome of this fee would come from the buyer (in the form of commissions, hence why when you hit the bid or ask, you are charged a higher fee with most brokerages, but when you leave your order open at the bid or ask and it is taken up on, you pay a lower commissions since you helped to provide liquidity)\n\nThere is essentially an algorithmic hunt for rebates occurring.\n\n[Diagram depicting Market Maker activity in a transaction](https://preview.redd.it/h7mh5rifjem51.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f810d26d65dcf94e103e0d31cf86d90edb5bff0)\n\nIn the options markets, for instance, MMs are now holding the majority of the positions that buyers and sellers are trying to either accumulate or offload.\n\nThese market makers are much more important because of their size and due to their large positions, which they are required to hedge to maintain delta neutrality.\n\nGiven the institutional mindset, which is to generate income passively by selling call options or buying puts on SPY, for instance, a situation is created whereby market makers who are hedging are compressing volatility as markets move higher (hence why the VIX declines steadily into market rallies).\n\nConversely, **market makers cause exaggerated selloffs when the market declines, which is why markets fall so much faster than they tend to rise, because they rapidly attempt to hedge their positions that they are short on the way down.**\n\nMarket makers basically create pressure points in the market through their activities and they exert the most pressure when rapid moves occur, further amplifying these moves.\n\nSome of the largest market makers are: Virtu Financial, Citadel Securities, Two Sigma Securities, Susquehanna, Tower Research Capital, Jump Trading, DRW, Hudson River Trading, among others.\n\nHope you found this useful and Godspeed.", "id": "iqemik", "created_utc": 1599779383.0, "score": 693, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "So I work for one of the biggest market makers on the street.\n\n\\>  Given the institutional mindset, which is to generate income passively  by selling call options or buying puts on SPY, for instance, a situation  is created whereby market makers who are hedging are compressing  volatility as markets move higher (hence why the VIX declines steadily  into market rallies). \n\nThis is wrong.

That's another topic of conversation. Accelerating selloffs are caused by the convexity of gamma.

If you look at the historical distribution of daily returns, you will find that it is statistically more like for the SP500 to move violently to the downside than the upside, that's why the skew is there. In other products, the skew could be priced to the call (like Gold), or symmetric (like Treasuries). This does not cost market makers any more to hedge. The only factor that would accelerate or dampen a move is whether market makers are long gamma or short gamma. If they're short, you'll get a larger move when MMs have to hack deltas, if they're long, you'll get a smaller move as they hedge deltas.\n\nAnd does all of this matter to MMs?

{"title": "Read 'The Intelligent Investor' & Sold my Portfolio", "selftext": "I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.\n\nOne sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:\n\n**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**\n\nThat sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays \"investors\" that is most embodied in meme sentences like \"stonks only go up\", \"buy the dip\", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.\n\nI think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a \"never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction\" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days. I feel smart and reliefed after selling to optimists.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did I made a foolish move based on outdated knowledge?

I think your first bullet is the most important one that I see a lot of beginners not take to heart.  When you buy a stock, you are becoming an owner of the company.\n\nYou can't think about it like you've bought this piece of paper that has a price tag, and then hope that price goes up now that you bought it.  You have to think about it as an owner--in that do you want to have a right to future earnings of this business.\n\nEvaluate based on what that business is likely to return to you over the time frame you have in mind for holding.  If it is going to be delivering solid earnings or cash flow, and growing those earnings over time, your investment today (at whatever the P/E says today) is likely to be more valuable later.  As P/E rises, it doesn't mean you can't still get those future earnings by becoming an owner.  It just means that the yield of those earnings will be less.\n\nIt has been years since I read Intelligent Investor, but did Graham speak much about relative valuations?  Because I think that's also something that is overlooked.  I like to take the P/E ratio (or price to cash flow when net income isn't a good measure) and inverse it, which gives me an earnings or cash flow yield.  If that yield is, say, 5%, then comparatively it is a better investment to other safer options.  You have to then do analysis against other companies in the market or against safer alternatives like bonds.\n\nA bond investor has to worry about valuation as well if they do not plan to hold the bond to term.  The prices can increase or decrease based on the yield that the market wants to pay.  But if a bond investor is going to hold for the full term, well, they are going to get that yield no matter what (assuming it doesn't default).  I like to think about stocks the same way.  If I plan to hold them long enough, I will somewhat lock in the yield.

We are and have been at all time low interest rates and will be for a long time in my opinion.  We are a global economy (ask your kids who buy pokemon cards overseas) and to me the TECH sector isn't all tech.  Amazon is more Sears/JC Penney for those of you old enough to understand the comparison.  Facebook/Google are ad agencies, nothing more.  The global economy wants the stability of the US Dollar and inturn US stocks which drive PE's higher because of simple supply/demand which again is completely different form 3yrs ago, 5yrs ago, 10yrs ago and so on.

The company is now planning to use  General Motors Co. battery technology after signing a deal with GM this  week, under which it will issue $2 billion of new shares to GM. Nikola  did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch email and telephone request  for comment.  \n>  \n>[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/short-seller-hindenburg-alleges-that-electric-truck-maker-nikola-is-an-intricate-fraud-in-new-report-2020-09-10](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/short-seller-hindenburg-alleges-that-electric-truck-maker-nikola-is-an-intricate-fraud-in-new-report-2020-09-10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Today, we reveal why we believe Nikola is an intricate fraud built  on dozens of lies over the course of its Founder and Executive Chairman  Trevor Milton’s career.\n* We have gathered extensive  evidence—including recorded phone calls, text messages, private emails  and behind-the-scenes photographs—detailing dozens of false statements  by Nikola Founder Trevor Milton. We have never seen this level of  deception at a public company, especially of this size.\n* Trevor  has managed to parlay these false statements made over the course of a  decade into a \\~$20 billion public company. He has inked partnerships  with some of the top auto companies in the world, all desperate to catch  up to Tesla and to harness the EV wave.\n* We examine how Nikola  got its early start and show how Trevor misled partners into signing  agreements by falsely claiming to have extensive proprietary technology.\n* We  reveal how, in the face of growing skepticism over the functionality of  its truck, Nikola staged a video called “Nikola One in Motion” which  showed the semi-truck cruising on a road at a high rate of speed. Our  investigation of the site and text messages from a former employee  reveal that the video was an elaborate ruse—Nikola had the truck towed  to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and simply filmed it  rolling down the hill.\n* In October 2019, Nikola announced it  would revolutionize the battery industry. This was to be done through a  pending acquisition, but the deal fell through when Nikola realized (a)  the technology was vaporware and (b) the President of the battery  company had been indicted months earlier over allegations that he conned  NASA by using his expense account to procure numerous prostitutes.\n* Nikola  has never walked back claims relating to its battery technology.  Instead, Trevor continued to publicly hype the technology even after  becoming aware of the above issues. The revolutionary battery technology  never existed – now, Nikola plans to use GM’s battery technology  instead.\n* A spokesman for Volvo spin-off Powercell AB, a hydrogen  fuel cell technology company that formerly partnered with Nikola,  called Nikola’s battery and hydrogen fuel cell claims “hot air”.\n* In  addition to now using GM’s battery technology, Nikola seeks to use the  automaker’s production and fuel cell capabilities. Nikola seems to be  bringing nothing to the partnership but concept designs, their brand  name and up to $700 million they will be paying GM for costs related to  production.\n* Inexpensive hydrogen is fundamental to the success  of Nikola’s business model. Trevor has claimed in a presentation to  hundreds of people and in multiple interviews to have succeeded at  cutting the cost of hydrogen by \\~81% compared to peers and to *already be producing hydrogen*. Nikola has not produced hydrogen at this price or at *any* price as he later admitted when pressed by media.\n* Trevor  has appointed his brother, Travis, as “Director of Hydrogen  Production/Infrastructure” to oversee this critical part of the  business. Travis’s prior experience looks to have largely consisted of  pouring concrete driveways and doing subcontractor work on home  renovations in Hawaii.\n* Claims of owning energy producing assets  is not new for Nikola. Trevor claimed that Nikola’s headquarters has 3.5  megawatts of solar panels on its roof producing energy. Aerial photos  of the roof and later media reports show that the supposed panels don’t  exist.\n* At one point Nikola claimed to own its own natural gas  wells. There is no evidence in company filings to support this. The  claims were eventually quietly removed from Nikola’s website.\n* Trevor  claims Nikola designs all key components in house, but they appear to  simply be buying or licensing them from third-parties. One example: we  found that Nikola actually buys inverters from a company called  Cascadia. In a video showing off its “in-house” inverters, Nikola  concealed the Cascadia label with a piece of masking tape.\n* In a  July 2020 podcast, Trevor said of Nikola’s “Tre” truck: “We have five of  them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm Germany.” A  spokesperson for Bosch, the manufacturing partner building the trucks,  confirmed this month that they haven’t made any trucks yet.\n* The  company’s Nikola One “reveal” was a total farce. We corroborate  Bloomberg’s earlier work debunking Trevor’s claims regarding its  semi-truck that “this thing fully functions and works…this is a real  truck” and provide new evidence.\n* We present behind-the-scenes  photos showing that Nikola had an electricity cable snaked up from  underneath the stage into the truck in order to falsely claim the Nikola  One’s electrical systems fully functioned.\n* We learned through  emails and interviews with former partners that Trevor had an artist  stencil “H2” and “Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric” on the side of the  Nikola One despite it having no hydrogen capabilities whatsoever; it was  built with natural gas components.\n* We also present evidence  that subsequent “reveals” were fictitious. In 2019, Nikola revealed a  “next generation” version of its off-road vehicle. We learned that it  was scrapped within weeks of the unveiling due to manufacturing  challenges. The redesign work was then quietly outsourced.\n* Nikola’s  much-touted multi-billion dollar order book is filled with fluff. U.S.  Xpress reportedly accounts for a third of its reservations, representing  \\~$3.5 billion in orders. U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on  hand last quarter.\n* Nikola’s key partners and backers have been  cashing out aggressively. Worthington, Bosch and ValueAct have all sold  shares. Worthington sold $237 million shares over a 2-day span in July  and another $250 million in August. We think they know exactly what type  of company Nikola is, and we expect that as Nikola’s GM “partnership”  boosts the stock price, key holders will continue to exit.\n* We  think Trevor Milton, through dozens of outright lies, was able to form  partnerships with some of the largest legacy auto companies in the world  in their desperation to catch up to Tesla’s EV leadership status.\n* Trevor  has ensured he is not going down with the ship.  He cashed out $70  million around the IPO and amended his share lock-up from 1-year to 180  days. If he is fired, his equity awards immediately vest and he is  entitled to collect $20 million over two years. Milton has laid the  groundwork to extract hundreds of millions from Nikola years before ever  delivering on his promises.\n* Every now and then a story comes  around that exposes how little the “experts” really know. Theranos inked  partnerships with Walgreens, Safeway, and Cleveland Clinic and staffed  its board with luminaries. We think Nikola’s partners did not do their homework\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch more info here:\n\n[https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)", "id": "iq338g", "created_utc": 1599743837.0, "score": 234, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "If you don't want people to believe you're a Tesla wannabe and trying to capitalize on the EV bubble, he should have named his company something other than Nikola...", "score": 111, "replies": [{"body": "BTW, about a month ago there was a thread out about compiling all of the misdeeds by the company’s management, and foretold this report coming out\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RealNikola/comments/i5q0xb/nikola_insider/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I said the same thing about Tesla back when they were making cars with shitty QC in a tent.

Can **you** help us make sense of it all?\" Like there's some random person sitting out there with the experience to do that who wasn't already aware of this company 5 years ago. Plus, Elon ran off most of the talent already b/c he told them their research wasn't progressing fast enough. From first hand accounts I've received, this is fairly typical of him (to naively ask for things to be done more quickly when it's not possible to do so). The only reason SpaceX isn't off the rails is that Elon had the sense to leave a lot of their top talent in place so as not to cause a feud with NASA whom most of those guys came from due to budget cuts.\n\nI mean, good on you all for making money on all this, but you people are nuts.

So around 2025 they will be selling 5,000,000 cars a year, at $1,000 dollars in software margins that's 145 billion in market cap based on the software alone. And that's not even taking into account that the software is eventually going to be 10x more expensive than it is now while also generating monthly profits from the ride hailing marketplace.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm confused why you even mention P/E. It has nothing to do with the rest of your comment.\n\nAnyway. So you think that if they sell 500K cars this year, and sold 400K cars last year, by 2025 they'll sell 5M cars a year for a total of 145M cars? I'm not sure I'm following here.\n\nAnd didn't some people already paid for FSD?

It has nothing to do with the rest of your comment.\n\nI'm mentioning the P/E ratio because it's part of my calculation to show that a 1,000 dollar (pure margin) software package on 5,000,000 cars justifies 145 billion of their market cap if you use the average P/E ratio of the S&P500, which is currently ~29. 5,000,000 * 1,000 * 29 = ~145 billion. Seeing as Tesla is growing much faster than the S&P, in actuality it would probably be worth a multiple of that.\n\n> Anyway. So you think that if they sell 500K cars this year, and sold 400K cars last year, by 2025 they'll sell 5M cars a year for a total of 145M cars? I'm not sure I'm following here.\n\n145 was the justified market cap in billions, not cars sold. They did 400,000 cars last year and will do 500,000 this year. This is obviously not a 50% increase, but their target in 2016 was to sell 500,000 cars in 2020 and their target right now is to grow at 50% annually and they're already building the infrastructure to guarantee that at least until 2023. So provided that they continue to execute, that means that in 2026 they would sell 500,000 * 1,5^6 = ~5,700,000 cars. I thought this would be in 2025, but I miscalculated by a year.\n\n> And didn't some people already paid for FSD? (basically auto-pilot at this point) And you think every single Tesla owner will pay for that?\n\nDefinitely not. As of 2019, 1 in 9 Tesla's was sold with FSD. The price is currently 8,000 dollars, so that's almost 1,000 dollars per car. Obviously as we get closer to actual full autonomy, both the price of the package will increase (eventually up to 100,000 dollars according to Musk, remember that autonomous taxis will be able to earn around 1,500 dollars per month for the owner, so that price is really not too outrageous) as well as the amount of cars that will be sold with full self driving (eventually 100%).\n\n> Everything here sounds insanely optimistic. You didn't account for competition at all, either.\n\nIt does sound insanely optimistic, but I also think it's realistic. I did account for competition actually, because in 10 years' time 100% of cars sold will be EVs. Global car sales have been relatively stable at 60-70 million per year since 2016. Tesla currently has a 28% global EV market share (and growing) which would translate into 16,800,000 cars sold in 2030. They could lose 2/3 of their (growing) market size and they would still be at 5,000,000+ cars sold in 2030. And that's assuming anyone would still be willing to buy other car brands if Tesla's the only one with fully autonomous cars.\n\nI know all of these numbers sound insane and are unlike anything the world has ever seen in this market, but that's exactly the reason why there's such a big opportunity in this company. Everyone's so stuck in this mindset of thinking everything Tesla's aiming to do is impossible, that they're missing what's really happening. It's exactly like the iPhone moment for Apple, except that it's a lot harder to build the product and infrastructure to compete with Tesla than it was to build an (Android) smartphone and the infrastructure to build enough phones and compete with Apple.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Good points and its probably too early.

And because of Apple -like brand I was sure they would continue to have good margins. However, after studied this company hundreds of hours during these insane gains, I realized autonomy opportunities are spectacular, especially the autonomy day opened my eyes. Also energy and software opportunities are huge. Plus my original thesis of the core car business has only gotten stronger as I see there hasn't been this kind of brand ever in car business. Ever.

Like on Sep 8 Finland was struggling and paying $0.1/kWh (95€/MWh) to regulate power up. Usually power is only like $0.36/kWh for all day contracts, between 1AM - 5AM power was only $0.011/kWh.\n\nI'm pretty sure the regulating prices are in addition to what you actually make selling the electricity. \n\nWhen the price is $0.011/kWh and there's too much power in the grid, they'll pay anyone currently supplying power $0.0065/kWh, just to turn off their power plant.

{"title": "Button Pushing", "selftext": "I wake up in the morning and press some buttons to see if the button pressing I did yesterday was good or bad. It was bad. I press some more buttons and pray things get better today.\n\nAfter I shower and get dressed, I press the button to call an elevator to take me down from my 15th floor condo to the street level where a Starbucks resides. I order a pumpkin spice latte and the nice young woman presses some buttons to inform the barista of my order. I then stick my card in a machine and press some buttons to pay for it.\n\nOn the way back up to my condo, I press some more buttons on my pocket screen to check up on my earlier button pressing. It's worse now. I press some more buttons to make the bleeding stop.\n\nI logon to my work screen and press some buttons to dial into a teleconference committee of like 30 people. Half of us discuss process and procedures for button pressing that will impact several thousand peoples' button pushing activities. The other half (myself included) are distracted with other button pressing.\n\nMy boss messages me asking why the numbers are down. He seems angry. I grab some data, press some buttons, and explain to him what happened. I then tell him which people should press what buttons to make the numbers go back up. He is now happy. They pay me 6 figures a year to do this. I look at my non-work screen and get angry as I see where that money is going.\n\nLater today, when I am done pressing the buttons on my work screen, my non-work screen, and my pocket screen, I'll head to my microwave and push some more buttons, then to the couch and push different buttons. Once the sun has set and I am tired, I will push the button that makes the big screen stop. Before going to sleep, I will check my pocket screen one last time and gaze into the future. The numbers will still be down.\n\nI never know which buttons to push to make them go back up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I am not even joking.

{"title": "SPY WILL NOT HIT $300 RETARDS", "selftext": "Just as the title says the market will not tank. This is a healthy correction but of course when we're so fucking leveraged with short exp calls it feels like the apocalypse. \n\nLet's take a quick look at June 8th. SPY had a face ripping rally of roughly 30% from the previous 3 months. It was a steady climb up with a few dips a long the way. The drop off from June 8th was about 8% over a week. This is widely considered as a healthy correction. This wasn't followed by another rally. No, this is where the Kangaroo market was formed. AMD was trading like KO hovering in the $50's and theta gang was taking Bulls and Bears lunch. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks of this consolidation we started the bull run that was more rigged than Tim Donaghy officiating NBA games. SPY went up 18% in about 2 months with almost no dips along the way. Similar to June 8th, SPY drops about 8% in a week. Again, a healthy correction. Will this be followed by another 18% rally? Probably not. We'll have some big green and red days sprinkled in here and there in the next week or so.

And they could put a floor around 300 here too.\n\nDetails in the wall of text below.\n\nMost of the value in the market, say 75%, is institutional money managed with fixed % allocations. Say 50/50 equity/bonds. QE pushed the value of bonds up (and promises to keep them there); together with the drop in equity values, that mechanically caused a massive flood of cash into equities. The equity portfolio managers then have to pick stocks. They may think everything is a Sell, but they have no choice. So they hold their nose and put the cash where it seems safest - tech, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Or they're following their benchmark index to a T, to reduce the chance they'll get fired.\n\nIf stocks go down, institutions will sell bonds to top up equities. Bonds can't go down, because of the Fed they're a bottomless pool of money. So if stocks drop 30%, the overall portfolio is down 15%, so stocks will get topped up until they're only down 15%. Traders frontrun the reallocation trade (either as an intentional strategy or because they're BTFD'ing), so even before the institutions do anything, stocks' losses are trimmed to 15%. Which means they should only be down 7.5%....then 3.75%...\n\nThe same mechanism could limit how much stocks can go up, but with bonds as expensive as they are, institutions might be more inclined to let the \"house money\" stay in equities. And no one is rushing in to short the market to correct prices (that strategy hasn't worked very well this year).\n\nStocks haven't crashed *because they can't*.\n\nThere are a bunch of side plots going on at the same time, e.g. the options feedback loop. And one way the above could fail is this: the Fed corporate debt programs have about $1 trillion. If and when the market starts exercising this put, the $1T will be gone in a day. The Fed doesn't have enough ammo. They can reload but that may take time, and it would lead to some awful outcomes like the Fed owning worthless defaulted bonds issued in August 2020, where the proceeds were immediately dividend'ed out to the PE company that controls the issuer.\n\nCMBS are another potential hole. Last I heard the market is still essentially frozen, so as not to look down. But as more CMBS defaults it will get harder to pretend they're worth the same as they used to be.\n\nA couple other theories supportive of the market:\n\n* the Fed created so much cash that cash is now worth less (in terms of asset purchasing power, not CPI purchasing power, which are pretty loosely linked these days); so companies are worth less, but so is money;\n* most of the S&P 500 will survive; many of their competitors won't.

Either through consolidation or attrition. In the 1990's the honest man who worked his 40 hours and contributed 75 percent of his post tax income to a high yield savings did well. Today that same man has to dance for more money and gamble to stay afloat.\n\nAnd I think that hopelessness is what causes people to live la vida loco.

I don't understand the logistics of the idea.\n\nI'd say a lot of this is just over population. Earths population has gone from less than 2 billion in 1920 to over 8 billion in just 100 years. The same saving tactics that worked 40 years ago couldn't possibly work as well now. \n\nAbsolutely insane and unsustainable exponential growth made possible by how privileged and capable almost every person alive no matter how poor or bad off is compared to the average person from 200+ years ago and it's only going to get worse.\n\nI think the average man has trouble staying afloat by the old pre 90s method because they have unreasonable standards when considering the situation we're in. Everyone wants to be white picket fence living like everyone else they know, without thinking about how much debt those people they know actually are in. So they just hop on board the debt train thinking it's normal. \n\nOr the other commonality is they live in dense, overpopulated expensive inner cities, pay rent instead of paying to own, while working either one or multiple near minimum wage jobs and think that since they work multiple jobs their life should be as good as if they were working 1 high paying job that they had to put in much more effort to obtain. \n\nA lot of people who work low paying jobs will do something like have a kid, then instead of convincing themselves they need a higher paying job to afford the kid will convince themselves they're just not being paid enough for the job they have and that it's all the rich peoples fault.\n\nI dont think they \"know\" the next 60 years will be shit, i think they play victim and assume so to be true by telling themselves the top has all the money already when it's just not true. I certainly never convinced myself of such and I'm quite young. If you're alive and not in crippling debt and are putting money aside to go towards things that retain value or produce income for you like rental property or a small business then life is pretty great, but they screwed up one of those steps somewhere.\n\nShit now people are openly advocating against property rights and they ironically call landlords leeches so I'd imagine long term income from rental property isn't exactly in their playbook anyway.\n\nI'd rather live in a $5,000 5th wheel on $10,000 worth of land while making 35-70k depending on the years weather and buy a 80k house not even to live in but to rent out to someone else before doing what most people do which is making a steady annual 35kish while living in a $165k house with a $24k car that will break before or just after i pay it off. I could work at walmart and still live as I do at least as far as shelter goes.\n\nI know so many people my age who get a 35-50k a year job then immediately buy a house well above what they can reasonably afford or pay off in a reasonable amount of time just because the bank will let them and immediately also buys a $30k car because they want to \"look\" the part whether they actually play the part or not with no regard for life changing events like what is happening this year.\n\nIf I make more money than someone, am relatively the same age as them, and I drive a paid for 2002 dodge ram and live on land i paid off in a 5th wheel trailer while they're driving a 2019 Altima they still owe 22k on and live in a house they still owe 15+ years on based on their wage and have dreams of sending their kid to college, there is an issue... on top of that they'd be the ones to call me trailer trash while they are at it too just because they scoff at the idea of living in one. But when the economy collapses for one reason or another and they still have bills to pay while I essentially have next to none and my income is unchanged because of what I chose to do who's living trashy?\n\nI dunno i could just be an asshole but I swear I saw something like this coming and have been setting myself up for success in the event of a collapse while im still at a young age so It's difficult for me to see or sympathize with any healthy, perfectly capable individuals who weren't prepared for this or have been complaining for the past decade about wealth inequality because it seemed pretty obvious to me it was coming. Obviously some people are actually in a tight spot not of their own doing but I definitely don't believe it's the majority and maybe we'dbe in a better position to help those who actually need it if the system hadn't been absued by so many for so long. \n\nIt had been far to long since the world had seen real hardship and I knew something was coming eventually in this modern age, everything has been too quiet for years.\n\nThough through my experience it seems most people who are down and out just make bad decisions and don't want to recognize, live with, or change because of them. It's easier to blame whoever they possibly can for it and demand change weather they can precisely articulate what that change is or not.\n\nIt's not any one individuals fault we're overpopulated or that prices law rules supreme in the end so that they absolutely must recognize their situation but I believe it's everyone's own job to recognize the reality of the world today and learn to adapt to it for their own sake however they can because that's just simple darwinisim and we cannot just violently change the way life is. Those who do not adapt will be left behind and I can't say that I believe the burden of saving them should be on anyone but themselves. \n\nThat or they can just keep on keeping on, complaining about wealth inequality without a real sense of direction or plan but man we've tried that before, we keep trying it every few decades in different countries and it hasn't worked out very well for any common man or woman yet, we have pretty well documented events of it causing massive harm and death but we keep doing it.\n\nEdit: I recognize what I've said doesn't eliminate the problem or indefinitely refute the idea wealth inequality is a problem to at least some degree regardless if I think a lot of it is just bad decision making at the bottom/simply prices law at work, but what im getting at is i dont think this will work, I dont think this can work, I dont think it's even supposed to work perfectly. We don't have anything to prove any economic system will work in the long term. We either have economic freedom which entails inequality inherently which isn't necessarily a bad thing, or we have totalitarian forced equality. \n\nThe whole world has been on a debt train to one another for many years now. Who's to say there's a correct way to do this that will solve most of the problems without creating new ones or sacrificing vital freedoms? Countries that our youth talk of as if they've got it figured out like the UK most definitely do not have it figured out at all.. We would need to see hundreds of years into the future to determine the validity of any system, we may have been doing this for a few generations now but we are still in the infancy stage considering this has all been accomplished in a very short span of time relative to our existence. All i can really say for anyone is recognize it is what it is and adapt or become a victim of circumstance because even the economists haven't a clue wtf they are talking about long term because most civilizations have collapsed long before that can be determined and this train is going to keep on chugging forward pending any major world wide war/event that resets the economy again.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "*Most* people *are* \"workin\".
