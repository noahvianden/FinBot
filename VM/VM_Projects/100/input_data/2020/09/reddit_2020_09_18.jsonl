We achieved record revenue of $72.0 billion, **48% of which was from our data-centric businesses**\n\nIt is clear that they are shifting away from PC-centric to data-centric, so a decline in market share for the PC market is to be expected, but a dominance and growth in data will continue to happen. But that also depends on two things: has their data division continued to grow, and are they reinvesting enough?\n\nFor the reinvestment, they say they will continue to reinvest into R&D (which I consider and factor into ROIC in my DCF analysis) and capital. This is entirely in their hands so I expect this to be true for the most part. From their 10-K:\n\n> Our first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to strengthen our competitive position. We shifted our R&D focus as we began a transformation to a data-centric company, while efficiently maintaining our investment at approximately 20% of revenue. [...]Our second allocation priority is to invest in companies around the world that will complement our strategic objectives and stimulate growth of data-centric opportunities.\n\nIn the most recent 10-Q, they say:\n\n> R&D decreased by $141 million, or 2.1%, driven by the following:\n\n> - (-)Ramp down of 5G smartphone modem business\t\n\n> - (+)Investments in our PC **and data-centric businesses**\n\n> - (+)Investments in our process technology \n\n> - (+)Profit dependent compensation\n\nThey also mention:\n\n> We acquired Moovit for $915 million to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services.\n\nMaaS is part of their data-centric shift, which includes the IoT (internet of things). Acquisition in my books looks like reinvestments to me.\n\nFrom all this, I can rest assured that they will continue their reinvestments. They did kind of begrudgingly mention that they will continue share purchases and dividend payouts, but I am not interested in that. Growth is my main priority, and dividends are not growth.\n\nAnyway, regarding growth, although the ratio of PC-Data is still roughly the same as of Q2 2020, the data division is growing very fast:\n\n> [O]ur data-centric businesses and PC-centric business grew 34% and 7%, respectively.\n\nThat is huge growth from data-centric, and there is still much more room to grow. I know that this still draws on the same ideas of taking historical returns, but it is more like trying to find out the current ROIC and reinvestment rate.\n\nThink about it like this: Intel has to have an ROIC. It might not be knowable, but it technically exists. It is a real measure, and there is one as of now. Now, imagine you were an omniscient being that knows this ROIC, and reinvestment rate.

{"title": "Trump to block U.S. downloads of TikTok, WeChat on Sunday", "selftext": "The Commerce Department announced Friday morning that it would ban U.S. business transactions with Chinese-owned social apps WeChat and TikTok on Sunday.\n\nThe announcement comes ahead of an expected statement Friday by President Donald Trump on whether or not the government will approve a deal for Oracle to take a minority stake in TikTok and become a “trusted technology partner” for the company in the U.S.\n\nIt’s unclear if the Commerce Department’s announcement means there’s no possibility of a deal going through before the Sunday deadline, and it could be an aggressive move from the Trump Administration to push for its original intention for TikTok to be fully owned by a U.S. company.\n\n“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Friday.\n\nFriday’s announcement from the Commerce Department is an enforcement of Trump’s original executive order from August 6 that gave TikTok 45 days to sell its U.S. business to a U.S. company or face a ban in the U.S. WeChat, which is one of the most popular social messaging apps in the world, is owned by the Chinese company Tencent. TikTok’s parent company is the Chinese company ByteDance. Trump’s executive order cited national security concerns over the Chinese government’s access to user data in those apps to justify the potential ban.\n\nThe Commerce Department’s statement on Friday said that starting Sept. 20, U.S. companies would be banned from distributing WeChat and TikTok, meaning the two major mobile app stores run by Apple and Google would have to remove the apps from their libraries. The statement also blocks U.S. companies from providing services through WeChat “for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.”\n\nWeChat is a popular marketing and sales tool for U.S. companies primarily in China, but around the world as well. With U.S. social apps like Facebook and Instagram banned in China, WeChat is the primary app people use for social networking and e-commerce. It’s also a popular app used by people in the U.S. to communicate with people in China, since U.S. apps are banned in China.\n\nThe Commerce Department’s announcement also lays out a separate time frame specific to TikTok, which take affect on Nov. 12. The rules that start Nov. 12 include provisions that block U.S. companies from providing internet hosting and services for TikTok. This could be directed at the deal being negotiated between TikTok and Oracle, which would provide cloud services for TikTok if Trump approves, and could give TikTok and Oracle more time to hammer out a deal that Trump will approve.\n\nRepresentatives for Tencent, TikTok, WeChat, Apple and Google were not immediately available to comment.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/trump-to-block-us-downloads-of-tiktok-wechat-on-sunday-officials-tell-reuters.html", "id": "iv56al", "created_utc": 1600432308.0, "score": 4227, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 989, "comments": [{"body": "What’s does it mean exactly?

Sell a 45 days to expiry call option at a strike of $200.\n\nPossible scenarios at the expiry of the option:\n\n**Scenario 1 - Apple is trading at a price below the strike price of the option (let's say $130 as an example)**\n\nYou get to keep the premium received on selling the call option (minus the brokerage charges) and nothing to lose.\n\n**Scenario 2 - Apple is trading at a price above the strike price of the option (let's say $210 as an example)**\n\nProfit made = $200 (strike price) - $118 (price at which you bought) + **premium received by selling the option** \\- brokerage charges\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only lost opportunity in this trade setup is that if Apple really shoots up a lot more than the call option strike price, you lose out on the extra profit that could have been made by selling it at that price.

In the above example, Apple reaching $200 in the next 45 days has very little probability.

Ives raised his price target to $475, which is 12.2% above Thursday’s closing price of $423.43, from $380, while reiterating the neutral rating he’s had on the stock since April 2019. “The pent-up demand in the China EV market for Model 3’s and recent price cuts are catalyzing strong unit deliveries for Musk & Co. in this key market with increased market share vs. domestic competitors as the Giga 3 success story continues to play out,” Ives wrote in a note to clients. He said because Model 3s sold in China have incrementally higher margins compared with those sold in the U.S. and Europe, he believes the strength in China could increase Tesla’s profitability profile over the next few years. And for the much-anticipated Battery Day scheduled for Sept. 22, Ives said Chief Executive Elon Musk will announce a number of potential “game changing” battery developments. The stock’s selloff the past two days snapped a 5-day win streak in which the stock soared 36.2%, which in turn came after a five-day bear-market selloff in which the stock sank 33.7%.

The idea of “unlimited” profit from a call is alluring, but if you want to actually make money then you should research a stock and have a price target in mind. Make the call spread by buying a call below your target and then sell a call at your target. Use the computer version of ToS (even to inform your Robinhood trades) figure out which interval of money between the long (buy) and short (sold) call has the most favorable risk to reward for your projection. For instance, you think TSLA will be 450, if you can buy the 440C and sell the 450C for $5, then you would make a maximum profit of 100% if the stock is at or above $450 at expiry (distance between the strikes - the cost of the contract). The cost of the spread can not be more than the distance of the strikes, so this allows for not having to risk so much to buy options on a high dollar stock. Because the cost of the spread is so much less than the call alone, you can get the same amount of leverage for less $ if you can get the price movement right. If you’re wrong, then you’ve lost less than on a naked call. If you can’t feel excited about a potential 100% profit (with some stocks you could get even more, but TSLA...), you should sell your positions and recalibrate before managing your money. \n\nI would recommend taking on less positions and trying to drill down into a few situations that you think you actually understand and trade those. Use stop losses and limit orders to limit loss and lock in profits once you get to your target. It’s better to drill down into a few positions and understand the stocks and price movement extremely well rather than just following trends on social media. You want to be ahead of the majority of people when you buy, otherwise you set yourself up for failure. One way to make money at this is to identify situations where something has been hyped, but the hype subsided and the stock pulled back too much and will pop again within a few months. Look at whether the stock is oversold (in terms of RSI) and see if the implied volatility is higher than normal, then only buy the contracts when you see that these metrics make the trade favorable. If you’re not saying no to some trades that you’re researching deeply, you’re probably fomoing and need to focus on good entry points. \n\nHope this helps some. If you don’t feel like you have the energy to spend the time researching and understanding each stock and figuring out a reasonable price target in each trade you will always lose money in the mid-long term, and will likely go to zero in your account. Risk management is everything if you want to keep playing this game. \n\nCheers!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Get out of amc lmao", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "He'll give it back", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Damn that's lots of calls lol", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "you dont wanna look at my td ameritrade either", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Plan B if market tank 3% between on Monday and Tuesday???", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Kill myself rofl", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Lol", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Calls on $ROPE", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "More than I’ve made the past few trading sessions", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "At least yours green on PTON", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I feel this title so bad.

{"title": "Costco (COST) will rain tendies and hit 360 at least by Friday", "selftext": "Alright everyone, a lot of us are looking forward to battery day coming up on Tuesday. But what do we do after? Well it’s fucking Costco (COST) of all things. I know, I know I’m a boomer but hear me out:\nCostco is a wholesale corporation like its competitors it makes money off of memberships while barely making a profit off of its low margin on goods. They may sell a 5lb jar of peanut butter for $10 dollars and produce that jar for $9. This is a very low profit markup and on its own there is no way that Costco could compete. However, here is the kicker: the membership. With the lowest tier of membership running only $60 a year or $5 monthly (120 for “executive”) Costco can afford to sell this low profit markup.\n\nCostco reported that their gross margin (net sales less merchandise cost) was 11% while their operating costs as a percentage of net sales was 10%  -[Annual report](https://investor.costco.com/static-files/05c62fe6-6c09-4e16-8d8b-5e456e5a0f7e)\nThe business model looks something like this:\nBuy no-name branded products at wholesale discount -> slap the Kirkland logo on it -> sell for small profit 11% -> utilize 10% profit to pay for operating costs = profit (albeit only 1% of their sales) –source(annual report)--\nSmall profit markup means cheaper prices for consumer -> consumer wants to return -> customer pays almost nothing ($60) for the right to shop there -> customer goes to Costco maaaaybe 10-20 times a year, because everything is cheap and sold in bulk middle class/upper middle class stock up on everything = large customer base. \nIn addition the Kirkland brand has become a household name helping them increase their membership numbers (detailed below)\n\n\nSo how can I prove that Costco is undervalued?\nCostco is currently trading at $336 is with a peak this year before the recent downturn (see: last two weeks) of $363.\nLast year at the beginning of September Costco was trading at roughly $300.\nWe are currently trading about 11.5% over last year.\n\n***\nCostco reported an increase in sales in all terms:\n“Net sales of $13.56 billion for the retail month of August, the four weeks ended August 30, 2020, an increase of 15.0 percent from $11.79 billion last year.\nFor the 16-week fourth quarter ended August 30, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $52.3 billion, an increase of 12.7 percent compared to net sales of $46.4 billion during the similar period last year.\nFor the 52-week fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $163.2 billion, an increase of 9.2 percent from the $149.4 billion during the similar period last year.”\n-(august report)- [August report](https://investor.costco.com/news-releases/news-release-details/costco-wholesale-corporation-reports-august-sales-results-7)\n\n***\nCostco has had around 4 million new memberships a year. 2016: 86.7 million -> 2017: 90.3 million -> 2018: 94.3 million -> 2019: 98.5 million -> 2020: Unknown but around 102 million\nHowever around half of those aren’t payed memberships like you would think. 53.9 million are directly paid memberships with 20.8 million of that the Executive and the rest just regular.\nThe other 49 million are under business memberships (the same price, but it allows these people to place even more people under the membership for an extra $60 a year per person) this is a good thing because what might be reported as one membership business membership could in reality be 3 or 4. \n[The website](https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html-)\n\nCostco membership renewal is around 91%. –annual report\n\n\n\nThis means that Costco has actually been doing better this year than last with the pandemic by more than 11%\n\nIn fact, on their lowest impacting thing (their sales) Costco is doing almost 10% better than last year. $13 billion actually.\nTheir memberships make up the difference\n\n2019: 98,500,000 x $71 (19% are the 120 a year plan) = $6.9 Billion\n2020: 102,000,000 x $72 (20% are the 120 a year plan) = $7.14 Billion\n$2.4b dollar difference in memberships + $13 billion dollar difference in sales = $15.4 billion new profit vs last August.\n\nSo with the sales and the member ships combined we are up around 13-14% of profit.\nThe estimated EPS is 2.81 vs 2.69 last year. Or roughly a 4% gain. (This isn’t a measure of growth but a measure of growth compared to profit)\nCostco (on average builds/acquires 5-20 new warehouses a year) at the end of august 2019 they had 785.\nBasically not only should the stock be at least 14% over 300 but we also have the increase of growth 2-5%.\nWith a total stock increase of anywhere between 14-19% of last year. Basically 636!!\n\nTLDR: BUY COSTCO CUZ THEY KILLIN IT AND THE PANDEMIC DIDN’T STOP THEM FROM MAKIN MONEY OFF YOUR MEMBERSHIP THAT YOU DIDN’T CANCELL BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU ITS $5 A MONTH TO GET CHEAP ASS BULK GOODS.\n\nPos: COST 30 x 350c 9/25 sell around $7, COST 25 x 355C 9/25 selling around 5, 17 COST SHARES selling at 350 and plan to get more once I sell these 7 x TSLA 550c 9/25", "id": "ivhk7r", "created_utc": 1600473209.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "My calls, which are absolutely fucked right now are hoping you're right", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah... um when did you buy your calls?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Literally the day before the market went to shit", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Oh fuck you fucked-fucked.
