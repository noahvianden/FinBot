When we got up towards $500 a share (and an even higher percentage of my investments) I thought about selling some to lower the exposure but decided against it.    Thought process was that even if I lost all of it it including my initial investment it won't really impact my long term goals.   My long term view of the company hasn't changed and is even stronger now then last year when i held down below $200 a share pre split (and accumulated more then).    So decided not to balance.   Hindsight says I should have done that but it is easy to know that now.    But I have always operated on the time in the market is better then timing the market as I am not a trader and was burned once trying to do that.   Turned out that is now a 10k lesson as if I had just held then I would have 25 shares more today.   On the flip side I think that the upside is far more long term.   So holding might mean not much if it flops long term.   But if I hold and Tesla continues to perform like some think this will take more actual goals and make it so I might be able to do whatever I want by 50.\n\nI was going to ask this question at some point.

Something similar to what a fund would do like ARK.   This forces you to sell but not worry about timing the market.  It also means that most of your other investment is still there.

So if you think you can make 8-10% in the market and your loan only costs 4.25%, it’s better to invest that lump sum and make your monthly payments. Example: if you had a lump sum of $5k, you would save about $1.1k in interest at 4.25 % over 10 years. If you invested that $5k instead at 7% interest, you’d make about $4.8k in interest so you’re $3.7k ahead, pre capital gains, by investing. That doesn’t include the tax benefits of claiming student loan interest, which makes the math better for investing. Of course there is risk in the market but the ten year repayment period mitigates that.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Enlighten me on claiming student loan interest. I’m way under the standard deduction when it comes to taxes, maybe that changes it. I would probably do no more than 10k in lump sum I’d think.
