Your short position is at 79 total delta, and your long is at 57 delta, so if APPL continues downward you'll actually be able to close this for a profit and re-center it.  Of course you'll still be holding an unrealized loss in the shares at that point, but you would anyway if you were looking to sell covered calls.  If APPL goes back up then you can roll your covered call out and up if you want, and let the extra call spread get close to max profit before closing.  You're basically capturing double the upside until 115, which is in this case would put him back near his 125 cost basis overall considering the initial credit received.\n\nI like the idea of being able to open a low to no cost position that will rapidly recover losses in an underlying that I think will go back up eventually, and once it does rise I can resume selling covered calls above cost basis.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Would anyone be willing to recommend an options alert group/service?

Drag the column to the left until you can see it without scrolling.\n\nThat's where your buying power went. \n\n* Every spread has a margin reserve that reduces buying power. It's the width of the strikes x 100 x number of spreads.\n\n* Every non-spread short put or call also has a margin reserve. These are roughly 20-40% of the total liability of the short. I suspect most of your BP went into these.\n\n------------------------\n\nBefore you blindly follow some trader, you need to set some risk management firewalls around your account. A good one for new traders is that no single trade should be more than 5% of your total buying power. That means if that trade is a dead loss, you can't lose more than 5% of your account. No single trade can blow up your entire account that way.\n\nFurthermore, put an upper limit on your total cash at risk. It would be advisable to get no deeper than 50% of your *cash* value, not BP.

If tomorrow you can sell that contract for $7900 and close your position, then you'll have made $50.  You're buying a thing and if you can sell that thing for more than you paid for it, then you've made money.  The contract price + strike price is your breakeven, which only matters if you hold the contract to expiration.  Most contracts are not held to expiration, so breakeven rarely makes a difference, but it's a useful number to keep an eye on so that you understand the base value of what your position is worth.  \n\nIt's also sometimes useful for us to use the expiration value when we're teaching concepts because it takes the more complicated topic of the greeks out of the equation.  You need to be aware that an option has an intrinsic value and an extrinsic value.  The greeks describe the extrinsic value of your position, which changes frequently based on many factors.  For your in the money contract, the intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the current price of the underlying.  In this case, APPL is currently 106.91, so 106.91-28.75 = 78.16.  The other .34 priced into your contract is the extrinsic value, and represents the market's anxiety/fear/uncertainty.  At expiration, there is no more uncertainty, so extrinsic value gets closer to 0 as expiration approaches.  But if tomorrow the market prices that anxiety level above .34 and the share price hasn't moved affecting your intrinsic value, then your contract will be worth more and you can sell it for a profit.\n\nThat market anxiety is priced the highest at the money.  Since your contract is very deep in the money, there is very little market expectation that the share price will drop to 28.75 by expiration, so the extrinsic value is very small.  As you look at strike prices closer to the money, the proportion of extrinsic value will start to increase.  At the money and out of the money contracts are entirely comprised of extrinsic value with no intrinsic at all.  Since you have very little extrinsic in your contract, your option position basically moves close to 1:1 with movement in the stock price.  If Apple's price goes up by $10 tomorrow then your option will go up by almost $10 as well.  You can then sell the option for a profit.\n\nSo now you've seen the two things that can increase the value of your option; anxiety in the market increases your extrinsic value, or the underlying moves favorably and increases your intrinsic value.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I see, so if i go after 100 shares of this:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL201002C00110000?p=AAPL201002C00110000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL201002C00110000?p=AAPL201002C00110000)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt'll be 286$ as a cost for those 100 shares an if apple goes past the strike price of $110 prior to OCT 2nd, I'll sell the contracts and make 110\\*100-286= $10,714 correct?\n\nObviously any increase in a company's share price depends on the market conditions/news etc...

On the day of expiration, it may only take a couple of cents of movement to go from max profit to max loss.\n\nYou can also see that extrinsic value falls off pretty symmetrically from the peak.  Since the slope of the line is similar on both sides, then delta is roughly similar, except delta goes from .5 to 1 on the ITM side, and from .5 to 0 on the OTM side.

{"title": "TSLA leaks (supposedly)", "selftext": "At the upcoming Tesla Battery Day conference on September 22, Tesla will officially announce two million-kilometer batteries. If Tesla’s million-kilometer battery is really realized, electric vehicles will achieve a qualitative leap in mileage and battery life, and battery recycling will also become a thing of the past.\n\nSingle crystal cathode battery\n\nTesla single crystal cathode battery, this battery is also a lithium ion battery. It uses a new generation of single crystal NMC532 cathodes and a new brand-new electrolyte, which can enable electric vehicles to travel continuously for 1.6 million kilometers. The battery technology we are using can only maintain about 1,000 charge and discharge cycles, and this battery allows 90% of the battery's capacity to maintain a normal level after 4,000 charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, the single-cathode battery can still maintain 90% capacity after achieving 1.6 million kilometers of travel. This also means that if the battery is installed in a car, even if the whole car is scrapped, the battery can still be used.\n\nSilicon nanowire\n\nanode battery. The weight of the battery cell of this battery will be reduced by half, and the space occupied will be half of the current lithium ion battery. This means that with the same battery volume and quality, the energy density of the battery pack will be greatly improved. At present, the energy density of Tesla batteries is about 250Wh/kg. If this silicon nanowire anode technology is used, the energy density of Tesla batteries will reach about 400Wh/kg. At the same time, this battery has a high cycle life, and mass-produced cells are not far away. If this silicon nanowire anode battery is mass-produced and installed in a car, it may become a changer of current battery technology rules.\n\nTesla and the battery\n\nAs early as 2016, Tesla began funding the Tesla Canada Laboratory, which was composed of a team of scientists led by Jeff Dahn. Dann is a heavyweight in lithium-ion battery research. In more than 40 years, Dann has made many major breakthroughs in battery research. At the same time, in May 2019, Tesla spent US$218 million to acquire Maxwell, which specializes in the development of batteries and capacitors; in October 2019, Tesla acquired Hibar, the world’s number one supercapacitor manufacturer in Canada; in February 2020, SilLion acquired SilLion Inc., a lithium-ion battery company. Today, Tesla has held a number of battery core patents by hiring battery technicians and buying companies.\n\nSummary\n\nTesla already has a number of new battery technologies. If the technology is mature enough, Tesla may no longer rely on Panasonic and Ningde’s battery supply in the future.

Napkin math says yes, but I may be missing quite a bit here.  edit: so from I gather this move is a far-reduced risk with an assured (though smaller) gain.  It beats selling covered calls in every way but would not outperform an OTM call that goes ITM.  Basically a good play for someone whose stack is big and mature enough that they want to make money but don't want/need as much risk.

If you’re in a tax-free growth account, sell the LEAPS and buy shares or whatever, you’re done!\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting.... Let’s say you’re a buy and hold investor in a TAXABLE account. In other words, you’re me. You don’t want to simply take profits and pay $100k in taxes. You want to exercise and hold on!\n\nYou went all in on these LEAPS, taking advantage of the leverage. You don’t have the $204k needed to exercise the 420s, or the $84k needed for the 230s. Again, you’re me!\n\nI’m skipping the math, but there’s a point where the proceeds from selling contracts matches the amount needed to exercise the remaining contracts. To exercise and hold the 420s you’d need to sell 1.36 contracts to generate $146k. To get $71k for the 230s is just 0.56 contracts. But actually with taxes this is more like 1.7 and 0.7.\n\nWhat that means is that the 420s will leave you with 317 shares in the end. Doing the same with 230s will leave you with 300 shares.\n\nNot a huge difference, but there’s also a strong psychological element to consider. At $230 strike, you’re in the money out of the gate. And with a lower break-even, there’s a lot less stress along the way. Also, not everyone may believe in Tesla going to $1500 by Jan 2023.\n\nAt a 2500 stock price the numbers work out to 385 shares vs 327. So as the stock price rises far above the different strikes, it would be to your advantage to have bought more contracts at a higher strike with a lower premium. No surprise there. I’m not going to do the math, but there’s a point where you’d come out ahead with the 230s vs the 420s.\n\nAnyway, I spent way more time on this than I expected.

Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to pay the risk & expense to build a physical chip while exposing themselves to a rival taking over their chip design supplier...\n\nThis is why everyone is using ARM: the licensing is fundamentally permissive, it's not a proprietary trap like say Intel's embedded solutions.\n\nBut from Tesla's perspective it's even better, because much of Tesla's AI chip (by surface area & power consumption) is their own design, there's no ARM (or Nvidia) IP in it.\n\nGaining independence from external suppliers & unlocking chip performance for their usecase was the ***whole point*** of Tesla designing their own AI chip: they used generic ARM IP as a glue to the rest of the system, but the real value is in Tesla's crazy capable neural network inference processing ASIC design, which is theirs and only theirs - designed by star chip designers Jim Keller (AMD x86-64 & Zen fame) and Pete Bannon (Apple A5-A9 fame).\n\nIf Nvidia tries to strong-ARM Tesla (har har), then Tesla can walk and do their own iterations for the glue.\n\nI.e. no big effect on Tesla here: if Nvidia burns up the openness of the ARM platform (I don't think they'll do that), it will be their loss.\n\nThe implications to all non-Tesla competitors (VW, Rivian, NIO, Lucid) is far more grave though: basically Nvidia and Intel will be the only games in town for automotive inference computing power, and neither are known for allowing too much of the profit margin to remain at customers. 🤠", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not super familiar with how the ARM licensing works, I think what you said about permanent license sounds right. I think specific terms aren't public so we can't really know exactly what the deal is. \n\nI don't think Nvidia really has the power to really rip things up. They wouldn't want to ruin the entire mobile space now that they own ARM either. \n\nIn HW2.5 they really had a mess of random chips, some Nvidia SoCs, Nvidia GPU, Infineon CPU. Yeah, the whole point was stacking everything on one thing and also letting them beef up the tensor acceleration for neural network math.\n\nIf you look at the FSD block diagram, [https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/File:tesla\\_fsd\\_block\\_diagram.svg](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/File:tesla_fsd_block_diagram.svg)\n\nIt's everything baked together, the total 12 CPU cores are all ARM licensed and ARM IP. Would really just be talking about Tesla being able to swap out the NPU cores for superior Nvidia IP (still in their own chip). Everything else would stay the same.\n\nNvidia has a lot of proprietary technology in their hardware that is widely support in the AI field, [https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/)\n\nNot only CUDA, but now also like TF-32, hardware sparsity support that Tesla is probably currently using when training on Nvidia A100s in the cloud through AWS and PyTorch. Licensing Nvidia tensor cores (if made available), would allow Tesla to add however many of them they want to their future HW4, HW5 SoCs and streamline their development process a ton. \n\nReally, if Nvidia would do this I think it would be a good deal for Tesla. They pay for the chip development and manufacturing cost, pay a minior licensing fee to Nvidia for the architecture development cost. \n\nNvidia does spend like $3.3 billion in R&D every year vs Tesla's $1.3 billion, I don't really know why you would want to fuck with Nvidia here. \n\nAs for exactly what kind of leverage Nvidia would have. If you say Tesla has a permanent license from ARM, I think that's to use the ARMv8.0-A instruction set architecture (ISA) and like Cortex-A72 microarchitecture. \n\nIt's v8.0 and A72 version Tesla has the license to use. In smartphone Qualcomm makes  Kryo 585 high performance CPU cores based on Cortex-A77, and efficient cores based on Cortex-A55. \n\nARM developed ARMv8.6-A in 2019 and added like General Matrix Multiply (GEMM), they also have a ARM Cortex-A78 microarchitecture with more powerful CPU cores going into 2021 smartphones.

Get return the same as (or very close to) 100 shares for a much lesser cost. However, with TSLA, options are also pretty high priced, so I would have to see if the risk/reward is worth it for me to hold LEAPS instead of 100 shares.\n\nFor example, a TSLA Jan 2023 450 call is going for about $210 as of Friday’s close. That’s $21k, which is almost half the cost of 100 shares. So in this case I may think if it’s worth it for me to get these LEAPS, or buy 100 shares, or even buy  50 shares for about the same cost and get half the return but have the peace of mind knowing my options aren’t going to die due to some short term fluctuation/bad news in the stock or the overall market. In some other stocks, you may be able to get LEAPS for considerably less than the price of 100 shares, and in those cases the leverage could be much more appealing.\n\nAlso, I used $450 strike in my example above, which is right at the money and would be a safer bet than a strike way out of the money. If TSLA continues to move beyond 450 over the next year, my call is now becoming deeper in the money, and returns are increasing accordingly, intrinsic value is increasing and extrinsic is going down, all of these are ideal factors for a long call holder. But this of course costs more. If I was to look at way otm options, and let’s say I got the furthest available strike for the furthest available expiration, that becomes a much higher risk / higher reward play. Because now if the stock happens to rocket much further over the next year, I will get exponential returns on lesser capital. But if it stays sideways or goes down, I will lose that entire capital.\n\nAt the end of the day, it should always be remembered that options, even LEAPS, are frail, decaying assets, and the safest game in any stock is to accumulate shares longer term. One bad downturn in the stock or overall market, and even deeper itm LEAPS can get wiped out. Let’s say some bad news/economic issues keep the markets down/sideways for next several months or a year or two, which is entirely possible at any given point in time, well there go all those LEAPS.\n\nIt’s also important to have a profit target and hit the sell button. When things are going up and your LEAPS continue to go deeper and deeper itm, you will see exponential returns, and you will be tempted to continue letting it run. But then, as I explained above, a few bad days in the market and boom, there go all those profits, and now you’re thinking “only if I would’ve sold when I was $50k up.” Sure, things can keep running in your direction also, but it’s not guaranteed, and profits can be lost very easily in those situations. It happened with many people who held TSLA options through the split and then the stock dipped. So my point is, just because one is holding LEAPS, that doesn’t mean they’re required to be held until expiration.

More importantly, the pilot line allows the cost to be  slightly higher initially and not turn a loss because of the high ASP of  let's say the Model S plaid. Also 12.8 GWh/year divided by 120 kWh/pack  leaves us 106k units per year, which when compensated for a slightly  slower rate in the beginning, should perfectly cover the unit sales of  S/X that have a max production rate of 90k/year.

{"title": "How to get big tendies off TSLA Battery Day - Lithium Americas Corp", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nBefore the DD starts please take a look at my credentials, you will find nothing...\n\nNow, to preface – this play has a huge catalyst by end of this week or but is also viable for the long haul. I bet it’s going to be cumming like my wife's boyfriend by Sept 22.\n\nThere are 2 companies in play here: TSLA and TSLA’s soon to be meth dealer: LAC.\n\nWanna make up for those TSLA calls you got crushed on earlier this month?\n\n**WTF is LAC?**\n\nIf you’re not dumb, you’ll already know that LAC is a lithium miner, and IMO the one in the best position for success in the near future.\n\n1. LAC has two mines in the exploration phase, one in Argentina (49% owned, 51% owned by Chinese Li miner Ganfang - this is important for later) and one in Nevada (100% owned)\n2. LAC mines brine Li Carbonate (Li C) which should outperform the other major Li miners as they are mining Li Hydroxide (Li H) out of hard rock. The major hard rock suppliers are shutting down mines and have faced regulatory hurdles, setting up undersupply in 2-5 years in the Li market that Li C brine miners can take advantage of as demand creeps up mirroring EV demand.\n   1. Li H has a marginal cost of production around $6500/t, with Li hovering around $7000/t it is no longer profitable to extract from hard rock.\n   2. Li C mined out of LAC’s Argentine costs $3,576/t and in Nevada, $2,570/t.\n3. It is possible to convert Li C to Li H (which is preferred for long range batteries) at a cost ranging between $500/t - $2500/t depending on the composition of the brine.\n4. In LAC Bureau of Land Management Application in Nevada the firm lists an in-house Li C to Li H processing facility (huge competitive advantage)... it also lists a BATTERY FACTORY (<- This is where stuff starts to get interesting).\n\n**LAC and TSLA: A Match Made in Heaven**\n\n1. Li is an important component in the battery supply chain, if TSLA cannot source Li it cannot build cars. Last year TSLA used approx. 23000 tonnes of Li, costing TSLA approx 300mil.\n2. The current agreement TSLA has for a Li supplier expires 21 Sept. 2020 - this agreement is with Ganfang (told you this was important).\n3. TSLA is holding a “Battery Day” event on 22 Sept. 2020.\n4. TSLA recently acquired Maxwell, a Li-ion battery tech company, confirming Elon’s need for Li.\n5. TSLA is looking for US suppliers of Li. One of the few acquisition attempts TSLA has made was to acquire a domestic Li producer Simbol Materials (acquisition failed).\n6. The Pentagon has expressed that rare earth mining is vital to national security and should be domestically sourced as much as possible (Li being specifically named as important to national security). China controls the Li market right now, even the spot contract is priced in Yuan. This also makes the regulatory approvals for LAC easier as this is obviously a priority for this administration.\n7. LAC’s Nevada mine (which will have a battery processing facility) is only around 3 hours away from the Gigafactory and holds the largest Li reserves in the US (no other mine in Nevada is even able to meet TSLA’s Li needs, where LAC can produce 3x over a 40 year mine life (expected production date in early 2023)).\n8. The CTO of LAC, Rene LeBlanc, formerly worked at TSLA as a “Staff Process Development Engineer” where his responsibilities included:\n   1. Supporting internal and external teams to identify, track and resolve technical, commercial, and organizational needs\n   2. Engage with upstream suppliers to stabilize or improve performance\n   3. Analyze market supply and demand to look for opportunities and new promising entrants\n9. The CEO of LAC has said that he cannot comment on talks with TSLA, while swallowing a smile, and saying “Tesla knows we are here”.\n10. TSLA has been raising money (at market stock offer), perhaps to prep for some acquisitions...?\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n… Put the dots together - LAC is a perfect vertical integration opportunity for TSLA in the short term and is overall is very well positioned to take advantage of increased Li demand for EVs in the mid-long term. Further, LAC is trading at around only 4.7x book value and 13 P/E… find that in another EV play.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nTSLA is likely to buy / take a stake in the mine / enter a partnership with LAC as their domestic supplier for Li, to be announced Sept 22.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR1zNDES1tR0aIUo\\_lEIVEtbATVvUnBL9jWoGa9nXfRm7BMV6WM1cui1rOQ#:\\~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said](https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR0klaeuk3_nDBcPMZJuk25JFgRXRleKqZokJ9GQg1aNoAxjOCaIldOw-SU#:~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said)\n\n[https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/)\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump\\~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM)\n\n[https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A](https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A)\n\n**Positions**\n\nJacked up to the tits in $13 strike Oct 16 calls (EDIT: on TSX, american options are priced different)\n\n**Post-Battery Day Edit**\n\nLooks like I was close, but no cigar.

These broke-dick TSX exploration mining companies are a dime a dozen and always out there trying to pump their huge reserves of the \"next big thing\" metals.    \nTLDR: decent DD, just buy OTM calls for ALB or LIT instead.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Most existing producers are reducing production / mines in development as they are in Australia or China and are mining hard rock. Most existing producers also have the vast majority of their off-take already claimed (there are only 3 major Li miners, the market is very concentrated). LAC is very different from a lot of the other exploration stage miners as they have a good cash position, the largest proven reserves (in fact the only reserves in NA that can sustain TSLA's current Li demand plus plenty more), mining partner agreements inked, and an in-house Li C to Li H conversion facility (huge differentiation as that is a major value add process that TSLA needs for battery quality Li). LAC's other project is 100% funded. All they need is a strategic partner / cash to bring the largest proven Li reserves in North America (which happen to be <3 hours away from TSLA) online. TSLA has plenty of incentive (supply chain integrity / efficiency / integration and geopolitical risks with china) to acquire a domestic Li miner. **Further, TSLA has attempted before to acquire an exploration phase domestic Li miner, in fact it was their 2nd acquisition attempt.** Li is a critical supply chain component, particularly if they are looking to in-house batteries which we all know they are.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "ALB has existing huge (low cost) production of lithium brines, the hard rock producers are mostly Aussie/Chinese.   You claim that LAC is best in breed of the exploration stage miners: I trust your analysis there and won’t argue.  I still think an exploration stage miner acquisition would be very risky.  The LAC website highlights a $2.6B net present value of their reserve base assuming $12,000 lithium.  At current lithium prices that NPV is likely close to 0 or negative.  Tesla did try to buy a NA miner, but thats was for a few hundred million dollars, not over a billion.

This play works both with or without TSLA partnership, although I do think it is likely.\n\nI think you might be neglecting the difference between Li H and Li C and the value add of LAC's conversion facility when making that NPV assumption.
