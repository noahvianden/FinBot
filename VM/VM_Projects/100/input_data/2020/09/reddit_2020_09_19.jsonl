Look around at actual kids in that age group in real life and a lot of them aren't even allowed to take selfies and are highly educated on internet privacy, much less putting themselves out there in a purposely sexualized video in a movie.

The dancing scenes are not meant to be something you are comfortable with they are supposed to upset you because this girl is changing their oroginally innocent dance routine into something obscene because of what she watched and doesn't understand on YouTube etc. This movie is really about unchecked access to the internet being a problem but people have glommed on to the brief visuals rather than the actual content of the story.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, the brief visuals are pretty disturbing and as a parent, my problem is that they are real girls and being told to do it when girls should be told not to share private information or personal images publicly, and also that it will appeal to a minority group of people for the wrong reasons.\n\nBUT, I have been passionately having this conversation recently and I have to say that the fact that people are having the argument and controversy makes people think, so I can understand some parts of that point.

To that point I would also say that some kids can even determine if a youtube video is something they don't like or shouldn't watch on their own if their world views have been strengthened and encouraged, the aim should be toward self-sufficiency where it's reasonable, imo.

There are a lot of videos with instructions how to do it.\n\nThat is a fact.\n\nIt is not only protective of our girls to be aware of it, but also of our boys who should be careful what youtube videos they see too, because it is not a healthy thing to teach them to be so focused on convincing people of things.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Is it though, because the movie is not about the dancing, in fact there are only 3 scenes in the whole movie with the dancing in question.

It's about repression in general and how woman are viewed by society as objects and how the internet changes perception of things. Most importantly it's a coming of age story about a girl who thinks she doesn't want to be part of what she grew up in but then adjusts her perception once she realizes what she has become. I actually watched the movie did you?

And people  ARE calling it cp which i find to be inaccurate so I used the dance moms comparison. \n\nI agree the film could've done it a different way. That show on Hulu, Pen15 is all about 12yr olds, puberty, and sexual discovery whatever...but the lead roles are played by 30 something yr olds. But yeah, they could've done it different. Even changing the camera angle would've been better. \n\nFree speech... I'm not critical of people complaining about the movie. I'm critical of people complaining without being educated what they're complaining about. If they watch the movie and complain then I have zero issue. 100% will back them cancelling. If they're like hey, y'know, I just don't want this movie to be accessible to my kids or pedos. Then sure. I pointed out the 10 min thing, but if someone was like \" yeah that 10 min ruins the movie, it's offensive, and I'm cancelling over the 10 min\". Then sure. But saying im cancelling cuz this is child porn and I'm mad they would allow child porn and this is equal to real child porn that ruins lives and I don't like it cuz I read a description but haven't watched it and I'll never watch it cuz I don't want to be on an FBI list for cp...that's my issue. The people who call someone who watched the movie and had a different exp a pedophile is my issue. Just cuz they watched it and had a different opinion. \n\nThat's why I was agreeing with things you were saying but not agreeing with someone else.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I was bothered by some of the things you said at first but also was kind of surprised you were taking the time to explain and I do feel like I see your point of view better and it gives me some things to think about.

It was obvious from day one when all the user reviews and claims of pedophilia started before even the trailer was out (based entirely on one poster) - at a time when only people that were at Sundance saw it. So I read reviews from people that saw it and realized, it was likely pretty much the exact opposite of what people were claiming on twitter.\n\nSo, I watched the movie. I know, big shock. Tough admission. But it really was exactly like the reviews said. People that see pornography are projecting. There are some uncomfortable scenes but that is intentional. The movie is about a young girl who feels suffocated and lonely by her incredibly strict religious upbringing and so she acts out and reaches out to exactly the wrong role models. Her dad took a second wife and is forcing the old wife and kid to live with the new one. She hates her life, hates her dad, and secretly watches these girls at school having \"fun\" and wants to be like them. They make it very clear that this sexualization of young girls online among even their own personal friends group is not the right way. She starts mimicking the girls she sees on instagram and joins the popular kids, watching hip hop videos and wearing adult clothing. There is a scene where she tries to flirt an talk dirty with an older guy online but he finds out shes 11 when the camera accidentally turns on and he instantly leaves. It's shown to be a bad thing.\n\nThere is this ever escalating attempts to do more extreme things to fit in until finally she takes a nude to prove shes not a little girl (of course nothing is shown). And in the end it backfires. All her friends abandon her for being a \"slut\" and they kick her out of their dance troupe, her mom finds out, she breaks down sobbing and acts out even more. The mom and grandma abuse her in this terrible ritual like scene hitting her and dousing her with cold water. It was way worse than any dance scene and made me tear up. In the end, they end up needing her to fill in for the dance competition and we finally get the scene everyone is losing their shit over from the poster. It should have never been the poster. The poster in France shows the kids being kids and throwing clothes around after stealing her mom's money to buy them for her friends.\n\nAnyways, in the final scene, they start to do their dance and the camera keeps panning to the audience who is super uncomfortable and complaining to the judge and once again, this is shown to not be normal or acceptable and you know what happens? The 11 year old girl realizes this herself and a minute or two into the scene, she breaks down and starts crying. Then she runs off and the scene stops half way through the routine. She gets home in time for her father's wedding and when they try to force her to go to the wedding, she finally stands up as her own person and says no. She makes up with her mom who defends her right to do as she wants. The final scene is her going outside wearing modern clothing (non-religous) but non-revealing modern clothing fit for a girl of her age. The skimpy dance outfit is shown on the floor discarded. The message is pretty clear. She has grown and realized she can be her own person without going either route of religious extremism or hyper sexualization and both are discarded.\n\nI honestly, I thought it was touching. Both the scene where she was abused physically and when she made up with her mom and became her own person were very emotional. The single scene people act outraged over because they saw a photo and assumed it was the whole movie was only one to minutes long and ended abruptly with her realizing this entire thing was wrong and quitting.

They let 16 year olds pose nude, younger if it's for artistic purposes.\n\nSo in watching the movie, you're only disturbed if you see anything \"wrong\" with what they're doing. I wasn't aroused in the least. They're freaking kids for crying out loud.\n\nBut \"sexualization\" is subjective and to me, there's nothing sexual about a bunch of kids dancing. The \"sex\" exists entirely within the mind of the beholder and I'd like think that in the mind of a normal adult, sexual thoughts don't even enter the picture when watching a bunch of kids dancing.

The movie itself sexualises the children, not the viewer, and the ones that don't want to see children displayed like that when they can't even consent to taking ibuprofen at school without a parent's permission are worried about those childrens' mental health and safety. Adult women can consent to their bodies being shown like that on film, not children. I think people are confusing conservative views that aay ahowing even shoulders are bad or that women have to cover up with people who want to protect kids from growing up with film already avilable and being sold of them dancing in a way that is described as sexual when it comes to as adults, let alone kids. \n\nThe director did nor need to show that to make her point, and it is exploitative on her part because, under normal circumstances, a child would be unable to consent to something like that and having videos like many of the dance scenes of a minor in your possession would get you arrested.\n\nI don't understand the claim that the people who recognise the way these children are dancing (Thrusting/twerking while the camera ZOOMS in on their butts, splaying the legs open as the camer ZOOMS IN on these girls' crotches, and one even flashing her chest) would normally be considered wrong to film and aren't any less wrong because the movie, at the very end, half-assedly implies it's wrong. She could have just seen videos of adults doing it or they could have just implied she's dancing in a way that would be inappropriate for ADULTS to do in certain occasions.

She begs him to let her keep it but he refuses, so in desperation she awkwardly copies the \"sexy\" moves she's seen on internet videos with her friends in the hope that he'll give it back.

On top of their regular clothes they're wearing adult bras and underwear that are clearly much too big for them and flinging more of the same into the air in jubilation.

The contrast is striking.\n\n---\n\nThere's a consistent theme underlying all three of these scenes (which is essentially the central theme of the movie): these girls are being exposed to things to 11-year-olds should not be exposed to and, as a result, doing things no 11-year-old should be doing, not because they understand them - they don't; they're barely into puberty - but because they're trying to be like the older girls/women, because that's what they think their \"normal\" is.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate you taking the time to type all this out and offer an alternate perspective to the complaints I read online. \n\nI still find the film disturbing, but it sounds like that was the directors point....

So her value to the group becomes her ability to increase the \"sexiness\" of their dance routine so that they win the competition. It's a well-executed portrayal of how ignorance, immaturity, technology and the need for social contact can all intersect in damaging ways.\n\nPurely as a piece of film-making, the movie is really well made and well executed.

I did watch the clip that was posted in this thread of the children performing. It made me extremely uncomfortable. However, I do not think that it showed anything worse than you’d see at one of these pageants or “dance competitions”, which is the point. You say “literally close ups” and “exposing themselves”, and while I do believe that these children are way too much on display, I do not think that there were any shots that exclusively showed children’s private areas, and they were covered (barely, but they were covered). This is what I mean by post truth, even your response twists what was actually shown in the clip.

The movie is semi autobiographical, and it’s meant to highlight how much young girls have their perceptions of the world warped by social media and sexualisation. After reading her op ed in WaPo it changed my opinion of the movie. It’s supposed to make you uncomfortable. It’s supposed to make people who would otherwise ignore the horror of how young girls perceive womanhood take notice and start discussing it. I recommend you read her piece here:\n\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I don't disagree with you, my point is that the way they went about making this is disgusting.

This is disgusting.” I agree that it should have been marketed different in Netflix, and maybe the film could have been more explicit in its narrative and let’s explicit in its showcasing, but this is exactly my point about understanding context and nuance before just shouting about outrage. Most people didn’t even look past the title card on Netflix (understandably, that one is on Netflix).

You shouldn't watch the scenes thinking they're sexual, but rather recognize that the girls are imitating a highly sexualized culture they've found on the internet.\" From Newsweek \n\nI have no doubt that was the intention, I deal with the same issue with my nieces that I am guardian for.  I would not have allowed them to join in with 650 other girls to audition for these parts. And that is my issue, and the issue for most people, that they brought in 650 little girls to compete for these roles, feeding this gross media culture. \n\n\"*Cuties* director Maïmouna Doucouré has indeed spoken about some of the sexualization that she witnessed that inspired the film. In an interview with [Screen Daily,](https://www.screendaily.com/features/director-maimouna-doucoure-reveals-the-shocking-inspiration-behind-sundance-drama-cuties/5146481.article) the director explained that the inspiration came from seeing young girls perform in a sexually suggestive fashion. \"They danced in a very sexually suggestive manner. There also happened to be a number of African mothers in the audience. I was transfixed, watching with a mixture of shock and admiration. I asked myself if these young girls understood what they were doing,\" she said. \" From Newsweek\n\nSo she asks 650 little girls to compete for these parts, while turning around and then criticizing it. Did she ask herself if those girls understood what they were doing in the auditions?  In her film? \n\nI cancelled Netflix not because I thought Doucouré was trying to slip cp past everybody, but because she holds up her (valid) critique on the sexualization of women while standing on the backs of the 650 little girls that likely watched and learned how to dance like this in competition for a spot in her movie.

If you're canceling Netflix but not calling out Bing energy drinks for sponsoring Danielle Cohn, then you're just virtue signalling. Where was that energy for Nickelodeon anywhere in the literal 3 *decades* they worked with Dan Schneider? Where is the boycotts of Google (who owns youtube) & Facebook/Instagram?  \n\nI'm not comfortable with Cuties. I'm also not comfortable to the outrage against it. People want to say it's a film for pedophiles, missing the point that pedophiles already have no shortage of sexualized images to children. And unlike this film, a lot of those social media suppliers also provide direct access for grooming purposes. \n\nThe film objectively does not condone or seek to normalize pedophilia. It's intent was to do the exact opposite and talk about how a culture of casual objectification of women in media is damaging young girls and making them vulnerable to predatory behavior. Did they miss the mark in execution? For sure. But there is **actual** exploitation of children that is currently totally unaddressed or laughed off, so why is a fictional account condemning the sexualization of little girls where people draw the line? The movie was intended to horrify and disgust you - that's the point. Meanwhile there's endless monetized images of minors elsewhere meant to tittilate and normalize - so maybe address your energy towards that first before going after some indie french director who went to great lengths to create a safe set.\n\nIt just seem s like people are going after a superficial depiction of exploitation instead of actual exploitation. You know how many current male celebrities working in Hollywood have been accused of knowingly fucking underage fans? You know how many people groom children for years and wait until the day after their 18th to fuck them so that everything is above board? You know how many actual rapes are on pornhub right now? But what we're concerned with is a girl doing something that there's literally thousands of girls sharing on social media as we speak. \n\nBlugh. I've never understood the conservative frustration with cancel culture and virtue signalling, but this outrage for a fictional depiction of something while steadfastly refusing to do anything about real life examples of the exact same behavior is enraging. You want to boycott a company for allowing the exploitation of minors and normalizing pedophilia? Boycott youtube. boycott disney. Boycott nickelodeon. Boycott the majority of major record labels. Boycott the current US president. Boycott all internet porn - including cam girls & only fans. Cause as someone who worked the industry, girls with pimps are everywhere and the age/ID verification and flagging is a fucking joke. \n\nI'm not saying people shouldn't be outraged.

JPow basically took the inflation  thought away on Wed when he said no inflation until at least 2023 (and thats IF everything goes well). God help us if deflation kicks in - in that scenario the market is likely highly overvalued. So now the market needs to price in all of the above making that generous 25% valuation above a stretch.

If you want to understand why, look up a guy called Lacy Hunt and listen to any interview he has given in the last year.\n\nCan this change?

This lowers yields on long dated treasuries in exchange for stronger reserves but those reserves are not available as cash for the banks to just use. They sit on their reserve accounts at the fed.\n\n1. What is this signaling? Yields lower means.....lower inflation not higher (see the Fisher equation). The commercial bond market would have disagreed if untrue - that hasn't happened.\n2. It takes liquidity out of the system. Banks could have sold those treasuries privately for cash but instead the fed took them out of the system and injected reserves that aren't  getting used because....\n3. Banks aren't lending. In fact they are tightening their lending standards (August loan survey shows this). Credit lending is where the actual money supply expands - it's not at the treasury-to-reserves phase above. That had almost no impact. Unfortunately people think the fed is \"printing\" when it's not really.\n\nTo get things \"inflating\" total money and  credit has to expand and velocity of money needs to go up. Consumers and businesses aren't taking on new debt (you can look up the h.8 data from the fed each Friday to see this - it's pretty bad). \n\nSo, now the government steps in and spends. But all they do is keep the lights on - there are no productive assets or investment in the future, just more debt that has to be paid back. This just  creates a tax on future growth. Government spending used to increase gdp but estimates from Lacy Hunt suggest it is now decreasing it. In Japan it's very pronounced - and they have had deflation/anemic inflation for 30 years despite all the same tricks the fed is trying.\n\nTL;DR QE spurring inflation is just a ridiculous logical fallacy.

{"title": "Not sure if it's luck or I am gokd at this", "selftext": "Dear autists, \n\nI am a university student currently in the last year of my under grad. Last year, I took a year off to work as a software engineer for an internship position. My work term was coming to an end and I had all this money leftover that I did not know what to do with. I live with my parents as my university is only a 10 mins drive away from my house and is cheaper and less time consuming for me personally.\n\nWith all this money just sitting around with virtually no expenses, I decided to start looking into the stock market when the pandemic started back in march. In may, I finally started trading with $3000 on penny stocks and lost over half my account.\n\nDoing more research (spending over 2+ hours everyday) on how to day trade, I started making a little bit of money. I then put in $5000 more earlier August into my account. In this time, I also discovered this sexy subreddit with risk takers like yourself.\n\nAfter this, I started making around $100-$300 everyday. Since then, I haven't lost money and infact, I made all the money I had lost, back. I had heard about options but didn't know what they were. Last week, I spent a lot of my time learning it along with doing school work.\n\nThis monday, I bought 1 option for tesla and sold it the next day for a profit of $3500. The rest of the days this week, I day traded tesla making at least $1000 everyday putting every dime penny I had in my account in each transaction.\n\nAt this point, I feel like when I am trading, I am really just looking at the  support, resistance, and the momentum as well as the direction of the stock. I am not sure whether I am good at this and know what I am doing, or is it just pure luck that I have gotten this far ahead.\n\nMy account grew from $8000 to $14000 so far. A lot of that was from this week alone.\n\nPlease let me know if this is exactly how I am supposed to be trading. If it is pure luck I have gotten this far, anything I can do to develop a safe proof trading strategy?\n\nThanks", "id": "ivmkkh", "created_utc": 1600493245.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Yes, this is how you should be trading.

Plus, as a reality check: if it was just looking at support, resistance, and momentum or whatever (i.e. if it was as easy as just looking at the shapes of the curves) quants, algos, and serious pros would beat you to literally everything.\n\nThe market prefers to be random, when it behaves in predictable ways it's because an equilibrium has been unsettled. The market will always try to restore equilibrium and maximize entropy. Everything does this, but the market does it faster because you have career traders and quants obliterating taking advantage of every edge they can.\n\nThink of it like this: If there was a predictable pattern to the market, we would all know that (or at least the smart guys on wallsteet would) and therefore trade accordingly. If this happened, that pattern would get completely ironed out and the market would return to total random noise again.\n\nThis is why big companies do weird shit like buy absurd amounts of market research data or try to run everything through fiber optics. They need to be the first to find an advantage before anyone else finds out. They want to listen to the static noise in the wire, before it gets to the speakers.\n\nAnyways, my point is that you probably have some small idea what you're looking at, but a week is so short it could just be luck.\n\nMy advice is that you should very quickly stop just relying on shapes and move to actually understanding what your trading.

Why? Even if you follow your position extremely closely and make good decisions based on what is happening to the company and it’s chart, you’re not controlling for the possibility of an exogenous event systematically lowering the stock market. There have been several days this year where the price of stocks, not an individual stock, almost universally fell several percent. If you were all in on calls on any one of these days, your account would have gotten killed. What you’re doing works at this moment, but it’s extremely fragile. Why not just put a percentage of your account into each position? Surviving is more important than making max profit...\n\nYou seem reasonably intelligent, so take these lucky gains you have and spend more time learning about how options strategies work so you can get leverage without risking your entire account. You have a quantitative background, use it to actually learn about what you’re doing before risking it all. Technical analysis (using chart indicators) can be helpful for timing entry and exit from a position, but they tend to lag big moves in a stock and relying on them will leave you holding the bag. \n\nLearn the Greeks and spend time using software to visualize different options strategies and how they are affected by time, volatility, and price movement. Check out some videos from TastyTrade to learn about different strategies (look at Mike and His Whiteboard). \n\nIf you use spreads AND have both long and short positions for different stocks, you’re more likely to make money AND survive in the long run.

RC Ventures says it believes that under the right circumstances it could produce the best results for GameStop shareholders if it were more involved.**](http://news.gamestop.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/sc-13da/0001013594-20-000699) \n\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\n* When I look at the sentiment surrounding GameStop, it doesn’t take very long to see [comments]( https://i.imgur.com/lndA70O.png) [like](https://i.imgur.com/Ec4z1fx.png) [these](https://i.imgur.com/6WoeXUS.png), yet here we [are](https://i.imgur.com/NpANVzR.png). What’s going on? Are people that stupid? Just jumping on the new console cycle? Idiots not pulling their gains and going to zero? When even r/wsb thinks the stock is a dud, it must be right? Nearly 120% short interest, yet the stock is up nearly 40% this week. \n* Its no secret GameStop has been hurting. The secular shift to digital has been pressuring them for some time with their highest margin category - used video software – under significant distress. Each year their gross margins contract with net income in the red these past few quarters. Everybody has written them off as the easiest short in the world, however I'm going to try to explain whats going on and tell you that buying GameStop may not be as bad as you think.\n\n**II. CONSOLES**\n\n* Just to start things off, you have to remember we’re in the beginnings of the new console cycle. But what does that even mean? Well the advent of new consoles means new trade-ins, new product, new customers, and a fresh spike in GameStop’s popularity. Sales have stagnated the years prior, and they are all but certain to go up and remain elevated for the next 1-2 years. Note that against all counts, the company was actually profitable during the 2019 holiday season, with new consoles you can bet that they will annihilate all expectations and proceed into 4-8 more positive quarters off the cyclic shift. This is pretty unanimous, and everyone accepts that they will start reporting positive going forward. In fact, new console cycles are where GME has historically [spiked](https://i.imgur.com/LOehh3E.png).\n\n**III. POST CONSOLE CYCLE**\n\n* At this point, the focus turns to what happens once the hype dies down. Digital will continue to erode upon physical, but the key factor here is that physical is not actually dying off. [Its not](https://i.imgur.com/kmVPF39.png) [going to](https://i.imgur.com/rfRRGC9.png) zero. **The biggest reason physical is sequentially a lower percentage of the market is because the total market size is increasing.** Digital is shooting off while physical is largely stagnant. Note that physical games admittedly have their strengths. Not only are they structurally cheaper because you can resell them, they also have clear definitions of ownership and the collectability factor where you *need* to have a physical copy you can hold. In fact, [two thirds](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/320224/Analyst_66_of_console_players_still_prefer_physical_games_over_digital.php) of console video game players prefer physical vs digital.\n* While physical is here to stay, albeit at a weaker level, that isn’t enough to turn the tides for GameStop. You see, GameStop knows digital is the trend and here to stay, they are not fighting it, **they are moving along the secular shift**. GameStop sells [digital games](https://i.imgur.com/RZJGjFE.png). GameStop is set to release a mobile app combining Game Informer and a online storefront by [month end](https://i.imgur.com/rdXejYc.png). They are doubling down on their online store with +500% ecommerce growth in [Q1]( http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results) and +800% growth in [Q2](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-second-quarter-results-and-strong-progress).

They intend on leveraging this network though a [company branded credit card](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-now-taking-pre-orders-sony-playstationr5-and-sony) with spending rewards to grab market share and retain customers. Furthermore, a digital revenue sharing model continues to [grow](https://i.imgur.com/V94FWJC.png) as publishers understand the value of GameStop as a customer acquisition service and that keeping the company afloat is better for sales and the general video game industry.

BALANCE SHEET**\n\n* But wait, their financials must be shit right? They have to be losing money. How much longer can they last? \n* Well it turns out their books are rock solid. They offered their creditors a new set of terms to push back debt for 2 years, 50% of them [took it](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer). They have eliminated all excess goodwill impairments. They are in a [$300M net cash position](https://i.imgur.com/HhfHaIT.png) with significantly reduced inventory (which explains the sharp reduction in Q1/2 sales) and massively cut SG&A by 28% in preparation for the console cycle. [FCF KING](https://i.imgur.com/LYyrrUm.png)\n* Many believe the days of their strong margins are long gone, but in fact its only beginning. You have to remember, digital is only outpacing NEW physical games. [Retro games](https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/02/01/retro-consoles-video-game-sales-nostalgia/) are a [huge untapped market](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/talking_point_how_much_is_your_video_game_collection_really_worth_to_you) where GameStop can replicate their past success, and it is a category digital can never penetrate. [Jesus wtf.](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/little-samson) GameStop is looking into [these already](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/pre-owned)\n\n**V. MAJOR BACKING**\n\n* In fact, their ecommerce prospects are so promising, Ryan Cohen bought a [10% stake](https://investorplace.com/2020/08/gamestop-news-sends-gme-stock-soaring/). This guy took on Amazon and [won](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2020/01/26/ryan-cohen-started-a-company-that-took-on-amazon-and-sold-it-for-3-billion-now-hes-thinking-about-whats-next/#7cdf60865579). [Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/Duyxu1i.png) and [Telsey](https://i.imgur.com/K169L1N.png), wall street firms, came out with strong buy ratings citing company prospects. [Michael Burry](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/michael-burry-top-portfolio-holdings-massive-bet-alphabet-google-scion-2020-8-1029517864#) still holds a 5% stake. This guy took on Wall Street and won. [Half their creditors](http://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-expiration-and-final-results-exchange-offer) ($200M worth) believe in GameStop’s prospects. Why would they defer their debt unless they believed the company will be in a paying position by 2023?\n\n**VI. THE SHORTS**\n\n* But here is the real kicker. GameStop’s short float. 120% has never been seen before. The short theory was that GameStop would not make it to the new console cycle and the shorters would collect their tendies. But GameStop made it. Current short fees are like 60% and from some figures we can draw on, we estimate that around 70% of the shorts got in [under $7](https://i.imgur.com/wRaMbLx.png), GameStop is currently nearing $10. **70% of the shorts are underwater.** Even if you don’t believe that any of their initiatives will work you have to admit that the company will be able to continue operating for another two years off the new console hype alone. When the stock hits roughly $15, we can expect to see several margin calls trigger a fucking massive short squeeze. For reference, [Blue Apron](https://i.imgur.com/6EqU417.png), [Volkswagen](https://i.imgur.com/S3DHn3j.gif).\n\n**VII. CONCLUSION**\n\n* Just the fact GME got to the new console cycle must be making the shorts cry. Add on that they’ve been making serious progress towards online and mobile presence, aligning themselves with industry trends, operating in a growing market, potential monopoly in the untapped retro market, solid financials, beginning their new upward cyclic cycle; you have the makings of a powerful ecommerce storefront just leaning into their growth period. Even post console hype, they should be able to leverage their branded credit card to retain a huge number of customers and bite off huge market share off other retailers. Lastly, remember that despite the trend towards digital, its in the gaming industry's best interest to keep GameStop going strong. The likelihood of additional revenue sharing agreements are fairly high.\n* For comparison GameStop has a P/S ratio 0.11. Chewy has a P/S ratio of 3.6. If GME begins to grow their revenue from this point its valuation will begin to normalize. Even a P/S of 0.2 would mean a stock price of ~$16, 0.4 would mean $32. The company is going to ride the console hype and likely trigger more than a few margin calls along the way. Everything management has been doing is to ride the new cycle into a fluid ecommerce business model, and everything I'm seeing suggests its going to work. \n\n[Tl;dr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)\n\n10c 9/25 to play XBOX prerelease\n\n10c 10/2 to play Mobile App/Stimulus \n\n10c 11/20 to play Console Release Date\n\n10c 4/16 to play Holiday Earnings/short squeeze\n\n***most text references are from GameStop's Q2 transcript which you can find [here.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/09/10/gamestop-gme-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n\n***[Digital vs Physical preorder statistic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/09/18/ps5-disc-and-digital-pre-orders-continue-to-sell-out-nightmarishly-fast/#27928d8c16a5) from u/nonagondwanaland\n\n***[Additional Digital vs Physical statistics](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/ps5-retailers-have-many-fewer-digital-edition-systems-for-pre-order/)", "id": "ivs6dw", "created_utc": 1600520634.0, "score": 877, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 358, "comments": [{"body": "Finally a post that dives more into their balance sheet.

(Chances are medium here.)   \nEven if they do it would be modest at best.   \n\n\n\\-We priced in everything for when vaccines does happen. Although I think that's just a dream that we all had.
