It not only adds 8 new studios to the company’s empire, bringing the total to 23, but, more importantly, ensures that ZeniMax’s titles will appear on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service the same day they hit the market. Titles from third-party developers often don’t make it to Game Pass until months after their initial release.\n\n“With over 15 million subscribers currently on its Game Pass MSFT is doubling down on its consumer endeavors with this acquisition, a smart and strategic move in our opinion heading into its highly anticipated new console release,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in an analyst note following the announcement.\n\nIt’s important to note that Microsoft lost to Sony in the current console generation. It sold fewer units of its Xbox One than Sony sold of its PlayStation 4, roughly 50 million to 110 million, despite the prior generation’s Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 nearly matching each other in sales.\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "ixnn9e", "created_utc": 1600782232.0, "score": 1069, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 228, "comments": [{"body": "I'm more impressed with Microsoft's approach to bring in new gamespass subscribers.

You need a standard value when comparing these things, I don’t see how that’s “changing the rules.” All of those passes being sold are from users or companies that didn’t use them and were looking to maintain some form of profit. They paid full price for them already, so that you could get a discount. What you’re looking at is a limited stock that can’t be maintained if the entire market used it.\n\nThat is why you can’t use a discount company as a measurement for the value of a product, and how they compare. Yes, you can get that price. You can get almost anything for any price. That’s not what it actually retails for though. And it’s subjective. You went from saying it was worth £30 to you could get it for less than £30, but there’s no way to corroborate that. Rn it sells for a couple dollars less.

But that's the beauty of Microsoft's strategy with Game Pass. Create a subscription service that has day-1 releases (versus waiting months), exclusives, EA Play sports, and when you get bored or a new release comes out, you can move on to a new title. Best of all, games can be played across PC, X-Box, eventually mobile, and if PS5 fans are lucky to get the title, they'll have to pay $60+ for a single title and give up 30% fees to Microsoft. You can see the consumer sentiment now on message boards and the positivity has led to both versions of the XBox system selling out quickly today--as well as some gamers canceling their PS5 pre-order and ordering an XBox Series X or S instead. Microsoft is closing the gap in gaming by offering consumers value and being the first to truly shepherd the streaming gaming market. So don't knock Netflix because their licenses for a few shows ran out.  Mind you, Netflix's market capitalization is worth more than Disney and Comcast and the video game industry is larger than the movie and music industries combined now. Microsoft's strategy mirrors Apple's Apple One and Netflix's streaming service w/ exclusive/original content.\n\nThe writing is on the wall... The marketplace for gamers is rapidly evolving and both Microsoft and Sony know this. However, they are both approaching it in different ways. Sony is continuing the strategy that brought them success with the PS4. Attract consumers with exclusive titles and timed releases. But even they realize people don't care so much for tangible ownership of games on discs, as they are now offering a digital-game only console (I suspect all consoles of the future will be either digital consoles or perhaps console-free, cloud gaming... Over 50% of game sales on Switch, Xbox, and Playstation are digitally downloaded now. During COVID, digital sales of titles have grown to 75% in some cases last quarter. And Google Stadia is starting to post very good sales (the subscription to access cloud-based gaming is the product).  Microsoft is also moving towards a subscription model and ubiquity thanks to the cloud and their positions in the video game console and PC markets. A key tactic of Microsoft will be to introduce many people to the Microsoft ecosystem by allowing cross-play on your console, on PCs, and eventually on your mobile device. Cloud gaming is the future and the acquisition of ZeniMax is symbolic of Microsoft's planting their flag in the sand.

Amazon has the most mature model with the greatest breadth of ways to implement for so many different levels. It's so easy to get set-up on AWS. Oh and Amazon makes it very easy to get stuff into their cloud. Like if you have actual hard disks that need to be stored Amazon will ship to you the stuff you need to put all that information onto to get it safely into their cloud. \n\nMicrosoft wins because so many companies also rely heavily on Microsoft to take care of so many other things. The Microsoft ecosystem is running strong. So many company's rely extremely heavily on things like AD, Exchange mail, IIS, etc. Oh and of course every computer that a company hands out is going to run Windows if they aren't a primary Apple product firm. \n\nGoogle literally hasn't innovated like Microsoft or Amazon in the cloud space. They just made a clone of what those guys did but with the Google name attached with the hope that their perceived market value will win them customers. Of course it will work, but it can only work for so long until the entire marketplace is saturated with only AWS and Azure experts. The signs show that Google is not dominating as expected and if you actually speak with Google recruiters (one reached out to me around early 2019 when they were most aggressively hiring to which I turned down and then reached back out later to learn this) they are hiring very heavily for senior SALES people because they are attempting to sell what they have. In the future they might just become like Oracle cloud, kind of there and working for their trusted partner's but maybe not a top dog. Google has tried this sort of tactic with other stuff when it comes to mimicking and selling and it hasn't worked out so hot for them in the past (thinking back to Google+). \n\nGoogle's best contribution to the infrastructure space was Kubernetes and that's pretty much opened up for the whole world to use so it's kind of lost for them. Their AI stuff only stands to get mimicked and grown by channels that are more popular, I don't think Google's infrastructure space is going to thrive but will likely remain as a niche player.\n\nGoogle Home is a solid product, but they sucked at branding it. Like you say \"Alexa\" and you say \"Siri\" and everyone knows this. They freaking made everyone say \"Google\" it's a poor job and it just doesn't have the power to be on top because of their lack of effort towards defining something that people can feel more relatable to. \n\nGoogle won when it came to making Chrome, the growth it's created on YouTube, G Suite is a decent set of applications - but frankly Outlook just looks better than any GMail interface I've seen. Google seems firm to sit in second or third place for a ton of it's entry points if it doesn't fall completely flat (see Chromebook, Pixel growth, Google+ again). Part of the problem stems from poor branding decisions, part stems from products that are not engineered properly or too thought out, and part stems from Google just wasn't going to be able to compete in that new space.\n\nGoogle has it's powerhouse which is data, it has the most powerful search engine in the world, but until some real innovation that has a direct impact in the enterprise or personal computing space makes massive waves - which hasn't happened since chrome - emerges, they are looking closer to a stagnant firm with solid growth from their core competencies and maybe a few winners, but it says a lot when their biggest winner in Chrome was lead by the guy that is their current CEO, they are well aware of what worked and now it's a question of where they can find internally the product that will meet the same level of demand.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Also, Google is taking over education with Google classroom.

Using both on a daily basis, I can tell you that iphones do alot of things worse then androids. Including:\n\n1. Crashing - my android never crashes. My iphone crashes constantly. In addition I've never needed a hardware reset, like on the iphone. I've had to use it on my iphone several times in the past year\n\n2. Expandable memory - you can insert a micro sd card into your phone to expand memory on androids. I gave my android 96GB for just 20$. You either pay 300$ more on an iphone, or you pay for icloud storage\n\n3.  App interfaces - like if I click on a YouTube link my android brings me to the youtube app. My iphone brings me to safari with youtube open, which is fucking terrible\n\n4. Chargers - micro USB or USB C are on every device. You can buy one charger for your speakers, laptop, alexa, google home, etc. Lightning USB cords are used for nothing else. And USB C is the future - the normal type can charge a phone 50% faster then lightning, and the advanced type charges 10 times faster. Once that becomes mainstream, androids will be able to charge in 6 minutes, vs 60 with a lightning cable\n\n5. No choice - I've changed my texting app, and keyboard repeatedly on my android. That's just not possible on iphones; you like iMessage, or you can suck a dick. With androids you can change everything - like I don't even use the app store that originally came with my phone\n\n6. Customization - iphones just got widgets. Androids have had those for at least 5 years. And with androids you've been able to download a theme that customizes many of your apps for years as well. Like my entire phone has a space theme, and there's thousands of others to choose from\n\n7. Texting interface - this is just straight up trash on iphones. It's fucking impossible to edit letters in a middle of a word. I usually just delete the entire word. Androids put the cursor where you point. The autocorrect is also way too aggressive. Writing a word it doesn't understand? Automatically autocorrect to something random on iphones, while androids just highlight it\n\n8. Split-screen - this has been a thing on androids always, not so on iphones\n\n9. Computer interface - I can plug my android into my computer and pull pictures/videos/files at high quality. On iphones you need to send it to the cloud, or over email, and roll the dice on the compression\n\n10 charging - androids can charge with the phone off, which allows them to charge faster and more efficiently. Iphones turn themselves on, so you need to power the operating system/whatever apps are running in the background. You're losing about half of your phones charging speed because the phone needs to be on while charging\n\n11. Low power modes - android has an extremely good low power mode. It makes the phone last for a week. I've frequently had my phone about to die when I'm out and need it to stay alive to find my friends, where androids power saving mode has saved me. 1% left on the battery will last for 3 hours on an android, and has frequently saved me from getting lost. I don't have much experience with this on an iphone, but I heavily doubt it compares\n\n\nKids prefer apple products over androids because they're \"cooler\". On an operational level they do everything worse besides:\n\n1. Imessage - this is pretty cool and far better than androids apps. Android has comparable, if not better, apps, but androids freedom of choice works against them; the apps only work if everyone agrees to use them. And too few people agree to use discord, or WhatsApp, or any of the others\n\n2. Efficiency: iphones have about twice the efficiency of androids. This is great for battery size and weight, iphone batteries are half the size of androids. But they operate slower - android maps apps frequently outnavigate apples precisely because the phone is using way more energy to update them more frequently.

{"title": "Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech", "selftext": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.\n\nMusk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: \n\n\n“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”\n\nThe company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.\n\nDuring the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.\n\nJoining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. \n\nBaglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.\n\nMusk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.” \n\nNear-term, Tesla says it aims to produce 10 gigawatt hours worth of its new battery cells at its pilot plant within a year. Musk noted that whatever cells it produces in Fremont would be supplemental to 100 gigawatt hours worth of cells it buys from suppliers. The company also said it had secured rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada to mine for its batteries.\n\nOn Monday, Musk warned that the advances announced at battery day won’t find their way into mass production until 2021, sending the company’s stock down about 6% ahead of the event on Tuesday.\n\nDue partly to Covid-19 health orders that limit the size of in-person gatherings, Tesla postponed its annual meeting from July this year to Sept. 22, 2020. The company previously held its shareholder meetings at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California but moved the event to Fremont, where its U.S. vehicle assembly plant is based. Shareholders parked and sat in their cars at the meeting, which Musk characterized as a “drive-in.” They honked in lieu of applause.\n\nAl Prescott, Tesla's VP of legal, at the company's socially distanced 2020 shareholders meeting, as attendees listen in their cars.\nAl Prescott, Tesla’s VP of legal, at the company’s socially distanced 2020 shareholders meeting, as attendees listen in their cars.\nThose who wanted to attend had to obtain a winning lottery-style ticket (or other special access) to the meeting. Otherwise, shareholders could log into a website to ask questions to be answered during the live-streamed event.\n\nSince its last shareholder meeting in June 2019, Tesla’s long-time CTO JB Straubel resigned from the company. He worked there from the start, even before Musk took the CEO reins in 2008.\n\nTesla also appointed a new board member, Hiromichi Mizuno, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Japan Government Pension Investment Fund, and a famous critic of shortsellers. Long-time Elon Musk collaborator and proponent, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, is leaving the Tesla board as well, though he still sits on the board of Musk’s aerospace venture, SpaceX.\n\nRemaining board members at Tesla authorized a five-for-one stock split, which the company implemented in August this year. The split followed four consecutive quarters of reported profitability for Tesla, and a season where Musk clashed with health authorities in California over Covid-19 restrictions that temporarily shut down their vehicle assembly plant in Fremont.\n\nThe stock split also followed a huge payout to Musk, part of his unprecedented compensation package. \n\nExpecting Tesla to talk about where its metals for batteries are sourced, and to promote battery tech suitable for Semi and Cybertruck vehicles, Cannacord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to investors before the meeting:\n\n“The big question will be on follow through. It’s one thing to announce all these breakthroughs, which might be great for momentum algorithms, but like most things TSLA, the devil will be in the details, which sadly will take some time to play out.”\n\nCannacord maintains a “Hold” rating and a price target of $442 on shares of Tesla currently.\n\nShares of the electric car maker are up more than 400% year-to-date.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/elon-musk-at-battery-day-tesla-deliveries-to-rise-30percent-to-40percent-in-2020.html", "id": "ixyrff", "created_utc": 1600817049.0, "score": 1940, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 461, "comments": [{"body": "-6.73% after hours :(", "score": 515, "replies": [{"body": "Meanwhile Nikola goes up...among a criminal investigation and a CEO resignation...", "score": 474, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 202, "replies": [{"body": "The mods over at r/NikolaCorporation have more power than their vehicles", "score": 40, "replies": []}, {"body": "Its sort of a \"game\" over at /r/wsb to see how little we can say to get banned. \n\nI got banned for saying: \" good time to buy Puts\"", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "I got banned after literally just saying \"lol\".", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "I have seen some strange subreddits and some sad power mods in my 10yrs on Reddit but they really are next level shit.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "I had a post removed from r/gardening because it had a human being in it .....holding a carrot", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "How dare you.", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Might seem like overkill but I appreciate subs that take steps to not become like /r/pics or /r/gaming, where placing an attractive person next to something ensures 100x-10000x the upvotes", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A mod from r/Robinhood, Carninalsomething, life time banned me because I called him out for harassing everyone on that page.

As a result, Tesla expects to be producing $25k electric cars within three years.. The stock itself is indicated lower by about 6% in after-hours trading (likely due to the lack of flashy product unveilings), but in our view, the event did a good job of summarizing the reasons why Tesla's advantage is insurmountable.

To quote the film Sully \"can we get serious\".\n\nYour comparison of a volcano to an asteroid is extremely telling and reveals your hand as someone who hasn't had a lot of experience with the timescale of Earth Systems. The most famous asteroid impact (assuming this is what you are talking about, but I can't be sure) was the end Cretaceous, Chicxulub, asteroid. You don't have to dig far to start seeing the debate around the impact of this asteroid. almost everyone agrees it hit at around 65 million years ago, but whether or not it was the sole driver of mass global extinctions is arguable. It definitely didn't drive any major long term climate trends, scorched Earth for years to decades, but the climate recovers in the rock record quickly from any effects of the Chicxulub asteroid. \nYou might have meant a different asteroid though. I see from previous comments that you are into the Randall Carson who is a prominent supporter of a an asteroid based driver for the Younger Dryas event. We will get to this in due time. \n\nSeems like you like quotes, so here are some on the PETM (Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum, 55 Million years ago):\n- Geological History of Britain and Ireland: \"The PETM is the single most dramatic, short-lived, climate perturbation of the entire Cenozoic (66 million years ago - present)\n- The Smithsonian entry on the PETM: \"The PETM is widely recognized by scientists as the best geological analogue for the human-induced global warming that is happening now.\"\n- Finally from the Wikipedia entry: \"Model simulations of peak carbon addition to the ocean atmosphere system during the PETM... are much slower than the currently observed rate of carbon emissions.\"\n\nThe main line of argument for the onset of the PETM is the initiation of volcanism in the North Atlantic that would go on to create Iceland, or as you delicately put it \"a volcano\"... This volcanism is a product of the Thulean or Icelandic plume. Here's some numbers for you:\n- The plume has raised the Earth's crust around Iceland by up to 2km above the plume centre, this uplift extends for 2000km away from the plume. Think about the numbers involved here, a 2000km radius of effect with a peak of 2km uplift, the numbers are crazy big.\n- Over a 50,000 year period it is estimated that 12,000 Gt of carbon was released from the system. Equivalent to 44,000Gt of Carbon dioxide. for reference we humans release ~10Gt/year (or 37Gt of CO2 equivalent). At our current rate of omissions we will have released the PETM's carbon in around 1000 years, so only 50 times as fast.\n- The volcanic effects of the Iceland plume caused volcanism in Ireland, the UK, Greenland and some very Eastern parts of the North American continent. But yeah sure... just one volcano. \n- The PETM is estimated to have raised the global climate by 5-8 degrees Celsius with the entire warming period lasting around 200,000 years. Please note that this is average global warning. Warming at high latitudes has been shown to have been much more severe (see my later points on the Younger Dryas)\n\nNow lets move onto the Younger Dryas. The Younger Dryas was a a short lived warming event taking place around 12,000 years ago. See the wiki for precise dates if you are interested. This is an event that is detectable in most of the world, but not necessarily simultaneously. There is also evidence for regional cooling occurring alongside the warming events of places like Greenland. You described a source (the fucking IPCC no less) as a flimsy wet noodle, so lets go into this:\n- The wealth of contradictory or varying lines of argument should immediately tell you that this particular event in Earth's history is not overtly understood.\n- The article you link (NOAA) states a temperature rise in Greenland of 10 degrees Celsius. I hope as someone who likes to do to their reading you followed up on that number and skimmed through the Alley 2000 paper to check out the claim. They summarise that temperature rose an estimated 5 - 10 degrees. Want to talk about flimsy wet noodles, how about quoting a source and only including the upper estimate of a temperature range prediction.\n- Do you want to enlighten us about the susceptibility of high latitude climate systems to be more responsive to climate changes? Or is that not something you've come across in your reading... Please don't conflate the notion of warming on Greenland being comparable to average global temperature rises. Computer models and ocean drilling suggest that the North Atlantic corridor is a very sensitive part of the Earth's climate to temperature perturbations, it tends to magnify whatever smaller changes are happening on a global scale. \n- Lastly, I believe you are implying that Mr. Carlson's argument for an asteroid impact causing the Younger Dryas event is the absolute truth on the matter. Whilst it is a possibility, I would like to highlight that Carlson's publishing are pretty much reserved for his website and social media platforms. His lack of peer reviewed, published papers detailing outright, indisputable evidence on this matter should allow you to label him as a \"flimsy wet noodle\".\n\nI'm sorry that you have such a hatred boner for the IPCC. The 1.5 degree report was the most comprehensive collection of climate modelling, direct geological evidence and human system studies ever produced. The collaborator list begs believe at how many people were involved. If that to you is a \"flimsy wet noodle\" then the notion of linking a single article form the NOAA that doesn't even quote its own source correctly should make you spit your tea. \nI don't believe you are interested in actual science, maybe because you don't really understand it (there's a whole argument here about science/research needing more relatable outreach programmes, for another day though) but maybe because you don't want to. The fact you believe Iceland is \"one volcano\" shows you have no sense of scale or perspective on these issues. If that's the case then I can understand that the scale of global anthropogenic warming must be scary/unfathomable to you. \n\nYours,\n\nA shallow kindergarten teacher who likes flimsy wet noodles", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck the IPCC, they don’t provide any real data, they simply talk about what they predict is climate change.

No I am not. \n\nTL:DR: I have too much time on my hands\nNow on to your claims and assertions. I’ll start off by saying that one of the biggest failing of the people arguing for climate change is the tendency to make stupid, cataclysmic statements, e.g.:\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2019/02/11/insects-die-within-100-years-leading-global-collapse-nature-8519304/#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20found%20that,out%20altogether%20within%20a%20century.\nOr even the glaciology lie of saying that Glaciers will be gone from the Himalaya’s by 2035. These assertions I believe come from the intent of wanting research to have impact. The people who study insects or glaciers for a living obviously care about them and when they see them in decline want to get the world listening. But equally when we get to 2035 and the Himalaya’s still have glaciers you are left doubting this radical claims/the underlaying cause. This is a problem and a common one amongst researchers tackling these sorts of big issues. \n\nTo retort your point that they don’t provide real data. The IPCC has a very large modelling group who’s group it is to translate the physical rules that govern our world into computer models that can simulate potential climate trajectories in the future. As with all forms of modelling, it has assumptions and simplifications built into the model, but the end result is always something that can approximate the reality of our world. The climate models produced in the IPCC are projects, predictions of what could/will happen. They are important source of information in trying to assess how to tackle these issues. Importantly the IPCC doesn’t implement policy, their mission objection is to present the science in a way that policy makers can assess and implement policies on. They present a range of models/outcomes and leave it to political powers to assess.  \n\nThese climate models use real data though. That’s how you get good models. You feed in massive amounts of real data and produce models that can accurately and reliably reproduce actual data. That’s how you know you can put trust into their predictive capabilities. Just because it is a “prediction” doesn’t mean that it’s made up. Its real science based on real data. Let’s be clear about that. How do you think weather forecasting works? We model actual atmospheric data and use that to predict what the weather is likely to be. Before you start shouting “BuT thE WeAthEr IsN’T AlwAyS RigHt!!!”, yeah of course it isn’t but it is much more right that wrong and might show inaccuracies on the level “will my garden get wet this afternoon”, but it will be very accurate on a regional/national level. Your failure to understand what modern climate modelling is doesn’t mean its not real/made up.\n\nNow onto your sources and links. Let’s have a look through them:\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/03/31/the-ipccs-latest-report-deliberately-excludes-and-misrepresents-important-climate-science/amp/\n-The NIPCC.

Are you seriously going to defend a man like Singer and suggest that the scientist and doctors who claim that things like passive smoking doesn’t affect people weren’t likely heavily funded by smoking companies? Don’t throw stones in glass houses.\n\n-The bottom line is that the NIPCC is a two-bit, angry and baseless group that talk themselves up providing outdated, incorrect and misleading information.

What was it I said about funding from tobacco and oil companies contributing to his views…\n\nhttps://247sports.com/college/west-virginia/Board/103782/Contents/Are-Still-A-Believer-in-MMGW-After-the-IPCC-Falsified-Data-129977632/\n-Let’s see… a random forum post linking two articles… cool. Both articles:\n\n-Peter Ferrara – Forbes: An outspoken climate change sceptic. Not necessarily a criticism but reduces the surprise when he jumps to the defence of the NIPCC describing them as a heroic, almost plucky institution compared to the evil goliath of the IPCC. It’s prejudice writing at best that ignores the fact the NIPCC have very very very little content in them other than outdated disproven science. \n\n-James Taylor – Forbes: again strong ties to the Heartland foundation so no surprises as to his opinions here. It’s all the same circle jerk of information and opinions. Not much to add that hasn’t already been said. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy\n-This is a swing and a miss. Taken directly from the link you provided. “Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct” & “The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged by the end of the investigations”\n\n-This is how science works “Climate scientists and organisations pledged to improve scientific research and collaboration with other researchers by improving data management and opening up access to data, and to honour any freedom of information requests that relate to climate science”. You point out things are lacking or need improving/overturning and you fix the problem. \n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/6679082/Climate-change-this-is-the-worst-scientific-scandal-of-our-generation.html\n-Thank you for linking an 11-year-old article relating to an issue we have already covered now. Makes for a fuller reading list I guess... See all points under the WhatsUpWithThat article.\n\nhttps://fcpp.org/2019/08/28/more-fake-five-alarm-crises-from-the-ipcc/\n-This was my favourite link you provided. Honestly, it’s wonderful, very funny! Let’s get into the claims it makes:\n\n-Paragraph 1: The Little Ice Age comparison. \n\no\tThis statement immediately sets the tone as one where the people writing have no clue over what they are talking about. Go to the Wikipedia entry on it and look at this graph: \n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/2000%2B_year_global_temperature_including_Medieval_Warm_Period_and_Little_Ice_Age_-_Ed_Hawkins.svg/330px-2000%2B_year_global_temperature_including_Medieval_Warm_Period_and_Little_Ice_Age_-_Ed_Hawkins.svg.png\n\no\tWe’re really going to sit here and say, “oh we were just coming out of an Ice-age”. Look at the preceding “Medieval Warm Period”. It lasts for like 300 years and represents 0.2 – 0.3 degree average temperature differences to the Little Ice age. The data doesn’t lie, something changes in the 1800’s to cause global warming, it’s human activity.  \n\n-Paragraph 2: Misunderstanding of the 1.5 degree science in the IPCC report.\n\no\tThe report states that models predict the effects of climate change increase with average global temperatures, but beyond 1.5 we see an increase in the rate of this change. 1.5 represents a cut-off point which if you can stay below limits the effect of climate change, not that the world immediately burns above it. \n\n-Paragraph 3: Old instrumentation.\n\no\tWell done, you’ve highlighted why error bars exist and why science is also presented in the form of averages with ranges of uncertainty.\n\n-Paragraph 4: Just untrue, satellite data is used.\n\n-Paragraph 5: Again, just not how climate science work.\n\no\tWe don’t just rely on thermometers. There are massive and extensive records of temperature records from cave stalagmites, glacial records, ocean floor sediments, sea-shell compositions, fish teeth… the list is incredibly long. All this varied data is used and combined and points to the same result. The world is getting hotter and its getting hotter quickly. \n\n-Paragraph 6: They said hottest ever on record, because it is the hottest ever on record, regardless of what a sceptic thinks. Data is data. \n\nParagraphs 7 – 11: Agriculture:\no\tCongratulations you missed the point. The warning isn’t saying your farms are fucked now. It’s saying your farms will be fucked. Record harvest prove that India is catering for a bigger population with better tools. Not the risk to agriculture is diminishing.\n\n-Paragraph 12 – 13: Methane:\n\no\tWell done you’ve highlighted the science of small changes can equate to big perturbations in the global climate. Also 30 parts/million is extremely detectable. Just because it’s small to you doesn’t mean it is small. \n\n-Paragraph 14: yep\n\n-Paragraph 15: ThEY’rE HiPoCriTs:\n\no\tYeah well done, to have a global meeting you need global travel. The consequences of a couple of airplanes flying to slat lake city are negligible. The consequences of poorly enacted policy to counter climate change is game over territory. \n\n-Paragraph 16: An interesting point:\n\no\tThe inequalities of global historical development bring about interesting debates in terms of who should bear the brunt of the fight. It is a fair line of reasoning to say developed nations with historical emission histories should lead from the front here.\n\n-Paragraph 17: Of course you weren’t:\n\no\tWould you pay for some who doesn’t believe in football to go to a football conference? No. Fuck off with your stupid rhetoric.\n\n-Paragraph 18: Aaah Heartland:\n\no\tTheir back baby, and continually spouting nonsense. I’ve talked enough about these guys. They have a very clear agenda and its not to produce good quality science that speaks for itself.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Part 3 Return of the King...\n\n-\tParagraph 19: Butchering arguments:\no\tNo-one is saying that we will be 100% wind powered (those that are, are an extreme and wrong minority). People know wind doesn’t always produce power. And we also know they pose risks to wildlife that’s why wind is often placed at sea. Go read for yourself the many articles about the UK’s decarbonisation success they’ve had in phasing out coal and substituting in wind at exponentially decreasing costs.\n-\tParagraph 20: Net zero:\no\tThis the what the IPCC is talking about. You need net zero carbon emission. We will always have carbon emission in our economy (closed cycle gar turbines, mining etc.) but that needs offsetting alongside zero emission technologies like wind and solar. \n-\tParagraph 21: Irony\no\tIt’s rich to have a hard-line capitalist, free market promoting ground like Heartland suddenly care about the ethics of child labour and cobalt sustainability when they will not lose a second’s sleep in outsourcing jobs to countries where this sort of shit happens. What was it I said about glass houses? \nhttps://www.thegwpf.org/images/stories/gwpf-reports/mckitrick-ipcc_reforms.pdf\n-\tOut of interest, did you really read this? Once you get past the Title and foreword this report is bloody boring. It’s a very technical assessment of this persons view of IPCC author structure. I guess there are a few “juicy” bits (Hide the decline probably being the most prominent one).\n-\tThe author Ross McKitrick is a climate scientist, and more to the point from looking at his publishing, he seems very interested in pointing out the difficulties and pitfalls associated with working through large and sometimes historical datasets. His most cited paper: CORRECTIONS TO THE MANN et. al. (1998) PROXY DATA BASE AND NORTHERN HEMISPHERIC AVERAGE TEMPERATURE SERIES, is interesting, presenting an argument against the classical “hockey stick” warming curve often shown alongside global warming discussions. I will highlight that this paper is often cited not as an example of good, corrective science, but often in rebuttal. Authors typical dispute McKitrick’s claims and methodologies. So care might be needed when reviewing his work.\nThat’s all folks, thank you to the one person reading this.\nPeace out,\nDoughface\n\nEdits: formatting didn’t carry over so corrected it", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "no", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Omg you’re a damn kid.
