Better yet:  close the positions (it goes without saying that you have to do this during regular trading hours but given what happened here, I’m just making sure).  Second, Robinhood doesn’t receive notice of the short puts being exercised right away (and assigned to the friend); rather, the OCC receives exercise instructions and then randomly selects a broker with a short contract holder, which may or not be the same broker from which the exercise instruction originated.  Then the selected broker selects, typically randomly, a contract holder for assignment...this is not an immediate process (the broker won’t even know until AH trading has closed) so there is nothing for the broker to react to.

There was a recent medical exemption in Canada for palliative care patients to use psilocybin assisted therapy to mitigate end of life depression and anxiety. This something that has been shown to be affective in the research of Dr. Roland Griffiths, and is already seeing positive results in Canada. I believe that Oregon and DC are also voting on the right for access to psychedelic assisted therapy clinics in the coming election, but don't quote me, I just remember that it was those two states.\n\nI like HOLL and TRIP because they are the two companies within the sector that have legitimate ways of generating income prior to generalized legalization within the west. HOLL has their revenues from the US cannabis sector (another very hot industry right now) and TRIP is targeting legal recreational markets in the Netherlands. I like Field Trip because they have some psychedelic assisted clinics already set up in places like Toronto, and probably will be a good company in the sector. Revive therapeutics is another one with legitimate revenue sources, but they have a bad wrap as being sector chasers, so invest at your own risk.\n\nMMED, NUMI, & BOSS are a few others in the sector that people like.

{"title": "Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.", "selftext": "I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.\n\nFirst of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.\n\n1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.\n2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.\n3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.\n4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash. We are seeing [record insider selling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/investing/insider-selling-stocks-market/index.html), but most publicly, it began with Tesla announcing they would sell $5bn in [new shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/tesla-to-sell-up-to-5-billion-in-stock-amid-rally.html). Their second biggest shareholder then announced they were conveniently \"[rebalancing](https://fortune.com/2020/09/04/tesla-stock-rally-investors-selling-outlook/)\" their portfolio to sell many Tesla shares as well. This was nothing more than a ploy to pull money out without crashing the market, even though it did anyway. I will get more in depth on this phase later. The biggest catalyst was [Softbank](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-dives-6-u-tech-004748400.html), though, and that leads me to the final stage.\n5. **Panic Selling**: This is when people start to exit en masse in order to recoup whatever they can. We are currently witnessing this. The last few days have been a trainwreck on the market, wiping out August's gains entirely.\n\nNow I know you want to say \"well look at today. We're up 2% in the S&P!\" This is par for the course on a crash. With the Corona crash, these were the rough day to day movement patterns (I'm using Corona as an example for its shortness/simplicity but all crashes have similar patterns):\n\n* 1 small loss day \n* 2 BIG loss days \n* 3 medium loss days \n* 5 ***gain days*** (there were 5 days of gains in the middle of the March crash) \n* 1 GIANT loss day \n* 3 Sideways days \n* 8 slightly down days, leading to the bottom \n\nOf those gain days, the first was a slowdown, but the second was a change of 4.8% in S&P/SPY from an open of 294 to a close of 309. Consecutive, positive days occurred during every major crash. We can see that being mirrored today and will likely see more upward mobility before more big money starts exiting. Don't be fooled by positive days. That does NOT indicate the crash is over. Novices tend to think crashes are a short event and that they should hold through them because they missed the boat. Crashes take weeks, minimum, but **usually months, if not years**, to become fully realized. Covid's crash is the fastest we've had at one month.\n\nAnother trend I've noticed is that these market bubbles are happening and recovering faster and faster. The late 80's Japanese market crash took 6 years to play out. The 2000 dotcom bubble was 4 years. The Chinese 2007 bubble took 2 years. The 2008 oil bubble took 1 year. On the flipside, the 2007 housing bubble took 5 years. The 2008 energy bubble took 3 years. We're about 6 months into this current bubble, but more if you account for any forming bubble from before covid. Maybe this means nothing, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nBubble analysts always say there is a warning sign prior to a true collapse. I've been seeing these called \"violent shake-offs.\" Most crashes get one, but some get two. We had one with the June mini-crash. One could argue that this current crash could be a violent shake-off. I'll get to the alternate scenario later. Assuming it's not, which I don't think it is, we move to the final trigger, the catalyst.\n\n**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank. They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.\n\nTo those who don't know, Softbank bought $4 billion in options during the early days of the market post-covid. These options are worth a fortune right now ($30bn estimated), but they have to be sold in order to be fully capitalized on. What everyone is afraid of is Softbank doing just that, or worse, for shareholders: holding through a market crash and losing it all. In the movie, Margin Call (great movie), a hedge fund got wind of the housing market crash before everyone else and ultimately sold EVERYTHING they had in order to get ahead of it, single handedly beginning the inevitable market crash. To be fair, this is a fictional movie and they had a portfolio of like a trillion, but it's really just mentioned to illustrate my point. Softbank has to exercise these options, which have strike prices likely WAY below market value. If they sell those shares, they could easily double their investment, even through a crash. The problem is that people got so spooked by this revelation that Softbank lost over $15 billion in market cap (currently at $112bn). Had this not happened, the speed at which we decline would've been much slower. They have to make those losses up now. You know what would do that? Exercising all their options and selling them for market gains.\n\nThey can't keep those options forever, either. At best they have 2 years. Softbank will try very hard to sell all those off without crashing the market, but if it keeps dipping, they will become more desperate and start selling them more frantically, promoting a panic selling cycle. And what are we in? A panic selling cycle.\n\nIf this cycle continues with Softbank, more will tack on and we'll see this bubble continue to collapse. If it can hold a recovery this week, it might survive, but of course, I don't think it will. The end of day today really showed that people *are* afraid and that given any opportunity, selloff will occur. I think this IS the crash. But, I could be wrong. That brings me to the second and third catalysts.\n\n**Commercial Real Estate Crash**: The eviction crisis is a real threat to our economy. It's brushed under the rug pretty heavily, pointing to the home real estate market and its gains, but the damage is done. Most major commercial real estate buildings, especially apartments, are in disarray. Go look around and see the kinds of deals your local apartments are offering. Where I am, I'm seeing up to 2 months of free rent in some places. I've never seen that before. Everyone is desperate for paying tenants. Most commercial properties can weather a bit of this kind of thing, but we haven't seen anything like this. Small businesses are shutting down, new businesses are not opening. No one is shopping. Who replaces those lost tenants? All these properties are heavily in debt. That's how the industry works, for the most part. Entrepreneurs and builders finance all projects because they are seen as very safe and it's a rule of thumb to never use your own money for investment. The margins had become abysmal before corona. I once looked into buying commercial real estate and found that I would only cover the expenses and have to solely rely on the property value increasing, to make anything worthwhile. This will cause properties to bleed out extremely fast. There is a commercial real estate collapse coming, likely within 6 months, and it will compound any damage the tech bubble has done. Don't forget that this isn't strictly a US problem. This is a worldwide problem.\n\n**Vacation Industry Crash:** Many countries around the world rely on a steady influx of visitors in order to keep their businesses afloat. This, in turn, boosts GDP. Malaysia, for instance, is a place I personally visited, during Covid, and it was a desolate wasteland. Most shops had employees literally standing outside waiting for a single customer. It was like this for blocks and blocks. Huge tourist attractions were completely devoid of people. It's only a matter of time before our lack of flying catches up to these already poor and extremely hard to maintain businesses. The country in Malaysia I visited had a notoriously low success rate for new restaurants, during the best of times. Now, they are lucky to get any customers. That affect will bleed into the second catalyst. More businesses going under, causing commercial real estate to lose tenants with no one to replace them, causing those buildings to go under, causing banks to be stuck with a boat load of vacant, unprofitable properties, causing them to go under.\n\nEven with a vaccine, we won't go back to normal fast enough to recover the losses. The airline industry is reporting that they don't estimate returns to normal until late 2021, early 2022. Do you think a random Joe has enough liquidity to keep his business running that long at extreme drought? The people at the bottom of the chain, consumers and small business owners, were never prepared to have a cash supply on hand for this kind of hit to their lives. That *is* going to trickle up to the top and when it does, goodbye market.\n\nOf course, there's also the US election, but that will be a small catalyst as far as I'm concerned.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\nOther notable indicators/insights that things don't look good:\n\n1. Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.\n2. Google trend results for \"Market Crash\" are trending up. Last week, which only accounted for 3 days, really, already topped the June mini-crash.\n3. An [analyst](https://www.ft.com/content/9d12ae03-2f6b-4028-8464-e305269e7ee3) who witnessed the Japanese crash of the 1980's believes this will be the biggest crash we've ever seen.\n4. EVs are the new dotcom company. Many will fail as car creation proves to be more difficult than anticipated.\n5. High growth, high revenue companies do not automatically equate to sustainable companies, despite stock prices pretending they do. For example, Sea Ltd. doubled revenue but also doubled expenses in Q2 2020. eToys is a prime example of this, from the dotcom bust era. Had huge revenue, but their expenses could not be lowered to a sustainable level and went out of business, despite the business model making sense and the revenue stream looking really good.\n6. The PE ratio of the market is above 30, which has historically always resulted in a market crash.\n7. Apple saw 12 million shares exited at the bell today. Prior to that was around 600k peak. This happened for MOST tech stocks.\n8. If you bought Microsoft at peak dotcom bust, you would have to wait 10 years to breakeven (longer if you account for inflation losses). That kind of stagnation is what we're looking at, even today.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\nThis does NOT mean the entire market will crash. Quite the contrary. Yes, most stocks will go down as the market collapses in overvalued sectors (TECH) brings down the whole thing, but they will stay high if priced fairly. Most epicenter is priced within a reasonable area, for instance, and will weather the storm quite well. At least, until the commercial real estate market collapse catches up to them.\n\nPlan accordingly, set stop losses, and do your own research. I don't expect you to just follow my information blindly. I may have gotten things wrong or mixed some wires. You need to figure this out on your own and make your own judgement call.

This isnt a \"dot com/tech bubble\" its a \"fed interest rate bubble\" and that bubble won't pop until the fed gives up on preserving interest rates and inflation. \n\nWhat just happened is actually easy to explain and understand when you look at the big picture (attached at the bottom). The Nasdaq and all these major indexes just hit all time record highes at a record pace. The ascent was so fast a violent pull back was due and thats what we got. But we are still in a fed bull market and the Nasdaq with its major tech indexes will return above their 10 year line because of covid. \n\nFor the last 10 years tech has grown at a steady pace, each year a new phone with a little better gadgetry, newer and better computers every year, but at a reasonable pace. My last laptop was a high end hp i7 top model with everything, it took 7 years for it to become outdated to the point of replacment becoming neccessary. Nowadays you're lucky to get more than 3 years out of one because tech is snowballing, just slowly. \n\nCovid has changed the game entirely, retail stores like Macy's or best buy could become a rarity, maybe not extinct but you wont have 3 Macy's in 1 city. Movie theaters could go extinct if we get a second wave over the winter, while drive ins are making a come back. Meanwhile techs snowball is building momentum. Post covid, how many businesses or organizations will no longer send people on a plane to physically go to a meeting when they can just use zoom or teams. Why go to the DMV for tabs when for an extra $3 you can do it online anytime in minutes. Why go to a grocery store for 5 items where you know you'll end up getting 20 items when you could just instacart your shopping list and avoid the temptations and lines. Not everything will change forever and we will all eventually have a normal life with travel and such, but a lot of changes will become permanent changes. A lot of people who have been working from home due to covid are still working from home because its easier for everyone, my gf is one of them. These changes will most positively affect these Nasdaq indexs that just took the biggest hit. \n\nSeptember is historically the worst month for the market especially with elections coming up and I bet its a volatile one. But I still bet a bullish one with lots of windows of opportunities to make any money back these 3 days just cost you. \n\nIts almost like the market just went, \"oh these techs are overvalued and people are going back to work covid is going away.

Yes people will take vacations but they cant fully load planes for who knows how long and their business travel income is near nil. \n\nNasdaq 10 year history https://imgur.com/gallery/uvBWbl5\n\nThis run wont end until the fed raises rates to combat inflation. But for these 10 years, these interest rates have continually gone down causing the market to go up. What youre describing is more of a full on bear market rally coming and that could last years. I doubt that will happen until the fed makes a move and currently they are still propping us up. \n\nI read everything you wrote and its a good analysis of a pattern, and I need this oppositional viewpoint. I think right now is a time to be cautious as its going to be a volatile couple months coming, but I don't think tech has reached its plateau yet, this is simply a bear trap, the deepest one yet which may indicate we are finally entering the blowout phase which is the final phase in the bull market. \n\nBull market cycle https://imgur.com/gallery/G90RP4L\n\nWhat we just went theough was the momentum phase. Heres the last 2 parts of that phase described; \nFirst sentiment extreme – Attitude towards the market is healthy and able to sustain a strong trend, and sentiment doesn’t become moderately extreme until the end of the phase.\n\n(This was August, strong trend until sentiment becomes extreme at the end.)\n\nBear trap – Concerns regarding overvaluation and an ending cycle feed a correction. However, the dip ends with a new round of buyers and provides a base for the next leg of the cycle.\n\n(We are literally just entering this today, we started to see a low volume of buyers come in. Tomorrow is likely also a greener day like you said, but I think it will sustain through the complete blowout phase. Which lasts about 10% of the bull market, so if this market has been running for 10 years this finaly ohase could last another year.)\n\nIn the coming days/weeks we will see renewed optimism set in as levels return to previous highs before true euphoria comes rushing in. \n\n\nTo be fair here: Bear market cycle https://imgur.com/gallery/gUEESiB\n\nAnd I totally understand how that could make you think we are entering that, afterall its descriptions are \n\nShot across the bow – This is the first major decline following the blow-off phase. It serves as a warning shot, marked by a fast and furious sell-off. This breaks the ‘animal spirits’ of the bull market as collectively market participants begin to become less certain about the future.\n\nBull-trap – The rally following the first decline off the high stabilizes market sentiment for the time-being, giving investors a false sense of confidence that the sell-off was nothing more than a sharp, but healthy correction.\n\nThe Lower-high – Buying pressure fades as skepticism leads to selling. The market begins to behave differently than it had after prior corrections by stalling and creating a major lower-high.\n\nHowever I still think we have yet to see the blowout phase of the bull market, it wasnt 1 month in duration. This is the telling week(s), if it retakes its old high lines its a bear trap, if it cannot retake old highs and hits resistance at the 21 and 10 day it could be a bull trap. \n\nI think the trickle effect you mentioned is what will cause the fed to drop the ball and everything to come falling down on itself, but I bet that doesnt happen until next year. Yes certain businesses are already closing, but the economy is not collapsing on itself in a way that affects companies like the amazons and apples of the world. Do you realize Amazon and apple combined make up over 20% of the entire stock market. So yes when they dip we all dip, but they wont crash cuz a few businesses closed. It will take wide spread poverty before they crash and burn.\n\nAt the very least, here is an opposing view.", "score": 2150, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your extremely thought out opposition kind stranger.", "score": 468, "replies": [{"body": "But we're in the crash now right?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thank you for such a well thought out view! You have the best one I've seen on here. This was exactly what I was hoping to get from someone when I originally posted this here.\n\nIt's very interesting that the bull and bear traps look exactly the same and they exist very close to each other on the spectrums (the bear trap basically leads right into the bull trap, post blow-off.). That's totally where my issue lies in my own argument. I wasn't sure if this was another violent shake-off leading into the last phase or if it was the crash itself. I'm still not entirely convinced it's not the crash though. Like you said, there needs to be confirmation one way or another.\n\nIt really doesn't take much to start a bubble crashing. One thing can cause others to compound on each other. Catalysts don't all have to be covid level to trigger a collapse. Looking into the dotcom bust, the catalyst was money managers urging their clients to rebalance their portfolios. That looks awfully similar to Tesla's second largest stockholder doing the same. Nothing is ever the same twice, and it's totally ridiculous to count Tesla as the main driver of this, but at the same time, they represent the emotional sentiment of this market as a whole. They embodied each phase of this bull cycle as if they were an emotional anti-VIX backed by the hopes and dreams Elon Musk has offered society. Now, it could just be Tesla getting their comeuppance, but like the bear chart says, this could create a fundamentally changed perspective in buying. You can't discount the power of this massive influx of retail traders and what they can do to a market. They've turned penny stocks into 10x returns and days later brought them back to their original point. I believe they single handedly boosted Tesla to where it is.\n\nPersonally, I think the retail traders are running out of money (as a unit). They aren't good investors, tons don't have jobs to re-up, and they just keep losing and losing and losing. Even during all the best green days, many still lose. They can only do that so many times before they are just gone again. And if their source of hope, Tesla, falls, they may rethink their entire investing strategy in general. They may quit or simply stop trading. With them not pumping, that creates a vacuum as well.\n\nThe market may be heavily handheld by the fed, but their strategies did not incorporate a structural meltdown of society itself. I doubt they anticipated that the world economy would literally shut down for months, millions unemployed, and somehow they'd have to use these niche market crash response strategies to fit with this crazy paradigm shift. No crash comes even close to covering the kind of losses we've accrued from corona. We haven't felt the burn from that in its entirety and it sounds like you are in agreement with me about the real estate and vacation industry crashes. I think those will compound on this current one. I guess I'd say this is the meltdown of the increasingly desperate retail trader who keeps getting their ass kicked by smart money.\n\nAgain, though, I totally think you could also be right and you're the only one here who has me legit rethinking my stance on this.", "score": 400, "replies": [{"body": "Retail investors are not propping up this market.

New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank.** They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.\n\nWhy do you think Tesla stock split + dilution is a catalyst for the market crash? I don't think that makes sense. As for Softbank, they bought calls in mainly the FAANG stocks, they didn't buy Calls on the whole market. Could Tech stocks crashing back to say, April levels, bring us back to SPY under 300? Sure. But re-test and breach the March lows?

It's supposed to be a measure of US domiciled publicly traded companies Market Cap vs the GDP of the US. What it doesn't take into account however, is that most US business do business overseas, and not just in the US. Therefore, it's no longer a good measure for how \"over valued\" or \"under valued\" a US company is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Google trend results for \"Market Crash\" are trending up. Last week, which only accounted for 3 days, really, already topped the June mini-crash.\n\nI checked this out, and it doesn't seem to be the case. On the 1 month chart, there's a small spike up on Sept 3, now it's trending lower than it was before this correction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>An [analyst](https://www.ft.com/content/9d12ae03-2f6b-4028-8464-e305269e7ee3) who witnessed the Japanese crash of the 1980's believes this will be the biggest crash we've ever seen.\n\nAnalysts don't know a damn thing. Also, the Japan example is so overdone when it comes to stoking fears. There are significant differences between 1989 Japan and 2020 USA. For one, at the market peak in Japan, the P/E ratio reached a staggering 60+ on the Nikkei. We're nowhere near those levels currently. Second, Japan has an aging population, and they don't have very liberal immigration policies, which has resulted in a stagnant population growth over the last 3 decades.\n\nBeyond the inconsistencies in your analysis, you've also got the other side of the coin.

Let's consider the Minsky-Kindleberger understanding of credit markets: there are three kinds of borrowers in the market at any given time. There are hedge borrowers who can make interest payments, and pay down debt. There are speculative borrowers who can make interest payments, but not pay down debt - they rely on asset prices increasing to improve equity (think of NINJA subprime holders). There are ponzi borrowers who pay down interest on debt only by borrowing further. \n\nA crash tightens credit markets. Ponzi borrowers go bust, because they can no longer borrow to pay down debt. Some speculative borrowers effectively become Ponzi borrowers as their equity collapses and perhaps as credit becomes tighter. Some hedge borrowers may become speculative borrowers. Further tightening causes Ponzi borrowers to collapse once more, and so the dance completes.\n\nThe great solution of Minsky is to have a lender of last resort. And right now we have a very Powellful LoLR. There was a moment in March that looked like a Minsky moment, but the Fed acted and the moment passed. You can say a lot about the present, but we are at no risk of a credit crunch. And while the Fed's actions were unprecedented in American history, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan both hold assets representing a far greater share of their country's GDPs. \n\nI will grant, I think there is some froth in the market right now. But markets won't panic like they did in March because the Fed has demonstrated its willingness to at least keep the banking system afloat. \n\nWe should note that markets don't have to go up or down, they can be sideways for a long time. An overvalued market with a strong lender of last resort may do just that - slowly drift towards some more sustainable - lower - equilibrium with occasional tumbles (halted by a proactive central bank). Incidentally, if you want to argue that American is Japan we should look at Japan's experience. Japan had a great fall in 1991, but much of what followed was not a crash but a sideways market and a sideways economy characterized by malaise. \n\nBears might be right, but not necessarily right away. Trying to short a sideways market can be exhausting - even as the Nikkei fell 75% from 1991-2009, it had five major booms in that period that would have broken many a short-seller.

Here's how I think we ended up where are today:\n\nMost of the value in the market, say 75%, is institutional money managed with fixed % allocations.  Say 50/50 equity/bonds.  QE pushed the value of bonds up (and promises to keep them there); together with the drop in equity values, that mechanically caused a massive flood of cash into equities.  The equity portfolio managers then have to pick stocks.  They may think everything is a Sell, but they have no choice.  So they hold their nose and put the cash where it seems safest - tech, Netflix, Zoom, etc.  Or they're following their benchmark index to a T, to reduce the chance they'll get fired.  \n\nIf stocks go down, institutions will sell bonds to top up equities.  Bonds can't go down, because of the Fed they're a bottomless pool of money.  So if stocks drop 30%, the overall portfolio is down 15%, so stocks will get topped up until they're only down 15%.  Traders frontrun the reallocation trade (either as an intentional strategy or because they believe \"stocks only go up\"), so stocks are only down 15%.  Which means they should only be down 7.5%....then 3.75%... \n\nThe same mechanism could limit how much stocks can go up, but with bonds as expensive as they are, institutions might be more inclined to let the \"house money\" stay in equities.  And no one is rushing in to short the market to correct prices (that strategy hasn't worked very well this year).\n\nTLDR: stocks haven't crashed *because they can't*.\n\nThere are a bunch of side plots going on at the same time, e.g. the options feedback loop.  And one way the above could fail is this: the Fed corporate debt programs have about $1 trillion.  If and when the market starts exercising this put, the $1T will be gone in a day.  The Fed doesn't have enough ammo.  They can reload but that may take time, and it would lead to some awful outcomes like the Fed owning worthless defaulted bonds issued in August 2020, where the proceeds were immediately dividend'ed out to the PE company that controls the issuer.\n\nCMBS are another potential hole.  Last I heard the market is still essentially frozen, so as not to look down.  But as more CMBS defaults it will get harder to pretend they're worth the same as they used to be.\n\nA couple other theories supportive of the market:\n\n* the Fed created so much cash that cash is now worth less (in terms of asset purchasing power, not CPI purchasing power, which are pretty loosely linked these days); so companies are worth less, but so is money;\n* most of the S&P 500 will survive; many of their competitors won't.

We probably feel it now because we are part of these subreddits and weren't exposed to it. You can't use ignorance as evidence.\n\n2)  I'm particularly disappointed in your point 4. Portfolios rebalance all the time so I'm not sure what you're trying to get at. You can speculate why Tesla sold new shares but the rebalancing and insider selling are absolutely nonsensical points. It's like me saying \"the CEO sold 10,000 shares this is bad news\" ignoring the fact that his overall stake is let's say 150,000. It's about perspective. Similarly, if I were to be a portfolio manager, I'd have allocations set out for stocks. Look at how much Tesla grew in the last few months. It would be a significant part of portfolios. Their strategy isn't just to buy and hold and keep buying. That's not how active management works.\n\n3) People just throw around the world overvalued and undervalued using arbitrary numbers that MAYBE are just good for relative comparisons but don't really tell us anything in and of itself. Let's take Apple as an example. No one talks about how their PE ratio was around mid-20s before the jump whilst other notable tech stocks that were arguably weaker than Apple had PE ratios in the mid-30s. Apple's is slightly higher now but it's more in line with the rest.\n\nMy point isn't to be like your end outcome might be wrong. You might even be right but I definitely don't think it's because of a lot of the reasons you outlined. And either way, people who make bold predictions may end up being right.

We arent in term of fantasy rather a reimagining of valuations and strategies. No more are analyst ratings a for institutional approval ; enter the retail investor. Enter the E-trading platforms.

One far less technical experienced or even invested in, emotionally or financially. Let’s not even go to platforms like RH and WeBull because they reinforce this point way too much lol. Think of e bank platforms offering 0 buck commission or free stock sign ups. Not only is this draining massive market share from larger institutional banks, it’s attracting masses of people. You may not worry about it but banks are losing sleep and execs are hanging themselves to find a solution. Not out of greed but out of necessity. Sign up quickly and get up to a Tesla stock? Where’s the difficult regulatory expensive conversion process a bank has to facilitate? It’s a no brainer for the masses. And sure while their deposits and portfolio in the early era of Accessible E trading is low, they represent a new market share/demographic that is growing exponentially. New advent of the overwhelming presence of the retail investor on a budget (financially and educationally) is such a shift in positions. We all like to joke about WSB, but through the memes and jokes highlights a fundamental shift in analysis. Pitches on positions seldom revolve on cash on hand, debt serviceability, coverage ratio, or return ratios. Any ratio that would be a part of pandemic discourse is usually missing. Projections and sentiments rule these investors citing growth in Apple shares due to probably priced in events of product releases when in pure history these factors have barely moved prices.

The firesale in residential is open season for the affluent. Commercial real estate will follow the same through mergers, acquisitions consolidations and summarizations to lesser players with larger wallets. That is the expansion cycle of capitalism. And so bailout is inevitable by the rich hedging a return with pennies on the dollar. It’s a no lose situation for them and what is occurring in residential real estate is a symbol for the financial opportunities in commercial. Think of it this way. With residential housing there is still a huge cash outlay required for a down payment or a mortgage. Meaning that it’s not only the ultra rich. More than anything serviceability is a huge mortgage concern and for new approvals, sure guidelines are a lot more lenient but it has to be fuckin something (at least in Canada lol). And therefore there are middle class purchasers too! All this to understand that residential gains also display an ability to maintain as well. Landlords will probably starve and thin out but it’s ridiculous to not factor in the giant sharks waiting to pick up prime real estate for pennies on the buck. Do you think giant firms aren’t itching to get back? Sure mid size and a decent number of large firms will permanently digitize operations but there is a large majority of firms that will have to return to commercial real estate as a function of necessity.

Then these become stand ins for the market as a whole (in part because their representation in the market makes them a huge part of it, for instance in ETFs, as well as in sentiment), and the market as a whole rises. But where this becomes kind of Fugazi is that these other stocks that don't really have a good reason to be rising quickly are following the ones at the top--which are rising because they are safer than those Fugazi ones that are following them. So there has to be a point where those at the top rise above any reasonable price--and should they fall the whole rest of the market is going to fall a lot harder.

The idea is that battery day should both show concrete roadmap of how they will to 20m vehicles in 2030, and hopefully convince the non Uber bulls that it’s not just possible, but likely.\n\n2) does wrights law take into account the cost, time, and capex (possibly more important than battery costs) savings of introducing never been seen before methods of battery production.

{"title": "The REAL Greatest Short Burn of the Century", "selftext": ">Disclaimer from Quora: A true short squeeze is a fairly rare event. There are probably 100 predicted for every 1 that occurs.*\n\n>There needs to be an unexpected positive event. This could be a huge earnings surprise, a takeover offer, new patent, drug approval, etc.\n\n>Unscrupulous stock promoters (PUMPERS) often dangle a potential short squeeze as a carrot to entice inexperienced investors to buy a bad stock. For instance, you will find predictions of a “massive short squeeze” on virtually every message board for every penny biotech stock. If you point out that there is insufficient short interest for a squeeze, the promoters just add lies about “naked short selling”.*\n\nThere, nobody sue me for the pennies I have. The following is all for entertainment purposes only:\n\n**The intro:**\n\nSup gamblers. Feel bad about missing the gain train on TSLA? Fear not - something much greater and stupider is here. \n\nYou know Citadel? The MM that took all our money today? Well now we finally won’t be at the mercy of the MMs. Instead, we’re going to temporarily join forces with the Galactic Empire and hijack the death star.\n\nOur choice of weapon... $GME.\n\n**The setup:**\n\nHuh?? Isn’t GME an absolute piece of trash stock? NO (will explain below), and even if it is, it's not entirely relevant. The this turn around is going to make TSLA's short burn look like warm afternoon tea.\n\nWhy? Well, most short squeezes are mostly math. This one is special because we have math AND great underlying news.\n\nTo be clear, this will happen whether or not we participate. I prefer us idiots to be a part of history. Here’s what’s up:\n\nShort interest: \n\nGME currently has between 85% - 99.8% short interest, depending on what site you use. For context, 20% is already considered high as the moon. TSLA and NFLX were around 30-40% at their peak. But GME’S ACTUAL SHORT INTEREST IS OVER 110%. In case you think I’ve gone nuts, look below:\n\n===\n\nShares Outstanding (June 2) = 64.8M\n\n- Insider Shares (June 30) = 8.9M\n\nTotal = Public Float = SO - IS = 55.8 M\n\n- Ryan Cohen Shares (8/31) = 6.2M\n\nTotal = Adjusted Public Float - Ryan Cohen = 49.6M\n\n===\n\nShares Shorted (9/2) = 55.7M\n\n===\n\n% Shorted (Total Shares) = 86%\n\n% Shorted (Float) = 99.8%\n\n**% Shorted (Adj. Float) = 112.3%**\n\n===\n\nThis is unheard of. Also, the short interest ratio/days to cover is 16 DAYS right now. Shorts are beyond trapped in their position.\nAnd the insiders? They won’t sell. In fact.. they’ve been BUYING.\n\nFine, what if the shorts are correct? They’ve been printing for 5 years. Ok fellow gamblers, here’s where the real DD comes in.\nThe reversal:\n\n3 big things will cause this reversal. Ryan Cohen, retail option buying, and Kenny G (Citadel) himself.\n\nWho’s Ryan Cohen?\n\nRyan Cohen sold Chewy in 2017 for $3.3 billion. He poured most of his money into Apple and Wells Fargo, saying he hates diversification and only goes all in into things he has high conviction in. Cohen is a Buffet-like investor. He is the largest individual owner of AAPL, and has sat on his hands doing nothing for 3 years.\n\n**Until last week… he went long on $GME.**\n\nWho cares right? He’s just another gambler like us willing to lose money. Not in this case… RC is special due to his expertise in e-commerce. He understands how a smaller company can compete against Amazon and Walmart despite heavy competition. THAT, combined with his hatred against diworsification makes his interest in GME a bit special.\n\nRC can spin this into an e-commerce/tech company, which would make Wall Street drool from their mouths. He’s already caught the attention of a few people, hence the recent 75% run up since the RC announcement.\n\nRC only needs to disclose his investments every 10 days. If he’s been buying since 8/31, we won’t know until this week.\n\nAdd to that, the original contrarian Michael Burry found that 90% of stores were free cash flow positive before COVID. GME’s balance sheet is healthy with $100M in net cash (around $500M cash and $400M debt), so they aren’t going bankrupt anytime soon. They also added 2 more activist investors, Kurtis Wolf and Paul Evans, who were nominated by Hestia Capital Partners and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund, to turn the ship around.\n\nAll this meaning, prominent figures have sKiN iN tHe gAmE, and if needed (unlikely) they have more cash to see it through.\n\nSecond and third, degenerate gambling retail robinhooders + CITADEL. Told you we’re going to work with him this time.\n\nThanks to MMs literally not using their brain and relying on ze maths to configure their entire business, we can take advantage of them sleeping at the wheel for a few seconds, and cause them to ram into GME for us.\n\nIt looks like this: RH Call Option buying -> MM Delta hedging/share purchase -> short squeezing -> Greater retail/RHers price action chasing/call option buying -> MM Delta hedging/share purchase -> short squeezing -> Institutional and new channels flip the script -> GME to $400+ -> cash out.\n\nBy the way. This is NOT a pump and dump. This is a kick in the shorts’ teeth. The stock will STAY HIGH.\n\nFor reference: if $GME was trading at the same P/S multiple as $CHWY, the share price would be $420.\n\nMaths:\n\nOn being delta neutral - quick refresher from a WSB classic:\n\n>“Part of the reason we see outsized moves is when a stock starts moving the dealers who are short the calls need to buy more stock to hedge. This can easily double the amount of buying pressure out there and lead to very exaggerated moves.\n\n\n>As the stock goes up, so does the delta of the stocks calls and dealers who were originally perfectly delta hedged before the move effectively become short the stock as it moves higher so they need to buy more stock to “hedge up” or flatten their exposure/risk.\"\n\nRemember, since GME is literally 99.8% of float short (ignoring RC’s shares for now) they currently HAVE LESS THAN 50,000 SHARES IN LIQUIDITY. \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME\n\nAs of writing this, delta on average is around 0.200, give or take. Higher for near dated (0.395) lower for long dated (0.195). Let’s be conservative and call it 0.2 for the time being. So now, for every call option I buy, MMs need to delta hedge with 20 shares.\n\nHere’s where it gets insane:\n\nIf $100,000 in calls are bought from RH, Citadel is forced to buy the remaining 50,000 shares. I’m using 10/16 $15C for this example. This is an insanely small amount of money, especially with Ryan Cohen, retail idiots, and the rest of the SeekingAlpha vultures waiting for this play. It’s a ticking time bomb waiting to happen.\n\nLet’s say Burry wakes up and decides to drop $600,000 in call options. This is going to force Kenny to delta hedge 300,000 in GME shares. When there are only under 50,000 shares available in PUBLIC FLOAT. This has NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN HISTORY. In an accidental squeeze (KBIO, VW), the shorts can’t buy back and get priced out momentarily. Pump and dump. Not what's happening here.\n\nIn a contrarian bet leading to a squeeze, shorts bail their positions and the stock STAYS HIGH (TSLA, PTON). The stock is no longer being artificially suppressed, and the shorts are NOT going short again.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I don’t even know how far this is going to blow up, since there is literally no historical precedent for this. I just know things are about to get very very insane.\n\nNow also add in the fact that GME is at a 5 year low, which means shorts can be largely satisfied with their gains, and are comfortable covering their shorts. Which, as a reminder, they have to BUY back.\n\n-Cut to Ryan Gosling toppling the Jenga pieces-\n\n**The timing:**\n\nAlright, if you’ve read up to now, I can assume you’re in. IV is off the charts right now. That’s what happens when a stonk goes up 75% in a week. Sorry, but the Ryan Cohen news is actually big news. \n\nPRE-EARNINGS BET\n\nThere’s no idea how the call will go. So place your bets if you think it will go well. If $GME absolutely misses the mark, this DD is worthless. BTW GME flopped the last 2 earnings - that's why there have been no big gains. Proceed at your own risk.\n\nFew things I’m betting on:\n\nFirst, GME beats earnings. All gaming companies, Nintendo, Sony, ATVI beat due to COVID lockdowns. Same store sales should be flat or up, with 300 less total stores. $GME is expected to post a loss of 1.27 EPS. That's way too low.\n\nSecond, activist investor activity. Cohen is sharp as a knife and will make sure things get aligned correctly. He's more financially oriented than most founder/CEOs. He can probably recite CHWY's balance sheet to you off the top of his head, and he understands the investing environment (bad IPOs, interest rates, SPACs). Meaning, he's not a gung ho YOLO Masayoshi / Grant Cardone coked out founder. He's disciplined. Yea I did some stalking... Well you know I had to.\n\nThird, positive news cycle due to Console Cycle: http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_240233258.jpg\n\nIf you’re wondering why fund managers aren’t covering and going long, remember that they have a JOB. They can’t make contrarian bets at the risk of looking idiotic. Cohen and Burry can because they own their own money.\n\nThey can talk about how $GME is going to be Blockbustered. Only one problem - GME’s Netflix… is GME itself. By the way, VW was also heavily shorted during a recession because everyone thought they would be bankrupt. Jus sayin.\n\nAFTER EARNINGS\n\nIf GME rockets after earnings, the short squeeze has started and we can pile on weekly 10-20% OTM options to force KG to delta hedge by buying shares, ad infinitum: see $TSLA.\n\nIf GME tanks, buy cheap options in anticipation of the short burn. \n\n**The trade:**\n\nIn order to capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call option is best. Remember when TSLA was going up so fast they didn't even have existing options to match the parabolic gains? Same will happen here. We only have $30Cs now, so these will have to do.\n\n15 Jan 2021 $30.00 C.\n\nAlso, since we don’t know when GME will skyrocket, this gives you time to capture any squeeze that happens.\n\n16 Oct $15.00 C.\n\nThis lets you capture more asymmetric upside in case the squeeze happens quickly.\n\nLAST, and timing is crucial here. ONLY WHEN I get the confirmed signal that the squeeze is happening, I will pound weeklies 10-20% above strike price. Again forcing Kenny to hedge with shares, causing shorts to cover and BUY back, increasing the delta of the call, getting retail and institutional attention, buying more calls/shares, delta hedge, shorts cover, ad infinitum.\n\nThe weeklies have the highest delta, so Citadel will be forced to hedge the most by buying shares. In other words, we’ll get the biggest bang for our buck in squeezing these.\n\nThere is a chance Citadel/MMs switches to buying puts to delta hedge. Like I said, they’re asleep at the wheel for a second, retail will likely ram before they change their algos.\n\nHowever, once the squeeze takes off, not even Citadel will be able to stop it. In any case, if they do start to buy puts, we can sell the puts as a bonus. \n\nLike /u/dlkdev once said, the only way to beat a rigged game is to rig it even harder.\n\nThis is not fraud. There is no manipulation here. We aren’t forcing anyone to do anything. It’s going to happen with or without us. But I want to ride. \n\nEarnings will light the match, but we can add all sorts of gasoline to the fire.\n\nI stole some data/ideas from a couple of different articles on Seeking Alpha/reddit/google/youtube. I’m not claiming credit for this trade, I don’t really care. In fact, I beg you to completely ignore me. I even dare you to short GME. I’ll happily take your money.\n\n**TL;DR: $GME is vastly oversold.**\n\n**GME is TSLA one year ago. GME is AAPL in 2017. Add to that the greatest short burn you’ll see in history, and you’re in for a hell of a show.** \n\nAlso GME is uncorrelated with the market. It might even be negatively correlated (it was today). It's only worth $500M (3 Bel-Air houses) and fund managers are happy to cut a high risk/low return position. Let your cognitive biases run free.\n\nRyan Cohen & Michael Burry if you see this - you better buy as much as you can now. When GME gets to fair value of $26B+, you won't be able to take over the company and kick out the backwards exec team. Good luck.\n\n**Edit1: $GME missed and tanked. Not much Cohen can do in 1 week. IV is dead and liquidity is still dry. Get cheap calls while you still can.

You then go sell the $400 strike call for $50. You get to pocket $5000 ($50 \\* 100 shares) when you sell the call. If you hold everything to expiration, and say the stock is $500 - you exercise your $40 call, and then sell it as part of the $400 call; you make the $360 spread (per share) and the original $50 (per share) when you sold the call. The downside is you obviously capped your gains so you don't make any more money above the strike price you sold.  If the stock price closes below $400, the $400 call you sold is worthless, your call is still in the money and you got to keep the $50 per share from selling the call\n\nLong winded way of saying, you can protect yourself a little by locking in some gains, but obviously capping your gains as well if things go gangbusters", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Are you long already a call in AMC that’s in the money?

You no longer need to drive to the store, wait in line, etc. Same goes for console releases - why would I wait in-line for days to get the console at midnight of release when I can pre-order it on Amazon and have it show up at my door on release day.\n\nTake a look at your historic chart (I checked). It's interesting - the 2007 share price run-up was AFTER the Nov 2006 release of consoles (PS3, etc.). Strong sales, etc. that surprised to the upside. Traders then ran up GME in 2013 AHEAD of console launch in Nov 2013 (PS4). But if you look at share price movement after Nov 2013, it cratered as clearly sales results were disappointing. That is why you are not seeing the same enthusiasm this time around for the next generation of consoles - traders have realized that consumer behavior has changed so much since 2007 that people will most likely order consoles online and have it delivered.\n\nThe biggest bearish case here is that: COVID-19 accelerated the decline of business.

Just like I had done all the way up the mountain. I gave myself a decent cushion, or so I thought. I even managed to roll my positions down to 380 for a credit by pushing them out to October. Perhaps there will be another run up and it will be over that strike by then. Perhaps not. I also should have cut my losses after dropping 40k in the first day of this sell-off. But no, I had to hang in there to see if it would go back up. Nope, just more down. \n\nThankfully I have not touched my initial capital and was able to get out before that happened, but I've essentially reset myself back to square 1. I am still up for the year, about 30k. Just enough to cover the 21k in options fees I have racked up so far, and a small withdrawal to pay off a credit card that I took out about 2 months ago. Of course, I still get to pay taxes on that.\n\nAs for the being thankful... \n\nI've learned some valuable, and very expensive lessons. Always protect your capital and don't let yourself get wiped out. Cut losses early and look for another play. It's extremely hard to win your money back in this casino when you're out of chips. Sometimes it is extremely easy to make money in the market, and it sure makes it difficult to want to work a regular job when you're bringing in 10-20k per day. It is also just as easy to lose your ass. Thankfully, this loss will not change my life in the slightest.
