{"title": "The pros are getting ready for a market crash — retail investors, not so much, top economist warns", "selftext": "***‘A large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.’***\n\nThat’s **Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz’s chief economic adviser**, explaining in [an op-ed for the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e50812f0-51c1-4f8c-9072-21eb0eb8cb9d) how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months.\n\n“The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said. “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “\n\nHowever, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.\n\n“It is hard to overstate the extent of today’s risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,” he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple [**AAPL,** **+3.98%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote), Tesla [**TSLA,** **-4.67%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) and Amazon [**AMZN,** **+1.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMZN?mod=MW_story_quote).\n\n“Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.\n\n“Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.”\n\nOn the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that.\n\n“The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.”\n\nHe pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies. At the same time, the smart money is hedging bets with downside “tail protection” to guard against the inevitable sharp declines. That’s why we’re seeing the VIX volatility gauge [**VIX,** **-1.09%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/VIX?mod=MW_story_quote) decouple from equities, another sign, according to El-Erian, that retail investors are particularly vulnerable when the sellers take the upper hand.\n\nRead More:   [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447)", "id": "ikxj51", "created_utc": 1599010474.0, "score": 521, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 391, "comments": [{"body": "For every pro that comes out saying the market is going to crash, there are others saying we'll go up another 10%.

Gains were nice, above average, but it's semiconductor, 2x gains every 2 years is the norm, that's Moore's law for you. It does look like a solid generation though, some of the rendered videos they showed looked absolutely stunning, Ray tracing will really take us to completely photo-realistic computer generated videos. The eye works on ray tracing (photons hitting the retina) so it should work.\n\nBiggest issue I had was the announcement that the cards were fabbed on Samsung 8nm \"Nvidia custom node\".\n\nI don't really like this, that's a really old ass node. Samsung 8nm is really just Samsung 10nm with a new coat of paint. About 15% logic density over 10 nm, with maybe 5-8% performance gain.\n\nIt's hard to compare logic nodes between manufacturers, performance is very hard, but for transistor density this chart is good,\n\n[https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm\\_vs\\_10nm\\_vs\\_12nm\\_vs\\_14nm\\_Transistor\\_Densities](https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm_vs_10nm_vs_12nm_vs_14nm_Transistor_Densities)\n\nRTX 2000-series was on TSMC 12 nm with 34 million transistors per mm\\^2, Samsung 8nm is 61.2 MTr /mm\\^2. It's a nice 80% density gain, but it's like really fucking old stuff. Smartphone were getting fabbed on TSMC 10 nm (comparable to Samsung 8nm), in 2017 with the Snapdragon 845 (thing that goes in all flagship android phones).\n\nIn 2018 Snapdragon 855 was on 7nm.\n\nIn 2019 Snapdragon 865 was on \"advanced 7nm\" N7P, about a 15% performance gain.\n\nIn 2020 Apple will launch the next iPhone on TSMC’s 5nm EUV in a couple weeks.\n\nTSMC 5nm has a transistor density of 171.3 MTr /mm\\^2, destroying Samsung 8nm @ 61.2 MTr /mm\\^2. Being around 2.8x more dense and \\~140% more performance per watt.\n\nNvidia seems to be on lukewarm terms with TSMC, while TSMC's new best friend is AMD. After lawmakers banned Huawei from using TSMC, AMD quickly gobbled up all their reserved 5nm wafers. AMD is going hard pushing newer nodes, of course larger dies like GPUs do kinda need to be on older more mature nodes. Just so they can fab such huge dies without defects and get good yields. AMD also has CPUs, which are much smaller and can handle higher defect rates. AMD is pushing 5nm CPUs in 2021, probably GPUs soon to follow. While Nvidia seems to be trying to nickle and dime Samsung getting good prices on their refreshed 10nm node.\n\nPros I think is that Samsung has a lot of capacity, they've really fallen behind TSMC lately, and they kinda suck. But obviously Nvidia can still deliver strong performance gains and will be able to pump out a lot of GPUs with all that capacity available at Samsung. Leaving all that performance on the table also gives them a really easy next generation. All they would need to do is move the same GPU to TSMC 7nm EUV (which they really just could have fabbed on today), and they would have an almost free 2x boost in performance over Ampere.\n\nAlthough...maybe none of this really matters. Their data center work-horse Nvidia A100 is of course on TSMC 7nm, and that's where they make all the real money anyways. Gamers not clogging up capacity on TSMC 7nm so the people who pay the real money can get all the A100s they want is a good thing.\n\nNvidia has also been really successful in selling dedicated AI research hardware to gamers. The AI people are very happy, because they're getting everything they want, 24GB on 3090, 40GB on A100, vastly improved tensor units, hardware sparsity optimization, TF32. They're really happy about Ampere. Gamers get sold this as DLSS, RTX voice, NVIDIA Broadcast. I don't think they really realize the tensor cores will be sitting idle over 90% of the time in games, and they're really just for training and running neural networks. DLSS is really impressive though, the way AI lets you cast fewer rays and fill in the blanks with a neural network is very clever and does vastly improve picture quality. I think Nvidia has sufficiently justified the tensor cores existence to gamers and they have accepted them.\n\nIt really helps Nvidia streamline their product lineup, I mean, the 3090 has\n\n36 TFLOPs FP32 (normal graphics)\n\n69 TFLOPs RT (Ray tracing)\n\n285 TFLOPS (AI acceleration)\n\nFor comparison, Google's latest Cloud TPU v3, purely for AI acceleration has 90 TFLOPS per chip. Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" AI Chip has 74 TOPS (37 TFLOPS). Nvidia has really succeed in selling AI accelerators with gaming support to both data centers and gamers. It's good business and more focused development teams, good synergy.\n\nYou're so performance limit by heat anyways, I think tensor cores takes up maybe 10% of the GPU, you can only create so much heat in a tiny area, throw in some tensor cores to space things out and it doesn't really matter for gaming performance. It could even improve gaming performance because it makes the chip easier to cool, just makes the whole thing a bit bigger really.", "score": 150, "replies": [{"body": "Yo dude, I am just gonna say good job on knowing the industry and doing DD.

For instance, Covid-19; reality: There are pandemics *all the time everywhere on the planet* and a large number of them are deadlier. Why this one? To be totally honest, no one knows, Ebola should have blown up everything if we are concerned for deadliness and the SARS should have collapsed the world over but neither of these things happened and there's no particular reason why.\n\nOur historians still ponder about what causes these things and while we can definitely look back and chronicle it all there's no real rhyme or reason why Tesla is what it is today or Zoom flew off the handle (because, think about it, Zoom's revenue is *not surprising* seeing as everyone has been using remote services; it should have been absolutely priced in by just simply thinking about it) or why stocks that have nothing to do with Corona blew up too; some of the stocks that actually *gain* from Corona exploded down. Makes no sense.\n\nSo the truth is that no one knows. We don't know what causes A to follow B to follow C. None of it requires a genius mind to realize certain stocks should have more value during certain times or when certain services are in play and yet the valuation of things is rampant and drunk not because people are stupid but because people are too clever; they've decided they know what they do not know about how things so obscure and complex work that they are all suffering from Dunning-Kruger.
