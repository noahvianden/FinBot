I’m personally going to research more about the September end date and see if the YouTube analysts are right.\nA potential play for me would be an end of September strangle - feels like workhorse has settled at a higher value because of the USPS contract potential, but what effects will that have on stock price if there is no news by end of September? I think we’d see a drop in price but not a collapse because they have a lot of companies seeing potential in them and they are in a great market. People correctly correlate workhorse with Tesla but incorrectly correlate battery day with workhorse - hence the confusion on why the stock is going up.\nAnother idea would be to throw an option on it now that expire in October and then buy shares if it falls. Options are exponential in value obviously while using less liquidity and I believe workhorses option value has a lot of room to grow due to the same volatility price fluctuation if it drops making it worth the risk. This stock was $.35 a share company at one point and is now a potential $7billion company due to a current fair market cap and massive potential. If the stock drops it’s because people were wrong about the timing. While there is still question if usps gives the contract up in December Due to potentially going bankrupt or making huge budget cuts, usps has claimed the money has already been set aside for the ev upgrade which would mean EOY for usps hasn’t happened yet and I’d assume December is the next potential announcement timeframe.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Workhorse is garbage.

Tesla's share price was terribly depressed and we were losing many long time supporters.  Contributions to this sub were overwhelmingly negative with a disproportionate amount coming from short propaganda pushers from r/RealTesla and the tslaq community in general.\n\nPrior to the above post i posted the following comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/bgsd67/tsla\\_daily\\_investor\\_discussion\\_april\\_24\\_2019/elo9tuo?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/bgsd67/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_24_2019/elo9tuo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) expressing how much I believed in Tesla during the lowest time in a 2 year period for the company.\n\nWell what a 12 months it's bee!  I was greatly relieved to recover my original investment and make many times that eventually.  But here's the thing: **My bullish thesis from 12 months ago has not come to pass.**  I believed Tesla would demonstrate an overwhelming lead in automation.  Autopilot currently is so bad my wife and daughter won't let me use it because the phantom breaking scares them.  Advanced summon is not worth using.  The FSD beta is novelty functionality.  I've found I have to turn it off for real use of he car.  Having Elon re-promise robot-axies by the end of the year adds insult to injury.  How bout you instead make autopilot better and safer ?\n\nTwelve months ago we had \"the most amazing product backlog of any company\" according to Elon.  We had the Semi, Roadster, Model Y, Cyber truck.  Maybe even a sub  compact.  The Model Y turned out to be a vertically stretched model 3.  The Semi and Cyber truck will go  into production when?  I *think* my wife and I are about to purchase a Y but its a bit underwhelming to me and I don't trust Tesla to take  care of me the purchaser they way I used to.  It's not as clear where their priorities are.\n\nThe fundamentals of the company have stayed flat or gotten worse during the time stock has gone up 10 fold.  They were targeting production of over 1 million vehicles a year (or 20k a week)  from Fremont alone back in 2018 when I pre-ordered my P3D.  Now we are excited about 500k total in sales for 2020 from Fremont and China combined?  Yikes.\n\nI didn't buy Tesla as a meme stock.  I believe fundamentals based long term buy and hold investing.  I am deeply disturbed by the kangaroo market in general that we find ourselves in.  I believe one day Tesla will be worth its current share price.  I think that time frame for that though, considering their slower  than expected progress, is probably at least  5 years out.  Thus I have sold my shares and will stay on the sideline until I feel the company is a better investment.", "id": "iw43om", "created_utc": 1600562415.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "Tesla failure to grow 300%  a year truly disappointing", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Here's an attempt to counter key points of the rather negative thesis outlined by /u/Soooohatemods. I'll post my replies to key points as individual replies, to not create a 'wall of text' with a single huge reply.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to thank our kind mod for outlining a thesis I'm sure he knew would be received poorly by the bulls and hyperbulls here. While I disagree with key points of the thesis, I appreciate the honesty. 🤠\n\nI also think it's time to spend a bit of time on re-examining the Tesla bull thesis. I assumed these points are well-known, but apparently it's not, and various sorts of doubts have crept in.\n\n# **(1) The \"no Tesla growth\" thesis**\n\n> \"They haven’t grown in the last 18 months.\"\n\nThis is false in terms of deliveries, Tesla reported record 112,095 deliveries for Q4'2019, which was two quarters ago - i.e. the true figure of \"no growth\" is 6 months. (You can add another 2.5 months if you will, but that's just reporting delay.)\n\nBut even the \"no growth for 6 months\" thesis is effectively false, because it's measured in absolute numbers & naively compared between dissimilar quarters in a highly misleading fashion.\n\nFor businesses with with heavy seasonality of sales (which Tesla certainly shows) it's not valid to compare absolute quarterly figures - i.e. expect Tesla Q2'2020 sales (second weakest quarter) to beat Q4'2019 (strongest quarter).\n\nInstead what analysts that want to value Tesla fairly will do a quarterly comparison, year over year, to eliminate the seasonal factor.\n\nIf we do that, we get the following seasonal pattern aware growth table:\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2018:** |              | 29,980 | 40,740 | 83,775 |  90,966\n **2019:** |              | 63,019 | 95,356 | 97,186 | 112,095\n **2020:** |              | 88,400 | 90,891 |      ? |       ?\n\nIf we calculate the percentage of growth compared to the seasonally comparable quarter from last year, we get this table:\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2019:** |              |  +110% |  +134% |   +16% |    +23%\n **2020:** |              |   +40% |    -4% |      ? |       ?\n\nAs you can see the \"growth story\" was alive, well and kicking up to Q1'2020, when a ~~Plague~~ Covid Year forced Tesla into an unprecedented 80-day shutdown, disrupting production.\n\nTesla still sold every car they made, and they have insane waiting lists in some places: in Norway there are documented cases of orders going in May and delivery being scheduled for August-September ... a 3-4 months long wait.\n\nAnd **despite** this huge interruption to supply, Tesla still managed to eke out only a -4% drop in deliveries, while sales of automakers all around the globe shrunk by around 30%.\n\nI.e. the Covid disruption was actually a really good natural experiment to \"measure\" Tesla's demand ceiling.\n\nBut it gets better. If we consider TroyTeslike's latest estimates - which are usually better than 5% accurate, in Q3 Tesla might deliver in excess of 140k units, with >180k expected by him for Q4. [Here are his latest estimates.](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike/status/1305998283580551168)\n\nTroyTeslike's (/u/Teslike) methodology is data driven, and so close to the end of the quarter his estimates were historically very reliable, even in \"surprise\" quarters that generated surprisingly high or surprisingly low sales.\n\nHis track record is very good:\n\nquarter | @TroyTeslike deliveries prediction accuracy\n---|---\nQ3'2019 | 96.1%\nQ4'2019 | 96.7%\nQ1'2020 | 93.9%\nQ2'2020 | 98.6%\n\nLet's plug in those numbers into our \"seasonally fair\" growth table:\n\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3         |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2018:** |              | 29,980 | 40,740 |  83,775        |  90,966\n **2019:** |              | 63,019 | 95,356 |  97,186        | 112,095\n **2020:** |              | 88,400 | 90,891 | 144,000 (e) | 187,000 (e)    \n\nWe get:\n\n **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2019:** |              |  +110% |  +134% |   +16% |    +23%\n **2020:** |              |   **+40%** |    **-4%** |   **+48%** (e) |    **+67%** (e)   \n\nI.e. not only is Tesla expected to meet FY 2020 growth guidance, the current data is projecting that they'll show \"explosive\" growth in the second half of the year.\n\nFinally, about the \"18 months no growth\" figure, which is the time measured since Tesla's last revenue record on Q4'2018 ($7.2b).\n\nThat comparison is unfair and inaccurate for several reasons:\n\n- it doesn't perform seasonal correction\n- it doesn't take into account the almost 3 months reporting delay: Q3 is probably going to post record revenue, we just don't know it yet.\n- it doesn't take into account that Tesla has reduced prices aggressively to grow faster in unit sales - the most useful metric of growth stories.\n- it doesn't take into account that each business segment has its primary metric, which is very often not revenue:\n - for video streaming (Netflix) it's \"subscriptions\"\n - for the videocard/GPU business (Nvidia) it's \"cards sold\" \n - for the software business it's \"subscribers/licenses sold\"\n - for the smartphone industry it's \"handsets delivered\"\n - for the car business it's \"cars delivered\". Tesla might be a tech company, but its growth performance is still unit based.\n- it doesn't take into account that Tesla managed this explosive growth episode with a **sedan** (the Model 3), while the Model Y, a globally more popular SUV form factor (with a 200-300% bigger addressable market, maybe more), is ramping up right now with several factories coming online (Fremont Model Y expansion: probably done, Shanghai Model Y expansion: almost done, Berlin Model Y expansion: a few months from done, GigaTexas: Tesla's fastest construction project so far), will significantly increase both the ASP and the unit sales.\n\nFinally, we are just ~12 days away from the Q3 deliveries report, which will IMO powerfully falsify the \"no growth\" thesis via an actual official report. Why have these doubts so close to the falsification event? Why give in to backward looking arguments in a moment that is arguably the 'most doubtful' time period due to reporting delays and due to Covid?\n\nHopefully I have not earned myself a ban with this reply. 🤔\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** If we are willing to project just 2 weeks into the future, with the Q3 deliveries report the \"no growth\" thesis is fundamentally false both in terms of deliveries and in terms of revenue.", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "### **(6) Tesla fundamentals**\n\n> \"The fundamentals of the company have stayed flat or gotten worse during the time stock has gone up 10 fold.

These will dramatically improve EPS figures for 1-2 quarters and I believe the market will *not* discount it - these are real tax benefits Tesla is forced (by GAAP) to turn into GAAP profits.\n- Convertible notes:\n - As most investors know, Tesla has entered into a complex set of convertible notes agreements over the years, which are dilution-hedged with an even more complicated set of call options.\n - What few investors realize I believe is that Tesla will gain a steady income of cash from these convertibles, starting next March with a $400m cash benefit. The total cash benefit is around $2.7b. These hedges are basically bullish call option spreads with a neat income for Tesla.\n - What even fewer investors are aware of is that Tesla could turn these hedges into GAAP income, with a simple board decision. This means both cash flow and GAAP income gets improved by about $2.7b over the next ~3 years.\n- Tesla Network could arrive anytime, and will arrive with a bang I believe.\n- S&P 500 inclusion is being discounted here due to the ~1 month delay the index committee decided, but it's still a **~$80b forced diversification from other sectors and investment into Tesla**.

Yikes.\"\n\nWhile historically you are right, Tesla indeed overestimated their ability to ramp up and grow Model 3 production, it is a fundamentally backward looking argument.\n\nIndeed Tesla over-promised, and they paid a heavy price for it, and for almost 3 years the stock not only stagnated but was cut in more than half in value from its previous peaks.\n\nBut for forward looking investors it's three main parameters that matter to the Tesla growth story:\n\n**(1)** The exponent of growth\n\nWhich, if we discount the Covid hick-up, is still fantastic:\n\n  **year** |  deliveries: |     Q1 |     Q2 |     Q3 |      Q4\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n **2019:** |              |  +110% |  +134% |   +16% |    +23%\n **2020:** |              |   +40% |    -4% |   +48% (e) |    +67%  (e)\n\n**(2)** Strength of the competition\n\nThere was an important story in the last 3 years which your thesis does not discuss, **the impending failure of the legacy ICE OEM industry**:\n\n- The I-Pace and the E-Tron were \"the king is naked\" moments,\n- that the smaller Taycan couldn't out-accelerate the 7 years old Model S design and had to resort to \"but we are better on the track!\" shenanigans was an \"oh shit\" moment,\n- the ID.3's software struggles show what an impossible gap legacy auto must bridge to catch up to Tesla.\n\nThese events, while not directly Tesla events, strengthened Tesla's perceived market position immensely. Please do not under-estimate the pricing effect of this.\n\n**(3)** Market dominance\n\nThe Covid crisis has shown the anti-cyclical resilience of Tesla sales (only 4% drop), and the fact that they managed to post profits despite various headwinds demonstrated their profit margins.\n\nMonopolies and quasi-monopolies get a very tidy valuation bonus, because they have more anti-cyclical and higher profit margin income streams. Wall Street is increasingly seeing Tesla as an \"Apple\" story, with very high potential profit margins and a resilient market position.\n\nAnd Apple's combined markets are maybe $500b per year - while Tesla is growing into markets with a combined revenue stream of trillions of dollars - maybe even beyond $10t if we include energy.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla was rightfully punished for their Model 3 optimism, but this is water down the bridge today, and the forward looking metrics are looking fantastic.", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "### **(4) Tesla's FSD lead and Robotaxis**\n\n> \"I believed Tesla would demonstrate an overwhelming lead in automation.

How bout you instead make autopilot better and safer?\"\n\nThis point has a healthy dose of truth to it, I'd only like to quibble with the \"Elon promised robotaxies by the end of the year\", which is false, he promised a fleet of 1 million robotaxi **capable** vehicles on the road, which is projected to be met: we'll well into passing 1 million FSD capable Teslas on the road by the year's end.\n\nOther than that, on the surface I agree, FSD progress has been much slower than many of us expected.\n\nMy own take on it is that last April was a rare glimpse into the true internal plans of Tesla - they disclosed them to investors because they needed the Autonomy Day equity round.\n\nSince then Tesla has earned & raised a ton of cash and has built a fortress of a balance sheet, and it's not in their interest to disclose the true rate of progress of their AI projects:\n\n- I believe their AI chip design is at least 3-5 years ahead of the competition such as MobilEye, Google and Nvidia.\n- I believe Tesla's \"data advantage\" driven by their 1 million nodes large training computer (the Tesla vehicles fleet), is basically insurmountable, if we assume just a modest level of 'first mover advantage' here.\n- They are disclosing new FSD features at a rate they believe will make people buy the FSD option with a sufficiently high take-rate. I.e. it's reactive, with much of the progress staying hidden.\n\nMost importantly, I believe much of Wall Street still doesn't value Tesla's FSD business - the analyst estimates I cited in my previous comments valued Tesla as an Apple-alike high-tech car company.\n\nARK comes the closest to valuing FSD, and it's an additional +$2,000-$3,000 of valuation to TSLA, **post-split**.\n\nBut then ARK doesn't value Tesla Energy at all and completely glosses over the Roadrunner project's real implications of Tesla's near 100% non-commodity supplier independence, IMO.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** Yes, Tesla's FSD progress is slower than expected, but the current Street valuation of Tesla is IMO not driven by FSD (non-)progress, at all, it's purely the automotive growth story combined with high margin income.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "The way machines learning works, is that the AI makes a decision and then learns from some sort of correction.\n\nThe advantage tesla has, is that they can send out an update, and then get relevant corrections on a weekly basis.\n\nThis is incompatible with the notion you express, that they have \"hidden progress\".

If we naively compare P/E ratios to P/E ratios back then, then we might come away with the impression that we are in a bubble.\n\nBut P/E ratios have to be compared to the P/E ratio of the 'real risk-free interest rate' - which was very high, around 6%, back in 1999.\n\nToday the real risk-free interest rate is around 0.6%, and the Fed just signaled it last week that they expect low interest rates to continue into 2023.\n\nIn practice this means that institutional investors, due to the lack of income from the normally huge bonds market, will increase their search radius in time, to the 2022-2023 time range.\n\nAnd if we extend to Tesla's expected growth in 2021 and 2022, its EBITDA based P/E becomes not just low, but the lowest of all major tech companies.\n\nFor example [here's TSLA fair value estimates by Gary Black](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1306951581838049281) (former CEO Aegon Asset Mgmt US, Co-CIO Calamos, CIO Equities Goldman Sachs Asset Mgmt, CEO/CIO Janus).\n\nHe arrives at a current TSLA fair value (risk adjusted to today) of $600, based on the automotive business alone - i.e. ignoring both Tesla Energy and Tesla Network.\n\nI.e. despite the run-up this year, TSLA is *still* trading at a discount, if these estimates are accurate.\n\nI.e. this view:\n\n> \"Tldr: I am a fan of Tesla the company but I have sold my shares and think the stock is greatly over valued.\"\n\nIs a dangerous view for retail investors if you are otherwise bullish on Tesla. You are trying to time the market. You might end up being correct - but key points of the bull thesis I have outlined would have to fail for that, or some major macro earthquake would have to occur.\n\nI.e. I'm in the exact opposite situation as /u/Soooohatemods: I wouldn't be able to sleep well if I **didn't** have a healthy stake of core TSLA shares. And no, I didn't care that it corrected by -40% two weeks ago, that's part of the Tesla story. 😎\n\nInstitutional investors are doing that all around the world, for numerous businesses, and I believe this process - which, if the Fed is holding rates, will not stop anytime soon.\n\n[I'm again quoting Gary Black here, who summed it up best IMO](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1306635239326916608):\n\n> \"But this isn’t 1999. 10-yr Treas are at 0.6% vs 6.0% in 1999.

Forward PEGs on R1000 Growth at 2x today vs 4x in 1999.\"\n\nI.e. you cannot compare 1999 PE ratios which were in a 6.0% interest rate environment to today's 0.6% interest rate environment. With equity spreads still at +4.5% the force for funds to flow into cash and cash equivalent bonds is weak. This same force was -1.0% in 1999, accelerating the flow out of the dotcom bubble.\n\nYes, when the Fed starts the next tightening cycle it might trigger a massive correction - but unless there's some Vis Major event, expectations of the current \"bubble\" to burst anytime soon are not based in rational logic I believe.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Incredibly apt analysis. 🙏🏽", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This entire point-by-point response is so appreciated, thank you so much for taking the time to write this out.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Or at all?

My impression is that Tesla over the past year or so was taken by surprise by the relatively slow progress of the competition, and decided to grow their own capacity faster than previously planned to partly fill the gap. If/when S&P 500 inclusion comes, I would not be surprised if Tesla raises more capital at that point.\n\nI consider it likely that Tesla production will increase significantly faster than 50% annual rate for the next few years, possibly with even greater emphasis on battery/cell production. We may hear something about that on Battery Day.\n\nElon mentioned a while back the goal that Tesla be able to grow even if there is a recession (and to grow much faster if there is not a recession).

Zach, you can…\n\nNote the careful answer: he answered a question whether to raise capital **to accelerate growth**. He answered in the negative, that they wouldn't have to raise capital for that purpose, because they are already primed for maximum sensible growth.\n\nNowhere does he claim that they wouldn't raise cash in other circumstances:\n\n- to grow a larger working capital buffer - like they did shortly before Covid (very sensibly I have to say),\n- or to opportunistically take advantage of stock price appreciation - like they did recently when TSLA broke $500/share.\n\nI'm pretty sure we'll be hearing about increased capex plans during Battery Day - the expansion of cell production is **not** cheap - and these are new expansion plans not affected by their comments ~8 months ago.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I was not tricked.

Good lord no, they sell them as soon as they appear). In less than a year, Model Ys are being manufactured with both front and back of body-in-white cast in a piece each in a factory filled to the brim with German automation tech, and for once they won't arrive by way of the Panama canal. They will be cranked out to a consumer base that is making do with Renault Zoes and software-bricked ID.3s and $70k i-Paces and e-Trons while their children make fun of them for getting any of those instead of a Tesla, and they will be selling for an extremely competitive price. Honestly, ID.3 is a fine car at a great price but since battery supply is so constrained for even VW (enough battery contracts for 1.5 million EVs by 2025?? Where is the other 10M cars they could sell if that wasn't an issue?) all of the really great EVs are going to by flying off the lots with no demand constraints until the entire battery industry can actually supply several TWhs per year a decade or two from now.

This caused a little consternation, and some rather good discussion, in my opinion. There was also friction between a few users, now mostly resolved.\n\nIn a [comment earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/iw9wrd/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_september_20_2020/g5zpbn4/), they brought up another point of discussion which was substantially less well-received, and got a fair bit more friction between them and another user. After some other problems that I'm going to kindly call \"misunderstandings\" between the various people, /u/upvotemeok was temp-banned. This was received very badly.\n\nAfter that, a few other users were also banned (/u/bjornbr1, /u/love2fuckbearthroat, and /u/YukonBurger specifically for personal attacks and then asking for a ban) for the comments they made expressing their displeasure. At this point, tensions were very high, and things were written that shouldn't have been on all sides.\n\nThankfully, calmer minds have prevailed and he's decided to reverse all of the bans from the day.

I think they underestimated how expectations of safety would be from the public. Uber shut down all their testing in California after they killed someone with their driverless car, the test driver was just found guilty of negligent homicide. Tesla is playing it safe and it's taking longer.\n\nSo EAP looks like a new middle tier of autonomy. Full autonomy may take a little longer and they can package their current features pretty nicely into a Level 2 Autonomy system.

Maybe partly that they feel they made FSD a bit too expensive early on and are seeing dropping FSD order numbers. \n\nAlthough underlying motivation could be, \n\nThey realized FSD is going to take a long time. If they could have fully self-driving cars in 3 months, nobody would want this half tier when they see how cool that is. If FSD will slowly get more features over next couple years then it would make sense as like \"Get what's available today\" vs \"Invest in future FSD features that will cost more in the future\"\n\nThe timing with the talked about Autopilot rewrite is a bit interesting. If it's a big fundamental change that would make it so different from what's available today, you could split it up into \"Legacy Autopilot\", \"Next-gen Autopilot\". Right now only difference is the stop sign and traffic stop and from what I've seen, that's kinda \"meh\" of a feature with the confirmation. They need to add something big to FSD to justify the 2x price. Although...If they want to pump Q3 numbers a bit making EAP super attractive for a while would make sense.

{"title": "Battery day is checkmate for fossil fuels", "selftext": "A lot of this post is speculation based on the leaks of the battery design, so keep that in mind.\n\nElon’s been stressing for months how big of a deal battery day will be. He’s not hyping. The tech they are releasing is a big fucking deal and the death knell for the fossil fuel industry.\n\nImages leaked of a cell that’s been estimated to have 5x the volume of their 2170 cell used in model 3, leverages dry electrode manufacturing technology from Maxwell, and features a tabless design. Let’s break this down:\n\n1) Power density.\nWhen Tesla moved from 18650 cells in model s to 2170 cells in model 3, they increased the amps per battery by 2x bc they increased volume by half (150%). Assuming the same battery chemistry as today’s batteries, that nets you a 16x increase in amperage per cell over the 2170. Expand that to the battery pack level (and account for the reduction in number of cells while maintaining voltage) and you get ~800-900 ampHrs per pack at the same voltage, a 4x improvement over current model 3 at 215 ampHrs.\n\nYou can use this power in a few ways. One is higher torque performance, useful in a semi truck or high performance sports car. One is cost, you can use less cells by volume and achieve the same performance as the existing model 3, although this sacrifices range (we’ll get there). The big one is higher charging speeds. The new batteries can charge 4x faster. 30 min charge to 5-10 min charge. You also get higher recapture rate from the breaking/energy recovery system. Tesla can waste less energy breaking the car and reuse more than ever before.\n\n2) Energy density.\nTesla will be using dry electrode technology in their new cells. Numbers have not been leaked here, we’ll have to wait until battery day to get the details. But the concept is important to understand regardless. Not only does a dry electrode increase energy density per cell, the technology also simplifies manufacturing and extends the charge/recharge life of the battery. I would not be surprised to see that this new tech enables a million mile battery.\n\n3) What’s tabless?\nNormally, electricity in a battery must travel in circles around the inside of the battery until it reaches the outside and can be discharged. Tabless design allows Tesla to suck energy directly from anywhere in the cell.\n\nThis reduces heat substantially, which means the same cooling system can be used to cool a bigger cell.\n\nAnd if you know anything about thermodynamics, you know that heat = inefficiency in energy usage. Tabless design, therefore, will bring an increase in energy density of the cell because you don’t lose as much to heat. While maintaining cost parity in battery management systems. Big deal.\n\nTabless also allows up to 10x current increase from the cell, because you can pull and put energy anywhere equally. So now you’re looking, at same range as today, a 40x increase in available amps if they use the same volt to amp ratio in their pack design as they do today.\n\n4) Pack internal redesign.\nI’m going to skip the gritty details of how the ratio between amps and volts work, but the high level version is that more batteries in series means more volts. More batteries in parallel means more amps. Got it?\n\nObviously, Tesla has no use for the level of amps they can pull under the current design. It’s just not practical. So let’s redesign the internals.\n\nIf instead of maintaining the same series/parallel ratio as the model 3, Tesla will lean more heavily on series and put less batteries in parallel. Why? Because now you can increase the voltage available across the pack and not waste the stupid level of amps where they aren’t necessary.\n\nOkay so why does that matter? Because more amps means a thicker charging cable. Elon has also been talking about actively cooled charging cables for the supercharging stations. If you can increase the voltage into the battery on the charging side, you can maintain the 5-10min charge time without massively increasing the thickness of the charging cable and handle the heat by actively cooling the charging cable.\n\nAre you putting the pieces together yet...\n\nCOST:\nWhat does this mean for the bottom line? Nothing short of monumental.\n\nFirst, let’s disregard dry electrode and tabless. Purely on cell numbers, you see a 80% decrease in cell cost per pack. Between model s and model 3, Tesla was able to manufacture cells for the same price and was therefore able to reduce the cost of the pack. If they can do it again, that means an 80% reduction in cell cost and ~8% reduction in price of the car.\n\nReintroducing the dry electrode and tabless, some of this will no doubt contribute to their ability to produce the cells at the same price, but the innovations in manufacturing from Maxwell point at a cheaper price per cell than parity. There’s no numbers here, so I’m going to bump the reduction in car cost to 10%.\n\nThere’s a bunch of little things as well. Cell to pack instead of cell to module to pack is a small improvement on manufacture and reduces the weight of the car. Vertically integrated production is again, a small improvement that mostly pays out in reliability, innovation speed, and economies of scale.\n\nAdd all this together, Tesla is looking at an overall price reduction of 10-12% per vehicle, and the vehicles will last much longer at initial range.\n\n——\n\nICE is fucked. The $40k model 3 is now $35k. The $35k model 3, which today is impractical, suddenly can be dropped closer to 32k and be made practical. The vehicles last longer than 10 years at peak performance with very low maintenance. The semis outcompete every existing semi by a wide margin. The roadster can go sub 1.8. \n\nThe energy storage division can handle equivalent loads for 20-40% less. Say goodbye to natural gas peaker plants. Solar + battery all of a sudden is at parity or below fossil fuel based electricity generation.

The purpose of the post was to gather information and speculation about a potential **EXPLOSIVE DREAM SHAKER** options play.\n\nFirst I would like to address the naysayers and conspiracies that have arised in the wake of a ***frustrating*** quad witching/bloody/currency fluctuating trading day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p1tut46xdo51.jpg?width=622&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5eda1b638655ec8708ed985290831aec3d3d9933\n\n“**Multiple People**”\n\nFor full transparency, the DD post was written by me, however three of my trading friends kept sending me links and DD that they were finding. So while there is some truth to your statement, it is nowhere near as sinister as imagined. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nfcxu287xdo51.jpg?width=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5550e115d1eeeac654ee683624668d5b50dc2b22\n\n**“The Awards”**\n\nI have no idea why people dump money on awards. Personally I think it is gay and I would rather put that money in a VALE yolo. When the post initially went live, all was well and it was on it’s way to being #1. People were praising me as “DD god” and the comments piling in. About 6 hours after the post went live, it started to get “lost” behind other satire posts and low quality content. I was confused as to why because the post seemed like it was getting a lot of traction and appreciation. (97% upvote ratio) My theory is that somehow it was being pushed down. I have no evidence for this claim but this could explain the crazy award to like ratio. \n\n**“Boofin on Vyvanse”**\n\nCan confirm this is accurate. The smoke on the west coast makes going outside very uncomfortable (coming from someone who doesn’t like huddling indoors) I decided to start writing the DD at 1am. Wrote an outline. Woke up for the market open, spent 16 hours writing it and not trading. Read over it and then decided to post the next day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tz63hl9xdo51.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d17e9915eab55b60127d708bcd0f9e465d37dab9\n\nu/nanaboostme\n\nu/nanaboostme has been my biggest follower since I posted the $VALE DD. He/She believes that I am the “elaborate RKT post”. \n\n* At the time of RKT chatter, I was working overtime and had no time to play options. I never even saw the RKT post.\n* Never once have I traded RKT or even had it on my watchlist\n* u/nanaboostme has no evidence to support his claim. Unless we are doing guilty until proven innocent in WSB, I do not think I need to say more.\n\n**\"Outsider\"**\n\n[Video of me doing a flip in the rain](https://imgur.com/4jTsmXi)\n\n**“Unprofitable Theta Gang Ploy”**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fj5a22ucxdo51.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b4a64e75506b6c4e5e8f37b149385f5d9ee83b8\n\nSince the inception of the VALE DD post, the day of, ***NO*** new contracts in the 9/25 chain have been opened. O/I stayed at 2863 and volume was some outrageous 30,000-40,000. Selling theta on those would have granted you a whopping 0.0083% return before option fees. My portfolio also shows I have no short calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwl2legexdo51.jpg?width=1664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=674ddc115083a35d2bc5db837aeb1a6f3d5cd0f0\n\n**PRPL Vibes**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg84n8iixdo51.jpg?width=1082&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ea009c681e20cf9dbfd7341e73b15b51c43d95a\n\nI am aware that there are legitimate pump and dump schemes that pass through r/wallstreetbets quarterly. I usually do not buy into DD posts. It's not my style. It can work very well though as seen with VALE on 9/17/2020. In fact I was the one who called Tanker gangs bluff, they had run too hard into ER and it was so predictable The post has since been deleted but I commented my take on it and got downvoted to earth's core.\n\n**“When they send pumpers, they’re not sending their best, folks”**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9oera5sjxdo51.jpg?width=1081&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1d209998b992d67a0cd095007e340fff2e4872c\n\nu/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY warns “be careful who you take “advice” from”. My post is educational and entertaining. No where in the post did I rush readers to BUY IN QUICK or to ACT FAST. I even had a disclaimer at the bottom:\n\n“ disclaimer: none of this is financial advice, this is for educational and entertainment purposes only. nothing in this post should be construed as financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any sort of security or investment.”\n\n**Why did** u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY **post this?**\n\nThe night of 9/17/20, I wanted to create humor around the culture of $VALE GANG, so I made a video post titled “[$VALE GANG TRAILER](https://www.reddit.com/user/ExtraEgg/comments/ivcga3/vale_gang_trailer/)”. This was shadowbanned from the subreddit and was only viewable if you had a direct link. :/\n\nI end up deleting the post and telling my friend to post it. Everyone is loving it, tons of feedback, medals, upvotes. WSB comradery was at an all time high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u9apc8nxdo51.jpg?width=918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40da4139771c904b5742bda9b9a526a7333505f4\n\nThen suddenly we notice the post is not available on the Top, Hot, sort by new. Nowhere to be found. A couple minutes later it was outright deleted. I message a couple mods, no response. My friend who posted $VALE GANG TRAILER got *banned* from r/wallstreetbets.\n\n**Quote a fallen soldier**\n\n\"On the pinned “advice” post, Mods heavily implied with only omission of name that Vale was a pump and dump and attacked my credibility and motives, when pressed in the comments they backtracked. Saying that my post was well made and they had no issues with it, however this is not true. I was shadow banned for my post and refused explanation from mods at all.\"[From this youtube video](https://youtu.be/VOhModuPCno)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gy05m6qxdo51.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9de21b20ff00b3c39abd81956a9d7cd37760ee2b\n\nThen u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY posts his pinned post about being wary with “advice”. I get to respond once in the comments. A couple minutes later u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY responds and *locks* the post. This was the start of the chaos.\n\nAlso, the VALE DD post was buried as well, bad algo? Or jealous mods? Only assuming because the conversation was cut short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Video not on hot](https://imgur.com/n2EEzib)(videos were being (fucky) [Video not on day top](https://imgur.com/zv5CKpF) \n\n**“He’s a Fraud!”**\n\nAfter u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY’s post went live, I was bombarded with naysayers and angry individuals. No, I am *not* selling you those dirt cheap contracts. No, I am not working for Goldman Sachs. No, I am not using WSB to bring volume into an options chain. One of my main reasons for entry in $VALE was the unusual activity coming from whales. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbru0bttxdo51.jpg?width=1036&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc3da2d913c8ed5fe6e9c8a1eb9087087c8c9609\n\nThe 1/15/21 chain was especially flooded with whale volume. I will explain the updated whale activity down below in the DD. I am still holding my positions and do not need WSB to pump my contracts. I’m relying on a price action movement to bring intrinsic value into my contract. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!\n\n[**Shifting burden of persuasion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_burden_of_persuasion)\n\nWhen I am accused of shilling/pumping/being an outsider/pumping/baiting/selling contracts to buyers, the need for evidence or fact is absent. There is no evidence that indicates I was intentionally posting the DD with sinister motives. However, now that I am on my heels with no factual claims being made, I have to rewrite the constitution to prove my innocence. If a Mod wants to remove/shadowban, ideally they must have some evidence in order to do so. Otherwise their range of power is larger than acceptable. They could ban or *not ban* anything without justification or evidence. If abused this is a very dangerous system of management. The Mods shift the burden of persuasion on the author who is banned from the subreddit and has no platform to preach. Technically what I am doing is against WSB rules. Posting on an alt account if your main is banned. I had to deliver though, too many eager eyes waiting for this follow up. To conclude, WSB ban policy needs to be reworked.\n\n**If my credibility is restored, continue to read the updated DD**\n\n**What was missed in first post**\n\nA theory was floating around that the $5 billion in debt that [VALE paid off](https://www.reuters.com/article/vale-brazil-debt/brazils-miner-vale-to-pay-creditors-and-reset-revolving-credit-lines-filing-idUKL1N2GB0SA), was funded by Tesla. The debt was disbursed in March 2020, during the covid crash. $2 billion was due by June 2022 and $3 billion was due December 2024. Tesla raised $5 billion capital through shares. Tesla said they intend to use the cash to “strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes”. That is a pretty broad statement. An analyst from Roth Capital partners said “They will need cash for all the facilities they are building, and **new growth initiatives**,”([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-stock/tesla-launches-5-billion-capital-raise-tapping-in-on-share-surge-idUSKBN25S4W2))\n\nThe connection people were making, is that Tesla raised capital to give Vale. Both articles wet public within 24 hours of each other.\n\n“**VALE DRILLING :(”** \n\nYes but no. After a shoot up in the morning, VALE fell for a couple of reasons\n\n* Entire Market was bloody\n* Quad witching madness\n* Exchange rate fluctuations\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb0perowxdo51.jpg?width=368&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00ecbba08c28d7205431ceeb9818929d7fd635c2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flfiv9gxxdo51.jpg?width=692&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0544f56dfcb616ec78000761467f01be4bb766ca\n\nClose price on the brazilian exchange was 61.66/5.3876 =$11.44 \n\nThis is why after hours, VALE was hanging around 11.44 but now the dip is being bought so it is back up to $11.59. **What to take away:** Vales down movement today was closer to -0.69%. The rest was currency fluctuation. A little unfortunate but that’s what we get for playing a brazilian rock farm.**What were the whales doing?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syidbj4zxdo51.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc4710c842fecef2e411c94adc45cc716225bcb\n\nToday from market open until 9:55, ALL the FlowAlgo was bullish\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whales were also buying into the 10/16 call contracts HARD. I’m cautiously optimistic. While the Najarian brothers live by following the Smart Money, it seems like it could be a lure. \n\nWhales probably know we love VALE and they saw the 10/16 chain was empty, so they got in and are going to price fix it now, like how you would price fix the market in FIFA Ultimate Team. \n\n10/16 also does not cover any earnings or special dates, just random. \n\nToday was another high volume day for shares and options. \n\nVolume: 46,142,890\n\nOptions volume \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrgkxkc1ydo51.jpg?width=829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24178d0e093b3238131d6efb2f93796ca9eca61e\n\nWhile the general sentiment among the options chain is bullish, there was an increase in p/c ratio for O/I\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeqg7c34ydo51.jpg?width=204&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=007805ab2c362fb12a8f8435c755a5b141921c26\n\nWhat this means is that the majority of trading was bullish today. Roughly 1 put was traded for every 11 calls. However, the open interest is now showing Roughly 1.17 puts exist for every 1 call. Whether these are “sell to open” puts is another question. The general sentiment in the options chain is still bullish. P/C ratio can be very misleading, going into ERIC Q2, the P/C was 11. That means there were 11 puts for every 1 call. ERIC beat earnings and then gapped up. \n\nMy reaction to today’s movement was the following. A perfect day to scare retail traders away, \n\nFriday nerves holding into the weekend combined with a currency fluctuation. Buy low, sell high. \n\nI bought more positions today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What’s keeping me bullish?**\n\nEverything from my initial DD post and some new information is keeping me bullish. VALE is not a meme stock. They are pretty well established and very large, just underlooked by retail. Whales continuing to pile in is keeping me bullish, along with the sneaky upgrades from Thursday and [Friday](https://zolmax.com/investing/vale-nysevale-upgraded-by-zacks-investment-research-to-strong-buy/4807283.html).\n\nGIGA metals is extremely bearish right now, CEO and Execs sold shares at the top and they have been getting beat down for three straight days.\n\n**Najarian** is very outspoken about his VALE position on CNBC. 2 days in a row he mentioned it. He is both long stock and long calls.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VALE EV PRESENTATION 2018**\n\nA lot of good information on demand for nickel was in [Vale’s presentation](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/presentations-webcast/PresentationsWebcastsDocs/BofA%20-%20May%202018%20-%20Bob%20Morris%20vFinal_i.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkp7yuv6ydo51.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4306c23d6f37d697c8af77145f0ce1827711ddb\n\nThe Nickel demand in 2018 was benchmarked at 38 in comparison to a 260/590 (conservative/upside) by 2025 and 890/1700 by 2030.\n\nNickel demand for batteries wass 3% of the market in 2017. It is projected to be 37% of the market in 2030. \n\nVale gives a disclaimer that the variance of range is 50% to the upside and 50% to the conservative side. \n\nThis growth alone is reason to long VALE.\n\n**WSB comments**\n\nBecause I am banned, I cannot see the comments anymore. However, their were some interesting comments in the original VALE DD post. Those that I recall are\n\n* Friend works at VALE, can’t say anything but I am holding a lot of calls\n* Apparently, there was a meeting in toronto between VALE and Tesla\n* Someone said that he orders 70k every month (or year I forgot) from VALE and they are a good company \n\nInterpret how you will, comments could be fake.\n\n**Ex Dividend date**\n\nMany expressed concern that the ex dividend date would be devastating for the 9/25 calls. This is true, but at the same time if the big news comes out on batteryday/ex date. The price action could plow through ex date. This is also why I have longer expiration calls.\n\nIn Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, they mentioned the word “nickel” that alone was enough to get the mining stocks to move up.\n\n**If nothing happens**\n\nIf there is no mention of VALE or nickel on battery day, the stock will be hard to dump because VALE has 5 billion outstanding shares. Compared to LAC, who rallied 10% on Friday, the have 90 million outstanding shares.\n\n**THE TWEETS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un5h51t8ydo51.jpg?width=364&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a1cf38a9dbc056e7d4863b48affe5b0ce27fa03\n\n“Speedrunning Factorio in real life …”\n\nFactorio’s game description\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw68pm5aydo51.jpg?width=544&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62feefd344e670b72d0009e926e425774eb609cf\n\n**I rest my case**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nVALE has potential for explosive movement on 9/22.

However, nickel sulphides mines of size are located in two countries, Canada and Russia.\n\nMiners are now faced with incredible ESG pressure from major institutional funds. They want the supply chain to be clean. So forget about Norilsk in Russia. That leaves Canada. Major Canadian nickel mines are owned by Vale (ex INCO), Glencore (ex Falconbridge by way of Noranda and then Xstrata) and finally, to a much lower extent, KGHM (ex FNX by way Quadra).\n\nGlencore is also an ESG nightmare and wants to return to being a trading company. KGHM is a Polish government run basket case trying to run a Chilean copper porphyry.\n\nThat leaves Vale, which ain't much better than the rest (see the Brazilian dam disasters).

In regards to NILSY vs VALE though, I don't think one has a significantly stronger environmental record than the other. NILSY started a significant effort to modernize and reduce pollution a couple of years ago. As far as metals basket, I believe NILSY derives a larger percentage of total revenues from Ni than VALE. Also, VALE has large exposure to iron ore, while NILSY is roughly evenly split between Pd, Ni, and Cu. In the automotive space, NILSY's metals basket provides a natural hedge. Pd is used in pollution-control catalysts of ICE and HEVs, while Ni and Cu content is aimed to BEVs. NILSY is also a significant producer of Pt which finds use in FCEVs. IMO NILSY is a better play than VALE if the goal is to profit from the transition in the ground transport space. One last point about Ni... The dominant use of the metal is in SS (stainless steel production), where NPI (nickel pig iron) is a lower cost alternative to pure nickel as an input, but high SS demand will drive up pure Ni prices if NPI supply is lacking. As the SS market goes so largely does Ni at this juncture.

This investment is part of BASF’s €400 million multi-step investment plan announced last year and builds upon initial battery materials production started in Harjavalta in 2018.
