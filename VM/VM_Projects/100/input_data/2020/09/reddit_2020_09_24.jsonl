Because most things have a beta to SPX, banks go around buying up tiny delta puts (think .05-.15 contracts) that expire the following Friday to replace the downside hedge that's rolling off that day.

They have to do this due to post-2008 regulations around solvency (but it's kinda a good idea, regardless).\n\nSo instead of thinking about this in terms of delta, think of it in terms of premium spend. 40k (qty) * .03 (contract) * 100 (mult) is 120k. They're spending 120k in insurance, which could easily balloon to over 10mm ($2.5 a contract) if the stock falls hard.

In no way does a combination of price going up, time passing by and IV going up mean that the option price went up because delta, down because theta and up because vega. The price will only go where someone is willing to buy it, and the greeks *attempt* to estimate that.. but it's never a guarantee because then someone would exploit a guarantee until it's no longer a guarantee.. ah, the beauty of a free market.\n\nGlad I could teach you guys something today.. should you choose to believe it.

Judging by the number of upvotes they received, OP was not alone -- which reinforces the need for clarification.\n\nIt was clear because OP phrased the question in a particular way and I responded in a topical way.\n\nFrom your phrasing, I don't understand your intention.

MM has hedging needs that can be partially fulfilled by buying a net sell order.\n\nAnother way to see it is by noting the response time. BID/ASK starts off with its usual spread and the center moves with underlying in the usual way. Often, the moment you submit an order in between the spread -- ie. either moving BID up or moving ASK down -- your order is filled. That means, in the former case, ASK moved down, and in the latter, BID moved up. In other words, someone responded to the change in order book. When that response is near instantaneous, what's the odds of it being peer trader in a low volume environment?

{"title": "How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.", "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nThis will be long, but it will also be concise, and is filled with information. Do yourself a favor and read it thoroughly. Don't complain that I got something wrong if you only skimmed the post.\n\nI've been studying options for years, and have read great books such as OAASI cover to cover. In other words, I know some shit. My goal here is to impart a simple strategy that can significantly outperform a \"buy and hold\" strategy on any major index, both so you can make tendies SAFELY, but also to rub it in the faces of those no-nothing /r/investing types who shun options.\n\nOne final note before we begin. I realize you can potentially increase returns on this strategy by utilizing margin to sell naked options and such... but I don't want to advocate a strategy that could blow up retards accounts. What I will advocate here is a 100% cash strategy and has no risk of a margin call.\n\n**This strategy is necessarily no riskier than buying and holding an index fund.**\n\nIf you insist on using margin to increase your returns, I would suggest simply using margin to own double the amount of assigned and held stock, in order to sell double the number of covered calls. This is a relatively safe way to increase returns.\n\n# The Wheel: An IMPROVED \"Buy and Hold\" Strategy\n\nForget credit spreads, diagonal spreads, iron condors, and all that often complicated jazz. The absolute best and simplest theta gang strategy, in my humble opinion, is The Wheel. But I'm going to argue for a very specific version of The Wheel here, and that makes all the difference.\n\nWhile spreads can be effective, we want to maximize returns by collecting FULL PREMIUM for options, and not hedging like a pussy.\n\n**When you think about The Wheel, I want you to picture an IMPROVED \"buy and hold\" strategy.**\n\nThe tried and true advice of most financial advisors out there is to drop cash in something like an index fund and forget about it. While this is good and all, we can clearly do better, by utilizing options. What we are attempting here is to mimic a \"buy and hold\" strategy, while consistently augmenting returns by collecting option premium on top.\n\nThe Wheel is a simple concept. You sell cash-secured puts and collect premium. If you ever get assigned, you hold and sell covered calls on the assigned stock. If your stock ever gets called away, you go back to selling puts. Rinse and repeat, ad infinitum.\n\nThe question of which options to sell and why gets complicated, and I will go into details below, but for simplicity I am advocating simply sticking to 30-45 DTE \\~0.30 delta options on major ETFs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vntvxqycv5p51.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b92bc6d4ecc345f07f4bf09ca2fd4f3f954f85\n\n# The Basic Concept\n\nYou want to get PAID to buy stock at a CHEAP price. You can do that by selling OTM cash-secured puts. And you want to get PAID to sell stock at a HIGH price. You can do that by selling OTM covered calls. When you understand this basic concept, you understand 90% of this strategy.\n\nThis will outperform \"buy and hold\" for two reasons: 1) It collects option premium on top of stock appreciation, 2) It reduces the cost basis for potential stock purchases. These factors also ensure reduced volatility compared with \"buy and hold,\" as both premium and reduced entry points offer downside protection from falling assets. This is inherently a long-term strategy; if you are unwilling to hold an ETF long-term through a drop or even a recession, don't waste your time... you WILL lose money.\n\nWhen I've looked for counter-arguments to The Wheel strategy, the common argument I hear is \"it works until it doesn't.\" In other words, these people argue that if you run The Wheel on a stock that drops hard and doesn't recover, you will lose money.\n\n**This argument completely falls apart if you run The Wheel on INDEX ETFs.**\n\nSPY and other major indices have recovered from every crash they have ever experienced. Individual stocks like Enron have not. If we want to mimic a conservative \"buy and hold\" strategy WITH diversification, we will only play major ETFs. This eliminates the major argument against The Wheel entirely, since it achieves instant diversification and will mimic the broader market. If you think the US economy will crash and never recover, you should be buying guns and ammo and not options.\n\nThe only REAL argument against The Wheel is that you could potentially lose out on stock appreciation during heavy bull runs. While this is true, we will show below that this argument doesn't hold much weight.\n\n# Calculating Returns\n\nIt is relatively simple to calculate potential returns for this strategy, so I will do that now using option prices on SPY as of 9/24/2020. Keep in mind IV is currently high, and so these returns will be inflated relative to a calmer market. Also keep in mind that annualizing returns based on one-month results can get wonky. *This is just an example to get a picture of how things work.*\n\nThere are two phases to this strategy: Selling CSP's and selling CC's. We will calculate each separately, using 30 DTE options and ignoring compounding for simplicity.\n\n**CSP Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**\n\n\\[(CSP premium \\* 100 shares) / collateral\\] \\* 12 months = Return\n\n\\[($5.30 \\* 100) / $31,000\\] \\* 12 = **20.5% return**\n\n**CSP Return (Aggressive ATM/0.50 delta):**\n\n\\[(9.00 \\* 100) / $32,000\\] \\* 12 = **33.7% return**\n\n**CC Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**\n\nS&P500 return + \\[(CC premium \\* 100 shares) / collateral\\] \\* 12 months = Return\n\nS&P500 return + \\[($4.12 \\* 100) / $32,500\\] \\* 12 = **S&P return + 15.5%**\n\nNow there are a few caveats for the above calculations. The first is that if the S&P500 rallies well past our CC strike price, we will lose out on those potential gains. This means the CC-side return for the S&P is capped, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n**Maximum CC Return:**\n\n\\[(Strike price - stock price) \\* 100 shares + (CC premium \\* 100 shares)\\] / collateral = Return (one month)\n\n\\[($334 - $325) \\* 100 + ($4.12 \\* 100)\\] / $32,500 = **4.0% (48% annualized)**\n\nBy reversing this we can calculate how much SPY would have to rise to outperform us.\n\n$325 \\* 1.04 = $338\n\nIn other words, if SPY rises more than $13 in one month it will outperform us, but only for THAT MONTH. Obviously the S&P doesn't achieve 48% returns annually and so bull months will be offset by flat and bear months. We will outperform the S&P in both those categories as shown above, which will more than make up the difference in lost potential gains.\n\nOne final note: These calculations assume that all options are held until expiration. In practice, returns can be increased by closing winning positions early. If you achieve 70% gain in 10 days, it makes little sense to wait another 20 days to collect the remaining 30% premium. Simply close and roll as necessary.\n\n# A Guide for Smaller Accounts + Proof of Concept\n\nTo run the strategy I am advocating on SPY, you would need a minimum account size of \\~$35,000. I know a lot of you don't have that much money, so I've done a little experiment for smaller accounts.\n\nI set aside a fund to run The Wheel on smaller ETFs, such as XLE, XLF, and GDX. To run the wheel on these individually you would need an account size no bigger than \\~$4000. Even smaller ETFs such as SILJ could be run for as little as $1500, though they are more risky and less liquid. To prove the concept for smaller accounts, I set aside $10,000 and ran smaller ETFs such as these for 4 months.\n\n**After 4 months, I achieved a 41% annualized return. This outperformed the SPY ETF during the same period by around 5%, despite the fact the ETFs utilized underperformed relative to SPY. This, in my view, provides some proof of concept.**\n\nObviously this return would have dropped significantly during this recent market drop, which is why I stopped running the strategy on the 18th, to avoid losing my own money just for proof of concept. The best strategy will always be adaptive to market conditions, but if you want a one-size-fits-all approach, The Wheel is probably the best you can get.\n\nIn one instance I used margin to purchase an additional 100 shares of SILJ to sell a second CC for \"free\" (minus margin costs), just to offer an example of how margin can be safely used to increase returns. I also sold ATM options on SILJ shares because I wanted to dump it quickly before the crash, and to collect higher premiums. Got very lucky and sold right before the drop on Monday. This is an example of how to adapt the strategy based on your market predictions.\n\nHere is a complete breakdown of my trades during this 4 month period. **Notice that I usually closed positions early in order to increase my $/day return.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v80b50jfv5p51.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=469d57e6bcce2c51641a211801d5997f05675e4b\n\n# A Note on Past Wheel Guides\n\nA prominent past guide on running The Wheel argued that you should always avoid assignment. However, they never made a compelling case for WHY you should avoid assignment. There is an argument to be made for such a position, which I will provide soon. However, there are also a number of arguments to be made in favor of accepting or even seeking assignment. They run as follows:\n\n1. Time Premium is maximized when the strike price is ATM. If we are selling time premium (Theta), selling ATM will tend to maximize premium returns long-term.\n\n[Apparently this picture didn't exist on the internet until now...](https://preview.redd.it/16ijbdsgv5p51.jpg?width=4608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb7fda8a060de84719695afc98c09f8bb7f644f9)\n\n2) If we are bullish on an Index long-term, we shouldn't have any problem accepting stock ownership. In fact, it will likely increase our returns due to stock appreciation on top of option premium.\n\n3) Stock can be more easily owned on margin than options. Holding double the stock on margin and selling twice as many covered-calls will outperform selling cash-secured puts long-term.\n\nThese past guides also focused on running The Wheel on individual stocks. I have so far not yet seen a guide advocating The Wheel purely on Index ETFs to mimic and outperform a \"buy and hold\" diversified strategy. **This is perhaps the most important takeaway from this guide.**\n\n# Maximizing Returns: ATM vs. OTM?\n\nThis strategy is simple enough... Where it gets complicated is in the details. And the most difficult question of all is whether to sell ATM, or OTM, and if so how deep?\n\nLet's start with the absolute ideal scenarios...\n\n**In a bull market: You want to sell ATM puts and OTM calls.**\n\n**In a bear market: You want to sell OTM puts and ATM calls.**\n\n**In a completely flat market: You want to sell ATM puts and ATM calls.**\n\nThe reasoning is simple. If the market is rising, you want to maximize premium on your puts by selling ATM. You also want OTM calls so you don't lose out on gains in stock appreciation when the price rises. The ideal depth for OTM calls would be just above the total underlying appreciation (which obviously is difficult to predict in advance).\n\nBy the same token, if the market is falling, you want to sell OTM puts for downside protection against assignment, and you want to sell ATM calls to maximize premium.\n\nIn a flat market you simply want to maximize premium and have no need for upside or downside protection, and so ATM will perform best.\n\nIf you are brilliant and prescient like me, you can navigate these complicated waters and adapt to the market accordingly. If you are a retard, on the other hand, you can't easily predict where the market is headed...\n\nIn that case, my advice is the following:\n\nALWAYS SELL OTM ON BOTH ENDS. This will give you downside protection from drops, and also give you upside protection from rallies. The consequence of this is your premium returns will be reduced relative to someone who strategically sells ATM options, but that is an acceptable loss for a safer and more conservative strategy if you don't know wtf you are doing. **You will still outperform \"buy and hold\" using this strategy, while also achieving reduced volatility.**\n\nAiming for selling .30 delta, or 30% Prob ITM options, seems conservative enough for me. You can adjust accordingly based on your personal risk tolerance. If you want a more conservative strategy, aim further OTM. If you want more aggressive strategy, aim closer ATM. Keep in mind you MUST be willing to hold stock long-term through a drop to make this strategy viable! If you aren't willing to actually \"buy and hold\" while selling covered calls, look to gamble elsewhere.\n\n# Other Details\n\nThe reasoning for selling 30-45 DTE options, which is advocated by TastyTrade among others, is because theta decay for ATM options accelerates around this range. However, this is only true for ATM options, and OTM options theta decay can actually decelerate closer to expiration. It is likely better to go for longer dated OTM options for this reason, though it won't make a huge difference imo. I would suggest keeping things simple and maintaining a habit around this range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3hl0wekv5p51.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e42cee750063a6932f96c151a8fb779f292467\n\nSome people attempt to run The Wheel by selling short-term weeklies/FDs. These individuals are not really selling theta so much as they are attempting to scalp gamma. While this can work, it is not really the consistent, safe, long-term strategy we are looking for here. It also suffers from the reduced theta decay for OTM options which I stated above. If you want to gamble, you might as well be BUYING the FD's, not SELLING them!\n\nI would usually close my options at 50%+ return and roll forward/up when necessary. This will tend to yield greater $/day returns if the underlying is moving in your direction. For example: If you make 80% return in 10 days, it makes little sense to hold another 20+ days for another 20% premium gain. Simply close the position and collect the secured premium to release collateral for another sell. If the underlying is moving against your direction, you generally want to hold until expiration and collect 100% of the premium, even if that means assignment. **Closing a sold option for a loss will DESTROY the returns of The Wheel! Do not do this!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is probably already too long, so I will stop here. I apologize if I've made any mistakes while writing this. Feel free to ask any questions and I will do my best to answer them!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Going to edit in important points others bring up.\n\n1. This is obviously less tax friendly than buy and hold. Running the strategy within a Roth IRA will eliminate this drawback.\n2. This strategy is very different from others such as the buy-write strategy. For one thing, the buy-write strategy rolls down for a loss, something we will never do. My exact strategy has never been backtested and probably never will.\n3. I should have made it more clear that we want to avoid selling covered calls below our initial cost-basis in the event of a drop. Ideally we will NEVER sell our shares at a loss, we will simply continue to hold and continue selling CC's until we recover in price (same as a buy and hold strategy).\n4. Something a few people are missing: The value of selling CSP's accelerates during bull runs, because they lose value faster. **However, you will only capture that faster value if you close the CSP early. This is something most \"backtested\" looks at CSP selling have not done.** Take a look carefully at the trade chart provided, and how my returns increased significantly by closing early \\~50% during the bull run. This is why I was able to outperform the S&P during the same period by almost pure CSP selling. If I had held every CSP to expiration, I likely would have underperformed the S&P.\n5. This will probably be my last edit, just wanted to quickly respond to the weaker arguments I keep hearing over and over...\n   1. \"This doesn't work because if the stock drops a lot you collect almost no premium.\" This is IDENTICAL to buy and hold!\n   2. \"This has been backtested and it doesn't beat buy and hold.\" No, my strategy has not been backtested. Similar strategies have been backtested, but this one hasn't. Show me your methodology and I will tell you how it differs from what I advocate. Or run your backtest on the same 4 months I ran the wheel and see if you get the same results I did. You won't.\n   3. \"This is stupid because you will just lose out on gains during bull runs.\" Except I literally posted results during a 4-month bull run and beat the S&P. You need an explanation for that. SPY gained 12% during those 4 months, which is not a weak rally.\n\nThanks for the overwhelmingly positive feedback everyone!

Now you sell SPY in a taxable account at a loss and then in less than 30 days (before or after) buy or sell SPY in the IRA, it could result in a disallowed wash sale.

Why avoid ~~assignment~~ closing early for a loss when ~~closing the option before expiration~~ it results in the same balance? The only reason I can think of wanting to get assigned is when you sell CSP and want to own the stock. Yes, your cash returns is destroyed but you gain that value back in the form of your stock gains.\n\n2. I see a lot of wheel strats going for the 30-45 DTE but this leaves so much room for the stock to move against you if you misjudge the market. I understand that if you end up getting assigned, then you'll have to hold it long term, but, what are your thoughts on weekly, far OTM, high volatility stock (E.G. TSLA) and closing it on 1-0DTE?\n\nSo, let's take a look at 2 example:\n\n1. 10/30 SPY $310P. Delta is 0.3 and theta is -0.14. Average price: $5.81\n\n2. 10/2 TSLA $310P. Delta is 0.079, Theta is -0.6. average price: $2.49\n\nIf I'm sitting on $31,000, why should I sell the SPY CSP over the TSLA one, seeing as how I'm getting about 4 times as much theta per day and that I'm even less likely to get assigned TSLA (though battery day did scare me a bit there). Given the numbers, I can capture about 40% of SPY's premium by holding the TSLA one for just a week. \n\nThe only incentive I see is long term stability as SPY won't tank sub $200, and will recover within the next few years if it does, but TSLA is overpriced and may drop back down to $100, and sit there for the next decade.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "> Why avoid assignment when closing the option before expiration results in the same balance?\n\nNot sure I understand what you mean... When I closed positions early it was because I had already broken the expected $/day return, and holding would have reduced my return.\n\nAs far as TSLA, you will indeed have a higher return running the wheel on that...

The only difference is, the ETF is losing value as opposed to your cash balance going down.\n\nBut, the argument for being assigned as a result of a CSP going against you is fine because stonks goes up.\n\nHowever, when you're selling a CC, I'd avoid assignment like the plague, as I'd lose cash but gain value in the ETF (or stock).

But, even with leaps, you'd still want to check in on it every day in case the world starts burning again.\n\nMy question refers to the more technical aspect of whether to get assigned or to roll out. \n\nOP mentioned to avoid rolling out if it results in a net loss, and I'm just wondering why. From a purely mathematical standpoint, you don't gain or lose anything, whether you chose to roll out or get assigned. The only difference is whether you have cash or equities. \n\nBut, in taking the net loss, you can claim that against your net gains and reduce your tax liabilities. This is especially useful when you are selling CC and rolling it out for a net loss. Here's some math.\n\nYour cost basis for stock X is $100. It's a bull market, so OP says sell OTM CC, makes sense. You sell $110C for $10. At expiration, stock X is now worth $130, the $110C is now worth $20. Do you roll out and take a $10 loss or do you get assigned and must sell your stock X for $110? Regardless of which decision you make, your balance will be $120. \n\n1. Roll out. You borrow $10, and with the $10 from the sale of your CC, you  close the CC for a net loss of $10. You keep your stock, which is worth $130. Your balance is $130-$10 = $120 ($130 in equity and $10 in debt).\n2. Get assigned. You sell your stock for $110, and with the $10 from the CC sale, you now have $120 in cash. \n\nIn scenario 1, you have a realized loss of $10 that you can now apply to any future gains.\n\nIn scenario 2, you have a realized gain of $20 ($10 from the sale of the CC and $10 from the sale of the stock) that you'll have to pay taxes on at the end of the year. \n\nDespite both scenario leaving you with the same balance, scenario 1 is better for tax purposes (unless you don't have any realized gains to claim that against, in which case RIP), but OP says to avoid taking realized losses and just get assigned.

The realized loss will offset any realized gains you have for tax purposes, and you just keep your stock. \n\nNow, this isn't an \"always do this\" situation, because you might feel like your stock or ETF of choice has gone too high and is overbought, and will correct over the next week or so, then you can let it get sold off to claim your realized gains over the duration that you held the stock (even better if you're getting long term cap gains off of it).

Thanks for showing us this but I’m a little confused. Let’s say you want to do the wheel in a hypothetical situation- you want to do a 30day wheel on spy. Let’s say spy is $100 and you start the wheel by buying 100 shares averaging $100. According to your graph, we would buy puts covered by the 100 shares. Let’s say we are bullish for the sake of the example. We sell a $95 out for 3 dollars, meaning 300 dollar premium. Spy closes on day 29 at 90 dollars. This means you’re gonna be assigned and you’re gonna lose 500 dollars, since you’re buying 100 shares at a 500 dollar loss. So now you say “sell covered calls” for at the price or more expensive. So that means we’d be selling a $95 spy call another 30 days out. Let’s say we get $1 per share for that. This would mean we’re getting $100, netting us $100 loss. \n\nBut here’s what’s confusing. If we are bullish, why are you selling covered calls OTM if you’re down?
