No, it has lower margins.\n\nOr the process... they're not stuck at 14nm because they've had chips at 10nm out for some time. And their density is actually equivalent to TSMC's 7nm process.

NVidia has about 1/5 the revenue of Intel, BTW.\n\nWhat you and folks like you don't understand is that not only is Intel's process not that bad, as I explained above, but process is just one component of their overall products. Other two key elements are architecture and scale. Intel's architecture produces faster cores, that's a fact. AMD beats them with number of cores, but most real-world workloads are inherently tied to singe core performance. \n\nAnd scale. As Intel's revenue shows, they're selling lots of chips. Chips at volumes which TSMC can't produce for AMD. It doesn't matter that AMD has a better halo chip that they have a few (comparatively speaking) to sell from, when the world needs volume.

{"title": "Why the Poor Man's Covered Call is the most consistently profitable strategy in existence:", "selftext": "\\>Listen up retards, I want you to start making legitimate low risk guaranteed returns. This strategy if done correctly is actually the most profitable theta strategy, and the only one that can generate more then 70% if your investment consistently every month.    \n\n\\>Quick Steps on how to do it and the TLDR is at the end, although i recommend reading through my explanation    \n\n\\>Ok if you‚Äôre still reading we‚Äôll need to establish a few things. A covered call is when you own 100 shares of a stock, and you sell a call against your position.     \n\n\\>So basically if I own 100 shares of spy right now, I can sell a call at 335 giving the right to the buyer of the call to buy my 100 shares at 335 each, in exchange they will give me a premium to have that right, and hence I make money. This strategy works when you‚Äôre expecting the stock to be bearish or flat. However, if the call exercises when it is ITM, you will be forced to sell 100 shares of spy at 335 no matter what the price is.    \n\n\\>Now a poor man's covered call uses the same strategy, however using a different collateral. You see, when you buy a call, you are buying the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at an agreed upon price. Therefore lets take this example, I buy a 335 call on spy, if I exercise it, I can buy a 100 shares of spy for 335 each. Now this right gives us incredible leverage, because we are able to do this, at the same time we can sell another call, such a 335 call. Now if the 335 call we sold is ITM and we are forced to exercise, then we exercise the call we bought, buy 100 shares for 335, and sell it to the other guy for 335, then we‚Äôre released from all of its obligation. This also applies to call you sell that are at a higher strike price then the one you‚Äôre holding, see if you‚Äôre forced to exercise, you‚Äôll make the difference in intrinsic value back as profit. Such as selling a call at the 336 strike price, if you‚Äôre forced to exercise then you‚Äôll actually make a 100$.     \n\n\\>Ok you‚Äôre with me so far? We have one more strategy to talk about, the diagonal spread. The diagonal spread is a strategy where you buy a long dated call say four months out, and sell another call at a higher strike price and shorter strike price. That way you make money from the premium of the short strike call, while simultaneously making money on the long dated call we bought.     \n\n\\>So this strategy employs these two strategies together on SPY. So let's get started to how you would set this up. First of all, you‚Äôll go to SPY, and look at the current price. Currently Spy closed at 333.91, so we will use this value for our calculations. Now the usual way to find the best long dated option to buy, is to find one that is very close to being OTM or even a dollar or two ITM. The best date is 4 months plus, because you'll have around two months of negligible theta.      \n\n\\>An important point here, the further out the better as the less theta, the more money this will generate long term. In addition, the more ITM the call is the better because it gives you more leeway, I‚Äôll explain how to use this to your advantage later.    \n\n\\>So in our case, the best call to buy, is the 333c Jan 15 2021 for 1943$. Now you buy this, and you‚Äôre a proud owner of this call, now it‚Äôs time to start selling a call against it. The closest next expiry date is sep 14. Now the 336c call is looking pretty spicey with it‚Äôs 123$ premium, so we sell it.    \n\n\\>Now a very simple plug in of the call you sold into a \\[profit calculator\\]([https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)) we see that for this call to remain over the 123$ worth spy will have to open at 337.50 or higher which is more then 4$ increase, which isn‚Äôt always likely. Now let‚Äôs go over the few scenarios that might occur:    \n\n\\>>\\* spy opens below 337.50, in which case the call will lose its value. As long as spy doesn‚Äôt close above 336, then you get to keep the premium, and if spy hovers around the current price and up to 334, the call becomes worth less then 20$, which means you can buy it back and get to keep the 100$ + difference    \n\n\\>>\\*Spy moons 9 points to 342 in one day. To close the call it would cost you 553$ as it would be worth 675. However, keep in mind that our long dated call is now worth 2397. Therefore, if we closed both options we will be at a total loss of 50$. This happens due to gamma of the short call being higher, due to it's shorter expiry date. If you had cash, you can buy back that call you sold, and lose 553 cash on hand, and be 50$ negative on your entire portfolio. Then you can turn around and sell more calls    \n\n\\>>\\*Spy has a retarded correction, or even god forbid a crash. In which case your long dated call will rapidly lose value and if spy loses more then 15% of its value, such as below 280$ then you lose 85% of the value of the spread. On the other a correction of 10%, would make the spread lose 65% of its value    \n\n\\>>It‚Äôs very important to remember, the type of equity that spy represents, which is the entire US market. For context, in the last 5 years, spy has only had 7 instances of a correction over 10% which can result in a heavy loss with this strategy. Now let‚Äôs look at the possible actions to take in every scenario.    \n\n\\>>\\*If the call has lost more then 80% of its value, or really any amount where your profits are over 120, them buy it back and close it.    \n\n\\>>\\*If the call becomes ITM and you‚Äôre forced to close it, then look at your options(no pun intended)    \n\n\\>>>\\*If you have enough cash to close it, and you don‚Äôt have any possible use for that available cash within the next two weeks then close it.     \n\n\\>>>\\*If you don‚Äôt have enough money to close the call or you‚Äôre not willing to lose that available cash, then simply close both options with either a profit or a loss depending on how had spy mooned that day.        \n\n\\>Now after you‚Äôve done this once, let‚Äôs say you were successful and the call you sold was worth less and you made premium back. Now you have more cash on hand, and you‚Äôve made money. Keep in mind, this also means more leeway, in case the next trade you might have to close the short call at a loss, either available cash loss, or net loss.     \n\n\\>Doing the math on possible profits. In a single month, you are able to sell 12 spy calls. If a spy remains flat, or has a slow upwards trend, and says on average you sell your calls at a profit of 100$, then you can make 1200$ from the spy, on a 2000$ investment. Every month, until expiry on the long call. If spy rises, then your initial call would also increase in value, resulting in extra profits when you eventually close it.     \n\n\\>\\_\\_NOW COMPARE THIS TO THE WHEEL STRATEGY\\_\\_ you would need a minimum of 33,000$ in order to buy a 100 shares of spy. Now first of all, the upfront collateral is ridiculous, and not many can afford it. If you‚Äôre asking yourself, well why can‚Äôt I use a cheaper stock, remember that only a spy has 12 contracts per month, every other etf and stock only has 4 per month. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of spy, it's more reliable in terms of premiums.    \n\n\\>Here‚Äôs the best part too, spy increasing in value won‚Äôt benefit you with the wheel strategy, as you‚Äôre forced to sell your shares at the strike price of the short call. On the other hand, let‚Äôs compare the potential losses with this strategy, If spy were to lose 10% of value down to 300, then you‚Äôll lose 3000$ vs only 1600$ with our long call. In addition, if spy keeps losing value you‚Äôll keep losing money, while your gains are capped with the long call.     \n\n\\>Thereby the obvious advantages of this strategy:    \n\n\\>>\\*We profit from spy‚Äôs increase of value and its flatness        \n\n\\>>\\*Our maximum losses are capped, and the more successful calls we sell the less our risk becomes.        \n\n\\>>\\*Our total needed collateral is a fraction of spy, at usually around 6%. Keep in mind that the same call, 333c at an expiration of sep 17 2021, a leap year call, is only 3000$, which is still only 9% of the value we‚Äôd usually need.     \n\n\\>And the best part, is how scalable this is, at an average of 100$ per contract sold profits, we can make back out entire about a month and a half, and we can buy another long contract. This way, spending 4000$, for an average return of 200$ per contract. This is ofcourse not counting our long dated calls increasing value with spy.     \n\n\\>This is to make your mouth water at the possible tendies. A 10,000$ investment, which is 5 contracts, can generate 6000$ per month on average, or even higher depending on market conditions. Keep in mind, the same amount of money, the 33,000 needed to use the wheel strategy, can generate 20,000 a month, vs the regular 1200 it can generate.    \n\n\\>Keep in mind, this only works if spy is in an flat and positive trend. To put things into perspective, it takes 1.5 months to generate enough money to buy a second contract.  Now that you‚Äôd be making double the money, that means you‚Äôll need half the time, to get the second contract, and because we‚Äôre buying the contract at a higher strike price for the same price of around 2000, we keep covering higher and higher values of spy. So the second contract takes 1.5 months, the second would take three weeks, the third would take a week and half, the fourth would take 2 option dates, and them you‚Äôll be making enough money to buy another call, every weekly option.    \n\n\\>I‚Äôll make a part 2 about how to take this strategy further if you are successful to layer calls upon calls, virtually building a tranche that becomes very profitable.     \n\n\\>So I hope you employ this strategy to start making real money, and generating actual returns that are consistent, while still basking in the glory of theta gang, without needing the ridiculous amount of collateral\n\n\\>TLDR : For the absolute retards who don't want to read but instead want to know positions: you‚Äôll need around 2000 - 2500 $ to employ this strategy correctly        \n\n\\>>\\*Buy long dated spy call, 4+ months out such as 335c Spy Jan 15 2021     \n\n\\>>\\*Then sell calls on weekly spy, 3-5$ OTM     \n\n\\>>\\*If the call you sold becomes ITM, buy it back with the cash on hand, if you can't, close both positions, and re-enter your long position at a higher strike price\n\n\\>>\\*If not, buy the call back on the expiration day when it's lost 80% + of its value    \n\n\\>>\\*Rinse and repeat    \n\n\\>>\\*You‚Äôll only be able to sell calls in this scenario, of 335c or higher, therefore if a spy's value drops where the 335c becomes worthless to sell, in this case if its value is less than a 100.

So 17.42x leverage, at the moment of purchase.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the sake of argument, let's say SPY drops from 334.06 to 300, a drop of 10.2%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you held 5.74 shares of SPY, you lose $34.06 \\* 5.74 = $195.5, because of +5.74 delta.\n\nThis is a loss of $195.5 / 1918 = 10.2%, which is to be expected for holding shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on option price calculator, for 123 days to expiry, 0.2 interest rate, 1.71% dividend yield, and assuming IV stays the same at 25.32%, \n\nthe 333 call would be priced at $6.121\\* 100 = $612.1. \n\nYou would incur a loss of 1918 - 612.1 = $1305.9\n\nThis is a loss of $1305.9 / 1918= 68%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo your argument of poor-man's covered call possibly having lower loss than holding shares, is completely incorrect. The reason why the % loss for the call is much higher, is because you are using leverage with buying calls instead of shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to your 2nd argument:\n\nYou claim that poor-man's covered call gives the holder leverage.\n\nThis is absolutely correct, but at what cost?\n\n**The collateral for selling the call is either 100 shares, or 1 call.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's say, you have $1918, but you want to buy 100 shares of SPY, to be able to sell the covered call. You need to pay 334.06 \\* 100 = $33406\n\nYou lack the fund $33406 - 1918 = $31488\n\nLet's say, **hypothetically**, you go and borrow $31488 from **your mom**, and your mom charges you 2% interest annually. (This rate is legit, as Interactive Brokers is currently charging 1.59% for margin loans)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's say, you borrow this money for 4 months, which is the expiry for the 333c.\n\nYou would pay $31488 \\* 0.02 / 12 \\* 4 = $209.92 of interest to your mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompare this cost to what you are paying with 333c.\n\nOf the $1918, (334.06 - 333) \\* 100 = $106 is the intrinsic value of the call.\n\nSo the extrinsic value is $1918 - 106 = $1812, which is the \"interest\" that you are paying by \"renting\" SPY shares for 4 months. This cost is about 9 times more than the $209.92 interest you would pay at 2%.\n\nIf we annualized this rate, 1812 / 209.92 \\* 0.02 =  17.26% is the annual \"interest\" rate\n\ni.e. Your interest rate is through the roof, comparable to taking out a loan from a credit card.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow with that being said, it is true that if you only have $1918 of capital, no one in their right mind would loan you $31488. So, poor-man's covered call, is like a very expensive loan, if you want to have a high leverage, such as 17.42x. \n\nWhile I do agree, this kind of leverage is the motto for this sub, it seems that you are actually advocating for some long term profitable strategy. And let me tell you, **paying 17.26% APR interest on a loan, is not a long term profitable strategy.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne way to offset the high interest rate, which you mentioned, is to get rid of the call early, say after 2 months to avoid theta acceleration. So if we take the expiry date to be 61 days, and assume SPY is still at $334.06, the 333c is now priced at $13.85.\n\nIf you now sell the call and roll to the next expiry, you have lost $1918 - 1385 = $533\n\nThis is the \"interest\" that you paid for \"renting\" 100 SPY shares for 2 months. \n\nIf you instead borrowed $31488 from your mom for 2 months (instead of 4 months), you would only need to pay \n\n$209.92 / 2 = $104.96 of interest to your mom.\n\nIf we compare these two, 533 / 104.96 = 5.08 \n\nYou are still paying 5.08 times more \"interest\", which is 2% \\* 5.08 = **10.16% APR,** for 2 months\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother way to offset this high interest rate, is to buy deep ITM calls. Then, the extrinsic value would be much lower, but the trade off is that since the prices of the call is much more expensive due to intrinsic value, so the leverage ratio would also go down a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it begs the question, **if you really want to increase your leverage, why not just use margin and borrow money and then buy the shares?** \n\n(After you own the shares, you would be free to sell covered calls.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an additional note, by buying calls instead of shares, you are also exposing yourself to the additional risk associated with changes in IV, which affects the price of your call.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Ok I skimmed through this, and you made some great points, I‚Äôll come back to it when I have more time, cause I want to understand all the points you made.

This leap is gonna be the most expensive thing that I own in life and I'll have the pleasure of sitting back for a year just watching it moon.\n\nFool proof.\n\n2023 doesn't give a fuck if the market dips. -4% SPY days mean absolutely nothing. We could crash 7 times in 2021 and 2022, every crash being  worse than last march and 2023 still doesn't give a fuck because it will always have time to recover and it will go back up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine struggling to recover from -0.5% dips, market corrections, and worrying about futures or pre-market selloffs.\n\nNow imagine trading options where suddenly dips don't mean a fucking thing and stonks go up. Sit back and watch other people blow up their accounts when TSLA drops 5% while you laugh at them and be sure to tell the whiny little bitch that dips and red days no longer apply to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: the price difference between 2021 leaps and 2022 leaps is not very much.

NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said ‚Äî assuming it isn‚Äôt derailed at the last minute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world‚Äôs smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics‚Äîand play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 index.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year‚Äôs biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm‚Äôs customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China‚Äôs Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider‚Äôs merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm‚Äôs giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Do you even know TSMC", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "What?

{"title": "I <3 Bulls (so please play safe)", "selftext": "Six trading days after the S&P hit its all time high, bulls and bears can both agree that there is much more uncertainty about what will happen next. While we all know the NASDAQ is in a bubble, no one can say for sure if it has popped or if this dip will be dwarfed by the face ripping rally that could show itself as September continues on.\n\nAs a confused bull right now I wanted to take a look at some tech stocks and offer a word of caution to those echoing \"BTFD.\" Buying dips is obviously a good strategy but doing so recklessly could leave you missing out on a good amount of profit. Don't try to be a hero calling bottom when a clear bottom has not shown itself.\n\nTaking a look at AMZN, MSFT, & GOOGL charts should help paint this picture better.\n\n[AMZN Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/a4cg6rl2zsm51.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1efead5e7afd376ec9bd6856857cdd0a0891f80)\n\n[MSFT Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/zutwr967zsm51.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=30030941855be77df09ca3d001ca8fbd452522ce)\n\n[GOOGL Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ggbp5b29zsm51.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9177952a6ebf33ac4c4885dd213664b2c5cd15c)\n\nAll three of these tech giants have broken the trend line, retested it on the Wednesday/Thursday bounce, and gone back down. Closing the week at new lows for MSFT and AMZN. AMZN even sporting a bearish divergence with RSI over 70 since the July high.\n\nWith 10 week and 40 week moving averages as far apart as they are, major price corrections could take place and it would be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWe all just like to make money. But I know many will be mad even looking at charts pointing towards further downside corrections for their beloved tech giants. I don't want them to but its what i think will happen.\n\nFeel free to discuss future market possibilities, rip me apart for making lines on a chart, or comment a nice \"fuck you gay bear\".\n\nIf the market turned around early next week and SPY never looked back at 330 I would turn bullish very easily.
