{"title": "Forbes on Electric Truck Startup Going Public and Youngest Self-Made Billionaire", "selftext": "[As Electric Truck Startup Hyliion Goes Public, Founder Is Set To Be America’s Youngest Self-Made Billionaire](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2020/09/25/as-electric-truck-startup-hyliion-goes-public-founder-is-set-to-be-americas-youngest-self-made-billionaire/#499fecc615c9)\n\nIntro:\n\n> If all goes according to plan, Thomas Healy, 28, will become America’s youngest self-made billionaire next week\n\nExcerpts:\n\n> According to SEC filings, Healy will be the biggest shareholder, with 22.9% of the company, or 34.97 million shares, worth nearly $1.5 billion. \n\n> He may not be as slick as the other billionaire electric truck impresarios Elon Musk or Nikola’s disgraced former CEO Trevor Milton, but Healy has one up on both Tesla and Nikola when it comes to getting revolutionary tech onto the road. There are already 20 trucks operating with Hyliion’s electric powertrains, built via ventures with Dana Corp. and Volvo. Tesla said this year it was delaying production of its Semi until 2021. Shares in Nikola meanwhile have collapsed from the $70s to less than $20 amid fraud allegations and the departure of Milton.\n\nAlso:\n\n> Healy’s e-axle evolved into a complete drivetrain system that Hyliion calls the Hypertruck ERX. Replacing the diesel engine is a bank of electric batteries, which are charged via onboard generators that run on tanks of compressed natural gas. Healy’s approach contrasts with the field’s first movers, including Tesla and its all-electric, battery-centric approach, as well as Nikola, which aims to power its batteries using hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nAnd:\n\n> Automotive parts giant Dana Inc. in March 2019 made an equity investment into Hyliion, and together they are manufacturing and marketing the device to Dana’s slate of customers, including truck giants Volvo, Navistar and Peterbilt. Today truck makers install engines from Cummins and transmissions from Allison. Hyliion hopes to someday join that echelon. First large deliveries of the Hypertruck ERX could come in 2021.", "id": "izwmta", "created_utc": 1601084195.0, "score": 1446, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 396, "comments": [{"body": "So IPO will be next week, did I read that wrong?", "score": 316, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 190, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.", "score": 51, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "Automod deletes it for being a small market cap which isn't reflective to what the actual market cap will be once merger goes through", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "I got flagged for trying to tell people about it the other day lol.

There is no doubt that natural gas produces less CO2 / BTU, the bigger issue is if you get more leaking into the atmosphere at fueling stations because methane is a potent greenhouse gas by itself. \n\nI’m not an engine specialist or mechanical engineer, but isn’t their system a similar concept as using a Prius hybrid system - keep diesel or CNG engine, but have a battery to store energy and deploy energy generated from going downhill and/or braking? You get a net gain in efficiency because you lose a significant amount of the energy via braking if you don’t have the electric system. Don’t really understand why this case would be different, but I could be missing something. \n\nAlso, if you are using a purely electric vehicle, you will be using energy from natural gas plants (renewables are still a small slice of the energy mix that goes into the grid), so it’s misleading to think that an electric vehicle doesn’t have multiple energy conversions where energy is lost before the final conversion.

Its a cost effective solution when compared to the cost of gas or diesel. \n\nNo the systems are not similar.  Combustion engines are only 70% effective at turning gas or methane into mechanical energy.  An electric motor is only 90% effective at turning electricity into mechanical energy. So at best this system is equivalent to a hybrid gas or diesel engine. A Prius only has to convert from electricity to mechanical using a motor at 90% efficiency. \n\nIf you are looking for the tech that will replace gas and diesel for trucking then the only option available is hydrogen fuel using fuel cells.

{"title": "Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola. This is a good thing.", "selftext": "Next week’s Hyliion reverse merger will take them public and should make Thomas Healy the world’s youngest self-made billionaire [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2020/09/25/as-electric-truck-startup-hyliion-goes-public-founder-is-set-to-be-americas-youngest-self-made-billionaire/#1b5fcbae15c9). For months, Hyliion was called the “next Nikola” - not in a negative so much as a positive light -- referring Nikola’s rocketing post-merger price action as an innovative green trucking company that went public via reverse merger.\n\nWith the downfall of Nikola, it is more important than ever to draw clear distinctions between the two companies, because other than the sector and the means of going public, they couldn’t be more different.\n\nNikola has had serious fraud whispers for months now, which had the stock already sinking from the post-merger highs. The recent short seller reports merely confirmed what a lot of people already knew: Nikola was claiming advancements in technology that is not there yet, using infrastructure that is not built yet, and pumping their numbers with model vehicles that may not even have operating prototypes.\n\nHyliion, on the other hand, utilizes renewable natural gas fueling infrastructure that already exists across America and Europe, but takes the technology to new levels that can now compete with the performance of diesel by adding an electric motor onto the axle.\n\nThere are no green solutions out there that can compete with the ERX’s combination of cost savings (their system pays for itself within two years, and from then on saves $20,000 a year on fuel costs per truck), performance (1300 miles per renewable natural gas fill, better payload than diesel) and practicality (can be retrofitted into existing fleets instead of replacing the entire fleet with expensive new trucks, and fit into any OEM body). The ERX can also go full electric to cross future zero-emissions cities, and will be fuel agnostic so can adapt to the new technologies like hydrogen when they emerge.\n\nIt’s a transitional technology until fully electric trucks and alternative zero emissions systems can catch up to diesel performance-wise, without costing an arm and a leg.\n\nThe trucking industry is practical and cares about the bottom line. Having to send out two trucks to ship the same load is not cost effective. Hyliion is the most practical green solution that combines significant cost savings with going green without major performance loss for one of the highest polluting industries.\n\n[Nikola and Tesla’s trucking solutions’ higher cost, learning curve, lower mileage and lower payloads compared to diesel make them impractical as a long distance trucking solution.](https://cdn.nanalyze.com/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Offerings.jpg) Tesla’s semi takes half an hour to charge to get 300 miles, and has drastically lower payloads than traditional diesel. OEM manufacturer green solutions are even worse - often maxing out around 100-200 miles and requiring 8 hour charges, meaning they can only practically be used in local area deliveries. And unlike the Tesla and Nikola semis, the ERX will be available next year.\n\nEveryone wants to go green if it saves them money and can accomplish the same or better outcomes compared to traditional fuel. With the likelihood of future green subsidies to offset the upfront costs of conversion, the next generation of trucks converting to Hyliion’s solution looks like a no-brainer for the entire industry, and Hyliion works with the existing OEMs instead of trying to kill them off.\n\nUnlike a snake oil salesman with a sketchy history like Trevor Milton of Nikola, Founder and CEO Thomas Healy is humble, straightforward and has focused his company on achievable and practical solutions. There have been no whispers whatsoever questioning the integrity of Hyliion’s product. Healy is an engineer, not a hype man. They aren’t releasing a dozen plastic models of various vehicles and fake orders to pump their stock price artificially. Hyliion trucks have been filmed on the highway, and their current diesel hybrid solution has already been released and has already logged millions of miles combined.\n\nNikola’s collapse has come at the most inconvenient time possible for Hyliion’s reverse merger debut, but long term, potentially one less competitor means more market share for Hyliion, and as investors, we are able to buy in at a discount compared to its highs a few weeks ago.\n\nThis is a long-term hold for me.", "id": "j03etb", "created_utc": 1601114225.0, "score": 340, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "I think these types of hybrid solutions are amazing and could certainly get some traction over the next 10 years, but IMO the future is BEV.

It has a rock solid board with Andrew Card (former White House chief of staff), and executives with ties to Union Pacific railroad and  Dana. It already has partnerships with major trucking companies in the US and Canada. And the infrastructure for an CNG/RNG refueling already exists across the US.\n\nTesla Semi will reach the short-haul and medium-haul markets with a maximum range of 500 miles. But 69% of commercial trucking is long-haul and that requires ranges in excess of 1000 miles. Hyliion's hybrid trucks not only have the greatest range (1200 miles), best established infrastructure (no need for hydrogen stations or improving electric grid), and nearest to market, but they also can carry the greatest payload among peers. That means greater profitability for truck owners. \n\nBoth Amazon and Walmart have announced their plans to go 100% carbon-neutral by 2040. They will need a long-haul solution to achieve this. Hyliion offers the best solution because their RNG hybrid trucks are actually carbon-negative, allowing the companies to offset carbon production elsewhere in their operations by using these trucks. Plus, the cost of a Hyliion hybrid retrofit is about 25% the cost of a brand new Tesla Semi or other comparable competitor. This makes converting fleets to Hyliion hybrid much more economically attractive than purchasing a brand new fleet of electric trucks that also need EV charging infrastructure.\n\nLong-term, I think Tesla Semi will be dominant in the short and medium haul markets, but Hyliion is the best solution for the long-haul market - both domestically and internationally.

The truck, the Nikola One, is at the centre of a $2bn lawsuit with Tesla, in which Nikola alleges its rival infringed on its patents. Nikola claims in that lawsuit that Mr Milton began designing the model in 2013, with other company staff later working on it. In a rebuttal to the lawsuit filed last week, Tesla alleged that Nikola could not protect the designs because they did not originate from the company itself, but from Adriano Mudri, a designer based in Croatia. Two people with knowledge of the transaction told the Financial Times that the Nikola founder bought the designs in 2015 after meeting Mr Mudri while visiting electric supercar maker Rimac in Croatia. While Tesla’s filing identifies the designer as the source of the original truck drawings, it does not contain details about the transaction, explain that money was exchanged, or that Mr Milton himself orchestrated the purchase. The latest twist comes with Nikola still reeling from accusations earlier this month that it passed off purchased technology as its own, covering supplier names on key components with stickers when making promotional videos. Nikola said it never claimed it made the components. In a report that sent Nikola’s shares tanking, Mr Milton was accused of spreading an “ocean of lies” about the company’s technology and its products by short seller Hindenburg Research. A little over a week later, Mr Milton decided to leave the company, telling staff he planned to defend himself “against false allegations levelled against me by outside detractors”. The 39-year old founder has repeatedly insisted that he has not lied to or deceived anyone about the trucks. The lawsuit with Tesla, filed during Mr Milton’s tenure, centres on the origins of the designs for the “Nikola One” truck. The company claims that Mr Milton worked for two years on the truck before, unsatisfied with his designs, he hired designer Steve Jennes in 2015. The lawsuit says the pair then crafted the final design between them in a lengthy process. When it was finished, Nikola had spent “several million dollars developing the Nikola One”, according to the lawsuit. In its rebuttal, Tesla said that the designs for the model originated from Mr Mudri, a designer at Rimac, who had dubbed it the “Road Runner”. The design’s origins could raise further questions about Nikola’s intellectual property. “Trevor Milton chose not to disclose the Road Runner concept truck to the [US Patent and Trademark Office] with deceptive intent,” Tesla said in its filing. Nikola said: “The Nikola One truck was designed and patented by Nikola. It is commonplace to license third party designs during vehicle development, and although early in the process Nikola purchased a license to Antonio Mudri’s designs, he was not part of the design team and his designs are materially different from the design invented by Nikola for the Nikola One.” According to several people with knowledge of the deal, Mr Milton sought, unsuccessfully, to collaborate with Rimac on a range of projects in 2015. On a trip to Rimac’s headquarters on the outskirts of Zagreb, he met Mr Mudri, the company’s designer, who had designed a futuristic truck as part of an earlier diploma project. Mr Milton purchased the computer drawings and virtual 3D model of the vehicle for several thousand dollars from Mr Mudri, according to two people. The Road Runner name lingered for months. A person familiar with the development of the Nikola One said that “Road Runner . . . was the internal name for Nikola’s project the entire time we worked on it”. A screenshot of a Nikola document seen by the Financial Times, shows 13 people being invited to collaborate on the “Nikola Roadrunner Prototype Project”. Another screenshot shows an early version of Nikola’s website depicting a truck that appears identical to the Road Runner in Tesla’s court filing. Nikola did not mention Mr Mudri, or Rimac, or say that the designs were purchased, in its 2018 filing against Tesla. Representatives for Mr Milton declined to comment.

The day after the much-anticipated event, Tesla shares dropped by nearly 10%. This seems to be partly because the “million mile battery” wasn’t part of the presentation. The fickle investment community was hoping for an easily understood revolutionary announcement like an EV battery that will do a million miles without needing replacement. What they got instead was a series of incremental improvements based on technologies that were hard to understand and not very well explained. But the tail end of the Battery Day presentation was incredibly significant and foretells the final nail in the coffin of the traditional car industry based around fossil fuel propulsion.\n\nElon Musk teased a potential future car costing as little as $25,000.\nElon Musk teased a potential future car costing as little as $25,000.\nWithout much more than a single slide and a couple of sentences, Elon Musk delivered the punchline revealing where all the minor improvements up until that point in the presentation were leading. Numerically, it was a 56% reduction in battery costs. But then he explained that this would enable a $25,000 Tesla TSLA “with fully autonomous capability”. In atypical style for Musk, he didn’t make any bolder claims about what this car would be able to deliver, but we can read between the lines.\n\nMusk infamously cancelled the Standard Range version of the Model Y, stating that under 250 miles EPA range was too low, and subsequently that 300 miles of EPA range was the “new normal”. From this we assume that the $25,000 car will have at least 300 miles of EPA range, which would mean well over 300 miles with the more frugal WLTP test. You can also be certain this car will be fast because there’s no such thing as a slow Tesla, so it will definitely do 0-60mph in under 6 seconds. There have already been rumors of Tesla planning a small hatchback / subcompact vehicle, with a design teased back in January, and this will likely be the format of the new car given the price.\n\nLA AUTO SHOW\nLA AUTO SHOW\nThe $25,000 tag doesn’t initially sound that impressive, when you can buy an internal combustion engine Toyota Corolla in the USA starting at under $20,000. But this isn’t the market the car will be aimed at. The Tesla Model 3 starts at just under $40,000 in the US, and was clearly aimed at the luxury mid-sized market epitomized by the BMW 3-series, which its sales have annihilated in the USA. The new $25,000 car – shall we call it the Model 2? Everyone else is – will be aimed at another European icon, the hugely popular VW Golf, which represents quality at an affordable price. You can pick one of those up for just over $23,000.\n\nObviously, the “Model 2” is still a theory, but Musk was talking about the new battery enhancements being able to deliver the price enabling a Tesla EV at this level in 1.5-3 years’ time. So in around 3 years you could well have the choice of a well-built German fossil fuel car, or a semi-premium EV with over 300 miles of range and much faster performance – that will then go on to be much, much cheaper to run because even in the USA, electric miles are considerably less expensive than fossil fuel ones. In the UK, where petrol and diesel prices are astronomical, the running cost differential will be huge.\n\nTesla small car sketch\nTesla small car sketch\nTeslas tend to come across to the UK at around the same price numerically in pounds as they are in dollars – the Model 3, which is $40,000 in the US, is around £40,000 in the UK. But the VW Golf is also numerically about the same. So a $25,000 Tesla Model 2 would probably be around £25,000, in the same ballpark as the VW Golf 8, which starts at just over £23,000 in the UK. VW’s all electric ID.3, just released in Europe (but not being launched in the US so far), will be right out of the picture, because it’s closer to the Tesla Model 3 in price.\n\nWhich would you choose for $25,000 – a Tesla Model 2 EV or a VW Golf with a conventional fossil fuel engine? No longer will the argument hold that “I can’t buy the EV because it’s too expensive”, because they will be the same price. You could still say “300 miles is not enough to get me all the way from New York to Los Angeles or London to Edinburgh in one go”, but who really does that? In three years from now, recharging will be much more ubiquitous, too – and it’s hardly a trial for Tesla owners already. When you can buy an EV with over 300 miles of range that is faster and equipped with better technology than an internal combustion engine VW Golf, as well as being much cheaper to run, only groundless anti-electric prejudice will stop you. There won’t be any real reason to buy a car that runs on fuel derived from oil and gas anymore.”", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "> The fickle investment community was hoping for an easily understood revolutionary announcement like an EV battery that will do a million miles without needing replacement.

As markets are always improving and becoming better and better, why game masters cannot adjust rules which could improve conditions for market participants ? I'm not going to describe the problem again, but this problem is simply a flaw. However, I do understand where you coming from, that ITM option holder must think if he is going to exercise his right to get shares or not, but why this is a problem if both sides must make a decision by the deadline ? It is super unlikely that news will be released let say a few moments before expiration.

We are going to have to agree to disagree on that probably.

Sure that doesn't mean that anyone can't ask for change but we are not the majority.  The individual non-pro (designated by the 390 average rule) is a little bit like the bat boy.  We get to go on the field and we can look pretty cool in the uniform but the game does not need to change to facilitate us.  Trading options backed by the OCC on an exchange is not a right.  The system only works because the \"game masters\" (great use of words) guarantees it will work if we follow their rule book.  \n\n\nSorry for the confusion, I didn't mean to suggest a 5 minute window.  I mentioned 3:05pm was because that is normally when you can comfortably say the end of day price.  Some options like spy trade until 3:15pm central, so 3:05pm is just extra confusion on my part.   But a 5 minute window is not nearly enough time to cover all the people who want to enter \"exercise\" or \"do not exercise\" instructions with their broker.  Often the customer would have to physically call the broker (are we still in the 70s?), the broker will send instruction to the clearing firm in some ridiculous format and the clearing firm then submits the totality of instruction to OCC.  \n\n\nBut - even with a universal cutoff time at the close of market + a pad, it still does not prevent the problem because you have no idea what the counter party to your short leg is doing at that time.  And remember,  the underlying equity/index is still moving.  Your contracts are with the OCC and not directly with the counterpart (ish).  The OCC matches assignments randomly during their batch process and delivers the results to the clearing firms around midnight.  The OCC does not know what combination of options each party has or how the broker has balanced them for margining purposes.  Depending on the broker, they then handle the assignments at random with their customers holding that option.    Reconciliation is not done in real-time (seems to be a common misconception).  At this point, the non-exercised right to buy or sell is gone and you can't go back change your instructions.  That is why I think it important to stress that each leg of a complex order is an independent contract even though it is displayed neatly.  \n\nIf you haven't already, look into European style cash settled options.

Same as it will be worth at close tomorrow, so pointless, but you get the idea.\n\nReal world: this past Thursday I bought AMZN 2995/3000C ds exp Friday that I paid $3.70 for.  At expiration, assuming an underlying price of 3000.01 or more, I sell the spread before RH can rape me with their auto sell feature (before 12:30 (3:30est)) at $4.95.  This was by far the riskiest application of this strategy I've used, but it paid off big *for me*.  (3 contracts, $650 ish in a day)\n\nAfter I sold, I got 9 SPY $335/333 P ds exp Monday at $1.72 ea.  I don't know if SPY is gonna keep going up, sideways, down, or in a fucking circle, but I'm pretty confident it won't gap up $6 at open.  Even if it does, I can sell the spread early and mitigate losses a LOT easier than with naked options since the difference in their premiums is your concern, not the actual underlying value exactly.\n\nThe plan is to sell near the eod on Monday for $1.95-7 ea, collecting the $25ish per contract.  Load up again on Tuesday near EOD for Wednesday on SPY, then eod Thursday for a fun ticker.  Something with crazy high IV that I can get a return on something 30% ITM or something.\n\nI'm too stupid to predict trends, I don't really understand a lot of the underlying economics of companies, I have no idea how to interpret financials, and I'm fat and ugly, but I do know that math is always the same.

What was especially beneficial was that, since I know had my own money in the market, I was compelled to read market news and analysis on a daily basis.

{"title": "Nikola is completely Fucked. Trevor Milton and his merry band of retards are finished", "selftext": "TL;DR: buy puts\n\nI hope you Retards are ready for this juicy story that put another nail in Nikolas coffin. As we all know Nikola is a complete shit show that just turned me into a 🌈🐻, \n\n\nFT: Nikola founder bought truck designs from third party\n\n\n* * *\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/9bd5e3f3-4d09-458c-b390-bc94b1f4a024\n\nThe original design for Nikola’s flagship truck was purchased by founder Trevor Milton from a designer in Croatia, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, despite company claims in a 2018 lawsuit that the vehicle was initially designed by Mr Milton “in his basement”.\n\nThe truck, the Nikola One, is at the centre of a $2bn lawsuit with Tesla, in which Nikola alleges its rival infringed on its patents. Nikola claims in that lawsuit that Mr Milton began designing the model in 2013, with other company staff later working on it.\n\nIn a rebuttal to the lawsuit filed last week, Tesla alleged that Nikola could not protect the designs because they did not originate from the company itself, but from Adriano Mudri, a designer based in Croatia.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of the transaction told the Financial Times that the Nikola founder bought the designs in 2015 after meeting Mr Mudri while visiting electric supercar maker Rimac in Croatia.\n\nWhile Tesla’s filing identifies the designer as the source of the original truck drawings, it does not contain details about the transaction, explain that money was exchanged, or that Mr Milton himself orchestrated the purchase.\n\nThe latest twist comes with Nikola still reeling from accusations earlier this month that it passed off purchased technology as its own, covering supplier names on key components with stickers when making promotional videos. Nikola said it never claimed it made the components.\n\nIn a report that sent Nikola’s shares tanking, Mr Milton was accused of spreading an “ocean of lies” about the company’s technology and its products by short seller Hindenburg Research.\n\nA little over a week later, Mr Milton decided to leave the company, telling staff he planned to defend himself “against false allegations levelled against me by outside detractors”. The 39-year old founder has repeatedly insisted that he has not lied to or deceived anyone about the trucks.\n\nThe lawsuit with Tesla, filed during Mr Milton’s tenure, centres on the origins of the designs for the “Nikola One” truck.\n\nThe company claims that Mr Milton worked for two years on the truck before, unsatisfied with his designs, he hired designer Steve Jennes in 2015. The lawsuit says the pair then crafted the final design between them in a lengthy process.\n\nWhen it was finished, Nikola had spent “several million dollars developing the Nikola One”, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn its rebuttal, Tesla said that the designs for the model originated from Mr Mudri, a designer at Rimac, who had dubbed it the “Road Runner”. The design’s origins could raise further questions about Nikola’s intellectual property.\n\n“Trevor Milton chose not to disclose the Road Runner concept truck to the [US Patent and Trademark Office] with deceptive intent,” Tesla said in its filing.\n\nNikola said: “The Nikola One truck was designed and patented by Nikola. It is commonplace to license third party designs during vehicle development, and although early in the process Nikola purchased a license to Antonio Mudri’s designs, he was not part of the design team and his designs are materially different from the design invented by Nikola for the Nikola One.”\n\nAccording to several people with knowledge of the deal, Mr Milton sought, unsuccessfully, to collaborate with Rimac on a range of projects in 2015.\n\nOn a trip to Rimac’s headquarters on the outskirts of Zagreb, he met Mr Mudri, the company’s designer, who had designed a futuristic truck as part of an earlier diploma project.\n\nMr Milton purchased the computer drawings and virtual 3D model of the vehicle for several thousand dollars from Mr Mudri, according to two people.\n\nThe Road Runner name lingered for months. A person familiar with the development of the Nikola One said that “Road Runner . . . was the internal name for Nikola’s project the entire time we worked on it”.\n\nA screenshot of a Nikola document seen by the Financial Times, shows 13 people being invited to collaborate on the “Nikola Roadrunner Prototype Project”.\n\nAnother screenshot shows an early version of Nikola’s website depicting a truck that appears identical to the Road Runner in Tesla’s court filing.\n\nNikola did not mention Mr Mudri, or Rimac, or say that the designs were purchased, in its 2018 filing against Tesla.\n\nRepresentatives for Mr Milton declined to comment. Rimac also declined to comment.\n\nNKLA 15p 10/16 \nSPY 320P 10/16", "id": "j0ejkl", "created_utc": 1601156683.0, "score": 503, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=j0ejkl)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=j0ejkl)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I swear to God yesterday a kid in my class told me he had shares in Nikola.
