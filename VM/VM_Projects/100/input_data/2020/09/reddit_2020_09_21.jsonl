Therefore, if a position is opened for -$100, it means you **received** $100 for it. Makes sense?\n\nYou can also think of it as the closing amount.

If you want to take assignment because you want the stock, it would be fine to hold to expiration, but if you are making money on the short, that means you are **not** going to be assigned. You would only get assigned if you lost money on the short put. The put needs to be in-the-money (ITM) to be assigned, and you are going further out-of-the-money (OTM).\n\n> As for that last paragraph, I thought when selling a put you want it to expire in the hands of the buyer.\n\nThat is a common misunderstanding. Let's put it this way. If you want maximum risk of loss and maximum opportunity cost, hold until expiration. If short puts were explained that way, would you want to hold until expiration? Because that's all true. People focus too much on the \"max profit at expiration\" part and not enough on the max risk and max opportunity cost parts.\n\n>  If the position closes and I'm at, say, -$30.00 does that mean I get $30.00 or lose it? What happens if the buyer sells to close? What happens if I buy to close?\n\nIf you opened for $40 and buy-to-close at $30, that's a $10 profit. Pretty good for your first time out. I'd take it. Don't worry about what the buyer does, that's none of your business. Once you close, you are no longer obligated to do anything.\n\nAs long as you are showing a profit (meaning, the current value of the contract is below $0.40), close the position.

More risk means more potential profit. It might be more accurate to say that more time means wider dispersion of outcomes, but wider dispersion of outcomes can translate into more risk.\n\nJust because profit of a spread is capped doesn't mean you want to reduce your profit potential. If you reduce risk enough, you will cap your profit at an even lower number.

If you are going to pay for 90 delta, you might as well buy shares directly and get the benefit of no expiration, as well as other ownership perks. Would you rather pay $5000 to wait for the possibility (not guaranteed) to buy 100 shares of XYZ for $49/share, or pay $5000 for 50 shares of XYZ today? No waiting, no uncertainty, in exchange for fewer shares.\n\nLack of liquidity is the other deal breaker.\n\n> I really hate theta decay, and I hate paying for time premium.\n\nThat's rather extreme. I happen to like time premium and theta decay. Few things in option trading are as reliable as theta decay. In fact, it's so reliable, you can base entire strategies on exploiting theta decay.\n\n> I really like the fact that deep in the money options have high delta, which gives me greater leverage per contract\n\nI think you are using \"leverage\" incorrectly there. More exposure to underlying price change is perhaps what you meant? Assuming that is so, see previous point about owning shares. It's hard to beat 100 delta.\n\nIn summary, some people feel the same way as you, they want all the benefits of options, but none of the drawbacks. Your cake and eat it too kind of thing. But that's not how the game works. If you want the leverage that options provide, you'll have to learn to manage all the rest of the baggage that comes with it, like time decay.

But in some situations I can get much better ratios, like 5 to 1 or even more for a low volatility underlying like SPY. That enables me to get much more exposure to the underlying without tying up a tremendous amount of capital.\n\nWhen you say that you like time premium, are you saying that from a perspective of selling options, or buying them?

I see people jump through all kinds of hoops to mitigate theta risk, while it's delta or vega that's bleeding them dry. I also see people pat themselves on the back for mitigating theta, with a vertical spread for example, while completely missing the point that their forecast is a 100 to 1 long shot.\n\nI'm not saying theta should be ignored. I'm saying each risk should be prioritized and addressed accordingly, and since theta is one risk we have maximum control over and maximum reliability in forecasting, it's one of the easiest to mitigate.\n\nFor example, I trade 25-30 DTE ATM long calls on XSP and I mitigate theta by bailing out of the position as soon as it hits 10% profit. I rarely hold those positions for more than a few days, so theta decay is negligible relative to delta.

It was dwarfed by the acquisition news.\n\nBut another factor of this is that. Unlike, Netflix, they aren't only making money from the subscription. They are making money off of digital content (dlc, microtransactions) in those games on game pass. The large catalog of games means that players who have game pass are more likely to try games that they otherwise would not have purchased (lots of indie titles fit this description). And if they like it, they are more likely to buy additional content for the game, or even outright outright purchase the game (at a modest discount that having game pass provides). They are pushed to do the latter when the games get removed from game pass. This is sales made that otherwise would not have happened.\n\nI couldn't tell you exactly how much money they get from this end, but I'm willing to bet that it more than makes up for money lost on initial sales of AAA games launching day 1. With EA play they now have all the sports games to add to the list, and those games make billions off of microtransactions alone. RoI is definitely much quicker than the subscription cost Alone makes it seem. Obviously they still plan to increase subscriber count for larger gains.\n\nIt's also worth noting that game pass isn't just Xbox, but also PC. Microsoft isn't really expecting to sell as many xboxes as PS5s, they know that's a lost cause.

Now, Microsoft has completed a huge market share over the open world games with Minecraft and Bethesda games. If Microsoft gains the dominance of Xbox in the console world, then Americans will completely dominate the global gaming industry - the next frontier of upcoming warfare with China. It’s all about the data and entertainment.\n\nTodd and Pete used to consider putting their games on Nintendo Switch, and the option is likely gone. PS players won’t ever enjoy any good open world game like the Elder Scrolls or Fallout ever again, or even Minecraft. The list can go on forever.\n\nSony is also currently in the chaotic management between the Japanese and foreigners. Despite of owning an overwhelming majority, foreigners still face hurdles with their Japanese colleagues of nationalistic elements. After Ghosn debacle, Japan increasingly looks inward at itself, and even gave the huge loans to the underperforming Nissan. In case of Toshiba, the foreign supermajority still can’t whip the Japanese corporate world as their government interferes with the leadership votings.\n\nMicrosoft can have a perfect storm to seize the console markets away from the Japanese. I likely predict the console market will see the entry of Chinese competitors and Apple/any American competitor to replace the Japanese ones. Tencent is rapidly becoming a powerhouse, and they have the resources to crush both Nintendo and Sony out of Chinese hatred against Japan.

If this man dies tomorrow, TSLA might die with him.\n\nThe reason why thats relevant is because TSLA isn't retaining its stock price due to its fundamentals alone.
