I cannot even begin to tell you the number of times I have been grilled on the internet, especially Reddit just for asking a question. Like I'm trying to learn! Lol.\n\nI researched this strategy and have come to appreciate it because, unlike selling calls, it has a higher profit potential, and buying anything (calls or puts) will just cost you money. Really, the downside of selling short puts is --*as you mentioned--*, the black swan events which are unlikely 90%+ of the time, and the large capital requirement you need to have to buy the stocks, should you get called. I tried to paper trade 10 short puts for a nice $7,600+ in premium and it didn't allow me to because I did not have the $1.2 million required capital to execute the trade. If I were to use this strategy any time soon, I would most definitely need to start with stocks in the double digits and not ones that are trading in the hundreds. But (again) if I were to sell a put for AFRM (as an example), $45.50 strike, expiring next week, I would only get a credit of $62 and that is peanuts compared to the $4,923 in capital I would have at risk. When you start selling contracts in the 10s, that's where it gets promising, even though the capital at risk is 10x at $49,230.
