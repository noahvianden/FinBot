They're kinda screwed until ASML actually has high NA EUV machines available to them in 2025+. Why build bleeding edge fabs if you aren't even sure if you'll have access to the equipment to begin production? I've heard a bunch of rumors about TSMC lately, and it's mostly preflighting excuses for why they're about to get leapfrogged. Personally, I think TSMC is in panic mode. And if they aren't, they should be. I get why they're building their most advanced fab on their home country, but China seems very intent on bringing them back into the fold. The only scenario here that bodes well for TSMC is if business continues on as usual. If it doesn't, they're kind of screwed. There's a lot of scenarios where Intel skyrockets, that was part of my strategy by heavily investing in Intel. Of course, I own a little bit of everything in the form of ETF's, so I win no matter what happens.\n\nGoing down to the labor part of your comment, that is always going to be a struggle for this industry.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if Apple and Nvidia are already in talks to buy fab space.\n\nNvidia is definitely already testing chips with Intel based on conversations that were reported earlier this year and there is precedent in how they used Samsung to make their consumer chips. Meanwhile Apple has always been in \"Zero Fucks Given\" mode and ships silicon fabbed at both foundries for the same lines of products and sometimes even the same chip, so it's possible that Apple will make their silicon at three fabs instead of two now, but I am not aware of Apple having supply side shortages for their chips.\n\nHaving said that, I doubt that Nvidia will put all their eggs in one basket with one new vendor. They sell specific chips with specific performance parameters - they don't want customers receiving a mishmash of chips with different thermal and performance characteristics, and they especially don't want the optics of consumers ripping into them for selling two different 5080s or 5070s and complaining about things not working as advertised. Even during Ampere generation they made the A100 at TSMC's lines. They have also reported at the end of last quarter that they have pending orders for two years if I am remembering correctly, and this excludes the China business. So it might happen that they move some lines to Intel and stick to TSMC for the others. \n\n>Going down to the labor part of your comment, that is always going to be a struggle for this industry.

I'm not convinced that performance incentives will help because in a fab most of the work is automated and the blue collar workforce is mostly there in a supervisory capacity. The real performance indicators will come from the fab engineers, who will be responsible for optimising the processes to get good yields, but they will have next to no impact on the roles of the lines people. That's where recruiting US workers is a struggle. TSMC is sending US workers to Taiwan for training but those timelines are obviously 1 year or longer since a lot of it is advanced, proprietary knowledge.\n\nThe other struggle is actually regarding fab construction - US construction workers are largely unionised and don't want to work on TSMC's timelines and are resisting TSMC's attempts to bring in experienced workers from Taiwan with experience to speed up the process.
