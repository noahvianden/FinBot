{"title": "Why TSLA is extremely undervalued", "selftext": "I’ll try to make this as short as possible for everyone. This is a bit more of a “longer term” DD post.\n\nTSLA is being significantly undervalued for the upcoming Optimus humanoid bots. If you look at a couple of videos TSLA has released, these bots have gotten significantly better over the past few years and their capability will only exponentially grow.\n\nSure we’ll start off with just a few extremely wealthy people having these bots, but Musk is planning to mass manufacture these things. A decade or so down the line, you’ll be able to get your own robot maid for 10K a pop. Everyone and their grandma will have one to do mundane tasks for us. And there are no competitors to this. Creating a robot like this is extremely difficult, much less mass manufacturing them. \n\nThere are no competitors in the field and they won’t show up for years due to sheer difficulty of the task as a huge portion of creating these things are software. And TSLA will only get further ahead with time with their monopoly.\n\nIf TSLA is successful with Optimus, they will bring in trillions of revenue over the years, making 5 trillion market cap eventually seem fairly valued. \n\n800B market cap today is undervalued.\n\n\nEdit: it seems there are some understandably quite pessimistic pundits in the chat. This take on TSLA is obviously not definite, but it might help get you ahead of the curve when people start speculating on Optimus perhaps one, two, or even three years down the line. Successful or not when TSLA proceeds to release more and more information on production, stock price will begin to spike at the very least on anticipation.\n\n\nEdit: I was wrong.

The way I look at the Cybertruck is as a platform to prove out the manufacturing processes and technology for a very high-volume next-gen vehicle. If they can successfully pull this off this is a vehicle that will sell millions of units per year at a cost to Tesla that no one can match. It can also add $50B+ to their bottom line before factoring in software (7M units at $25K each and $16K cost to manufacture... IF Tesla achieves some of their more ambitious targets here). No one is close to competing with this.\n\nAs to being a car company... their gross non-automotive revenue since end of 2021 has gone from 1.75B to 3.73B and gross margin on this has gone from a loss of 35M to 510M income. This is growing at a much faster rate than auto revenue and the incremental margin has been accelerating here (Q2 YOY margin growth rate was 22%, Q3 it was 35%!).\n\nFSD - so don't factor it in. Continued innovation in auto and batteries alone are enough to drive the value of Tesla way up. I do think FSD is coming believe it or not (go watch videos of what these systems can do already and realize they will continue to improve).\n\nOptimus - I think this is 7-10 years off from being a commercial product. I think anyone that discounts this is being a bit foolish. Just look at LLM's and how quickly they are advancing. Computers are rapidly increasing their ability to respond to language as expected. So if you have a robot that has the hardware, and it can respond accordingly to commands it means it can manipulate that hardware to do what you ask. Obviously there is lot of AI (FSD like work) for the video feeds to be interpreted to understand the world, but that is not unlike a LLM to interpret what it sees and translate that into something it can respond to. There is no one close to Tesla with Optimus because the key to AI learning is scale which Tesla is on a path to build many of these robots cost-effectively.\n\nMusk - make of him what you will.

The manufacturability of it is clearly miles ahead of anyone else which is enabled by Tesla's vertical integration.\n2. The design is a functional humanoid robot, not a superhero. No need to run or do flips, rather just be able to navigate a normal human environment and do normal human tasks at a moderate speed. Once you have your basic hardware capable of manipulating objects similar to a human it is simply a software task. The Gen 2 Optimus already has hardware near or at that level.\n3. In terms of software the key thing, I believe, will be having many robots (e.g. thousands) being assigned to do a variety of tasks in different environments and then like the cars having the AI software learning and constantly improving. Cheap hardware and manufacturability here is critical as otherwise you will never get to the volume of robots needed for self-learning.\n4. The base of the software is obviously based off FSD meaning that a lot of the work designing the software was done already.\n5. Compared to self-driving in many ways the compute needed for Optimus is much simpler. Self-driving requires processing numerous camera feeds in a fraction of a second, which means highly efficient NN's that can process downsampled video (not enough compute to process high-res live) to make the correct decisions. Optimus is running off two cameras and can take much more time to process. In other words it can take more time to process high-res so your compute needs may be lower to understand your environment.\n6. LLM's and the advancement of AI in general is important as communicating tasks to a robot is a challenge. This is also an issue with self-driving and we saw that Tesla was doing work to translate driving tasks into language. With a robot it is one thing to program explicitly to move from point A to point B, but being able to ask it to do something and for it to understand what you want it to do and then plan how to do it, is a challenge that LLM's are showing are solvable as we are able to communicate in natural language with computers. Without this, you can have a robot that can be capable of anything but will do nothing since you can't explain to it what it needs to do.\n\nAll-in-all, I believe the key differentiator for Tesla here is their ability to manufacture these at volumes necessary to do the learning to make them functional. The software; any great team with some time can probably accomplish to some extent or another, but the manufacturing is what sets Tesla apart (this goes to design of actuators and every part of the robot) and will enable Tesla to get to volume to allow them to solve the AI problem here to make them functional.\n\nThat all said... we are probably talking a need to manufacture thousands before the AI can be solved... That will likely not happen till the hardware design goes through several more iterations where they are confident that the hardware is at the level needed for a commercial product. Then building the manufacturing process will take some time... I would figure perhaps 2 years till the hardware is complete, another year to build the manufacturing process and start producing the initial batch for AI learning. Another year to complete that first batch and then another 3-5 years of AI learning...

I used to work for prime video, and in the context of a stock performance (which from what I understand is the purpose of this sub), a lot of folks here are completely missing the point. \n\nI'm not arguing that adding ads is the noble thing for amazon to do. But I do know first hand, what the value of prime video is to the overall business of amazon, and that customers who regularly watch prime video (1) are incredibly more likely to renew their Prime membership, (of all the prime categories, video is top 2), and (2) the volume of customers who watch prime video means amazon can make big bucks from this move. \n\nThis is a 0 -> 1 change into a video ecosystem with tons of viewers, who honestly, don't really care about having to watch ads. The most important part is that the content where ads are placed, is worth watching. Not that ads exist. \nThere are already streaming options within prime video, that are ad-supported. They are amongst some of the highest viewed content on PV, because the content is good enough. People aren't going to stop watching TNF, because of ads. As terrible as those games are, they are still the most watched content on PV. The internet folks who are proclaiming they're going to now cancel their prime membership because of this.. yeah, i'm calling your bluff. Not in a personal, and individual sense, but the vastly overwhelming majority of people who subscribe to prime, don't care about this enough to cancel their membership over it. \n\nMuch like when Netflix announced it was doing away with shared accounts, and reddit erupted over it saying this was the end of the company, only to find out that netflix increased their subscriber count after making that change - this will be the same. Reddit people will whine about it, 99.999% of prime subscribers won't care, and amazon will have an entirely new business line added to their P&L thats making gobs of money.
