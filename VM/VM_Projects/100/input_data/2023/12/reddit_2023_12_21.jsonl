This could be disadvantageous for the employee, as it creates uncertainty and insecurity about their job status. It could also be disadvantageous for the employer, as it may discourage qualified and talented candidates from applying or accepting the job offer, or reduce the employee‚Äôs loyalty and commitment to the company.\n\nYet,\n\nKollektivavtalad f√∂rst√§rkt f√∂retr√§desr√§tt (collective agreement enhanced right of priority): This term grants the employee who has been dismissed due to redundancy a preferential right to be rehired for up to nine months after the termination date. This could be disadvantageous for the employer, as it restricts their flexibility and discretion in hiring new staff, and may force them to rehire employees who are not suitable or qualified for the available positions. It could also be disadvantageous for the employee, as it may create false expectations or prevent them from seeking other employment opportunities.\n\nArbetstidens f√∂rl√§ggning (work schedule): This term allows the employer to adjust the work hours and shifts of the employees according to the needs of the business, with or without the consent of the employees or the union. This could be disadvantageous for the employee, as it may disrupt their work-life balance, health, and well-being. It could also be disadvantageous for the employer, as it may reduce the employee‚Äôs productivity, motivation, and satisfaction, and increase the risk of absenteeism, errors, and accidents.\n\n\nL√∂neprinciper (Wage principles): The agreement states that wages should be based on the value of the work, the skills and performance of the worker, and the profitability of the company. However, it also says that wages should be determined by local negotiations between the employer and the union, which might not reflect the individual contributions of each worker\n\nL√∂neber√§kning vid fr√•nvaro (Wage calculation during absence): The agreement states that if a worker is absent from work due to illness, injury, parental leave, or other reasons, the wage should be calculated based on the average earnings of the previous three months. However, this might disadvantage workers who have worked harder or longer hours in the recent period, as their wage would not reflect their actual performance.\n\n√ñvertidsarbete (Overtime work): The agreement states that overtime work should be compensated with either extra pay or extra time off, depending on the worker‚Äôs choice. However, it also says that the employer has the right to assign overtime work according to the needs of the business, and that the worker has the duty to perform it unless there are valid reasons to refuse.

It is a bit too much for very small busenisses and really not needed (especially for self employed people). But at the same time, many small busenisses sign in on these as well, because if you have let's say 20 employees it's still difficult to write up your own legal documents so it's convenient to just copy the homework done by the big guys. Or they simply join the employer organisation and let their lawyers deal with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This is an agreement with MAF not Tesla.\n\nYes, MAF is the employer assosiation. They have a lot of members from large car manufacturers to small workshops. So this would be the CBA in question.

As the AI say, this can be dangerous to health and so on, so you have to come to an agreement with the workers that they are fine with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>L√∂neprinciper (Wage principles):\n\nYes, both are true at the same time. The CBA states that the pay should be individual, but also that the union can make some adjustments for their own members, as long as they are still based on individual performance.

Half an hour before it was time to go home there was a leak and about 3000 liters of paint was suddenly on the floor. Anyone who did not have an emergency at home was forced to stay and clean it up.

Instead, they are likely affiliated service centers or workshops that work on Tesla vehicles. This distinction is important because it reflects on the nature of the labor dispute and the parties directly involved.\n\nIn Sweden and many other regions, Tesla operates a network of service centers and workshops, some of which may be operated by third parties under Tesla's guidelines and standards. These service centers and workshops handle maintenance and repair services for Tesla vehicles. In the case of the strike in Sweden, it appears that these workshops, while not directly owned by Tesla, are closely affiliated with the company and work primarily on Tesla vehicles.\n\nThe involvement of these workshops in the strike underscores the broader impact of labor disputes, even when they involve third-party operators or franchises. The issues at stake, such as wages, working conditions, and collective bargaining rights, are similar to those faced by direct employees of a company. This situation also highlights the complex nature of modern labor relations, where workers may be employed by a variety of entities within a larger corporate network or ecosystem.\n\nFor more detailed information about the specific nature of these workshops and their relationship with Tesla, it would be necessary to examine the individual agreements and operational structures of these service centers.

So the workers have to find 10% of the employees who will join the union.  Normally it will be the employees who can take more risks and the ones who really believe in the unionized system and are willing to strike.  Then that 10% of employees join the union and they can start asking for a collective agreement.    In Tesla that happened like 5 of 6 years ago.    At the moment there is no need for more people to join the union, why would you? just to pay them more?  Because Tesla did not want to talk after these 5 years the union called for a strike.

And this has become one of the core MMT thesis, namely that tax drives the value of the currency.\n\nAnd secondly people who‚Äôve done operational analysis of central banks have found support for MMT. For example, these UCL researchers wrote a white paper detailing the UK Bank of England/Treasury operations and found they are basically as MMT describes. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/publications/2022/may/self-financing-state-institutional-analysis\n\nAnd then thirdly from philosophical considerations , I think the core points of MMT sort of have to be correct. For example\n\n1. Money is a form of debt (a la Chartalism)\n2. Debt is only created when it‚Äôs given from A to B\n3. Debt is destroyed when it‚Äôs returned to the issuer of that debt\n4. Therefore, the currency issuer creates money when it spends it (give it from A to B) and destroys money when it taxes it (return to issuer)\n\nAnd then also the insight that you cannot tax that which doesn‚Äôt exist, so taxation presupposes the creation of money. \n\nThe philosopher Alex Douglas has written a book covering Chartalism from a philosophical perspective as well https://www.routledge.com/The-Philosophy-of-Debt/Douglas/p/book/9781138929746\n\nThose points support the MMT notion that government spending comes before taxation and therefore the government is not constrained by revenues.\n\nSo overall yeah I think MMT is probably correct.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I found the argument quite compelling as well, thank you for your points!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Yes Gary pump it like you want 300 by Xmas \n\nhttps://x.com/garyblack00/status/1737819391138447413?s=46&t=fGVL0206fdWMIjq9C1_Fgg", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Semi megapacks and cybertrucks are the near growth.

Was a nice riding car but $68k US  for 230 miles of range is just stupid.   Couldn‚Äôt even take it on the planned excursions because of the range was inferior . I  had to buy and excursion package. \n\nBesides that , it was a major pain to even try to get it charged up.  Om-mfg the hotel was full with people hoarding chargers .  The teslas super charger station was a mess and possibly wouldn‚Äôt work even if  I could t figure out how to even get in the inside the charging station to charge and they wanted to charge me $18 for 0-4 hours .  Wtf?  For 40 miles of range ?  Fuck that ! \nI‚Äôm out .", "score": -3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla is gonna crush Q4 mark my words.
