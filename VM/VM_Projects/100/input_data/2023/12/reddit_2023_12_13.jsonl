{"title": "Can Tesla stock reach $500 in 2024?", "selftext": "Tesla has a remarkable history of delivering strong returns, boasting a trailing 10-year return of 2,560%. Even this year, with a 98% increase in share value, Tesla has outperformed the broader market. Despite currently trading 41% below its peak price of $410, set in November 2021, some optimistic investors are eyeing a target of $500 per share, implying a potential 100% gain.\r  \n\r  \nFor Tesla to reach this ambitious goal by the end of 2024, several factors need to come into play. Firstly, the company must demonstrate fundamental improvements, particularly in revenue growth and profitability. However, recent challenges, such as a slower revenue increase of 9% in Q3 2023 and a decline in operating margin to 7.6%, indicate a need for substantial progress in these areas.\r  \n\r  \nElon Musk attributes the challenges to an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, including higher interest rates affecting car affordability. Additionally, competition and ongoing price cuts have impacted Tesla's profitability.\r  \n\r  \nWhile revenue and earnings growth are crucial, the missing piece of the puzzle is the valuation. Tesla's current steep price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 78 poses a challenge. The stock's 98% increase this year is attributed to a 105% rise in the P/E multiple, indicating heightened investor enthusiasm.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, relying on continuous P/E expansion might be unrealistic, especially with already sky-high expectations and an uncertain market influenced by higher interest rates and inflation. To reach $500 per share, Tesla would likely need to deliver exceptional financial results, including a doubling of earnings per share between 2023 and 2024. Given recent trends like revenue slowdown and margin compression, achieving this bullish scenario appears challenging, prompting a cautious approach for investors with tempered expectations for Tesla's future performance.\r  \n", "id": "18hexgo", "created_utc": 1702467555.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Either Yes, No or Maybe!", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "I think you may be right!", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Leaning hard NO with musk at the helm", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Out of morbid curiosity.

Now that the Fed is signaling that we've reached the terminal rate -- today was the second FOMC meeting where they've decided to keep rates where they are -- and future moves may be going down (speculation, of course, nobody knows and the Fed won't say) future investment will move to other categories (and sectors) and the top 20(ish) names in the S&P will see downward pressure as that investment goes elsewhere.

That will always be the case. Do not try to switch between the different waves just based on sentiment, fear, and greed.\n\nTrading stocks / sectors / factors based on reddit sentiment and market movements is very, very irrational. Even if you have some kind of advantage and can reasonably well predict *certain* trends (which is clearly not the case when you move to what's hot every few months), you can never predict how the market reacts to it.\n\nFor 99% of people, it is best not to chase these trends. Time has proven that the easiest advantage to achieve is patience, the exact opposite of jumping on trends that were playing out for months. Look into trends from early '23 / late '22. Everyone was chasing dividends, SCHD, VOO. So many people predicted that META (at a PE of 13! Even after factoring in the massive meta expenses), GOOG, etc. would underperform, just as they recently had. So many people were getting into energy & oil.\n\nThese sentiments change every few months and once you see it repeat a couple times, it's obvious that the average retail investor has almost no patience.\n\nDon't chase big tech after a giant rally. Sure, buy some and build a position over time, if you're comfortable riding the long term secular trends of technology. Don't buy it because it will outperform the broad market in a month or a year.

You don't need to answer to shareholders of your fund, you don't need short term outperformance. You can rely on quality companies that have time and time proven they can excellently allocate capital, that have dug wide moats around their businesses. Companies that yield high returns on capital and can reinvest these returns into more capital.\n\nBuild a portfolio of companies you will be comfortable to hold for decades (you can change your mind, as the world and business  changes, of course). Not by chasing trends - slowly add to your positions. If you trust the leadership of the company and you understand the business models and the incentives that power them, you won't need to worry about short term sentiment changes. If you have a diversified portfolio of companies, there will almost always be some that are on sale due to no other reason than investor sentiments and short term market trends.

Here are some counterpoints to consider:\n\n1. **Inflation and the Labor Market:**  \n\n\n* While there has been a surge in prices, it's crucial to assess whether it's a short-term inflationary spike or a sustained trend. Central banks often monitor core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy.\n* Employment rates and wage growth are important factors. A strong job market can support consumer spending, potentially offsetting the challenges posed by rising prices.\n\n1. **Government Intervention:**  \n\n\n* Governments and central banks worldwide have tools at their disposal to mitigate economic downturns. They can implement fiscal policies, monetary policies, and stimulus packages to stabilize and stimulate the economy.\n* The increase in public debt may be a concern, but if the borrowed funds are used effectively to spur economic growth, it can lead to long-term benefits.\n\n1. **Global Economic Interconnectedness:**  \n\n\n* While global economic conditions impact each other, the U.S. has a diversified economy. Some sectors may be affected by international events, but others might be resilient.\n* Trade policies and agreements can be adjusted to navigate changing international dynamics.\n\n1. **Consumer Resilience:**  \n\n\n* High levels of credit card debt and reduced savings are concerns, but consumer behavior can change. If consumers become more cautious, they might adjust their spending habits, leading to increased savings and reduced debt over time.\n\n1. **Historical Context:**  \n\n\n* Economic cycles are a normal part of any economy. While certain indicators may resemble those before a recession, it's important to analyze the context and unique factors influencing the current situation.\n\n1. **Technological Advancements:**  \n\n\n* Advances in technology and new industries can drive economic growth. Innovation has the potential to create jobs, increase productivity, and contribute to economic expansion.\n\n1. **Policy Responses:**  \n\n\n* Governments and central banks often respond to economic challenges with appropriate policies. For instance, if a recession appears imminent, policymakers may implement measures to counteract its impact.\n\nIt's important to note that economic forecasting is inherently uncertain, and various factors can influence the direction of an economy. While there are challenges, there are also potential mitigating factors that could prevent a full-fledged recession.

All one needs to recover \"lost BTC\" is the private key to the address of the BTC, which can eventually be calculated or guessed - it just takes, in our current technological age, practically infinite effort/time to guess it. \n\nBut thankfully that's where the analogy breaks down because the energy it takes to recover a golden asteroid or gold at the bottom of the ocean is much greater than the energy it would likely take to steal it from someone else's vault. Whereas with Bitcoin, the energy it takes to recover \"lost\" BTC is the same as it is to steal BTC.  That's a good thing.\n\nAnd, Because BTC is potentially infinitely divisible beyond even satoshis by using layers of blockchains secured by the Bitcoin network, that means that as more and more BTC is lost, the greater incentive to better custody remaining BTC as its value goes up.

They just want the line to go up and not have a crash because we can't have a crash on an election year. Can't make the current administration look bad.\n\nLet me put it another way. For apple to make money they need to sell iPhones, the government threw out tons of helicopter cash and people bought iPhones. The government doesn't create value, they can only print debt. So that money will have to come from some where. Thusly we get inflation. \n\nThe Government claims we had a 5% GDP growth in Q3.... where? Seriously where? All I see is the highest credit card debt in history (1 Trillion) people unable to afford food, shelter or anything else and the government redefining inflation. That's the key the government gets to define the metrics so they will manipulate the numbers to give a rosie outlook of everything. The price of rent is still skyrocketing (so they just don't count that anymore with inflation) Food prices have gone up double digit percentages (so just stop counting that too). We emptied out half of the strategic oil reserves to try and curb energy costs. \n\nWhat I am saying in short is, stocks go up based on consumers actually buying shit, if the government is the one giving them money no value is created it is just fake money being handed in a big circle jerk. Nvidia stock goes up because adobe needs chips for the AI services and people want to pay for that subscription. If people are paying for that subscription with helicopter money given out by the government then all that really happened was the government gave out Nvidia tax dollars to people to buy a service from Adobe to Adobe can buy more Nvidia chips. Nothing of value was created the net gain is actually negative since Nvidia is basically paying the government via tax and inflation to give people money to buy their chips indirectly. That's the shell game and why this cannot sustain itself. \n\nIf you want a real indication of how much we are spinning our tires here look at the inflation adjusted S&P 500 [https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)\n\nWe have basically been flat since 2021 and most of the \"value\" is due to inflation.
