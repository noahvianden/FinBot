The chip density is dependent on what the industry calls the manufacturing node, think of this as the size of the lego parts used to build the chip. Nodes are commonly referred to by the nanometer size of their smallest design elements. Currently the fastest chips in the world are being made at 3nm. China on its own is closer to 22nm (about a decade behind the west).\n\nChip design is only part of the battle, companies like Intel, AMD, Apple, Samsung, etc are at this point more reliant on the next manufacturing process for performance increases than they are on just better designs. Unfortunately, TSMC the worlds largest and most advanced semi conductor fabricator has a massive back log for its 3nm process that requires companies to order billions of dollars months or even years ahead in order to get their next chips out of design phase quickly. So a brand new startup could make the worlds most advanced chip tomorrow and never be able to have it manufactured unless they could get enough money for a slot on the 3nm node from a company like TSMC. Chinese companies are stuck designing for the 22nm and 28nm nodes which offer significantly less performance per watt.\n\nThe US is in a massive push right now to build out more semi conductor fabs here at home, but it might not be until 2050 before we can match Taiwans output. If we continue to hold china back they will likely never fully catch up. Ironically if they spend half as many resources developing their own technologies and processes rather than reverse engineering and steeling the designs of the west we could have a really interesting scenario where chip fabrication could take a wildly different path in China leading to better chips overall.

You can buy a chip and look at it with an X-ray microscope to get the design. A really good hospital or research lab should have the equipment.\n\nThe issue is making them with a low failure rate.  The silicon base needs to be extremely pure and extremely flat and even.  The entire entire assembly process must be done in a building that’s cleaner than a hospital because a single hair or piece of dandruff can ruin a chip.\n\nThe machines have to be isolated from any outside vibration, because a human even touching one while it’s running is too big a movement and will screw up the piece being worked on. The factories are very quiet because even sound can cause the machines to mess up.  They’re writing on the silicon in tiny movements with tiny machinery, like a laser reading a CD. Anything that would cause a CD player to skip or a record player to scratch is going to damage the chip.\n\nOne flaw or accident can completely destroy a piece of the chip, rendering the chip less powerful (many 6 core CPUs are actually failed 8 core CPUs where 1 or 2 cores never worked) and there no way to fix the problem other than turning off the affected part.  It’s not like metal or wood where it’s east to scrap a failed attempt and start over, because the process to even get the materials is really hard.\n\nThose chip-making machines are also tens to hundreds of millions each, with a full factory called a fab typically costing more than $10 billion to build.  TSMC, a major chipmaker, is actively investing $40 billion in one fab in the USA.\n\nThere is one company, a Dutch company called ASML, which makes the chip-making machines for modern CPUs and GPUs. They make the machines and also help construct the factories. They estimate that if anyone wanted to make a factory making the current high-end chips at current success rates without their machines or expertise, it would take a competitor at least a decade and around a hundred billion dollars.\n\nThe people who design and build the machines are also a small group of insanely well educated professionals. ASML’s teams are full of people with science Ph.D.s and history it’s of published research, and when they retire from that work they often get hired as professors by engineering colleges due to their expertise and industry experience.

China could use Huawei chips today with relatively good “effectiveness”, 30-50% of A100. If the sPiRiT of the law is, don’t sell datacenter chips to China, then they should say that. I work in the industry. If they give us a meaningful limit, we’ll abide by it. But this is not sane rule-making. Not arguing pedantics of “skirting”. Pick a number, feature set whatever, say what it is, and the industry will sell the most competitive chip they can that is strictly under the limit. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. If you wanna ban datacenter chip trade with China, then say that and people will plan for never selling to China again.\n\nAlso there is no law, this is agency rule making.\n\nAnyway, they’re not gonna change the rule again, 250-300 TFLOPS is gray zone that requires export license. 250 and under is green zone. You can bet both AMD and Nvidia will be selling 249 TFLOP cards and apply for 275-299 TFLOP cards. This is the spirit of the rule. The reason they changed the rule from last time, they realized their limit on chip to chip networking speed didn’t adequately slow down training times for LLMs. A800 was fairly close to A100 in usability. The TFLOP limit will indeed slow down training substantially. What the lady is saying is that if Nvidia figures out new and innovative ways to sell a slow chip but still a compelling system, they will revise the limitation. But a AD102 die with disabled cores is exactly what they want. They already have a rule against chiplets to get around it. They’re saying if some kinda other novel way of increasing compute density per blade/rack/datacenter is developed they’ll ban it. Nvidia’s current plan is to sell H25 and A25, exactly what Biden wants. So no, US Government isn’t on your highly regarded side. \n\nThe issue with low iq sPiRiT of the law comments is they don’t understand what they’re talking about in the least bit.

Seems like it’d be more efficient less waste redesigning and creating two products and the tariffs achieve very similar results. I understand that Nvidia would rather work a bit to avoid the tariff but is it enough to work with Nvidia to then maybe price the A100 higher high enough to impose a sufficient cost in in lieu of a tariff.

While inflation was initially muted, substantial stimulus measures, supply chain disruptions, and increased demand as the economy reopened in 2021 contributed to rising prices.\n\nBy mid-2021, inflation rates surpassed expectations, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reaching multi-year highs. This surge raised concerns about the potential long-term impact on the US financial market. In response, the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its approach, acknowledging that inflation might be transitory.\n\nHowever, if inflation remains elevated, it could lead to reduced consumer purchasing power, impacting retail sales and corporate profits. Bond prices, especially for fixed-income securities, might face downward pressure, affecting investors holding these assets. Central banks might respond with interest rate adjustments to curb inflation, further influencing the cost of borrowing and impacting various sectors of the financial market.\n\nWhile the situation is dynamic and subject to change, the period from 2020 to 2022 witnessed a delicate economic balance, with the potential for high inflation to exert pressure on the US financial market.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "why would they spend money on research when they can just shake a magic 8 ball from dollar tree and write whatever they want", "score": 32, "replies": []}, {"body": "JP Morgan hardly has any skin in the game.

Good explanation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I’ll take a stab at explaining. \n\nSwedish labor market is extremely deregulated. Very strong labor unions early 1900’s also led to the employers organizing themselves and around 1938 both parties agreed on how to manage things. The government regulates the right to strike in the constitution and some basic rights but mostly left it to the market to figure out the terms and conditions. \n\nThe result was a system of collective bargaining agreements (CBA). This has been fleshed out since 1938 of course but the point is there is a long tradition of union and market cooperation to ensure fair treatment of laborers *and* ensuring companies couldn’t use cheap labor as a competitive edge amongst each other.\n\nFast forward to the present day. 90% of the companies in Sweden have a CBA in place and about 65% of the work force is part of a union. \n\nThree important things to understand is that a CBA is just a baseline agreement. It doesn’t come with any direct cost to be part of it and you’re free to give better terms if you want to and you’re perfectly free to apply individual salaries and benefits. Sweden is a capitalist country after all (many confuse socialism with communism). \n\nThe other part is that you don’t have to be part of the union just because the company you work for have a CBA. With 90% coverage it’s basically taken for granted any serious company have one as it also regulates pension benefits, extra health insurance, extra pay for parental leave, overtime pay etc. \n\nThird and one of the reasons many get confused by the sympathy strikes. Unions here are not connected to your place of employment. They are connected to your trade. This makes it easy for a union to take people out on strike that might work at a different company if they feel it will serve a purpose. \n\nA fourth bonus one. Sympathy strikes are legal. Which is why the postal workers strike by not handing out mail to Tesla for instance. And the painters union not painting their cars. The dock workers union not offloading their cars etc etc. \n\nSo there’s no secret forced recruitment drive by the unions going on here or any Jimmy Hoffa in the background on the take. That’s not how it works here. \n\nThe funny thing here then is that *if* Tesla already provide benefits that exceed the CBA the cost would literally be 0 to sign it. \n\nThe CBAs also run for three years at a time. And to show how the CBA is really negotiated between the unions and employers organizations: strikes are illegal while operating under an active CBA. \n\nThis setup. Called the Swedish model, has been considered a win win win for employer, employees and the Government alike with a predictable and stable market. Proven by the fact Sweden has 0,6 strike days per year and 1000 workers whereas the US has 5 and France something like 45. \n\nElon is trying to overthrow a system set by precedent for 85 years. Supported by most employees *and* companies. I said in another comment I don’t really think he understands the hornets nest he’s kicking here. \n\nThe last bit is that the Danish dockworkers are now posting their notice about a sympathy strike as it was (I assume) planned to circumvent the Swedish dockworkers strike by bringing in the new cars through Denmark instead. \n\nSorry this was long and due to your first posts downvotes will probably only be read by you 😄\n\nBut I hope it helped clear things up. Feel free to ask more if you want.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "This is great.  So I assume Swedish companies don’t have as much healthcare leverage as in the U.S.  In the U.S. it seems harder for Unions to persist once a need has been met.

In the U.S. even direct striking is blocked in some states, for teachers for example.  And they submarined the rail strike.  In the one hand, US companies seem to achieve a lot, on the other hand, labor abuses and wage gaps seem unsustainable.

With “free” (nothing is free, it’s tax funded of course) national healthcare health care benefits in Sweden CABs usually involve three things. \n\n• Grants for gym cards etc to promote a healthy lifestyle. \n\n• Pay coverage that extends above the national pay. Ie if you’re on sick leave the government pay 80% of your salary up to about $4000 per month. The CBA usually cover the same above 4K for x months. \n\n• Same setup as above but for parental leave. Makes a big difference for high earners being able to take out their parental days (my CBA covers 6-9 months of extra pay this way)\n\n• Extra insurance on top of the governmental one in case of permanent injury or death. \n\n\nThis would essentially be called fringe benefits I guess with a national healthcare system in place but the sick leave and parental leave pay really matters. \n\nMedian house prices went nuts of late due to low interest rates. Swedish households have among the largest housing debts vs income in the world so no system is perfect but job security is very high. The minimum 25 days of vacation is great as well.
