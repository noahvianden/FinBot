(Ok, the lightning is a good truck, but it's no rivian).\n\nThey are simplifying the product line options, while reducing costs by in-sourcing motors, improving batteries. Breaking ground on a new factory that will print money. By which I mean smaller, more cost effective (cheaper) SUVs.  They will be moving to NACS in 2025.  Every article I find seems a solid game plan for success, while they are trading at $20/share, from an IPO of $150/share. In 20 years they will either be a huge success, or successful enough that Ford/GM buys them cash, and I make out either way. \n\nI'm still buying TSLA. They aren't a car company. They are an energy company that is the new Standard Oil. They will make it, (solar). Store it (batteries). and Sell it (virtual power companies). and make the things that use it (cars). and maybe someday HVAC or other tech based on the cars. The HVAC in my 2023 X (heat pump, octovavle stuff) is amazing. If they can sell that tech to heat pump companies for houses, dryers, water heaters,etc. it will print money.  \n\n\nWhile the cybertruck won't sell by the millions, the tech platform that it, will contribute immeasurably towards future cars/tech. 48v alone will be huge. allow for the reduction of wiring, simplification/standardization of systems that reduce costs, improve reliability. Steer by wire will come to all cars by 2050. or sooner. It's too good to not.  \n\n\nLCID makes 4 door sedans. Clearly they do not realize Tesla *exists*. You don't make something to compete with the 'king'. you make something they do not... but I digress. (And do not own any LCID).\n\n  \nI look for things that I think will payoff. Not a quick buck. I don't day trade. I buy and hold. I know tech. I know cars.  Only EVs have a potential 100% market share.

So put in the effort.  \nOhh, it's not tech, but I see 'fat/diet' pills as being ***huge***.

Hey, myself included! \n\nIgnoring for the sake of investing side effects/etc, I think that a pill that 'makes you thin'. would make **billions**. Now it's a race to who has the best pill. \n\nAAPL feels stagnant to me, the hardware is 'old news', no one needs a faster phone every year. App store makes a ton of cash, so that's good. Their VR headset was a joke, but it's only v1. it's a tech platform, that should, when it gets cheaper / more common, create a huge opportunity for apps to jump from phone to VR with only slight changes. I haven't dug too deep, but I assume my iPhone apps would run on that thing. And while I'm not dropping $5k on one today (it's 5k? or 4?) someday... when it's $2k.. sure why not.

They take parts from hundreds of other companies, put them together and sell you a car. And that model has worked rather well for 100 years or so. \n\nHowever, *welcome to the iPhone age.* Where it's **not** enough that the device be a phone. It has to be 100 different things that all work together in a tight, seamless, cohesive, easy to use system. So, in 2023, it's not enough to assemble a \"car\". What was once a luxury and a 6\" GPS in your dash is now center to your car and your life. This screen that used to do 1 thing, now has to do 100 things. and more everyday. And companies like Tesla, who built the car in-house, and own every part and every line of code can do magical things like software updates that affect literally every device inside the car.  Even my keyfob had a firmware update a few years ago.  On the flip side Ford's CEO discussed how they couldn't update the brakes (IIRC) or something on the Lightning because Bosch owned that 'part'. which, does not result in a cohesive vehicle. If you watch Sandy Munro tear down (disassemble) the Mach-E. the HVAC system is a nightmare hodgepodge of wiring, hoses, fluids, etc. While the Tesla with it's full systems integration is not only more elegant, but MUCH more advanced, thus cheaper and better.\n\nMy point is that Stellantis *assembles* cars.  Can they make the leap to building cars? I don't know. Will *suppliers* step up and allow legacy to build 'modern' cars the way they built older ones? \n\nI don't know. In that scenario, you give up control for (alleged) cost reduction.  I do think suppliers want to stay in business. they want to make money, and thus will adapt, in time, to making modern parts. Or.. they go bust right?\n\nI do like the looks of the RAM EV. but as soon as I signed up I was spammed with dealer crap about the gas ones. Clearly they do not know their customers 1 bit.

But as for the brands I see that they own... I'm not really feeling... inspired. But that doesn't mean they are bad. Honda made more money selling mopeds than cars initially.

Then another company cuts another 10% etc etc, and by 2030, we have batteries that are twice the capacity at half the cost of 2023.\n\nMaybe look at power companies too.

This nearly line for line btw.\n\n>\"I forgot how to use my powers!\"  \n>  \n>\"Just remember you're a super fancy sassy awesome black woman!\"  \n>  \n>\"Oh yea!\" - The character then goes on to activate her powers and turn the tide of the battle.\n\nIts not MCU fatigue, its poor product fatigue. Product that is catered to a very small audience. MCU isn't the only area Disney is failing in. Their latest in-house animation film, Wish, bombed as well and has lost money.\n\n The brilliance of Disney was that is was apolitical and they were selling to everyone. With the current leadership, they've actively alienated 1/2 of their customers.\n\nYou've got poor product, alienated customers and an out of touch leadership. Combine that with an \"angel investor\" hostile takeover, public hostility becoming more and more prevalent, I see Disney under the current board as a loss leader.\n\nStock prices haven't been this low since 2014 and are down from an all time high of $197 and change. The only reason its bounced up is manipulation and typical cost cutting to shore up prices.

{"title": "Final Update: What happened after YOLOing my life savings.", "selftext": "Appreciate everyone here who was rooting for me. It’s certainly been a wild ride. For those new here, I YOLOd my life savings of 38k into META calls on Tuesday that expire this Friday. I ended up selling my META calls yesterday for a 10k loss, then like a true regard YOLOd the rest into 🕹️🛑 options that became near worthless overnight.  I currently have only 5k left from the original 38k. To make things worse, I woke up from my sleepless night to see that META rocketed this morning and if I had just held one more day I would’ve been up to 140k at today’s peak.\n\nAfter that crazy YOLO went as bad as it possibly could, I want to reiterate that I’ll be alright financially - yes I lost like 90% of my life savings but I have no debt and some money in my checking account to live on while I’m working part-time and even a bit to cover any emergencies. I am only 20 years old and I still got time to set myself up financially (because of my ACT score I got a full ride to a private University so I don’t have any student loans. And yes, just because I’m academically smart doesn’t mean I’m financially smart as you all can see 😆).\n\nI’ve always considered myself a workaholic and I almost never spend any money on things that I don’t need, so I amassed that money doing various jobs like fast food, food delivery, and internships whenever I had free time throughout my teenage years (saying this because some people were assuming this was my parents’ money). It’s time to save up again and move on past this loss. I’m obviously not doing the greatest mentally but a few people have reached out which I really appreciate and I know it’ll get better. Also, I think it’s important to note that I YOLOd the money with the mentally to take full responsibility and accept the loss no matter how severe. I’ve always wanted to do something crazy and illogical and decided to just go for it. We only get one shot at life, why not do something insane? When I’m 80 I know I’ll look back at this thinking of how much of an idiot I was but at the same time kind of glad that I wanted to do something so insane and had the balls to just go for it. You only live once, right? I hope this makes people feel better about their losses, and serves as a warning to those considering doing something as stupid as I did. Long live feta, and FUCK META ✌️\n\nEdit: Here are the links to my two original posts, the first is the META YOLO and the second is the regarded GME YOLO.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18bqx23/i\\_bet\\_my\\_entire\\_life\\_saving\\_on\\_meta\\_calls\\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18bqx23/i_bet_my_entire_life_saving_on_meta_calls_that/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18chko9/update\\_yesterdays\\_meta\\_yolo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18chko9/update_yesterdays_meta_yolo/)\n\nSecond Edit: I forgot to mention that I dumped the remaining 5k into C3.ai calls.

Then say I make a capital gain of 9000$ in year 2023. How much capital gain will I be taxed on?\"\n\nIn your scenario, here's how the capital gains tax would be calculated:\n\n**Year 2022:**\n\n* Capital loss: $10,000\n* Deductible against ordinary income: $3,000\n* Capital loss carryover: $7,000 ($10,000 - $3,000)\n\n**Year 2023:**\n\n* Capital gain: $9,000\n* Capital loss carryover applied: $7,000\n* Net capital gain: $2,000 ($9,000 - $7,000)\n\n**Tax on capital gains:**\n\n* Tax rate: Depends on your income tax bracket. Assuming a marginal tax rate of 22% (for illustrative purposes):\n* Tax owed: $2,000 x 22% = $440\n\nTherefore, you would be taxed on a capital gain of **$2,000** and would owe **$440** in taxes.\n\n**Remaining capital loss carryover:**\n\n* Since you only used $7,000 of your capital loss carryover in 2023, you would still have $7,000 - $2,000 = **$5,000** of unused capital losses to carry over to 2024.\n\n**Additional points to consider:**\n\n* This is a simplified example and assumes certain tax rates. It's important to consult a tax professional for personalized advice based on your specific income and tax situation.\n* Remember that capital loss carryovers can be used indefinitely until they are exhausted.\n* Different types of capital gains (short-term and long-term) may be taxed at different rates.\n\nI hope this helps!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Look up tax loss harvesting, people will purposely lose a ton on realized losses so when they make a large realized gain in future years they do not owe tax on the gain.

Over those amounts, you start paying wealth taxes on total worldwide assets, irrespective of growth and depreciation. Capital gains/dividends also applies.  Guess which province doesn't have the wealth tax, Madrid, where the politicians live...lol.  trying to grow your assets by 5% a year for retirement? Give the government 1% of it **every year** on the total amount, then taxes on anything drawn down, on top.\n\nThere are other provinces who scrapped the wealth tax too, so the middle class that can, move to those provinces, reducing the tax income in provinces that didn't. To claw that extra 1% from **net** assets, they lose 40%+ of income, property, sales tax etc etc. \n\nAll the Mediterranean coastal provinces **except** catalonia (Barcelona) scrapped it, guess what's happening haha. Bye... House prices (and thus tax income) in those other provinces go *brrrrrrrrrr*. Those provinces are buying marble lined paseos and shit whilst Catalonia falls to pieces with crime, litter, pollution, squatters, its becoming a shithole. New build houses in valencia/alicante province can be €5000 a square metre, that's more than palm beach in miami. We pay 10% property transfer tax or 21% sales tax on newly built houses here... tax income goes *mmmmmm* as its €3000 a square metre for old 90s crap ffs too. \n\nThe poor scream 'tax the 'rich!'
