The next-best performer was Coinbase, which shot up 423% largely because of bitcoin‚Äôs rebound.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve setting the stage for interest rate cuts in the year ahead and more retailers signing onto Affirm‚Äôs buy now, pay later offerings, or BNPL, fear of a doomsday scenario for the company has faded. Shares of Affirm got a big boost in November after the company inked an expanded partnership with Amazon, and BNPL purchases hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.\n\n‚ÄúThe expectation was the consumer was going to be toast, unemployment was going to pick up and higher interest rates would destroy everything, and the exact opposite has happened on all fronts,‚Äù said Tom Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital, which doesn‚Äôt have a position in the stock. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why you have a scenario where Affirm can start to perform.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/28/affirms-stock-quintupled-this-year-beating-all-tech-peers.html", "id": "18t2d9j", "created_utc": 1703791976.0, "score": 471, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "Broke now, broker later.", "score": 445, "replies": [{"body": "buy now poor later", "score": 58, "replies": []}, {"body": "[ Removed by Reddit ]", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "Argentina & Venezuela would like a word with you good sir/madam", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Don't know why you're bring downvoted, you aren't wrong.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "What did he say?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Don't know why you're being downvoted, you aren't wrong.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "There‚Äôs a new company that finances your weed purchases online.

Allocating a small percentage of your portfolio to individual stocks is a wise decision, but that's due to limiting risk, it has nothing to do with the comment that these are expensive stocks. Expensive is a relative term. A $50 stock could be more expensive than a $500 stock. The expense is judged in terms of P/E ratio, where P is the price of the stock and E is their most recent annual earnings. When you buy a stock, it's not a number on a screen, it's a tiny piece of a company. Now, if I can own a piece of a company for $10, and they produce $1 in annual earning per share, that's a 10 P/E and could be an excellent investment opportunity IF that company will continue indefinitely and perhaps even grow (growth is also relative to the rest of the economy). In contrast a company with only $1 in earnings but a $50 stock price is a much riskier proposition, because that company would need to grow tremendously for it to be eventually be able to pay out dividends and increase the stock price through buy backs to reward me for my initial investment. In simplified terms, the P/E reflects the growth expectation that's currently priced into the stock. If it exceeds that expectation you do well. If it falls short of that expectation, you'll do poorly. The entire S&P500 is currently at an elevated P/E but few moreso than the \"magnificent 7.\" If you've owned any of them for a long time, sure, keep holding, but now is not a good time to buy into MSFT or NVDA, nor AMD, nor COST.

It's super effective! Finding Stark. Every party needs a tank class. I should know, I used to play one in FFXIV. The axe wielding one too, as a matter of fact, also called Warrior. The fantasy tropes established by Dungeons and Dragons decades ago are important and should always be followed. This show doesn't concern itself with reinventing fantasy tropes because it has much bigger fishes to fry and I'm thankful for that. \n\n**7-9**\n\nThis is the first proper arc of Frieren's new journey. Now with both Fern and Stark in tow, it's time for Madhouse to earn their stripes animating fights and shit. The first few episodes really made you wonder how and why Madhouse was chosen to animate this manga. But this manga was being serialized in a shounen rag in Japan for a reason and it's becoming more clear now. \n\n**Additional Comments**\n\nThe Yoasobi OP for this show seemed pretty out of place going in but now that we're pivoting to the meat of the story it starts feeling better.

Doesn‚Äôt mean musk has been doing his duty according to the long list of rules you are surely about to reply to me. \n\nBut if 90-95% of people who bothered to vote want him to stay before the launch of the cybertruck, when tesla was doing worse both as a stock and a company (margins seem to be bottoming according to both the general price trends and WS expectations), then perhaps it is time for you to reassess where you want your money to be given that ultimately, musks duty is to shareholders and the vast, VAST majority want him to stay.\n\nOthers have pointed out in posts about you as well that while you are extremely thorough and willing to write up ANYTHING and EVERYTHING you deem bad about Musk and how useless he is in Tesla as a company now (insert the quote you have used multiple times about musk saying that Tesla essentially tuns itself now and he has very little to do), you are very happy to ignore it whenever the same hardworking and talented Tesla employees praise musk. (https://amp.smh.com.au/business/companies/thanks-for-firing-me-ex-tesla-workers-praise-elon-musk-on-way-out-20180614-p4zle2.html) Musk was also praised by franz who said that the cybertruck would not have been possible without him. \n\nSurveys like (https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-not-alienating-ev-buyers-tesla-survey/amp/) while coming from Teslarati also shows things are not quite so black and white.\n\nI have my problems with the way musk does some things/did some things. I also will sell my shares if i get an indication that Musk is leaving.\n\nFortunately, at least 95% of shareholders seem to be in agreement with me.\n\nProbably gonna get downvoted for this, but with 44% of tesla currently being held by instituitions (https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&subView=institutional#:~:text=Tesla%20Inc%20(NASDAQ%3ATSLA)&text=Institutional%20ownership%20of%20TSLA%20stands,the%20Motor%20Vehicles%20industry%20average.) i‚Äôd say its fairly unlikely the instituitions are literally all made up of simps blindly voting in Musk as well.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla only being 44% institutionally held is rather low for a megacap, and by far the lowest of the Magnificent 7 members.

For the most part, these funds will vote the recommendation of proxy advisory firms like Glass Lewis.  Vanguard, a notoriously cheap company, isn't going to spend a lot of money on their own analysts to do this work (this would raise expense ratios for the fund holders, and their objective is rock bottom expense ratios).  \n\nThey definitely aren't \"blind simps\".

It's rebound o'clock, baby! And why now, you ask? Two words: Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)!\n\n**üõçÔ∏è BNPL Christmas Surge:** With the holiday season upon us, people are swiping that plastic like there's no tomorrow.

This guy is like the Elon Musk of fintech (without the tweets). He's building an all-star team, poaching talent from Intuit, Walmart, and Amex. The focus? Small businesses, baby! Say adios to Square (SQ), because PYPL's got its eyes set on that small biz throne.\n\n**ü§ë The Potential Squeeze:** Currently down 70% from ATH, this bad boy is prime for a squeeze. Remember when it hit $180? We're not promising tendies, but we're saying the potential is there, and potential is what we live for!\n\n**üöÄ Why PYPL?
