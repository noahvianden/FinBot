{"title": "My employee called me a 🌈🐻 and then quit", "selftext": "So, I’m a supervisor at Wendy’s and I had a 1 to 1 with one of my more problematic employees. This kid was a full charity case diversity hire, it might be an adult, but it has the mental age of a 4 year old and ticked nearly every box for learning and mental disabilities. It’s so bad I struggle to believe it’s human, it’s full on regarded in every sense of the word. I don’t know how, but it somehow managed to operate the till and thinks that’s the height of modern technology, so much so that it thinks Wendy’s is a global tech giant about to take on Apple.\n\nAnyway, during our 1 to 1 I wanted to try to relate to this thing a little bit better. I know it’s interested in the market (it talks about shorting Apple all the time because it will make the difference in ensuring Wendy’s outperforms them) and this was just as the interest rate decision was going to be made and all of a sudden this thing shouts at me, “oh shit you’re a 🌈🐻 too?!?”. Now, on the side I may or may not have been embezzling money from Wendy’s and may or may not be down $128k. To say I’m f-ed is an understatement. I may or may not have been shorting BTC because it’s obviously a Ponzi. Now, say what you will but as long as I can keep this secret long enough, I will hit the jackpot. I’ve gone with 4x 0DTE OTM options because I know it will eventually collapse, and when that happens this will be the best way to profit from it. They’re virtually free and will pay off millions. It’s only logical.\n\nAnyway, now I’m freaking out that it figured out what I was doing. So, I’ve got to fire him right but I need HRs approval. I tell it that, and it suddenly mumbles some random incoherent mess at me and quits! I was honestly relieved, I no longer had to deal with it, my secret is safe, and I can now fire the guy I pay to wipe this things bottom after it sh*ts. I never liked that guy, but funnily enough no one wants to wipe for other people.\n\nProblem is though, now this thing is hiding out behind the dumpster at the back of the shop. Is it trying to ambush me? I’ve tried calling the police since it’s trespassing, but I can’t get it to go away. It keeps telling me it can offer me a good time for $20. Is that code for telling me it knows I’ve been making $20 bets on BTC using Wendy’s money?\n\nIn hindsight, I don’t actually think it’s smart enough to know what I’m doing, so it was probably an overreaction. But I am still paranoid about it all.\n\nIs anyone able to provide some advice on what to do with this thing? I don’t need any investing advice, I’ve got it all under control.\n\nEdit:\n\nI think my employee might also be active on this in. I’ve just come across this post which appears to be him:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/ptV2b19K1l\n\nPlease be nice to him, he’s a little bit special.", "id": "18i1s3f", "created_utc": 1702533043.0, "score": 484, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 271, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|30|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "...They called you a gay bear...?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b56fn1knj76c1.jpeg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b741b561c6c887448461a65877000b85a7be5a", "score": 1606, "replies": [{"body": "Sir, this is a McDonalds.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "No this is Arby's!

In our modern interpretation of this definition, we treat the three criteria—depth, diffusion, and duration—as at least somewhat interchangeable. That is, while each criterion needs to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions revealed by one criterion may partially offset weaker indications from another.

Because a recession must influence the economy broadly and not be confined to one sector, the committee emphasizes economy-wide measures of economic activity. It views real gross domestic product (GDP) as the single best measure of aggregate economic activity. This concept is measured two ways by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)—from the product side and from the income side. Because the two measures have strengths and weaknesses and differ by a statistical discrepancy, the committee considers real GDP and real gross domestic income (GDI) on an equal footing. It also considers carefully total payroll employment as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\n> The traditional role of the committee is to maintain a monthly chronology of business cycle turning points. Because the BEA figures for real GDP and real GDI are only available quarterly, the committee considers a variety of monthly indicators to determine the months of peaks and troughs. It places particular emphasis on two monthly measures of activity across the entire economy: (1) personal income less transfer payments, in real terms, which is a monthly measure that includes much of the income included in real GDI; and (2) payroll employment from the BLS. Although these indicators are the most important measures considered by the committee in developing its monthly business cycle chronology, it does not hesitate to consider other indicators, such as real personal consumption expenditures, industrial production, initial claims for unemployment insurance, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price changes, and household employment, as it deems valuable.
