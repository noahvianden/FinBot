{"title": "First year results", "selftext": "12/1/23 officially marks my first full year of running a csp strategy I expect will work for the foreseeable future and be adequate to support me in retirement. \n\nFor context:\n\n-Mid 40s\n\n-I manage what would be considered a decent size portfolio but most of my assets are tied up until I quit/retire, hopefully soon. \n\n-Have bought and sold stocks off and on for ~25 years with varying success. Had not made any real money in the markets til the last 4 years, since I never had much to work with in the first place. \n\nI had been looking into selling options for the last few years, I thought there was something there and what I liked most was that you get paid regardless which way the market moves. But I didn't know what I didn't know and had always heard it was basically gambling, so not confident on pulling the trigger just yet. I had joined wsb just to watch the s-show that was gme and at one point r/thetagang gets mentioned, I wish I remembered the context, but it was enough to pique my interest. Joined thetagang and started reading, wow, it was like a different language. Dte, delta, theta, strangles, straddles, itm, atm, otm, etc. But fortunately I ran across u/scottishtrader. I dug into his tutorial posts and man the light just got turned on for me! That was what I was looking for. \n\nMy first foray into selling CSPs was brutal and over in a matter of a month. The stocks that had tripled my account in 2020 turned out to be not so great in 2022, including for selling csp on. Minus 15%, just like that, I closed everything and took a month off. But I still knew there was something there, which lead to how I sell CSPs now:\n\n-Went with a broker that pays interest on cash used as collateral for csp. \n\n-I only sell csp on spy. Why? It's unlikely to drop as much as a single company can and does. I don't need to research minute financial details. It's the bar (s&p) by which everything else is measured. It's design basically guarantees it will always go up. \n\n-I roll and never take assignment. \n\n-I sell into rising vix, close into dropping vix. I avoid guessing at when to do this by selling 25-30 delta puts/30 dte using ~20% of my port and rolling up at ~50% gain or closing a put if challenged and selling two at a lower strike and/or later date for a healthy credit. \n\n-I don't use margin. \n\nI had hoped to make 1%/month and amazingly, that's exactly the result from 12/1/22 to 12/1/23, fidelity has my 1 year return listed as 12.00%. I had actually been ahead of spy in the last couple months but a 9% November for spy put it back ahead of me by 2%. My worst month was +0.2%. There were two months where my market activity was negative, but the interest from mm funds made up for it plus some. My worst drawdown was -1.5%, not bad considering spy has had drawdowns of 9% and 10% that I've had to manage through. Best month was around +2%. My strategy severely lags spy regardless which way it moves, but that's what I want, low risk. \n\nI'm posting all this so that hopefully my experience helps someone and also I am always open to receiving critique that betters my strategy. \n\nI'm not suggesting this is anywhere near the best approach to selling puts or a good fit for where others are at. It's just what is working for me and my situation and my experience level. I expect to continue to evolve from here. \n\nAnd this sub and I are beyond blessed to have u/scottishtrader guiding us along. \n\nHave a great day.\n\nEdit: I'm not trying to beat spy. I'm trying to get a more predictable and less risky return than spy provides. I thought I clearly showed that this is indeed happening but I guess not.

When Fama published his Nobel winning paper it was a known fact that size of companies was an alpha predictor. Not anymore. I can come up with many such examples. Trading firms do not tend to share information across groups for precisely that reason. \n\nThat’s why I take umbrage with your statement of “then show us something that we can all follow”. I have shared my trading ideas and what I think is better for new traders than the wheel. While most people here love the wheel as a trade for beginners, most people here are beginners too. From what I’ve seen most of the posters on PM traders do not wheel and the people in that sub that have posted here say different things but at some point the downvote deluge gets annoying.\n\nI remember a very detailed post about a year ago explaining why the wheel is inefficient as a theta mining strategy because of the risk/ reward ratio once you are very close to assignment. Very interesting read, I actually learned something from it (I’ll add it later, maybe). That posts was downvoted to oblivion as you can imagine.\n\nI personally don’t like your trading style because of your gamma risk and an assumption that things will work out in the end if the stock is a good one. I think a new investors (and implicitly all since I still do it) would be better served by much tighter loss protection (and so do [others](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1063702374232064000?lang=en)). \n\nWe could have an enriching discussion on said topics, but instead we have the same sacred totem discussions.

In essence, we have to take your word you have a better strategy but we can't see or use it so that is the reason for the downvotes and consternation.  \n\nOne more comment is that the way I trade which closes around a 50% profit, or rolls when ATM and keeps rolling reduces gamma risk substantially.  In my wheel trading plan I am assigned at most 1 to 3 times per year, and many times only hold the shares for less than a month because of the premium collected.   Gamma is only a factor if I wanted to close the option and not take assignment, so this is not a factor in the way I trade.  \n\nWhile not 100% of the time, things do \"work out\" over time a very high percent of the time.  It is not unusual to see posts with high 90% win rates before being assigned, and it should be very rare to not have a winning trade so this is far more than an assumption.  \n\nI've been active on reddit for more than 6 years and posted my trading plan over 5 years ago, so I'm wide open to having discussions, and have had many discussions, on all of the topics and welcome more.  Since I have shared a detailed trading plan that has worked well for me over the years I obviously work to counter comments that are simply not true, such as backtesting shows the wheel can't work, or the many about buying and holding being outright better.  \n\nIn summary, if you are saying you have a better strategy or concept then the wheel and are willing to share it, then we're all ready to see it, myself included!  I've always said there may be other strategies that may be better, and which newer traders can successfully trade, but there have not been many posts like this.  \n\nIf you are trying to \"protect\" new traders from what you see as the downsides of the wheel, then offering details and alternatives is the way.   BTW, and again being direct and candid, I went back and reviewed your posts which are posted in a condescending way and self proclaimed rants.  You went to a fancy school and got a fancy degree, but this is not the way to win people over, especially on reddit.  \n\nThe saying you can \"win more with honey than vinegar\" comes into play here.  You may not like theta trades or the wheel, but why fight against it so vigorously?  It's like those who post on options subreddits that options are evil and can never work.  Why do they do this?  It seems they think they may be truly helping people when what they do is eroding their credibility and gathering downvotes . . .  \n\nOne last thing is that it is not a 'hive mindset' but that thetagang is where those of us who sell options come to gather and share.  While you are obviously convinced you are correct in your views, these will get downvoted when there are those of us who are successful doing what someone say cannot be done as it is the mechanism of reddit to indicate the common view.  This is like going to the r/Corvette sub and saying \"Vettes Suck\" which will be downvoted.  \n\nThis is my sincere and respectful way to engage and have an enriching discussion that I, and others are happy to have.  Just keep in mind that backtests and papers do not count for much for those of us who are trading a strategy successfully for long periods of time.  Opening a dialog based on your personal experience is far more helpful and that includes sharing what that is, which unfortunately you are unable to do.
