They're fuelled by the need and desire for vehicles.  We've seen that in the last couple years as auto sales backlog has been massive even as there has been historical rate jacking.  \n\nOn that same front, vehicles remain, on average, older than ever.  Something like 12-13 years.  Replacement is not a luxury, it's a necessity.  Demand isn't going away.  \n\nHis comments on legacy makers now struggling with EVs is a false bear.  Sure, that's been a fun headline.  But legacy makers have an ace in the hole in the form of hybrids, which I've long maintained are a win-win for buyers and sellers.  The legacy makers' hybrids are a clever and cheap ass solution, providing 20-40% better fuel economy but not costing much more than a conventional ICE vehicle.  And customers love them.  They have microscopic 1-2 kwhr batteries which benefits the makers on the cost side.  They alleviate buyer concerns about charging and range.  I know numerous old folks who have bought hybrids, and in their minds, they own \"an electric car\".  These will be a great area of marketing and sales strength.  Hyundai has absolutely murdered their competitors with these, overtaking Honda (!) in sales last year while also stealing a bunch of Tesla's lunch.\n\nJonas' concerns about R&D spending are already solved.  The big makers have already done the big work.  Everyone from Ford to GM to Toyota to Hyundai have fully developed products on the road and on the lots.  EVs and hybrids are developed, so that R&D can be, and probably is, being right sized already.   \n\nAnd contrary to what non-automotive people say and think, an EV/hybrid and an ICE vehicle *are* mostly the same, and they *do* need substantial repair and maintenance and servicing.  \n\nSo I think the auto industry is actually in a very good spot right now.  \n\nI sold long term F this year before the strikes and rebought when it was in the $9's.

I think it's definitely possible to get there, but robotics is the area where AI is the farthest behind.\n\nMusk has said that the Tesla Bot is basically FSD AI, unchanged in a humanoid form factor, but that's just not true. Self-driving is an area where it's super easy for Tesla to collect lots of training data. The robot is not like that at all. The kinds of tasks that a humanoid robot has to do are also a lot more complex. For example, if you want to drive from point A to B, we have software like Google Maps that can almost instantly generate turn-by-turn directions for the entire path. If I ask you to bake me a cake, in a new house where you've never been before, and you you't know what ingredients I have in my pantry, it's a much harder problem space in terms of problem solving, fine motor control, etc.\n\nIn order to source training data for the robot efficiently, Tesla needs to pull a magic trick out of a hat. Something like having the robot learn from watching other people doing things in YouTube videos. Leverage existing video data to build a world model the robot can use, instead of training only from first-person data like the car. The problem is that this doesn't directly translate to what actions the robot needs to do. You can watch thousands of hours of people breakdancing, you still need to practice a lot to become a good break dancer. Your understanding of the world as an external observer watching it doesn't immediately translate into usable skills you can perform.\n\nIMO Tesla is well-placed in terms of manufacturing expertise and also in terms of being able to fund this project for multiple years without giving up. It's not unthinkable that the robot could perform some simple repetitive tasks in a factory setting, but I think it's important to keep your expectations low. FSD V12 and the next-gen EV will be what fuel the next growth wave.\n\nFor the Tesla Bot, I would personally be very excited if it does anything useful in a Tesla factory in the next year or two, but productizing and selling it is a whole other ball game.

Tesla already has millions of cars on the road. With the robots, you have a chicken vs egg problem.

It is notable for being mentioned by Godzilla Minus One director Takashi Yamazaki as his personal favorite Godzilla movie, and is also credited with influencing his script for G-1.\n\nThe film is unusual for being the only one in the 70 year history of the franchise which reverses the roles of Godzilla and King Ghidorah when they both appear together, as Godzilla is the bad guy and Ghidorah is the good guy in this one. Mothra and Baragon appear as well, and as usual Baragon being on the B-tier of Toho's kaiju stable gets left out of the film's title. \n\nThe basic story of the film, involving Godzilla being possessed by the spirits of Japan's war dead who were left behind by the Imperial Army during WWII, is a clear inspiration for G-1. This extremely angry version of Godzilla proceeds to smash the fuck out of Japan and also is shown on screen killing humans, which is rare in Japanese kaiju films. The kaijus kill humans on screen all the time in the American MonsterVerse franchise which is why many Americans don't know this. This again carries over to G-1 where he kills humans on screen quite a lot.\n\nGMK, and also the Gamera trilogy, are liberally referenced and borrowed from in the MV films, something Kaneko has commented on. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and the MV film people obviously really like Kaneko's films. The climactic scene in GMK where Mothra dies and infuses her life force into Ghidorah to resurrect him so he can defeat Godzilla is repeated almost exactly but with the roles reversed in the MV entry Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019).\n\nGMK is brimming with impressive special effects featuring both CG renders and people in rubber suits, filled with some pretty awesome kaiju fights, and backed by one of the best stories and themes in the franchise. Today GMK is regarded as one of the best entries in the Toho series of films. It's not hard to see why this film has been so influential in the genre and why so many Godzilla films after have been inspired by it.

G2K is notable for being the last Godzilla movie to get a wide North American release until Godzilla Minus One, 23 years later.\n\nThis movie is actually pretty interesting in concept. Made very quickly in 1999 by Toho, it was kind of a \"rapid response\" film made as an answer to the widely hated 1998 first American Godzilla film. Fans of the Big G on both sides of the Pacific agree to deride Roland Emmerich's giant flaming pile of shit, and at the time Toho was extremely displeased with how everyone's favorite kaiju was depicted in his American debut.\n\nG2K is an utterly conventional Godzilla movie in almost all respects. The humans have one guy who thinks Godzilla is good and one guy who thinks Godzilla is evil and should be killed. The military shoots ineffectually at Godzilla. Godzilla himself is played by a man in a suit, characteristic of all Japanese Godzilla films until Shin Godzilla in 2016 when Japan finally made him CG rendered. Said man in a suit smashes miniature Tokyo in gloriously effective manner.\n\nWhat's actually notable then is the references to both G98, which is treated with contempt, and also the direct references to Roland Emmerich's previous film Independence Day (1996). G2K seems like a very direct repudiation of everything the American attempt at Godzilla stood for, which is good because that movie fucking sucked and everyone knows it.\n\nDuring this movie, a goofy looking CG rendered alien spaceship thing blows up a building with a death ray in a very familiar scene homage to Independence Day, and all hope for humanity seems lost until Godzilla shows up to save the day. Then he proceeds to destroy Tokyo anyways over the closing credits, because first of all fuck Independence Day and second fuck G98. If his rubber suit could manage it, he would be flipping the middle finger at Hollywood while shouting \"Go fuck yourself!\" Unfortunately he can only roar, but at least it's the good classic roar.\n\nThis movie only exists to memorialize how much Toho's executives hated the first American Godzilla, and beyond that it's pretty bare bones. Fortunately, it's also only 107 minutes long, and Godzilla himself is in the movie a lot so you aren't getting ripped off on quality Godzilla on-screen time when he's smashing Tokyo, shooting his atomic breath at a UFO, and also wrestling with an alien monster that looks just tiny bit too much like a deformed version of Zilla in G98.\n\nFinal Rating:\nFuck Roland Emmerich/10", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/kxb5lppezj6c1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc3d7718e5008463882eb10bbd93452fbda08ab2\n\nBears literally 💀", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can't wait to try new park 3d view on my one gimpy tesla w no uss", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I've a 2018 Model 3 and have 2 hurdles - uss and hw 2.5.

A huge number of businesses cannot survive current interest rates when they refinance. This is why small cap companies have rallied very hard in the last couple days as more rate cuts sooner seem likelier.\n\n- Extremely large public debt load. Public debt crowds out private capital and is generally less efficient and more wasteful. Infrastructure arguably has a multiplier effect but that's 2% of federal spending and half of that is outright waste. If you are young you know how bad education is. Local governments bankrupted themselves to pay for that, enjoy the bill.\n\n- Potential GDP is in a significant decline. You can see official estimates and how they have changed in the last few years. I think official forecasts overestimate the future also. This happens from lower productivity, due to lower labor (smaller participation and aging workforce) and less human capital (experienced workers retire). If you're anywhere in the productive workforce you know how few useful people actually make things happen. There is a crisis of competency. In economics when GDP is higher than potential GDP, there is inflation as supply tries to keep up by making use of more expensive inputs (ie, overtime, running equipment more and wearing it out, drawing down inventories etc) but it is inevitably followed by contraction.\n\n- Deglobalization. In economics you learn that trade creates additional things in the world because people, firms and countries have relative advantages in making things. This drove a huge amount of wealth creation since the 80s, on net. Some people lost out but the overall gains for all people were massive. This trend is in a hard reverse. When everything is in shortage there will be contraction.\n\n- Energy. Everything uses energy as an input and there is a global campaign to make it much more expensive. Making energy more expensive reduces supply, which leads to contraction. Since energy requires a very significant lead time of years and billions of dollars, the last ten years of non-investment is catching up and will be a major drag that gets worse even if large investments start now (they aren't).\n\n- Quantitative tightening. The money supply decreasing is deflationary, wages and prices are sticky, so prices tend to go down the hard way via layoffs. That's why central banks prefer slight inflation. Right now there's still excess liquidity exiting the Fed's reverse repo money trap but that will evaporate in about three months at current rates. Nothing causes recessions like a liquidity crisis, and this is a crisis that will be very sudden because the current pace of money destruction has been outweighed by the drawdown in the RRP facility.\n\nWhat it will look like is just everything getting slowly worse, more stupid, and more expensive. There might be a sudden liquidity crisis in the next year but that will be fixed by going back to QE and monetizing the debt. Then in 30 years maybe will have a 'new dollar' that is the old dollar with three zeros lopped off the end.\n\nYou should just buy SPY and not worry too much.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You should've seen the 1 Million government jobs added which isn't really good for the economy.\n\n-GDP is primarily based of spending. We've seen credit card debt, which is actually bullish because it's a debt based system. However, credit card delinquencies are up, usually that's bad because it's irrelevant what utilization is as long as it gets paid off. The fact that banks are getting balsy by getting bailed out and extending lines of credit to people who probably shouldn't have it doesn't help.\n\n-Refinancing starts next year for alot of debt. There is no way the rate cuts proposed can save the brutal destruction that will happen if they refinance at even 4.00%. Which is why 6 or 7 are being priced into the market. Not bullish. We have an economy on sticks. Strong economies shouldn't implode when debt actually starts becoming refinanced. \n\n-Its very similar to the \"housing is going to collapse\" narrative. Interest rates went up. No housing collapse, because everything is fixed.\n\n-Next year, variable rate loans roll over and THAT is going to hit the fan. The bulls are pricing in the fed mega cuts in order to avoid that, hence why KRE is pumping. Banking is such a high risk low reward for bulls but they might be right. Lag impacts if you will.\n\n-Overnight repo has been mitigating M2 money contraction. Meaning we had liquidity injection this year, very much like what China does frequently causing stocks to rise. Repo is draining fast and will probably be 0 early next year. M2 was unmitigated during post COVID run up causing all time highs. We haven't even rolled much of that off the fed balance sheet before we had to inject again. (You should see the nice dump in the overnight repo as a result of this blowoff top)\n\n-Oil defeated the last CPI print. Oil has been dumping in expectation of a recession. Oil dumping is only bullish in an oversupply based off production, not off of a lack of demand. Wealth and energy are proportional. You want to use energy to produce.\n\n-The amount of intervention that has happened is staggering. Why is my student loan payment due in 2024? Why?

Of the [indicators closely tracked by NBER](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/dashboard/84408), only Industrial Production is currently down year-over-year, and that only slightly. \n\nHowever, there are a number of [leading indicators](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/dashboard/8084) which often indicate a coming recession. Many of which are currently negative. I happen to think these all could fail. But there are so many it is worth considering them.\n\n1. The most well known here is probably the first, the yield curve. We have been hearing recession forecasts since the moment it inverted (and really even well before that). But the actual past behavior of this indicator has been for recession to occur quite some time later, and the most recent three recessions occurred only after yield curve normalization, which hasn't even happened yet.  So a recession starting maybe a year from now might be *most* consistent with past behavior of this indicator. A counterargument here is that the yield curve inverts when the Fed inverts it. It usually precedes recession because the Fed usually overshoots. If the Fed gets policy right for a change, this indicator should fail. \n\n2. Next we have the labor market indicators. None of them is a strong indicator at this point, but the unemployment rate is slightly higher than it was a year ago, the quits rate has come down quite a bit from it's peak, and continued claims have also bottomed and are higher than a year ago and slowly increasing. Overall, the deterioration is slight so far, but if it continued over the next couple of quarters, it might start to look like the classic start of a recession. \n\n3. The next group of indicators shown above are housing related. Slumps in things like Private Residential Fixed Investment, New Home Sales, and even things like Retail Furniture and Home furnishings often preceded recession. However, these are also obviously related to mortgage rates, which are also significantly impacted by Fed policy (both rate policies and balance sheet policy). So the argument above may still apply: if the Fed gets policy right, these indicators could fail.\n\n4. We have also had slumps though in Corporate Profits, Commercial Bank Credit, and Real Imports. So the indicators are really adding up.\n\nUltimately, there are plenty of arguments why this time might be different. And plainly, given the inflationary overheating the economy had been experiencing, some slowing of some of these things was needed.

Business need to borrow money to function for various legitimate reasons. Higher interest can compound and if a business can’t pay back because the interest was not in the budget or the bank won’t lend, the business can be forced close or cut staff. This has a domino effect, people laid off can’t pay mortgages, bills, car payments etc. Also, people tighten spending when they get laid off. So less money going to other businesses, which causes them to cut back (fire people). If people stop spending, businesses also, may not invest in new facilities, maintenance, expansions, etc. well those are all businesses and jobs also. \n\nWhen the wealthy see a pattern like this form, they are the first to tighten the belt, lay off, take profits from the stock market etc. this will cause the market to drop.

If that happens, it will put downward pressure (recession) on the entire economy. Shipping cost goes up, so everything becomes more expensive. The cost to manufacture goes up, so the cost of goods goes up and sales go down. The cost of commuting goes up, as well as electricity and heating, so people spend less money elsewhere. People travel less which effects, airlines and the hotel industry, which also negatively effects restaurants etc. which effects the business and the workers. OPEC is why there is currently fears of a recession now that the FED has stopped raising interest rates. (BIDEN doesn’t want a recession). But investors are also afraid currently high interest rates will cause some tightening and possibly defaults on debt.\n\nA few months ago the fear of recession was because the banks were failing which triggered the trauma of 2008.

And people were very happy to attack people who didn't sell those bear theses.\n\nNow we have the next 6 months to get through, which I think may be one of the more dangerous periods because this is when people are looking for something to break... but at the same time we have to remain optimistic because the Fed Put is back, and the market will react to that until we can see it doing otherwise.

The question about the impact of tightening and the effect to CPI is not my opinion.\n\nIt's the Fed's opinion, and if they could say that their tightening was responsible for all of the CPI reduction, they would.\n\nStop and apply a little logic. If their intent is self-serving, why would they change the data to make it look like their actions had LESS effect.\n\nThis is the opposite of what happens when corrupt oligarchs manipulate data in regimes and situations where that kind of thing happens in a non-transparent way. They typically change data to make themselves look better, not less effective.\n\nBut we don't need to rely on basic logic for this assessment, because the idea that tightening cycles take up to 18 months to show demand destruction isn't a new concept, it's baked into the dynamics and always has been and shows up in every tightening cycle that exists in the past for a very simple reason: Consumers and businesses don't change their behavior until you reach a restrictive stance AND they start to feel that restriction, which means you need several months of increased debt spending before it slows anything.\n\nWe're not just savages clawing around in the muck (well, most of us, anyway) where nobody understands anything. There are dynamics and there's public data to make assessments with.\n\nI'm also aware of the change which was made to CPI last year to reduce the size of the data bucket range and push it forward. A lot of insanity happened on this sub at the time by people who don't understand basic math and statistics and data analysis concluding that the Fed was making a massive change that was going to suddenly and immediately reduce CPI to normal.\n\nPeople said that it was a secret change.

One of the main problems we have is:\n\na) there is as much people working without legal contracts (so no taxes being payed upon their income) as people that do have legal contracts. This makes for a society where only half of the working class has to pay for every penny the government spends in all of the things I listed above via taxes. As governments realize they are not getting as much money they need to pay for all this variables, they up the taxes, which results in even more people going into the non legal contract sector (their employer and them won't pay any taxes, which results in the pay being a little bit more than if it was all legal).\n\nb) governments spend more than they have and incur in printing or borrowing money from global emergency funds, which lowers the value of our currency, producing inflation and making everyone poorer month by month.
