Go look at what happened in Dec 2018. It’s called the Powell Pivot for a reason.\n\nMost other respondents didn’t get it quite right. If the Fed indicated it would cut in the next 1-6 months, then rates would drop - for everything. The Fed funds rate is 5.5%. If investors expected the Fed to drop in the near future then that would start getting priced in today. Rates for loans, mortgages, car notes, etc would drop until the spread is small between the Fed funds rate and those products. The demand to purchase debt would increase (because investors would want to lock in higher rates than the soon-to-be-even-lower-rates) and that would drive down rates.\n\nThis would ultimately have the reverse effect the Fed wants because this would stimulate the economy. That would cause inflation to rise. And the Fed wouldn’t be able to lower rates. \n\nMonetary policy is a blunt instrument. It is not precise and it also takes time to impact the economy. This makes the feds role precarious. The Fed first needs the economy to slow down more, but ideally not enter a recession, before signaling they’ll hold or even drop rates. At that point, the market lowering rates won’t be able to stimulate the economy enough to outweigh the slowing economy, so inflation won’t rise. If the Fed overshoots though (waits too long) then we’ll enter a recession. The monetary policy change of cutting rates will take a while to actually turn the economy around.

You'll have to bear (bare) with me because when I saw that I made over 8.8 thousand dollars today I immediately blew half of it on my children's preschool tuition and wasted the other half on getting caught up on my mortgage.

Will you choose the Red Pill of financial security, where you buy high quality stocks and hold them for long periods of time? Or the blue pill, where you are introduced to new chart patterns that will make you question the very fabric of financial reality? The choice is yours.\n\nIt's an easy out, and nobody will  hold it against you. If you're uncomfortable learning the truth about how the markets work, then by all means... take [THE RED PILL.](https://www.cnbc.com/mad-money/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you still here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWake up... WAKE UP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow did that blue pill taste? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome... to the real world. A world where many people have nothing... not even a Robinhood account. Above them, some people have hundreds of dollars... enough to be secure in the knowledge that they can afford food for their family for many weeks to come. Above them, a few people own a useful tool like a bicycle, giving them the elitist ability to travel 3-4 times faster than their foot-bound peers. Some people have thousands of dollars. We're getting into rarified air here... Privileged few have enough wealth to own a home. Truly wealthy individuals have vast fortunes that stretch into the hundreds of thousands of dollars - enough wealth to allow them to do no further work themselves, and instead lean on their holdings to create value on their behalf.\n\nIn a handfull of circumstances, (normally inheritance) people are able to accumulate wealth reaching into the millions of dollars. This allows them to largely distance themselves from the struggles of day-to-day life. These people are able to afford things like 'therapy', which is a ceremony in which people pay huge amounts of money to sit on a couch and complain.\n\nBut, this is not the highest amount of wealth. No, it goes much further. There are in fact people who control 10's of millions of dollars of wealth. This amount of money, converted to rice, would yield:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If you took 10 Million dollars to Target and just bought long grain rice, you could get 1,428,571 pounds of rice. Provided they had it in stock.](https://preview.redd.it/rd0km62bfs3c1.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2518592e37395496a84a95853221be92aa96854)\n\nThe amount of energy in a pound of rice is about:\n\n[Get on the stairmaster you lazy shit. ](https://preview.redd.it/wrchsjnxfs3c1.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=7614aefa58c14d74cab28f80ec7750e9ce89a908)\n\nSo if you took your $10,000,000 fortune to target and converted it to rice, and then took it home and converted it to food, you would have:\n\n(1,428,571) x (1,655) = 2,364,285,714 calories.\n\nThat, divided by the recommended calorie intake of 2000 / day would mean that if you took $10,000,000 and converted it into energy through the purchase and ingestion of target-brand long grain rice, you would have enough energy to last you 1,182,143 days. This equates to 3,238 years or roughly 45 lifetimes for the average human.\n\nAnd that assumes you're buying your rice at retail.\n\nKnowing the above, it may surprise you that some people are hoarding even more than $10,000,000. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[You've gotta be kidding me.](https://preview.redd.it/692wvb2phs3c1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32aa8a3a47db5b9c8d07a24f875149f049da06c)\n\nLook, you can see where I'm going with this. There are a lot of people who have more money than they need to survive. But the weird part about being really rich is that it doesn't mean you want to disappear and just enjoy your rice and some peace and quiet. If wealth accumulation is in your nature then it will probably remain part of your nature even after you accumulate wealth. One of the principles of life that is most useful is the idea that people don't change.\n\nFor example, Dion Sanders had nothing to prove at the end of his NFL career, and yet here we are... he's coaching college football and starring in an Amazon series whose creative underpinning seems to stem from the fact that the word 'prime' is shared between the two relevant entities.\n\nAt some point, money doesn't matter anymore. I'll let Heath Ledger deliver the punchline to the last few paragraphs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If we're going to understand the markets, we need to understand that the people influencing it like to pretend that they exist in a dramatic universe where there are winners and losers.

I don’t think Fisker has broad social support from retail investors in the way that GameStop does. But I think one thing a lot of people don’t understand is how much hedge funds hate each other. I would not be surprised if a hedge fund with a large and very profitable short position closes out their position suddenly, and with a series of market orders. In fact, that may be what we saw in the price action yesterday just prior to the dick and balls pattern forming.\nOne of the ironic parts of a short squeeze is that a huge price spike can sometimes actually give the company better odds of success. If the company has been authorized to float some shares into the market to raise capital, a short squeeze is the perfect place to do that. I think AMC did quite a bit of dilution during price spikes in 2021.\nThe opposite is true as well. If the price of the stock has been artificially deflated by short, sellers trying to push the price to zero, then the company is going to have a hard time raising capital if they choose to use market value shares as a vehicle to do so.\nBut all it takes is a few large short positions to close out, and it can create a chain reaction. In my opinion, the company is undervalued on a fundamental basis, and on top of that there’s a 47% short interest. Certainly worth keeping an eye on! \nIn the likely event, that a epic short squeeze, never materializes, provided the company is able to survive and avoid bankruptcy, the large amount of short interest would, at the very least provide a great deal of “upward, gravity“ similar to when a company buys back its own shares there would be a lot of additional buying pressure for a long period of time that would support the price of the stock at whatever level it decides to bottom out at.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like it works on the same principle, even if you want to give it different labels.\n\n> An analogy is to imagine your house is worth $1 million. Overnight, the money supply is doubled. Your house is now theoretically “worth” $2 million. In real terms, there is no change in value, but in dollar terms it is worth twice as much.\n\nValue is always relative to something else. In this case you’re saying the value has not “increased” because you define it as an increase in dollar supply. It has not “appreciated”, but rather the dollar has inflated. At least thats what you’re trying to express. And this is, in your opinion because relative to everything else, the house is not “worth” more, yes? This is what you call “real” value?\n\nIn that case let’s take another example where the supply of money does not increase, but rather, the supply of all goods and services including housing has suddenly halved. Now everything, including housing is worth twice as much. In this case do you still want to call it appreciation of an asset? Or is it inflation?\n\nThey are literally the same thing, except the first example is an increase of supply of usd and a stable supply of goods. And the second is a stable supply of usd and a decrease supply as goods.\n\nBoth cases are perceived as “inflation” even though the levers involving the supply of usd were not the same.\n\nIn the real world, the supply and demand of products fluctuate separately, as does the supply and demand of the dollar. It is the relative supply and demand between individual products (including housing) to the dollar that you perceive as inflation/appreciation.\n\nThat’s why the government tries to decrease inflation by increasing rates. Increase rates lead to decreased spending. Decreased spending leads to decreased demand on products. Decreased demand on products as a whole leads to perceived decrease of inflation (yes there is also some interplay here with the increase demand on the usd when rates are high because you can make more interest by loaning it, as well as decrease supply of usd by less people borrowing and more people locking up usd in treasury bills, etc.). Anyway at least that’s the theory.\n\nIn another example, that’s why inflation historically has not hit us as a 1:1 of how much money is printed. You can print more money with less inflation if all your consumer products can be manufactured more efficiently. The US has been able to enjoy printing like crazy over the decades with minimal impact to perceived inflation, simply because they outsourced manufacturing to cheaper countries like china. The increased supply of goods kept pace with the increased supply of money. But not everything can be outsourced; the value of gold and housing for example “appreciated” over the decades even adjusted for “inflation” because the supply of them could not be rapidly increased in the same way consumer goods could (yes i know it also has to do with an increase demand for gold and housing, its not just one or the other).\n\nThe government knows this and thus is why they do not include housing in the CPI, even though housing is a fundamental part of a person’s spending. They only include things that they know are more able to absorb higher demand due to a larger supply of money. If our trading partnership with China were to shut off overnight, you will see massive levels of perceived inflation because the supply to so many goods would suddenly vanish.\n\nIt’s nice that they were able to fool the many of us into seeing a bad thing as a good thing. Oh no, your money is not inflating to the point that housing is getting too expensive, its that your house is appreciating in value!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Rates going up reducing inflation reduces it not just because people spend less, but it effectively pulls money from circulation as people with debt now spend more of their money paying said debt.

It's multiple effects that work on both sides of the equation. Lower supply of money, as well as lower demand on goods.\n\n>I do get what you are saying, but theres a reason many investors and economists divide the two.\n\nFair, if it's useful to think of the two separately then I understand wanting to think of them differently. I just also think it's helpful to realize that from certain angles, money is not really \"special\" and that it too is under the same laws of supply and demand.\n\nLike, some people don't realize it and assume that exchange rates are just magically stipulated by governments and that makes it so; rather than realize that the value of their currency too depends on global (and local) supply and demand (of course that doesn't stop some governments from trying this anyway, which then just leads to black markets).\n\n>If i start buying assets in an economy experiencing hyperinflation and you do not separate the devaluation of their local currency and the actual appreciation of their assets you are going to look like a fool and think you became extremely wealthy cuz all your assets went up relative to the currency.\n\nBut isn't this exactly what sparked this convo to begin with? You were attributing the increased price of the OP's house to asset appreciation (which, I'm sure part of that did have to do with increased demand for housing; which would be \"asset appreciation\") but I would argue that a big part of that also has to do with inflation (or increased supply of money). You seemed to be implying that it was only appreciation. I'm trying to argue that it's both, as we have to both look at the supply and demand of housing as well as the supply and demand of the currency in which they are valuing it in (and incidentally also trying to argue that said supply and demand on currency are the forces that induce inflation/deflation).\n\n>There is REAL asset valuation separate from inflation.\n\nI agree; this is the component of the equation which corresponds to increased demand for the asset. But it's rarely just that side of the equation that contributes to pricing is all I'm saying.\n\n\\------\n\nAnyway I don't think we really disagree, we just are at odds with certain semantics of terminology.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Tell us you own real estate without telling us you own real estate\n\nNo no *that* one doesnt count!!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Do you not buy things? lol.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bk54rvylnGQ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bk54rvylnGQ)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "How can prices be here to stay, but also \"buy the dips\"?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "\"prices\" meaning prices of goods not stock prices", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Fuck Trump/JPOW and Fuck Biden/Yellen combo.\n\nThe worst 8 years of my life.
