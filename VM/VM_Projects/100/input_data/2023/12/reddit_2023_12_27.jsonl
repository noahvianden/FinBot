I think we need to find another market that utilizes what we have learned so far. What will most likely happen is that AI will reveal new usecases that will produce new markets. The last 20 years of digital innovation is a technological revolution that has changed the world so much that I sometimes feel like my childhood in the 90s was a different life. To see the same growth again, we need another technological revolution, but I doubt it will be in entertainment and work productivity which is the primary driver for the past 20 years of technological advancements. But there are plenty of markets that have yet to be modernised with the technology we have today. Example; personal health, psychology, education, finance, to name a few. \n\nHere is an example of a product I would pay for; a monthly subscription to get AI to analyse my body metrics in order to give me health feedback, discover sickness or cancer early and generally help me make good decisions before a doctor tells me im sick. \n\nAnother product I would pay for is something like Blueprint by Bryan Johnson which is health and food guides that atleast seem to not be based on bullshit, because 9/10 health-meal companies sell you a scam product for profit. \n\nAn important product that we have forgotten about since corona is green energy. A lot of these companies have been beaten to death by the markets, yet the problem it wants to solve still persists. If we dont do anything than 5 years from now when we are close to he 2030 deadline, a lot of people will get a reality check. Cant become a stock market millionaire or billionaire if half the world is in flames due to constant natural disasters. \n\nFinally, the digital age has brought with it a quantized world. I think the next step is to bring individual quality into the mix. There are plenty of areas where the individual quality has died out the past 30 years. Education, medical help, psychological help, societal empathy, just to name a few. Research is showing that from a human aspect of health, especially mental health, we are in a not very good spot currently. So whoever figures out how to modernize and digitalize quality improvements in human wel-being will have a really strong moat for becoming a giant billion dollar company. \n\nGenerallty, I think the past 15 years has showed a lot of people that you cant really trust any big company.

I guess you never really think about what it's like being the long-life species because the story invariably is from the point of view of the humans who live the shortest lives. This goes for everything from The Lord of the Rings to whatever recent fantasy story mixes Humans, Elves, and Dwarves. It's also a theme heavily present in the Xianzhou Luofu arc of Honkai: Star Rail.\n\nIt's one of those things where you realize that J.R.R. Tolkien actually did sort of envision a world after Sauron was defeated and was finally at peace, and that while The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen ends with the passing of Aragorn, as it turns out Arwen does keep on living for quite a long time after Aragorn is gone. Of course we also know that as far as Arwen is concerned, she actually did choose to live the life of a mortal and would eventually die. So even that is a bit of a cop-out in terms of imagining the experiences of someone who will not die period short of being violently killed.\n\nBeing that she is an Elf, Frieren here is destined to live indefinitely. After a thousand years of already being alive, she joined an adventuring party that defeated the Demon King and saved the world, and then the story starts after the credits would normally roll at the end of a Final Fantasy game. 50 years later, the 2 human members of the party have grown old and pass on, leaving the now elderly but still looking the same as ever Dwarf Eisen and Frieren behind in the world.

Good luck with your short position moron!**\n\nReuters published an article that leads with a wildly misleading headline and is riddled with incomplete and demonstrably incorrect information.   This latest piece vaguely and nonsensically suggests there are thousands upon thousands of disgruntled Tesla customers. It‚Äôs nonsensical because it‚Äôs nonfactual‚Äîthe reality is Tesla‚Äôs customer retention is among the best and highest in the industry.\n\n**Misleading headline:**  ‚ÄúTesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective.‚Äù\n\n**Reality (buried in the article):**¬† Tesla paid for most of the 120,000 vehicle repairs under warranty.\n\n**Manufactured story:**¬† The customer photo represents not a failed component, but instead a **post crash component** that was damaged in the course of reducing the adverse effects of a collision. The customer was informed that Tesla was able to review the telemetry and understood there was a crash that resulted in this repair not being covered by warranty.¬† Most, if not all, manufacturer warranties exclude damages caused by a crash because that is the point of insurance coverage.\n\n**Helpful context:** Tesla has the most advanced vehicle telemetry system that can identify emerging issues, determine scope, and allow for faster vehicle and service improvements than has ever been seen in the auto industry.¬†We take action as soon as we see a problem, something that should be celebrated as best-in-class, and is often cited by our regulators as a major safety advantage.\n\n**False accusation:** The author has conflated a noise-related (non-safety) issue with a range of unrelated and disconnected service actions.¬†Contrary to the article‚Äôs statements based on erroneous data, Tesla is truthful and transparent with our safety regulators around the globe and any insinuation otherwise is plain wrong.\n\n**Tesla Service Principles:** a. Our service technicians and advisors diagnose, maintain and fix our customers‚Äô cars efficiently and are not incentivized to profit off customers‚Äô repair needs.  b. Tesla provides our service employees with excellent compensation and benefits packages.¬†They don‚Äôt work off of commission like at other dealers who are incentivized to upsell or overcharge their customers. The best service is no service.¬†When service must be done, we fix 90%+ problems without even needing the customer present ‚Äì either through over-the-air updates or with mobile service at a customer‚Äôs house or workplace. To see Tesla‚Äôs approach in action, one can refer to this maintenance study from earlier this year, ‚ÄúTesla was named the cheapest luxury car brand to maintain..‚Äù ‚Üí\n\n[https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-named-cheapest-luxury-car-110000613.html](https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-named-cheapest-luxury-car-110000613.html)\n\nThis cherry-picking approach to journalism results in missing the truth, which is a pattern in many of the negative articles about Tesla.¬†Using one customer‚Äôs one-sided version of events as the universal experience of all customers paints a false and misleading picture of Tesla.¬†In reality, for every upset customer, there are hundreds more who are thrilled with their Tesla and eager to repeat their business.¬†The numbers don‚Äôt lie in terms of repeat sales and customer satisfaction.  We strive to make every customer a lifelong member of the Tesla family.¬†  While others may have their own agendas, **our principles have been the same since the beginning:¬†to make the safest cars in the world, which are easiest to maintain, while accelerating the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy**.\n\n12:47 pm ¬∑ 27 Dec 2023 ¬∑ **1.8M** Views", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Can someone reply if they see the above post - I'm testing something.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Deleted", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Show me your short position.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "It was a software update", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "What?

Amazon wanted to test advertisements in various movies, probably comparing popularity of movie, length of advertisements, quantity of advertisements, and content of advertisements. If you paid attention, the freevee movies were movies already on Amazon. Amazon wanted to prevent the Amazon brand recognition from being affected incase there was a bad reaction to their untested use of advertisements so they create something palatable called ‚Äúfreevee‚Äù as a secondary brand that now offers movies ‚Äúfree‚Äù with ads. These are movies that historically were already free, or movies the cost to pay to make them free is easily offset by the advertisements. \n\nAs soon as freevee was created, I called it that Amazon was setting up for advertisements. \n\nSo they test advertisements in their content with freevee, gathering all the data on our population that lets them know just how many, how often, and how long ads need to be or not be to ensure they don‚Äôt suffer X drop in viewers. There‚Äôs a magic number where the amount of viewers they drop‚Äôs revenue isn‚Äôt offset by the increased revenue the ads make. So they test what exact lengths, content, frequency etc of ads leads to the ideal number of value increased by the ads, and lowest drop of customers. \n\nThey do this for a long while, gather good date. Then they take it a step further and create a whole ‚Äúfreevee‚Äù channel. Make the idea over a year or so span, nice and slow so the frog doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs being boiled, that to get ‚Äúpremium‚Äù movies, you now can ‚Äúsave‚Äù money by watching them with ads. This gets the group psychology of the viewers to associate ads with savings‚Ä¶ not realizing the actual cost was the movie was free to begin with. \n\nNow ads have been present for so long, associated with ‚Äúsaving‚Äù money, it makes sense when they stretch the final distance to close the gap that to ensure quality media as a whole, they need to continue ads in everything. Then you have increased revenue by adding ads that offset the people that you lose by having ads. And since everyone learned to see premium movies for free you need ads, now it‚Äôs totally understandable, to see premium movies without ads, you have to pay. \n\nI swear on all that is holy, the very first time a freevee movie popped up on Amazon and I saw it, I told my wife all of this would happen, and now it has.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "They were testing ads in Prime Video long before Freevee ever came to be. \n\n* Bumpers in and out for other Prime content. \n* Moving paid (buy/rent) content toward the top and along the way throughout the UI.\n* Continually making the UI more obtuse so you see more ad material.\n* The Boys and probably other shows going over the top with product placement.\n\nI have Prime, but literally use Kodi on a FireTV stick to watch most of the Prime TV content I have interest because Prime's UI is more friction. \n\nYou're probably right though on using Freevee to take the research further.

Let me explain what I mean using my own personal circumstances (and with simplified numbers to keep the maths easy).\n\n* I recently bought a Tesla.  Before that, I drove a Toyota.  \n* I bought the Toyota for 30k and sold it 5 years later for 25k.   Net loss was 5 grand over 5 years.\n* On the Toyota, I spent about 1k/year on petrol and $500/year on maintenance.   So thats an additional $7,500 cost across those 5 years I owned it. \n* So in total, I spent about 12.5k *net* to own a Toyota for 5 years. \n* I bought a Tesla because despite the higher price point, the maintenance and petrol costs were zero (as I have access to free charging) and Teslas don't need maintenance in normal cases.  In theory, if I owned the car for 5 years I would save enough to close the gap with the purchase price of the Toyota.  Makes financial sense, right? That's what I assumed too. \n\nProblem is the resale value of the Tesla when the time eventually comes.  Every time Elon drops the price of Teslas by say, 3 grand,  it makes the entire 2nd market (not just Teslas, but all EVS) drop by 3 grand.  The way he keeps repeatedly slashing prices, it's wiping away the resale value I was counting on to make buying a Tesla economical - the resale value after just 3months is close to a 10k loss already.  It will no doubt be higher than 12.5k by the time I'm ready to sell this car. \n\nNot to mention, it's rapidly dropping the prestige factor in owning a Tesla.

{"title": "$Wix is gonna be a monster pick in 2024, and I am going to continue going all in", "selftext": "In this post, I am going to use some actual logic and reasoning, some anecdotal evidence, and some degenerate logic to appeal to everyone as to why this is gonna be my #1 pick for 2024.\n\nLet's start with some degenerate logic for you guys: Wix is based in Israel. They've been getting attacked for 100 years and still managed to become a tech powerhouse. Intel just announced a multi-billion dollar investment there, and they're gonna win this War on their terms no matter what some mamby pambys crying on social media do.  When they win: Bam. Rally. So buy in for the \"Israel won the the war\" rally, coming soon.\n\nActual Logic and Reasoning: Wix is a leader in a growing and important space. There's some easy transitions into some big markets, and the area of 'no code' websites and tools are becoming a growing part of basic e-commerce sites and most low hanging fruit. Sure, there will always be complex tools needed custom built from professionals, but most restaurants, e-commerce stores, personal brands, news outlets, media brands, and anything of the sorts is where Wix shines.\n\nI am a writer, have a few of my own companies, SEO professional, news, data & analytics, ran some stores, etc. I've used and built with WordPress, Wix, and custom stacks (react), and have used Shopify, Squarespace, and GoDaddy. Basically, I've used all the options in some capacity. Wix currently has a 43% global website builder market share AND GROWING.\n\nRight now, I think Wix is quickly becoming the #1 overall option. As far as investing goes:\n\nShopify is at a forward P/E of 73, and Squarespace is at 31. Wix has a P/E of 23 and still largely depressed stock price after their fall from grace duringthe 2022 crash. (like Zoom and other stay-at-home stocks.)\n\nAs far as the competitors, I've used them all and the advantages between them are quickly fading. Wordpress used to be the 'default CMS' and #1 option for SEO. Now, in my experience, Wix is better for SEO. Let's break it down:- Shopify:  Tends to be the go-to for the e-commerce side of the house. It has a few advantages, like built-in warehousing and some other key features. But largely falls flat on many things outside of this. Wix is making some quick headway here and has apps, services, and other options here for users to build out.\n\n\\- Wordpress: Wordpress used to be the go-to CMS for anyone looking to write blog posts or news. It still is in many ways because its an 'open-source' solution. You can develop on the WordPress program to let users publish on, for example, a custom-built website that's not WordPress. But for anyone with a casual blog, or even a semi-professional basic news site, Wix is more than enough. Wix has an open source program called Velo now to compete with this anyway that I know a lot of people use. I have top-ranked stories published through Wix, and my Wix site has done better SEO-wise than many WordPress sites I've used (I know, for example, backlinks play a huge role in this, but it's just something I've discovered.)  I don't know anyone that uses Wordpress for e-commerce.\n\n\\- Squarespace: It used to be top of the line, then they just gave up.  It's like the budget option that everyone starts out with then abandons because it's terrible at everything.\n\nHere's some key points of growth for Wix:\n\n\\- Payment Processing: You can now use Wix as a payment processor. They take 2.5% and that can QUICKLY add up when you've got millions of websites around the globe. As they keep taking market share, and become a more legitimate option for medium-to-large companies, that could add up quick. It's cheaper than competitors by like .3%, so makes it easier to switch. They're already getting involved in integrating POS devices so people can use Wix to process payments in physical stores as well. So now, they can get in physical retail stores of all the companies on their list.\n\n\\- Newsletters: Everyone has a newsletter now. It's exhausting. I have like three. Wix gives you all the features everyone else has and more because you can integrate it all in one. Lots of people would, for example, use Mailchimp, Beehiiv, or Hubspot for their newsletters AND THEN have several other services for hosting their website, accounts, etc. Wix has a paid newsletter service now, which means people will now launch a website + a newsletter on their site all in one. It maxes out at about $60/month for unlimited email sends. Convert a few hundred thousands users there and you're looking at some solid rev growth of pure profit.\n\n\\- Velo: For people that want that all-in-one solution that Wix offers but using a more open-source and custom solution, Wix launched Velo. Wordpress isn't the only opensource CMS option now, and you can build out some impressive options with the site.\n\nPosition: 500 shares (on margin, for the degeneracy.) I'd buy calls.... but there's not enough volume which sketches me out there a tad.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "18rzsdx", "created_utc": 1703680714.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "This is the most idiotic DD I've ever read.
