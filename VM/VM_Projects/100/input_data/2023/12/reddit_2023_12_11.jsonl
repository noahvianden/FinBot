{"title": "Why the stock market is more likely to crash in 2024 than any other year.", "selftext": "Hello everyone. I wanted to put this out here to see if I'm crazy or not. Feel free to tear this up. \n\nThe stock market is likely to crash in 2024. There are mutliple reason for this. Those reason could be simple coincidences. Just because x has happened in the past doesnt neccesarily mean y has to happen in the future. But if we find that there are multiple coincidences pointing at the same conclusion, we start to see a pattern take shape. There is a certain pattern that is starting to line up and it all revolves around FOMC decisions/market reactions to these decisions. \n\nduring and leading out of the 90's the fed went on a rate hiking campaign that saw markets rally like crazy and find a hold at 6% for the rate. The fed then went on to hold this rate from May 16, 2000 to Dec 19, 2000 (7 months and 3 days).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3m4mz5cjk5c1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d7a51e0cbcae02e2914b12cdafebdd4edac561a\n\nThis is a chart showing the pause period from May 2000 to the first cut in Jan 2001:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/if0kjerskk5c1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=d98f4f8cad86733eb3cab89ada88158ecea7d35f\n\nNow whats interesting is the highs and lows since the last hiking date (May 16 2000) to that first cut in Jan 2000. You had +4.77% on the upside and -14.37% on the downside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpresve4lk5c1.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=36d2c7e0c9e3bfec73213f45c21d0d751ff0f0c5\n\nDuring the tech bubble, SPY went on a 3 year draw down to about -50% from its high. This demonstrates rate cuts only cut the markets. This chart essentially speaks for itself:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vyb7nafkk5c1.png?width=1877&format=png&auto=webp&s=f87ff199a7721aaa5f4afae1965a11579bdf663c\n\nOn the next recessionary event, the market activity during the pause was different. The reaction to the cuts however was way more severe. This pause period was from June 29, 2006 to September 18, 2007 (14 months, 2 weeks and 6 days aka almost DOUBLE the previous pausing period). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ge07jxqlk5c1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=88a2c34c10832b140bb0aa2310a2ac2d59e78ce7\n\nThis chart demonstrates that you would only have gotten killed trying to bet on the downside during the pause cycle AND showing the effects of previous events on market psycology. You'll notice the prior pause period was 7 months and  3 days. If we too June 29, 2006 and added 7 months and 3 days, we get Feb 1st 2007. I highlighted below that when that time came on the 2006 cycle into 07, the market actually sputtered down 5.47%. I mean tell me that wasn't purely pyscological damage from the tech bubble at play here. Unreal! Overall, you only went down very early in the pause cycle 3.87% and was up 22.5% before it was all over. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ydovhsenk5c1.png?width=1869&format=png&auto=webp&s=c657c030667715f99e75871338842741e92cd615\n\nDuring the cuts, the market was not so friendly and gave back a cool -50% over just the next 12 months from that first rate cut while gaining 3.49%: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5gkegy5ok5c1.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=c64be7c4275a28c02ad1ab48ff8df44999cb2c00\n\nSo right now if we are only concerned with the fed as our metric for what to do out here, all we know is that each time is different. If you decided to go all bear and got some confirmation in Feb of 2007, you simply went on to get wiped out as a short in the ensuring months directly afterwards. For all we know, this pause cycle might last 14 months. It might last 7, its anyones guest honestly. \n\nBut what I do know is that all scenarios win lose or draw land in 2024. The last hike by the fed was July 26, 2023. Imprint that date into your brain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7o1pvfrook5c1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9cee0da171334762d8a509b1e18d0ddf11d1761\n\nHere is a chart of how things are going since very specifcally July 26, 2023: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dy6s9wkzok5c1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=59319cc04ac7bf027ffbd18aca5ed0a77f909d8b\n\nSo far the market has offered -10.12% and +1.16% returns. The upside is hardly there right now. To think that this is some kind of top would be inconsistent with the prior events. Which by the way might even be entirely logical as no event is the same.\n\nIf we scope out here is where we are now. I have added in the theoretical price movements upwards based on prior fed pause periods. If this was like the tech bubble, it would reasonable to expect SPY to hit 477.80 give or take a few cents. if this is like the housing bubble, we would see SPY go all the way to 557.51. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/glg9qmabrk5c1.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb972c2ca875356335a402e6532094420eee7c2c\n\nIf I had to pick a horse to bet on, I'd say its reasonable to think we can go retest those ol highs we made in early 2022. It could easily be the case as in all previous cases, that we HAVE to go higher before we can go lower and much lower at that. \n\nI find interesting that if we take that current fed pause price on SPY of 455.51 and cut that in half (-50% typical loss for a reccesion lately), you would wind up retesting the COVID lows. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rv38ahn2sk5c1.png?width=1873&format=png&auto=webp&s=f626a0f705bc7ca0a117263a8397c7baaba02ec9\n\nI suppose its just fascinating that these parameters exist. I suppose if anyone was going to buy whatever doomsday scenario may await markets, the might as well wait until it hits the same end of the world prices offered in 2020 eh? \n\nAs of today, the pause is only 4 months and 2 weeks in. If we went 7 months and 3 days from the last hike, it would be Feb 29th, 2024. If we were 14 months, 2 weeks and 6 days later, the date would be Oct 16, 2024. \n\nProbabilitys are currently showing like this for March of 2024:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fb3lfl5atk5c1.png?width=1457&format=png&auto=webp&s=90dbe1a7ff20edc197b43f06542788c310cf2a1f\n\nPost Oct 2024 there is a 0.3% chance the rate is still at its current level:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqaorvyjtk5c1.png?width=1405&format=png&auto=webp&s=467c39b21d7fd81c81e4ae892650e691d4be52ff\n\nCuts are priced in not because of some soft land shenanigans. Its priced in because of history. History affects pyscology and psycology is the only thing that really drives markets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuess what else 2024 is? A presidential election. Think this next election is about to just be all hunky dorey with no drama whatsoever? I highly doubt it. One thing the market no likely is uncertainty. Its out of everyone's minds today because it can be. But they can only ignore this dynamic for so long. \n\nBelow is a piece I grabbed off Morgan Stanley: \n\n[https:\\/\\/advisor.morganstanley.com\\/the-ernie-garcia-group\\/documents\\/field\\/e\\/er\\/ernie-garcia-group\\/S&#37;26P&#37;20500&#37;20in&#37;20Presidential&#37;20Election&#37;20years.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/the65qn8vk5c1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=76103a71cd7833793f770f3b8866789066fba24a)\n\nYou can see in the past that markets have been typically good to the presidential elections until more recent history. 2008 being one of just fed cutting activity stands out with -37%. Even in 2000 under similar federal funds rate conditions it fell 9.1% that election year. 2020 is not listed, but it went down 31.85% and finished up 18.24% on the year (so both sides basically won if they were smart). \n\nThe good ol 2 year 10 year spread shows us the yield curve inverted quite deeply and is now starting to uninvert:  \n\n\n[Jan 2000 is a low, Oct 2006 is a low](https://preview.redd.it/wefmowg9wk5c1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=5822f507e172c99cf6a8295bbd839b138f5fd866)\n\nOur low here appears to be firmly established April of 2023. Its possible its a false signal and another coincidence amongst these other coincidences. For example Inversion low to high for the tech bubble was a peak 2 months later, and another peak 7 months later before it was all over. For the housing bubble you needed to wait a full year before it was all over. If this was any kind of direction, 12 months from our low is April of 2024 peak. 7 months is Feb 2024 peak. \n\nThere are alot of months that seem to line up in 2024, but all of them on their prior time scales all end in 2024. Again its not impossible this time is different because it actually will be. The one thing we can all count on is that history will not repeat itself to the dates whatsoever. But once we hit these date milestones, pysocological damage of the past will cause people to get \"scared\" if we havent gone into a rate cut phase by then. \n\nOne curious aspect I'm seeing online, in articles, on the stock shows and youtube channels is that somehow cuts are a sign of something good. They neglect the fact core inflation is still around 4% and the fed wants THAT at 2%. They also forget that once inflation starts moving to the downside, why should it just stop at 2%? Whatever causes a decelartion of inflation so severely is not going to just stop at some number we all want it to. It's more likely this goes deflationary and we see periods of negative growth. Negative growth would only add to uncertainty which markets no likey. That the public consensus is turning to a soft landing and that rate cuts will be a good sign just tells me they are priming the cow before its dinner time.\n\nSo 2024 is basically it. We will probably bounce around, retest some highs. Things are good so they appear. But unfortunatley I'd say everything in the data says the complete opposite and it will show itself at its designated time. \n\nI'll close with a quote form Metric: \n\nWanna make a trade  \nCougar for a snake, wanna fall in love  \nWanna make a deal  \nAngel versus eel, owl versus dove\n\nEvery living thing pushed into the ring  \nFight it out to wow the crowd  \nGuess you thought you couldn't just watch  \nNo one's getting out\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "18fknke", "created_utc": 1702263612.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "num_comments": 200, "comments": [{"body": "Annnddd I’m not reading all of this", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "Any of this*", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "This was so funny,I scrolled and then I was like \"let me get to the bottom and see the comments\"", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "r/agedlikemilk", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 189, "replies": [{"body": "Dogs are a very good idea.

{"title": "I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.", "selftext": "Hello Readers, \n\nMobyDick4Real here, and I am going to dissect why I believe Microsoft is prepping Lumen Technologies for a acquisition.\n\nTo begin, I was a former employee of Lumen Technologies for just under 5 years. I was part of the Federal team, and it was my responsibility to price-to-win RFP's in the communications and technology sector. During my tenure, I was part of the team that secured the IPTS win which is a $1.5B sole contract awarded to Lumen.\n\nDuring this time, I watched the stock sink from about $15 to less than a dollar, and currently own 4% of the call options expiring January 1st 2026. This may sound like a lot, but its $1,000 worth of $5 strike options. \n\nLumens stock has been in steady decline since Jeff Storey took the helm about 5 years ago, but was anchored around $7 due to the ridiculous dividend they were paying ($0.25 a quarter). After his retirement there was internal chatter of whether Laurinda Pang, or Ed Morche was going to replace Jeff during his departure. However, to the companies surprise an outsider was awarded the position and took leadership. \n\nKate Johnson is a tenured executive that was previously a Vice President at Microsoft. Her bread and butter was subscription based modeling at Microsoft, and headed major projects. After winning the CEO position at Lumen; Kate slowly fired off all the executives of Lumen besides two people: Andrew Dugan, and Chris Stansbury and proceeded to fill the positions with Microsoft alumni and other colleagues from her days at Warton. \n\nFirst thing Kate did was remove the dividend, and sold off Lumens LATAM and EMEA offerings; sizably reducing Lumens debt, and bolstering free cash flow. Bears say that Lumens primary sales are coming from landline phones and other legacy services, and I believe this to be a fallacy.  \n\nLumen can be easily broken into two major teams that derive most of the large wins. The Hyperscalers team (Enterprise) and the DoD team (Fed). For the sake of this conversation I am going to focus on the Federal team. Lumen was created after a merger between Level3 and CenturyLink. Where CenturyLink focused on enterprise sales, and Level3 ran the majority of the DoD network. \n\nMicrosoft has recently bolstered their view on supporting government contracts, and has done so by crafting Zero Trust infrastructure into their cloud offerings, and getting Teams on just about every government computer there is. \n\nMy hypothesis is Microsoft wants to further their hold in the defense sectors and plans to do so by acquiring Lumen. Lumen is a consortium member of every large undersea cable and provides most of the layer 1 transport to the government. Having Microsoft purchase Lumen immediately puts them in a position to win massive multi-billion dollar contracts, and overlay their technology as a value add. This then provides the government with an easy button to not only purchase their data infrastructure but to have all the bells and whistles Microsoft provides included seamlessly. If there is one thing I learned working Fed, is that the government loves an easy button. \n\nLumens goal for both enterprise and fed is to create a subscription based model referred to as network as a service (NaaS) and this allows their hyperscalers and larger accounts to add and reduce bandwidth across their business within a few clicks. Insert the Queen of subscription based modeling. \n\nAs quantum computing and quantum fiber become more prevalent Lumen is perfectly positioned to have massive growth seizing the workload for all autonomous vehicles, AI, 5G, quantum computing, and any large data transfers across the US. \n\nRegarding the sell-offs of LATAM and EMEA, the deals were structured that the companies that purchased them (Colt Telecom, and Cirion Telecom) would still supply the company with all required needs on the fiber that was sold. This allows Lumen to be a global business without having to manage their global fiber footprint. \n\nLumen is capable of pivoting and creating dense datasets due to the fact they have direct access to 70% of all global internet traffic, and have vision into another 10% through peering agreements. This gives them access to 80% of all global internet traffic. This would dramatically increase Microsofts AI offerings, and could make all their selling efforts more affective. \n\nBy Microsoft purchasing Lumen, their security, AI, government, enterprise, and all data transfer offerings would be dramatically improved based off the information they could feed into it.\n\nLumen stock is currently sitting around $1.40, and makes about $15-$20B a year with a gross profit of about $7B in 2023. The business has been in decline profit wise for about 5 years, but this is due to major sell-offs and securing future business. \n\nFor the reasons of Microsoft executives taking the helm, cutting off the deadweight sectors, rumors of the merger in the industry, and the overlap between the two companies. I believe Microsoft is likely to purchase Lumen for pennies on the dollar in the upcoming years. \n\nBut who knows, maybe I'm just regarded.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "18fn1n6", "created_utc": 1702271808.0, "score": 2980, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 642, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|44|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I think Microsoft is going to buy Lumen for their undersea cable access, and government contract wins.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you think the CEO and CFO cashing out on lumen stock at $1.09 is a good sign or a bad sign?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "They both purchased.

Also that money was looking for a home and you're in an institutional repositioning cycle, and that can go sideways for a bit, but typically means there's a grind up.\n\nYou're shorting the market into an aggressive bullish trend because you want the market to agree with your rationale on inflation and rates... the market doesn't care about any of that.\n\nRegarding your thoughts on rates and inflation: Rates at the current levels only cause a change in behavior in specific markets, like the mortgage market. For the most people, consumer habits haven't changed along with rates... what's really constraining demand is that certain classes of consumers are experiencing a credit crunch because the higher rates reduce the rate at which banks deploy capital (risk departments won't allow the bank to risk their capitalization in this context). There's a time component to this, though. As time goes by, it's clear the Fed won't claw back all of the money sitting in bank coffers, so they're deploying it slowly, and that will introduce more capital at a constant rate to support ATHs.\n\nHowever, if rates have topped, which it looks like they have, then this benefits potential return against the market relative to the risk-free rate.\n\nThe three primary scenarios for next year are:\n\n1. Soft landing, surprising everyone, and rates may not be cut as quickly as people expect. This is a known scenario. Nobody's saying things like \"the Fed will cut rates 4 times, no matter what.\" People know the soft landing scenario has a chance of keeping rates up a little, but as you said elsewhere current rates aren't that high really. Not enough to threaten average return from risk assets as long as there isn't a threat of much higher rates (what happened in 2022). Why would the market rally without rate cuts? Because an unwinding of the yield curve will surprise the market as a positive earnings condition, driving P/Es up.\n2. Mild recession. We get medium rate cuts and there's some slumping in the market, but it's not as severe as people think. Rates get cut a bit and the Fed makes the rational determination that even if inflation is hovering around 2-3% that you don't need to make 2% exactly (which isn't even historically significant, only during the past 15 years, really) and honestly all of the benchmark dynamics right now show a threat of potential deflation next year... the beige book tells a demand destruction story from last month and we're starting to see the lag in housing prices in CPI catch up. You think the threat is inflation at 3%... you can do inflation at 3% indefinitely and be fine, and we have in the past. What we can't do is deflation, as that's the real threat. I think this is maybe the most likely scenario, and it basically sees the Fed cutting rates to maintain inflation from switching to full on deflation which would be a major problem for the banks.\n3. Deep recession, and the theory that the Fed will not intercede here is dead after SVB. We all know the Fed will react to a crisis. JPOW may not want to preside over 10% inflation, but he has time and again shown he also doesn't want to preside over a crashed economy. The Fed cuts rates, they buy up bonds and MBS' to prop the market up and try to reduce cuts. This is the \"Fed breaks something\" you're talking about, and what happens here is that you get a decline (how big is anyone's guess) and P/Es go up as companies come out of the recessionary phase, since we're already operating at a recessionary footing. It may take a couple of months or so depending on how things go, but here's the thing: If we've already front-run the expectation of a recession, how much is there to really sell off? Maybe SPY to 380? Something like that? Maybe 350. I mean, that would be a 2022 repeat, but more likely it has a radical grind up in this scenario after a short period of decline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of those scenarios support buying positioning ahead of the event.

I don’t think we’re nearly as clear from the minefield as you think.\n\nIt's not that I think we're in the clear. Scenario #3, which I think is not as likely as #2 but still quite plausible, definitely isn't \"in the clear.\" I'm not sure I'd call #2 exactly in the clear, either, but that's debatable.\n\nIf we have a deep recession, I think a 20-30+% decline in the S&P 500 is entirely reasonable to expect. And I can't write it off and I'm positioned even with the strength of this rally with my main account in a very bond and cash heavy distribution... I'm just not actively shorting because my biggest losses over the last 2 years have been shorts that imploded.\n\nSo when I say I've been there with you on those puts blowing up, I mean it. LOL\n\nWhat I'm mostly doing here is considering why the market does what it does, and it sounds like a cop-out but the answer is usually \"institutional positioning\" whether for delta neutrality against their total holdings, hedging, or rotational factors.\n\nThe institutions look very far out and are cash heavy, even now with ATHs back. They're offsides with the mag7, as well, and that's a recipe for sector rotation which is exactly what we're seeing in the breadth data.\n\nSo the market's just not primed for a major pullback yet (though a moderate pullback could happen at any time), though I understand the rationale behind thinking it \\*should\\* based on the uncertainty factor and the extension of the run. But at the same time, you get extended runs like this both during bear markets and during recovery from bearish conditions (like August through October).\n\nSo let's assess that: Can we say it's a bear market rally?\n\nWell, putting aside the 20% decline requirement for an official bear market (as I think we'd all agree that all rallies into the end of 2022 were bear market rallies even though we were often above the threshold) we're above the EMA 50 and 200 day moving average. We're making 52 week highs in the various primary market indexes.\n\nWe had a bearish structure in September/October, so toying with the idea of a bear market rally then was rational, but we've moved way beyond the reversal range here and no longer have bearish structure.\n\nDepending on where you look, the put:call ratio against the S&P 500 is anywhere from 1.25 through about 1.50... more on the side of greed than fear. While contrarians will say \"that's a perfect environment for the market to dip\" and I hear them, there's another scenario where we get this pattern:\n\nRecovery runs, which tend to push through OpEx dates without the standard reversal pattern. Lots of puts and shorts can drive rallies, but so can just really strong rallies and institutions being offsides on the long side.\n\nCollecting premium matters less when institutions are positioning for a long trend because the overweight position shifts market maker and large institutional priorities and the center of gravity for more profit. Sacrificing chasing long returns for premiums doesn't make sense when you can make money in both games.\n\nSo really, we have to until proven otherwise assume that the accumulation up will continue.\n\nI still advocate a risk-based positioning in people's portfolios, though, because the risk is still high that this deflates IF we get a recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The stock market and the economy are not the same thing, and based on current stock valuations, we are pricing in a much different outlook than we realistically have.\n\nI agree, all the more reason not to let our perspectives on the economy allow us to ignore the patterns of institutional directional positioning and their time duration. That tells us how economic conditions will be played during a recession (or fear of a recession), and the trick really is that institutions will be buying at various points through the process.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "So what calls are you eyeing in the next couple weeks?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I've been playing AMD and don't intend to stop until I get a technical reason to do so. \n\nI also have some SPY gambles open, but am concerned about a short term bond rally, so I'm mostly just buying a few next day options or 0dte.

What I do and what is supported by the chart pattern on the one spike which made it this high, is to consider every $5 to be resistance potential, just because the market loves to put stops and sells right at those increments. Numbers divisible by 5 and 10 are psychologically important numbers.\n\nThe break of trend on December 7th was out of a parallel trendline channel with a depth of a little over 15 pts. That break occurred around 125, which puts the price target around 140.\n\nThat same day was a break on a cup and handle pattern, with a 30 pt depth, If we're conservative and start the run from the bottom of the handle, that's just above 115, so that puts us at 145, and the majority of the bottom of the cup is closer to 100, so it's possible the technicals put us closer to 140 for a price target there if there isn't a supportive market pattern.\n\nThere's also an inverse head and shoulders there where the math works the same and a price target of 140 or so. \n\nWe've broken another cup and handle around 130, but the handle is small. It does count, because there was a pullback right at the level and then broke up... so are we in a higher ranging trend with momentum and an unknown price target?\n\nI think that's the bull case. Personally if we hit 140 tomorrow, I might take a few chips off the table and look for confirmation to form a new play, or perhaps just hedge a little with the put position, depending on what feels best.

At least not a full blown one. The market may be behaving in the greed space, but cash distribution is still at a very risk-averse place. So we're seeing capital deployed, but a lot of it is held back because, let's be honest, our base hope may not be a recession, but for many of us it's our base case for our positioning right now.\n\nSo what do we do if this is all just the effect of cyclical artificial impacts to the metrics because of the Fed's actions and the pandemic and it turns out that it's not a normal business cycle? \n\nBecause if the yield curve continues disinverting and we don't get a recession (which again, not my base case) then what happens? Do we just stop expecting one because the clock runs out? Does us expecting one result in behaviors which stop it, but once we turn our backs on it do we become vulnerable to a new business cycle? The start of those cycles is usually a bull run.\n\nI don't have an answer for that because the last time we were in anything remotely close to an analogous situation - and it's a somewhat strained comparison - was the early 1920s because of the effects of being in a period of warfare and post-pandemic. So we're very short on predictive patterns, far shorter than even the small number of recessions people cite for their bear cases.\n\nI think that this actually explains bond yields.\n\nI don't think it's a matter of there being a specific economic case, though monetary policy hawks will say that it reflects a reduction in expectation of GDP growth by institutions over the next year. I think there's something to that, but it doesn't explain the mechanics.\n\nI think what we have here is a garden variety chase for profit and positioning.\n\nWhen yields are going up, institutions hold back so they don't expose themselves to portfolio balance and margin risks. If you buy bonds at a low yield, you risk pulling an SVB. \n\nSo I think what we're seeing is this perception that rates will come down driving buying patterns to chase higher yield, because during the upswing, so much capital was held back to see the market top out. With the Fed decision, the mechanics were such that you now get that chase for yield among both large institutional positions (like banks hedging their holdings with the 10Y on a buy and hold basis, clocking in the best performance possible by maxing yield across the portfolio ladder) and bond traders who want to scalp the move in valuation on zero coupon and high volatility positions.\n\nThat's gonna drive the yield down.

BUT there's an exception to that, which is in the reason why the rule exists.\n\nYou don't track the yield because the yield is an artifact of natural chaotic processes.... usually. \n\nIt stops being as chaotic when it becomes a focus and people are actively competing on yield, which makes the yield into a target for technical trade patterns (Remember: the goal of technical analysis isn't to predict the future, it's to find emerging human behavior to understand how the market is reacting to fundamentals and macro events so you can get a better sense of the trend strength and direction). \n\nSo when the yield starts trading against technical factors, I notice because that means there's a mindset across the market at play and a change of tactics, which changes capital flows.\n\nSo we're working off the same chart, here's what I use to do standard trending. It's a little busy, but I'll explain how it's used:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxj7jwjjsy6c1.png?width=1823&format=png&auto=webp&s=64e6da714525e36aed50388ce41fe312f32dca97\n\nThis is one of the trending methods I use. I have some other charts which track closing smoothed averages and things like that. I use these as lenses to look at behavior and find if one set of averages is more heavily traded than another. \n\nThis particular matrix of averages is my personal riff on the Williams Alligator. You have 3 EMAs: the 50 day as the larger trend indicator, the 21 day as the median indicator tracking monthly trends, and the shorter 8 day which tracks weekly trends. Instead of using close values, I use the high and low of the day, because this reduces false signals. Closes can fluctuate, but high/low tells you about the range of prices the market is playing within and gives a buffer to show a position of indecision/neutrality of price, which keeps me out of trades that are less trending. Just using closes can result in buying into a position that is just experiencing volatility.\n\nThe specific number of days don't matter as much as people think... the key is that you have a spread and can hit the rough time ranges, people make the chart fit in other ways. Using the EMA 8 just seems to fit more often than not to me, and it gives us something to discuss the patterns of behavior with. Remember: not a predictor of the market, but rather a tool for understanding its behavior and when that behavior changes, because when it changes is when the biggest moves occur. Someone might be able to get the same thing to happen with the 9 day. The key is that we know it's on a pattern.\n\nIn this matrix, the alignment matters, and gives you a sense of the strength of the trend that can be more subjective just looking at the candlesticks. For me, this helps me keep my biases in check. With the 8 below the 21 and the 21 below the 50 range, you can say that the trend is strong with the directionality. Doesn't mean we can predict, but it means the market is trending. \n\nWhat I was referring to with the EMA 8 High here, is that it keeps bouncing off that EMA 8 High line, and I pay attention when a pattern like that emerges. It means bond traders are using that as a key directional pivot for liquidity, and in every case eventually these trends break. So you're not looking for conformance and prediction here, we're looking for change.\n\nCurrent trend is down, which is good for bond valuations and risk equity in the near term... so we use this in conjunction with other methods to look for opportunities in risk assets and to establish a portfolio bias. To me, this screams near term long bias. \n\nIf the EMA 8 High breaks, that would suggest a break in technical behavior for bond traders, and to me that would suggest the potential for shifts in trending in other assets. \n\nIs it rational to say that bond yields shouldn't be pinned to the EMA 8 High? Yes... but... the chart says it is, and yeah, maybe if the context changes we don't get the outcome we expect.\n\nThat would be interesting, too. :) \n\nAnd it's all good. :) I appreciate the thoughtful exchange.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ok thank you for your analysis can you pls explain like I’m 5 years old ha ha", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You can trend the market based on common weekly, monthly, and longer patterns to remove subjectivity from trending.

When the Fed supported an insane level of fiscal spending expansion in 2020 and 2021 through massive bond buying, most of  that money went straight to the poors who went on a spending spree for two years. That's why inflation was not transitory even after supply chains mostly recovered.\n\nNow QT is the opposite of QE. It reduces bank reserves and deflates risk assets without affecting the poors, because they don't borrow money much compared to asset buyers. But the reason as soon as the Fed goes back to QE this time it immediately lead to high inflation is because the government is spending at around a 7% deficit as a percent of GDP, and unlike old QE, this money is going straight to the poors.

The \"stimmy checks\" ended in 2021 and through 2020 and 2021 consumer spending ex-housing and consumer debt generation stayed pretty much on-trend for the prior decade, with moderate growth. The only difference is that the stimmy checks gapped up the spending reduction during the decline in spending during mid-2020, and that was at a time when inventories outside of JIT items were still pretty flush. You start seeing the pressure on groceries at this time, and there's some buying that helped push prices up then, but that starts to abate by 2021 outside of sectors like eggs where you have the avian flu problem affecting supply (along with a mass chicken kill off when the market dropped in 2020).\n\nSo when people talk about the \"stimmy check\" scenario, they're really talking about a short period in 2020 and what's really the supply chain breakdown story, and the GDP impact of that gap up in spending during that 2020 decline period ultimately canceled out... the gain on the back half of 2020 is basically a mirror of the loss of GDP in early 2020.\n\nIn 2020 you absolutely saw an outsized difference in impact to risk assets relative to pricing (exception being real estate which has both investment and buying facets, but that's in large part because the Fed buying MBS meant cycling into new loans was low risk and at such a low rate... you get the point) so the dynamics are the same... because the money still goes to banks and they all knew it was short term capitalization.
