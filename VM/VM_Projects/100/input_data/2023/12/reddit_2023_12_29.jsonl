If not, I apologize and feel free to remove. So I'm a pc gamer and have noticed AMD has been popping off in all aspects. Almost nothing bad has been said about them this generation and I have heard and seen a lot of people moving from Intel and nvidia to AMD. I bought some calls on it since I believe it to continue to go up. These are my current options, it's not much, but I'm a beginner. And before anyone says it, I know people recommend to not do options early on and I understand why. I'm not afraid of losing the little bit of money I have in there. My goal is to get some decent chunks of change from AMD's calls and reinvest the profits into actual shares and using the original investment into calls again. Here are my [options](https://imgur.com/a/eaTExAN). The first 3 are cheap yolos that I know have a small chance. The second 2 are the ones I care about and really hoping does well.

I was in daily communication for a while with Suzanne Plummer and Steve Hale, who kind of built the front end of the Zen core, and the Colorado team. It was really good people. Mike Clark's a great architect, so we had a lot of fun, and success. Success has a lot of authors - failure has one. So that was a success. Then some teams stepped up - we moved Excavator to the Boston team, where they took over finishing the design and the physical stuff, Harry Fair and his guys did a great job on that. So there were some fairly stressful organizational changes that we did, going through that. The team all came together, so I think there was a lot of camaraderie in it.

PEG ratio is 5.11, lol. I don't know that I've seen a PEG ratio that high before.\n\nThere's also some headwinds for Tesla. They recently lost the federal tax credit on most of their lineup. This will undoubtedly affect sales and their margins, but admittedly they should remain profitable without the tax credits. IIRC one of the articles I read said that, without the credits, their margin is around 30%, which is still higher than most auto manufacturers. But still, for this company being valued higher than any other auto manufacturer in the world, even ones that sell exponentially more vehicles, I still don't see how the stock price equals reality. \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2023/10/30/5-reasons-why-electric-vehicle-sales-have-slowed/\n\nThere has been a slowdown already in electric vehicle sales that will most likely be accelerated by losing the tax credits. Granted that's not all Tesla's fault. We are still a few years away from viable Li-Ion alternatives being ready for mass adoption. Until that happens, the cost of the batteries and rare minerals to make them will remain the biggest hurdle they face. Not to mention hydrogen powered hybrids are slated for mass production starting next year. Electricity rates are constantly increasing. Even if you have a bunch of solar panels, you still paid for that electricity, even if it's cheaper than what you're getting from your utility company. Whereas water is the most abundant resource on the planet. The advantage here does not go for pure electric vehicles IMO.\n\nAs far as the AI angle, are they really a competitor when they still only have level 2 autonomous driving? Seems to me like Google would be an infinitely better stock for the AI angle since they are expanding to level 3 and 4 autonomous driving, no?

While the stories of disgruntled employees are there, the ones I‚Äôve spoken to seem positive and the tidbits they‚Äôve shared of what they‚Äôre working on seemed to bring them genuine excitement.\n\n2) They‚Äôre still a top spot for multiple engineering disciplines and from point #1 seem to be cross functionally collaborative than they are siloed.

Which I‚Äôve also invested some in. (NIO/BYD) it‚Äôs expected that the EV market share will continue to drop while overall volume increases.\n\n5) their year over year growth in vehicles and other energy products are hard to find.\n\n6) FSD, while highly questionable in name, is quite good in terms of what it can do. I‚Äôve put a few thousand miles in commute distance with it and have had very little complaints other than the nagging from time to time.\n\n7) the tech in the Cybertruck is exciting to me. Mainly steer by wire and moving away from 12v architecture.\n\n8) their energy arm is still struggling to keep up with the demand. It took awhile for us to get our solar and power wall due to the different constraints they‚Äôre working through. I see solar and battery adoption increasing over the next decade and again I‚Äôve diversified into a competitor as well.\n\n9) factories and building locally, they‚Äôre building things in America with American employees. It‚Äôs a silly reason to some but to me I‚Äôd rather Tesla succeed than BYD or another Chinese EV company.

There is no model that tells us what happens when you overbuild by this much, but it certainly will not be good.\n\nChina is in a massive debt trap.  People generally miss this, because the CCP has kept it off of the top line.  This does not remove the debt; it only hides it.  China is not a serious reserve currency, either, so it does not have the kind of support that the dollar or euro have.\n\nXi has eliminated most of the competent people from government to protect himself.  Technically speaking, he eliminated any immediate challengers, anyone who could challenge him in the future, and finally anyone who could eventually grow to challenge him.  As a competent person is always the biggest threat to a dictator, they have been eliminated.  As a consequence, the government in China is malfunctioning on a massive scale.  We won't even consider what happens if Xi were to die tomorrow.\n\nThe attempt to move to an economy that can support itself through internal demand has failed.  One day, this will be examined closely as to how \\*not\\* to run an economy.\n\nThanks to their \"Wolf Warrior\" diplomacy, China has blown through whatever goodwill it had managed to build up over the last 40 years.  They overestimated their power and are now facing an international community that is done with their bullshit.  Toss in their poorly timed support for Russia (which was thinly veiled play for Taiwan) and China must be feeling pretty lonely right now.\n\nXi has realized that without the U.S., China is immediately toast.  The U.S. not only represents the biggest market in terms of demand, but the U.S.  exerts strong influence in Europe that China has not been able to break, despite trying really, really hard.  I think Xi has also finally realized that the U.S. could cut China off in terms of international trade on a whim.  China \\*needs\\* the U.S. to be sweet on them, and everyone seems to have realized this at around the same time.\n\nChina is no longer the cheap place to produce anything.  Investment has fallen off a cliff, leaving China to be moving on fumes.  People would rather move production back home, nearshore it, or go to the new cheap places, like Vietnam.  \n\nChina made a really good play on renewables.  If they had not completely fumbled everything else, this might have been something to propel them to true superpower status.  Instead, Covid and Russia's \"3 day special operation\" gave everyone a new appreciation of how fragile the supply chain is, and China chose exactly \\*this\\* time to demonstrate their aggressiveness.  Of course everyone is bringing production home, and this includes anything to do with renewables.\n\nChina is in grave danger.  To solve all of these problems, China will need to be flexible.  This is \\*not\\* their strong suit in the best of times, and these are not the best of times.\n\nWhile nothing about the future can ever be truly certain, if you are not figuring out how your world looks without a functioning China in it, you are not preparing for the future.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "These youngsters have no idea what China is.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": " Tony over at China Update be like oO.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "China collapsing has been predicted since the 70s.

Some have said you are right.  If you are simply selecting the ones that confirm what you believed when you came in, you are not learning.

(They can make cars to sell at a loss, but nothing that sells well at a profit)\n* Most of the new companies are struggling to make it over the mass-production hump.  One or two will make; most will not.  \n* Tesla will be one of only a few companies left standing when the dust clears.  \n* Tesla has already shown they will innovate til it bleeds.  The big point here is that other companies will find it hard to catch up.\n* Tesla is vertically integrated, meaning they have the flexibility to adjust to whatever happens in the future.\n\nNow, if you don't believe this (and lordy, I hope you are doing your own research rather than depending on Reddit), then it doesn't matter.

Waymo is stuck trying to do a digital rails solution, Cruise just self-destructed, and about the only one I would bother to consider real competition -- comma.ai -- has repeatedly said they are not interested in trying to go for a full FSD system.\n\nThere is always the chance someone might pop out of nowhere.  If we go with that logic though, then investing is impossible.  Somebody can \\*always\\* pop out of nowhere.  With the data and financial requirements needed to get into this game, it is extremely unlikely a dark horse will emerge.\n\nFor the bots, about the only real competition is Boston Dynamics, and they do not seem to be going after the same market.\n\nFor the energy, there is more competition, but Tesla has been ramping up recently regardless.  If Tesla ever decides to get really serious about that segment, I am not sure who else really has the infrastructure to compete.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And it still doesn't address the high valuations today for what may happen 7+ years from now in a best case scenario.\n\nThis is why you assign a percentage.

First you have to split water to produce hydrogen - let's be generous and say we achieve 70% efficiency here. Then you need to compress and transport hydrogen to 700 bar - another ~20% loss. Then you use that hydrogen in a fuel cell to produce power - the typical efficiency will be at around 60%. And then comes the electric motor with 90% efficiency. And electrolyzers and fuel cells are mature technologies and their efficiency will only increase incrementally. So the physics part of the EV-to-fuel cell comparison won't change substantially.\n\nSo it's 80% vs. 26%. This simply means that you need at least 3 times as much power per mile driven for a fuel cell car. That means three times the wind parks, three times the solar farms, more wires for transporting the power, etc.\n\nThe physics aren't even the whole story though. For the EVs, you also don't need a lot of capital expenditure that you *do* need for the fuel cell cars: Electrolyzers, pipelines, storage tanks, refueling stations etc. A hydrogen refueling station costs upwards of a million dollars; a charging station with multiple charging points about a tenth of that. All that capital expenditure will raise the price of mile driven *in addition to the physics*.\n\nAlso, EVs have had a huge head start. You have literally trillions of dollars in private capital chasing market share in EVs, from Tesla to Chinese upstarts to legacy automakers. EVs are a few years away from being cheaper *upfront* from ICE cars, without government support. Compare this with fuel cell cars where they're nowhere near any sort of price parity, not even on total lifetime cost terms. There's barely anyone throwing their money after hydrogen cars, and governments are realizing that hydrogen will very likely remain scarce and expensive for at least 15 years and will be needed to decarbonize industry, shipping and aviation, and are therefore refusing to subsidize its use in cars. \n\nI beg anyone still thinking hydrogen in cars will be a thing to read [this](https://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-one-the-supply-side/).

That's what's so funny about the right making fun of the left for things like the green deal and how absurd everything on the list was.  Of course it was especially when they haven't allowed the advancement of many technologies for decades other than smartphones for the most part.  Tesla is a discovery in upgrading the efficiency of solar  away from being installed on everything because it will double as a passive income with extra electricity you can sell on decentralized markets or you can mine crypto with it.  The Optimist Robot will integrate with his phone which will run on his satellite Network and will also mine crypto while you can also have a robo taxi commissioned out driving around for you earning another passive income.  Tesla's going to become the most important company in the world that's why the positioning all over the world with giant facilities.  You know they went in house with their chipset getting rid of Nvidia a few years back?  I mean that right there should tell you something is going on because you don't just make chipsets that supposedly are 5 years ahead of anything Nvidia had to offer.  I mean you know he had x.com domain already from 30 40 years ago?  He's not as whimsical in business as he acts like he is. X was crypto before it was invented unless he invented Bitcoin which he probably did.  And I'm not counting that but I think that's 1 million Bitcoin in the Satoshi wallets which will be funny if Bitcoin goes as high as people think that that even exists.  He's going to decentralize Twitter and make it the operating system for your life if you want like we chat. And he's going to airdrop billions of dollars to its users.  Optimus will be the preferred social servant robot model sold and his AI is going to be impossible to beat.  I mean the Tesla data alone was light years past anyone and now he has Twitter and he freed it.  If you think AI is valuable that's the real AI play this garbage that Microsoft and Nvidia have plan that's going to be the most nasty lying garbage you've ever seen like it already is will fail in comparison. Unless you think it's easier for AI to lie than it is to tell the truth? The path to least resistance will win. He said it the last shareholder meeting that if you understood Optimus you would never think about automobiles when worrying about Tesla's investment value in the future. Then he asked the crowd how many units they thought he would sell and he made it sound like one for every human on the planet was very possible.  Then on that all integrates with the neuralink chip I mean you're looking at a serious competitor to Google I guess I don't know I don't think really they have any competition.  I'd be more worried about the other American car companies.  Depending on how far they take it with China it could get rowdy.  You know the US acts like it can just boss everyone around with sanctions and that's what we've been made to believe but the truth is countries are just companies and they all work for the same boss so depending on how far they want to take this reset ushering in the new way, I feel it's going to involve \"natural\" disasters, pandemics or the threat of, and from the way they're talking in the White House at the very least some kind of cold sanctioned-based war.  Unfortunately that looks like the BRIC Nations and 47 other countries abandoning the dollar and maybe China doing something like making their Auto industry state run or threatening to which would put every American company out of business because all their profits are from China which will allow for a deal to be made to bring Chinese Auto to America which will pretty much crush them as well but they won't have a choice.  And your one flare up with Taiwan away from a literal reevaluation of every major tech company including Apple probably a 50% haircut considering they're not a growth company anymore and borrowing a 0% and buying your own shares is over.  That's why gold breaking out and no one's even talking about it. Anyways the AI is what will tie everything together that's why I mention it.  Whether or not all that translates to Tesla's share price going up or falling off who knows but it's the most important company in the world and I've been watching this for over a decade and musk has some serious backing or did early on to get this far and they're not going to let him fail even though they might act like they're against them everything he will do will work and everything he tells you is going to happen will happen he just doesn't dictate timing.  The rothschilds dictate the timing.  If he was a free man in the past I reckon they got him with the SEC like they did Mark Cuban and poor Martha.  But they let musk run his mouth pretty openly because he's going to be the savior.  And then everyone will get chipped as willing as anything you've seen people do lately with fairly questionable discernment. Especially generation millennial and below.

Cost to provide the service. A charging station buys electricity and resells it for a profit. Easy. They don't have any staff. Any swap stations would have to factor in the cost to lock in X battery packs to provide Y swaps / hour. If a swap takes 5 minutes and charging a battery takes 30 minutes, then you need at least 6 extra packs to provide that service. If we were to factor in 80kWh packs, then it's an extra 480kWh that increases the cost of any swap station. And it doesn't save you time with the chargers either, as your charging power needs to be sized for peak demand. Add to that the rental cost for the space which is significant, especially in big urban environments and the maintenance cost of the swap station itself.\n2. Do you want to go into the cost to build? Fast chargers is essentially just their cost plus a contribution to upgrading the transformers, if there isn't enough spare power available. Not to mention that most charging stations are associated with other businesses like shopping malls, which means there's an incentive for them to contribute towards the cost, since the occupants of the vehicles are likely going to shop/eat there as well. Compare that to a swap station, where you need A LOT of real estate, which frankly isn't compatible at all with dense urban environments. And all of these costs come and inflate your operational cost and drive the price at which you need to sell your 1 kWh of \"charge\" higher. Not to mention that in order for the 5 minute swap to be an advantage, it needs to be very close by. As otherwise, especially in a big city, it makes no sense to drive a few kms each way, since the time saved from swapping would be consumed by driving to/from the swap station.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I mentioned, I'd be really curious to see official data on what's the cost associated with a swap station.

Once loved ones are gone, the ability to make memories with them can't be replaced.\n\nMy New Year's financial resolution is to basically continue the path I started this year.

I roll the options around to keep my delta/theta where I want it to be. As a result, I'm up 94% for the year with a max monthly drawdown of 4%.

I think the easiest way to make money in this game is to short dogshit that is getting pumped up... which leads me to $COIN\n\nCoinbase is up 454% YTD with revenue of $623M, net income -$2.3M with a valuation of $44.5B. Now what is driving this news is a few things: Bitcoin price going up, dismissal of lawsuit against them, hopes around approval of Bitcoin etf and optimism around that space.\n\nNow with full transparency, I am a crypto bear. I don't think it really does anything. It is very useful for transactions which involve crime (hello dark web) but for normal people it does nothing - but people will be either for/against and I'm not going to argue that here... though I see the comments coming in already...\n\nNow the good thing is that this thesis doesn't rely on crypto winning or losing - I have a bear case for this company in any scenario\n\n1. Bitcoin goes to moon with halving, blackrock and fidelity ETFs come on board, Coinbase gets fucked as competitors begin to offer access to crypto with much larger institutional money and better products at lower cost. Coinbase can't compete on margins, can't compete with larger established institutions which sell to their own customers, gets squeezed out by the big financial guys\n2. Tether collapses, bitcoin sinks, SEC cracks down, legislative headwinds increase. Crypto is headed into deeper winter and Coinbase is a market selling something nobody wants. Trading volumes drop further and stock sinks like a rock\n3. The current situation continues - Coinbase is losing money. The valuation comes back to earth. They cut costs and become a modestly profitable business\n\n454% YTD run up with flat revenues? Gotta come back down to earth. P/E is >100 if you take revenue as PROFIT. Even a pretty neutral outlook on this stock would see it as overvalued. There is no upside for this company.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk\n\nEDIT: Fidelity still locked me out of options but DOWN 15% SINCE I POSTED THIS.

{"title": "Why you‚Äôre dumb for thinking the economy sucks", "selftext": "Let‚Äôs be real, if you‚Äôre here you are probably poor. Not just poor, like sucking dick behind Wendy‚Äôs for some FDs. Life is terrible. You work 8 hours a day, you have no friends or family, and you‚Äôre dumb as bricks. \n\nTo you, and those around you and online, it seems like the world is failing you. You‚Äôll never own a home, you‚Äôll never retire, and even your car payment and student loans are enough to cripple any hope of having savings. After all, that‚Äôs why you gamble on the very system that keeps you perma-broke. \n\nYou and your woke ass Instagram high school classmates (aka Wendy‚Äôs coworkers) continually post to your feed statistics of generation wealth inequality, the destruction of the middle class, and whatever else helps you rationalize being a lazy and depressed piece of shit. It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs the system that‚Äôs broken!\n\nAfter a while you might start to think about how this can keep happening. How can so many people be okay with being broke? Well the reality is, it‚Äôs probably less than you think. Or at least enough of the poors are too dumb to know any better. \n\nThe reality is, the next golden generation is here and thriving. The baby boomers were known for having the easiest path to retirement in history, but damn gen X is making it look easy too.\n\nThink about it. These losers have essentially no life, high paying jobs, mortgages with all time low interest rates, 401k‚Äôs that have rallied harder than Jesus on the third day, and a severe lack of personality or passion, which results in a lust to just be richer than their friends. \n\nWe have a hoard of near retirees who work, spend money, and eat unseasoned chicken with roasted potatoes their whole life. A whole generation of buffets balls deep in the markets, who have rightfully been rewarded for their patience. The kicker is, these idiots won‚Äôt even retire as they wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with themselves if they did. \n\nThese people are the consumers keeping things afloat, and they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. As long as these people are buying new cars every 3 years, going out to eat 5 times a week, going on 2 vacations a year, and buying all the new tech in the world for their 20 something year old degenerate kids, things are going to be just fine. so stop waiting around for a crash that you only think will happen because your poor. The US economy is going to stay strong for way longer than you can imagine.\n\n\nEdit: some people here think this is me shitting on zoomers, or me shitting on millennials, or me shitting on gen X, or me shitting on boomers. Y‚Äôall need to chill. This is poking fun at 2 things: how dramatic people are. The economy ebs and flows. Faster now than ever.
