{"title": "Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google", "selftext": "\nSAN FRANCISCO — Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.\n\nThe decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.\n\nIn summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google’s payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/11/epic-google-trial-verdict/", "id": "18g9t8e", "created_utc": 1702343630.0, "score": 935, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "I was wondering why Epic Games lost to Apple but not Google. Epic Games had a similar lawsuit against Apple and lost a couple of years ago. Apple even won the appeal against Epic Games as well. I did a little bit of research and here is what I found. \n\n“The case was very different in terms of outcome from the antitrust case against Apple, which Epic Games largely lost. It still has a last-ditch appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court, but a lower court judge and an appeals court affirmed that Epic failed to prove its case that Apple was a monopolist. Epic won on just one point — that app and game devs should be allowed to advertise their alternative stores with lower prices inside their apps that are available on the Apple app store.”\n\n“But in this case, the jury decided Google had illegally tied its app store and its billing payment service together. And it also ruled that “Project Hug” deals, where Google paid game developers not to compete with its app store, were anticompetitive too.”\n\n“To me, Project Hug was the biggest difference between the Apple and Google cases. Since Apple makes its own smartphones, it didn’t have to cut deals with other companies to secure its business advantages. But while Google created the Android standard, it has invited many smartphone manufacturers to make phones based on the standard. To secure universal cooperation and to keep its Google Play store strong, Google initiated Project Hug, where it paid alternative stores such as Samsung and game developers substantial amounts of money to use its store rather than compete with it or to foreclose competition.”\n\n“For instance, with Samsung, Google paid Samsung money to ensure that Google Play was the only app store preinstalled on Samsung smartphones, aside from Samsung’s own store. And Google paid game developers to use the Google Play store rather than open up their own competing stores.”\n\n“Epic argued these practices enabled Google to extract excessive fees — as much as 30% royalties — for every purchase of an app, game, or in-game virtual good. Developers had no choice but to go along and pay the fees, Epic argued, and the jury evidently agreed.”\n\n“In contrast to the Apple case, Epic was able to surface witnesses during the Google trial who said that Google made payments with anticompetitive intent in mind when it convinced game devs and store owners not to compete. The result, Epic argued, was direct harm to consumers in terms of higher prices.”\n\n“Epic sued Google in federal court in 2020 on the same day it filed a lawsuit against Apple. Federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in that case that Apple didn’t have a monopoly on its app store an payment system.”\n\nI wish I could post the website but knowing this subreddit my comment will probably get deleted if I do that again.

No trailer hitch camera (a basic feature on pickup trucks for 20 years)\n4. Compared to other EVs a poor front trunk\n5. Viability of the front of the truck. Reviewer of all heights say you cannot see the end of the hood.  \n6. Stainless steel… I work with this material daily and would not use it for a vehicle that will live outside.\n7. Lack of frame which mean no recovery attachments points that are practical\n8. Storage under the bed has alway been a bad idea if you plan on using the bed for anything and don’t want it trapped until you off load.\n9.  As far as I can find Tesla cannot be used to automatically power your house in an event of power outage.

Home charging this beast will take longer than overnight and that would depend on the service you have to your house. Best case 16 hours but it could take much longer.  Ford it takes -8 hours. \n11. No motorized tailgate. For 100k that should be standard. I also will not buy another truck without an extendable tail gate step.  Which is weird since Tesla wants you to use the bed from the back.\n12. Extendable battery takes bed space. \n13.  It doesn’t have a real lockable differential. I believe this is why you see it struggling up hills that the lightning doesn’t. \n14. No way (that I can see) to add a winch or steel bumper (brush guard, lights…) I may be wrong but this is likely due to no frame\n15.  My preference no driver gauges and no knobs.

Increased tensions can lead to risk-averse behavior, potentially causing declines in stock prices.\n\n3. **Specific Market Exposure:** Markets or sectors with direct exposure to the affected region (like companies with significant operations in the Middle East) might be more impacted.\n\n4. **Global Context:** The global economic context, including factors like interest rates, economic growth, and other geopolitical risks, also plays a significant role.\n\n5. **Event Severity and Duration:** The severity and duration of the event are crucial. Short-term incidents might cause temporary volatility, while long-term conflicts could have more profound effects.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that predicting stock market movements is extremely difficult, even for experts, due to the complex interplay of various factors.

They're paid essentially to keep the market moving, and they make money by moving large blocks of shares and options based on their methodology and scalp the bid/ask spread on what they're supplying.\n\nBasically, they get shares at ideal prices and take the excess.\n\nMarket Makers are commonly thought of as directional, but they're directionally biased by their portfolios.\n\nThe normal method for the MM is to try to maintain delta neutrality. So if they get access to 500 shares, they might try to sell 10 covered calls at a delta of .50 ... and then they'll flex up as the market runs up, generating additive buying pressure.\n\nHowever, when the market trends, they end up off sides. Adherents of Max Pain theory here presume that these MMs are always at odds with options buyers, and want an ideal situation where they avoid paying back the most premium or being forced to give up shares.\n\nDuring lots of patterns, this theory makes perfect sense, and you'll see the market trade opposite its trend during OpEx periods (and you can see this increased on the intra-day after 0dte all week was introduced on index proxy ETFs)... with the exception of after you get a reversal, when an OpEx can trend.\n\nThe reason for this is that MMs have a portfolio bias to consider. They buy to facilitate selling when the market is going down on one side, and on the other they have a tranche of positions that maybe they're using to hedge sold puts, which they're selling. Ideally, these remain neutral, but during big trends they can get offsides, and in that circumstance the best profit potential is to let the market trend and abandon premium so their long share positions can run to get return that way. Also a lot of MMs work for institutions who have their own directional portfolios and while they're not supposed to care about that by strategy... we all know there's alignment there to some extent, even if it's just the conjunction of positional direction.\n\nBy contrast, the original commenter is just saying that wealthy people are buying up because they want to put money to work and this is seasonally supported (until tax loss selling or profit taking becomes attractive).\n\nEventually, the market trend changes slightly, or people are happy with their new positions relative to their perception of risk, and they stop supplying money... meanwhile the MMs continue doing their thing.\n\nSo I'm kind of saying you're both right.

It trades at a 31 pe. The street has 27 buy or overweight ratings and only 3 underweight or sell.\n\nMsft, reading at a 39 pe and up 70% ytd with earnings up 12% has 35 buys and zero sells.

Health care added 77k, gov 49k, both non cyclical industries that has nothing to do with interest rate or economy, and likely backfilling for positions they couldn't hire during covid. retail lost 40k jobs in a holiday month.

The fact that this year is gonna be another flat year for sp500 earnings doesn't sound very good.\n\nThe stock market isn't the economy. There's wealth effect, but it's not like the top 1% didn't spend last year when stock market was heavily down.

I do warn that forecasters (tend) to be more positive and have \"soft landing\" talks when stock market is up, and vice versa when it's down, but I wouldn't make anything out of it.\n\nThe main argument is the excess savings is gonna be drained by this year, or Q1 next year. It is now depleted among the bottom 60%, and mostly concentrated in the top 20%. When/before it is dried up, consumers will stop spending, and businesses will hire less and fire employees to cut cost, leading to further less spending and the domino continues. That's the non-linear aspect of recession that we haven't really had to face yet.\n\nThere's also the corporate refinance cycle next year that businesses are really praying the fed cuts rate before then. Therefore, the longer the recession takes to hit(and it has to hit at some point simply because economic cycles exist), corporates balance sheet will become more stressed, consumers will become complacent and leverage up, and the more severe it's gonna be.
