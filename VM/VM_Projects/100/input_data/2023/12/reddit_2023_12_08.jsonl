Sweden has very little law regulating labor market (actually quite libertarian even if we say socialism). For example: there are no laws on minimum wage! You can start a company in sweden (very easy) and hire people full time for 1 USD/month wage (if anyone would take that) and be within the law. Then if the workers would form a “union” and contribute money every month (and over time become a rich union, because it invests money in stocks) have the capability to “strike” it is up to them! (the company pays no salary during a strike, instead the union will pay salaries). \n\nHowever, due to practical purposes, the state stayed out of regulation of labor market. But also stayed out of preventing union practices such as sympathy strikes.\n\nThat said, there is one main area Swedish law regulates labor market: Who can get fired. Law says Last-In-First-Out (with 2 people exempted) and that the unions have power to circumvent this rule if they approve. This makes in many ways the unions to be something companies wants. For example, if you want to fire the 10% least performers in a company no matter when they were hired, you can do that if you work with the unions. Also Unions hold back salary increases (eg max 2% in a year on average) and thus limit worker churn between companies.\n\n(the Swedish unions care about maximizing the amount of workers, not improve an individual worker’s life)\n\nBtw. The unions in Sweden calculated they have enough money to strike against Tesla for 500 years.\n\nOf course, Tesla hire high-achievers that expect more pay-rise than 2% per year that don’t want to be in a union. But due to “Libertarian” values in society, sympathy strikes are legal - and this is what is crippling Tesla atm (no postal service). 😊 Btw. Logic conclusion of lawsuits are that the postal service does nothing wrong, as the sympathy strike is within law and it is equivalent to force major, but also that Tesla has right to pick up registration plates themselves, i.e. when all is said and done Tesla should be able to function still but they have to pick up registration plates themselves + maybe buy one of the harbors that can receive shipments of cars (should not be a problem for Tesla/Elon to afford).\n\nOr maybe it would be easier to sign the agreement with the unions? I doubt Tesla would have higher costs (the union-mandated insurance is like 30 usd/month, and Tesla probably already have the equivalent), but in return they would be able to fire anyone that is low performing and only increase salaries with 2% per year (however they would not be able to reward top-talent, who would instead go elsewhere*) 🤔\n\nWhat do you think Tesla will do?\n\n*) “elsewhere” is either startup (unions don’t notice/care) or abroad (US etc).", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Much of the information is correct but a CAB just set the floor.

Barring discrimination you can use that 2% salary budget increase as you wish giving the high performers 3% and the lower performers 1% and then give John and Lisa 25% because they’re awesome.\n\nIn short.

Meanwhile, in the two years following the approval of mRNA vaccines (2021 and 2022), Moderna and Pfizer have earned $42B in *additional* net income above 2019 ($116B in additional revenue), which was already pretty much their high water marks in terms of net income. This additional income was at obscene margins (better than Facebook, who makes a fucking app), and primarily due to the Covid-19 shots.\n\nUsing basic reasoning abilities, it stands to reason that Pfizer and Moderna could buy multiple entire elections to keep up the gravy train. Remember, mRNA has no other FDA approved purpose as of yet, and thus immediately loses all revenue and income if people stop taking the booster shots. In the case of Moderna, they would go from $10B+ in sales to something like $1B (in grant revenue given by the govt to do more mRNA research).\n\nOf course, this does not necessarily mean that it is ineffective, but it certainly means that you will never ever know if it were ineffective. Given that Covid-19 is a RNA virus, it mutates rapidly and each booster's efficacy is wildly different. \n\nLastly, the reality is that what's going around probably is not Covid-19.

We live in a spending economy based on Keynesian Economics which promotes a low rate environment and heavy consumer spending- which is what has been in place since we came off the gold standard in the 70's and experienced pretty rampant inflation due to an unencumbered increase in the money supply, low rates which means cheap debt, and a change in the structure of retirement & compensation packages that heavily promote the flow of cash into the markets (high earners often are paid in equity more so than cash). All of this leads to a pump in the price of goods, an increase in profits, and increase in the cost of equity- which results in the record profits. Since the implementation of this system the government has tested and tried to find the best way to reduce variance within the economy specifically figuring out the best way to implement policy to reduce the downside- done since the 70's (also when we went off the gold standard). This in turn creates a synthetic upward trend which we've seen with the bull market in the 2010's. To intentionally create a recession or depression is against the Fed's typical behavior, which can be seen in the reversal of the monetary stance in 2018 (they do want to decrease average workers earnings and keep it an employers market however). \n\nThey do not want us to live frugally which was proven when they pumped trillions of dollars into the economy during COVID with the sole purpose of stimulating consumer spending. In addition there's more evidence to support that the variable they want to bring down is average wages because JPOW literally stated it in 2022 and has brought the average wages down the last 2 years. They want us to keep spending and allow unfettered growth in companies which allows the market to continue to grow and prop up the economy which makes people who are stable and have money even more money. There's a balance though which means they can't take the economy and make every day life unaffordable for the average person.
