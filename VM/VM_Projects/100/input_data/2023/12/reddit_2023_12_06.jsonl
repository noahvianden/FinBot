You're assuming cash on the balance sheet has a 1:1 relationship with stock price/ market cap.

Same business, same everything.\n\nOne, AAPL A, has no cash and is worth $3T or $193 per share.\n\nThe other, AAPL B, has $3T cash and in your mind should be worth $6T or $386 per share.\n\nWhich company would you invest in?\n\nThe rational choice is AAPL A. They're getting 100% exposure to AAPL's business, whereas AAPL B they're only getting 50% exposure to AAPL's business, the remainder is invested in cash.\n\nGrowth rate and earnings will be half for AAPL B. \n\nIf AAPL doubles their revenue and profits, and stock price doubles then $10k invested in AAPL A would become $20k.\n\n$10k invested in AAPL B would only become $15k + any interest on cash.\n\nIt's the same logic on why companies borrow money instead of issuing more stock, it boosts shareholder return through capital efficiency. \n\nThe company borrows so you reap the benefits of the returns minus cost of debt.\n\nPeople can easily understand how borrowing from the bank can allow them to get huge property gains with only the down payment. \n\nPeople also understand that cash in the bank not being invested is missing out on stock returns.\n\nHowever, people have trouble applying that knowledge they have to companies.\n\n\nLastly for the people who think in terms of DCF and discount rate. If you're discounting a company's cash flows by 10% and the cash on balance sheet is generating 5%, then mathematically more cash on the balance sheet has a negative impact on the stock price versus buying back stock.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Dead wrong actually!

Attack me personally as much as you’d like because I’m not seeing any arguments as to why investing in Tesla now is better than investing in Tesla back in 2014. Product pricing is a complicated aspect of business. The 4Ps, the 5Cs… you can’t force customers to buy your stuff. 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers. I feel like I have to go back to the very basics of business to articulate why lowering the price on their top tier cars makes customer who bought them recently unhappy about the brand. But this isn’t a consumer feeling sub, it’s an investment sub. Their margin on their top tier cars were reduced with the price cuts. Unless you increase volume by more than 34% it’s a bad business decision to reduce your price by 34% (price & demand elasticity).

My car is a depreciating asset. If you take the information like a business, you look at the percentage and not the dollar amount- because it’s all relative. Off 2 million dollars, a daily fluctuation of 40k is 2%. 34% vs 2%. If your brokerage account decreased by 34% and only continued to decline, you may feel differently about your portfolio. If your account is less than 1 million and you have daily fluctuations of 40k, that’s a 4% daily swing which is getting pretty high considering most  accounts target a 10% yearly return.\n\nAs an investor, when I see the company reduce their price by 34%, and I don’t see a 34% increase in volume, at the same margins, it’s a bad business decision. In terms of keeping me as a model S customer, my customer journey looks different after their pricing changed due to my perceived brand value. Value for business = price - cost. Value for customer = perceived value - price. If the car cost 60k to make, and sold for 100k, 100-60= 40k company value created. As a customer, 100k perceived value - 100 price = 0 (as a reference point). The new pricing for those customers is the new price minus how much they paid, 80k-100k= -20k.\n\nI feel like a similar mistake was made with twitter. A company that depends on volume (users) and value (interested posts vs promoted / ads) to create profit. You can’t have the company be worth more when you decrease value, decrease users, and now decreasing ads.\n\nTesla does have upsides, their software has no marginal costs. If they charged for updates I can see them making up for the lost margins- but users may not like this. They also have the best charging network so opening their charging standard to be adopted industry wide was a great early decision. I think they did it in 2016 and it took 8 years for other car makers to utilize. \n\nEverything you’re saying is a feeling or an insult. Talk is cheap. My news feed has 3 Tesla headlines. 1.

So, you have items in your cart and receive a notification that a product has decreased by a few pennies; that pushes you to compete the purchase. That is amazons model and they have maintained their brand value. That’s pricing elasticity based off demand.\n\nChanging the price based off FP&A is not pricing off demand, it’s pricing off assumptions. Whatever assumption was made, they changed it, meaning they were wrong. It isn’t dynamic but more of a cash grab. I can understand that in terms of releasing a new, high demand, limited production product, like their cyber trucks.\n\nDealerships are separate entities from the manufacturer. I get avoiding them for all their flaws and I get their side of the incentive to raise prices. But they don’t destroy brand value when they say MSRP is x and we are charging x+. That’s not coming from the manufacturer but marketing lies the dealership is spewing. It’s coming from the a middle man that wants to increase their spread. I’d argue, dealerships have shot themselves in the foot by not understanding this same principle. \n\nThe price of a used Tesla has crashed. That is because the manufacturer has lowered their msrp price. A customer, who has bought from Tesla, is more likely to shop other brands when seeing their purchase has depreciated not because of demand, but because of price reductions.\n\nIn my case, why would I pay 100k+ now, and buy their same car later, when it lost so much value? And it’s not perceived value but actual value. Did something happen to make a Tesla cost 34% less now than a year ago? As an investor, why would you allow or be happy with a top tier item being reduced by 34% unless the volume increase is greater than 34%?\n\nI dunno, as a former investor, and someone who owns their cars, my next purchase (not for another 5 years) is likely Mercedes or perhaps even lucid if they are still around. And manufacturers seem to recognize the dealership issue by creating a separate entity to sell their EVs directly to consumers (GM think).\n\nI don’t invest based off my feelings. I buy products and services off of feelings. When someone invests, they invest in both the product / service as well as the people. Investment wise, I think their price games was a mistake. If I saw an increase in demand due to their price cuts I may still invest. As a consumer, I feel the brand hurt itself with their pricing and I don’t want my purchase to be devalued so much, not because of demand, but because of pricing.\n\nI don’t know what else to say. I was an investor and now, am not. I’m not institutional so I don’t have the ability to buy at discounts and hold. As an investor, I took the massive gains and left. I have a 2023 model S I bought at the height or the market and a 2021 model y I got at the low / middle. Personally, I’ll be looking at Mercedes or lucid for my next 100K purchase and won’t be investing back into Tesla. Not because it’s a bad car but because they destroyed their brand value in my eyes and I don’t see an increase in sales greater than their decrease in price cuts. If you disagree, that’s fine.

In Germany any union job will get you 70k$ easily out of university and you have half the COL compared to London.\n\n>the top contributors will always take a higher pay over job stability/protection\n\nAs a top performer after 5-10 YOE depending on your achievements you generally reach a salary level higher than the biggest union pay (120k$) and you are free to negotiate your own salary so union doesn't prevent you from doing that - if your friend couldn't do this it's because he is not a top performer. \n\n>Really any developed country not in EU treats their technical expertise better.\n\nI don't think you thought this through. Again, Canada and Australia are not it, their salaries are at the same level as Germany and with much higher COL. There might be some oil states but I hope I don't have to explain why that's different. It's easy to sit in the US and judge because the economy in the last 30 years has left the EU behind and that's why you have much higher salary levels over there. The reality is though it still has among the best salaries in the world (better than UK, France, all of Asia and Africa) - I don't know what mysterious countries  you are talking about because there are basically none with better salaries (I'll give you Switzerland)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Yeah but cost of living is lower in Spain when compared with us cities or even other European cities.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes cost of living is lower...but usually US professionals can have more money leftover after expenses than the entire paycheck of European peers.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Shhh European professionals get upset when you remind them their American counterparts make 4 times more than them.

This influx of money was aimed at mitigating the economic impact of lockdowns and reduced consumer spending. However, this surge in liquidity also led to inflationary pressures as the money supply increased significantly.\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict further exacerbated these challenges. The conflict disrupted global supply chains, particularly in energy and agriculture sectors, leading to shortages and further inflation. These disruptions were compounded by stringent industrial shutdowns in countries like China, a major global manufacturing hub. These shutdowns resulted in a significant reduction in the supply of various products, from electronics to basic consumer goods.\n\nThe combined effect of these events created a unique economic scenario. On one hand, there was excess liquidity due to government stimulus, fueling consumer demand. On the other, supply chain disruptions and reduced industrial output led to a shortage of goods. This mismatch between supply and demand has contributed to inflation and economic instability.\n\nEconomies typically take time to adjust to such large-scale disruptions.
