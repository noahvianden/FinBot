People familiar with the discussions reportedly told the WSJ that Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus aren't just looking to end Netflix's reign as the world's best streaming service. Per the US outlet's sources, the duo are also said to want to offer their services as a joint enterprise in a bid to save people money. Indeed, the two companies are believed to have had meaningful dialog about offering said bundle at a cheaper price than subscribing to both streamers separately – a deal that would surely pique the interest of customers operating on a budget.\n\nIf the WSJ's report is correct – the outlet is keen to stress talks are still in the early stages – the potential bundling of Paramount Plus and Apple TV Plus into a single package could have a big impact on the wider streaming industry. For one, the world's eight biggest streamers have all raised their prices over the past 12 months – some, such as Disney Plus and Max, have done so twice in less than a year in the US. That's placed undue pressure on people who are subscribed to multiple services, with many forced to choose which one (or, at a push two) to stay with as the cost of living continues to bite.\n\nThe bundling of Paramount and Apple's platforms, then, would be seen as a significant move. Like their rivals, the pair have increased their subscription fees in 2023 – Apple TV Plus' major price hike was particularly irksome to me – and, while each one has some great content to offer customers, their back catalogs aren't on a par with Netflix, Prime Video, or even Hulu.

Religions can be a force for whatever, they are not inherently good or bad, but they are often used as a tool for evil, in many forms.\n\nThe question is, would the world be better or worse without this tool?

Their brain melts when you challenge the infallibility of their book.  But as you say, why would an atheist waste excess thought cycles on something that doesn't have any influence over them or their actions?\n\nThe even funnier thing is that in the grand scheme of things, given that there are a couple thousand religions in the world, most theists are *almost as* atheistic as an atheist.

It relies on in-groups and out-groups to determine who belongs to which \"tribe\".  As families become more blended over time, they'll be forced to reconcile the traditional divisiveness of religions in general.  With that, I see future generations casting it away in favour of a more humanistic perspective, unburdened by the dogma and hate of traditional religion.  I also believe this is a huge reason why religious conservatives are so scared of immigration.
