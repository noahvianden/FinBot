Once you eventually arrive at retirement age (it’ll happen a lot sooner than you think) you’ll only be taxed on the 401(k) money, but everything you socked away into the ROTH IRA will be entirely tax free income!  Don’t forget that most companies will “match” your contribution up to a certain percentage, so at minimum you must contribute as much as they will match, because otherwise you’re just throwing away free money. Example:  if you save and deposit 6% of your pretax money into your 401(k), and your company will match up to 6% of your contributions, you end up with 12% annually plus you start compounding interest which will lead to significant wealth in just a few years time.  If you were to keep that 6% pre tax money in your paycheck you’d end up with approximately just a little under 4% - maybe closer to 3.5%.  Would you rather have 3.5% in your pocket or 12% in a retirement account that’s going to grow by 6-8% per year (and that’s a conservative estimate for growth).

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "18obygy", "created_utc": 1703241011.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "PCE -0.1% MoM, Exp. 0.0% \n\nCore PCE 0.1% MoM, Exp. 0.2%\n\nPCE 2.6% YoY, Exp. 2.8%\n\nCore PCE 3.2% YoY, Exp. 3.3%\n\nDurable Goods 5.4%, Exp. 2.3%, Last -5.1%\n\nDurable Goods ex Trans 0.5%, Exp. 0.1%, Last -0.3%\n\nCap goods orders nondefense ex air 0.8%, exp. 0.1%, last -0.6%", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Look at that negative sign.\n\n\nWould you just look at it.", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "RKLB up 17% premarket on news of government contract worth $515 million to design, build, and deliver 18 space vehicles.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "My gem stock.

That said, the red line shows that of that small proportion in collections, the amount in the red is higher. Now someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not think this is inflation adjusted, so that $1600, while high, is actually not much higher than in say 2012 or 2013. The red line is being driven up by everything getting inflated.\n- As always, [most household debt is mortgage debt](https://i.imgur.com/RNZmQ7m.png), and are mostly only given to those with [high credit scores](https://i.imgur.com/0UOCRuo.png), unlike pre GFC.

And the total frequency is still very low, indicating minimal stress in consumer finances.\n- If we [break down delinquency by type of debt](https://i.imgur.com/dlC1S3s.png), you can see where stress is more common. Credit card delinquency rates tend to be highest, although they are still at pre-pandemic normal levels. There has not been a real spike in credit card delinquencies.

I won't summarize them all. My general takeaway is that nothing here really concerns me with respect to the stock market / overall economy.

And, well, if that's what you came for, and honestly what else would you come to a MonsterVerse flick for, then this movie fucking delivers. Hoo boy, does this movie fucking deliver. Wew lads, there is so much Godzilla and King Kong punching each other that it's hard to believe they had time for anything else resembling a story.\n\nWhich, actually, they didn't. There is barely a story in this film, and other than it being cool to see some characters from KOTM 2019 again, it's very obvious that almost the entire actual humans doing things part of this movie was cut to the bone. Director Adam Wingard stated that the original footage for the film was enough to have a 5 hours picture but his intent was to make a 2 hours or less film and that's what he did. Basically this means 3 hours of humans doing things was cut, giving the film an even more breathless pace than KOTM 2019 had.\n\nSo anyways, yeah humans are vaguely seen running around, flying around, visiting the Hollow Earth for the first time, something about a power source, a generic evil corporation, and then Mechagodzilla. Just Godzilla and King Kong weren't enough, so they had to cram good old G-Metal in there too to make sure there was someone else to beat up because Godzilla and King Kong already fight 4 times in this movie and you need more than just that, same reason why UFC has undercards and title cards.\n\nI'm not sure what they plan to do with the upcoming Godzilla x Kong but we already know it involves the Hollow Earth and might be a really big apes version of Planet of the Apes.

It seriously would not surprise me if the auto industry lobbies in favor of more regulations because regulations overall help them maintain their positions.\n\nIt would also be helpful for foreign competitors who are already entrenched (eg.

Both of which is more expensive than just making a car for one market.The US barely sells any cars outside their own market. Nobody really uses those large horrible pick up trucks anyway, its American market only and a few people who want to be \"different\" and therefore you see one or two of them on European roads from time to time.\n\nNot to mention that US companies often simply do not have a competing product at all. Small or efficient cars in general often are not available in the US, so keeping them outside of their market has no cost to the US manufacturers but removes a huge chunk of highly competitive offerings that would undercut them and be hugely popular probably causing the US manufacturers to shrink into obsurity if they stopped their protectionism.\n\nJust to further make my point: Brands like VW and BMW sell completely different versions of the same car in USA compared to Europe. Often the car is made to a different quality and of bigger size even though the design and model name is identifical. They are also made in the US so when Americans complain about BMWs having bad quality I really can not take that information into account when buying a BMW made in Germany by Germans with a German design for the EU market.
