One adapts to the market and scalps in bullish or bearish flow. So if the trading that day tends to be bearish those algorithms lower the bids so they can scalp safely in a falling market. These algorithms goal is end the day in cash, just with more cash than they started. And they almost never lose money. The other type is run by trade execution services and has a specific goal. When a company is added to an index an execution services job is to buy the shares in such a way that the index and underlying prices match. If a company wants to dilute or distribute shares an execution service does this. If a hedge funds wants to buy a stock after a catalyst an execution service does this. There is really no human involved. The code just tries to make as much money as it can on whatever it is doing.
