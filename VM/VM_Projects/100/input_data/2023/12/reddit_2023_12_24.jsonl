The option premium is like the equity you have in the position, and the difference between that and the notional value is like the loan amount. We can make that approximation because delta rapidly approaches 1 as you get deep into the money.

The money paid for the call option would reduce the other profits made and you would end paying tax on a lower amount - at the same time shifting tax liability to the following year where the cost basis for NVDA would be very very low and taxes would only be payable if sold on its entity.

Shares will fly on better than expected inventory reduction, interest rate cuts lowering debt burden, and multiple expansion supported by broader market rally. This company has the highest ROA of any tech company in the entire NYSE and has really high earnings per employee as well as margins compared to peers. [Here was my very first post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/183gyxf/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_nov_25_2023/kar6t01/). And [another comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18b94i5/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_dec/kc6376p/). I have a small position at $120 average price. Similar company but much much riskier is CLFD for fiber internet infrastructure. I'm very underwater on this one (cost basis $56). If BEADS money from the government (for fiber buildout) kicks in + the larger players increase spending, CLFD could see huge earnings expansion. It will have a loss in the immediate 2 quarters though.\n- $PYPL: I have shares at $58 a piece. Strong earnings growth will knock out the consensus narrative. Not going to elaborate too much. [Short comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17hjomv/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/k6qiq8f/) for example, [or here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17c75i3/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/k5qlx1b/).\n- $PFE: I don't own nor plan to, but I think this company will see some multiple expansion and possibly earnings expansion toward end of 2024. Right now narrative of Covid and patent expiration is hanging over the stock. More positive announcements in time will reverse the narrative. And dividend yield helps too. (6% and they just raised it too) But I'm not confident enough to be absolutely sure, more just a bet on overdone sell-off.\n- $HCC. No current position, but I've been eyeing it for more than 6 months. I saw a huge win this year with $AMR (cost basis $150, sold half my position, which was at its peak 6% of my portfolio), and $HCC has shared some of the glory but there is much more room to expand. These are both metallurgical coal (= input to steel) companies, and while $AMR is the 'king' of them all due to its buybacks and managaement, only a few met coal companies are actually in position to expand production (only two real ways to increase profits here, either higher commodity prices or more production. Met coal prices are doing phenomenal but only so much upside.) $BTU is another peer but its half thermal coal and the pricing situation for thermal coal looks ugly.\n- $CROX. A lot of the gains already have been had, but a broader market rally could see it fly. [Here is example of some of the analysis I've done](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18easl6/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_dec_09_2023/kctqrnb/). My DCF model suggests it is about fair value but I was just using analyst revenue assumptions--if it beats them, stock could fly to $180-200. Have shares at $85 average. International growth (Asia especially) will be key to beating analyst expectations.\n- $ENPH on interest rate cuts. Haven't researched this one as closely though. No position.\n- $CELH. No position. International TAM is massive. Look at Monster energy drink which has 40% of its sales internationally. CELH is at 96% domestic. Yes, the stock price / revenue growth has already been enormous, in the triple digits, but watch out if it takes off in Europe/Asia/etc.\n- $CVS is too cheap. Deserves much higher premium over for example $WBA. [Comment here on why it's better than WBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18frkpe/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_dec_11_2023/kcz4vvm/), and a [more extensive write-up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/186mdrx/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_nov_29_2023/kbbw778/).

[Comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17xc5oy/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_nov/k9otkis/).\n- $META: it will hit $500 a share by end of 2024.

Endpoint security is basically what someone would call antivirus, if I were to dumb it down. Education is a different beast, because no software will make your staff not write their passwords on a sticky note under their keyboards. Application security helps developers not write vulnerable software, managing this is once again not easily automated from start to finish, because you have to make sure that requested changes are actually happening, but you also have to provide help to developers finding alternative solutions for that particular business problem.\n\nSince you mentioned consulting, consulting is basically selling security professionals' time as a service. If your company is not large enough to have its own security program with an internal team, you can outsource your SOC to them, if you don't have an internal auditor for security specific audits, you can request help to evaluate your situation and work with you to achieve your compliance goals. Most companies are also required to have a penetration test done every 0.5-1 years by a 3rd party, this is a basically guaranteed revenue source for consulting companies.\n\nSo for 'cybersecurity' it involves lots of parties to achieve a goal, security teams use lots of tools, and several companies are involved either directly or indirectly.

{"title": "Barrons: Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is Behind the S&P over the past year + 5, 10, & 20 Years", "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway stock is having a disappointing finish to 2023, putting Warren Buffett’s conglomerate behind the S&P 500 over the past 10 years.\n\nThe Class A shares have lagged behind the S&P 500 by about nine percentage points during the current quarter and now are up about 16% in 2023. That compares with a roughly 26% total return for the index. \n\nThe shares are up an annualized 12% in the last 10 years, slightly behind the 12.2% yearly total return, including dividends, for the index. Berkshire also is behind the S&P 500 over the past five years with a 13.4% annualized return, compared with 16.4% for the index., according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nBerkshire’s Class A shares were up 0.3% Friday to $542,600 while the Class B stock was 0.1% higher at $356.47.\n\nThe stock is roughly even with the index over the past 20 years with a 9.8% annualized return. That is despite dramatic growth in the company’s operating profits and Buffett’s coup in buying Apple stock, which is showing a nearly $150 billion gain for Berkshire. \n\nBerkshire stock’s lagging performance shows how difficult it is for even an investor of Buffett’s stature to beat an index driven by powerful megacap tech stocks, especially given Berkshire’s huge size. Its asset base is about $1 trillion.\n\nIt isn’t clear why the stock is lagging behind the market lately. The company is finishing what likely will be a record year for profits. After-tax operating earnings could rise more than 25% to nearly $40 billion in 2023. \n\nBerkshire’s big property and casualty insurance business is humming as Geico, the auto insurance unit, undergoes a profit turnaround. Berkshire’s $350 billion equity portfolio is topping the market this year led by Apple, which has gained 55% this year to about $194 a share. Apple accounts for nearly half the portfolio.\n\nThe Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, another of Berkshire’s key businesses, is more valuable this quarter thanks to the rally in shares of its chief rival, Union Pacific could be worth $150 billion, in line with Union Pacific, while all of Berkshire is now valued at about $775 billion.\n\nBerkshire also is benefiting from the sharp rise in short-term interest rates since early 2022. The company is sitting on more than $150 billion in cash that is mostly invested in U.S. Treasury bills yielding above 5%.\n\nIt could be that investors anticipate lower earnings on the cash next year, reasoning that the Federal Reserve may well cut short-term rates.\n\nThere also could be concern about Buffet’s age. He turned 93 in August, writing last month that he feels “good” but saying he is fully aware he is “playing in extra innings.” The fact that Berkshire could soon lose the leader that built the company over nearly 60 years was highlighted by the recent death of Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger at 99. \n\nBarron’s recently named Berkshire as a top stock for 2024 based on what looks like a reasonable valuation at 20 times projected 2024 earnings. The company is valued at 1.4 times our estimate of year-end 2023 book value of about $390,000 per class A share.\n\nBuffett may not have many years left at the helm but he seems as sharp and engaged as ever. He could still find the elephant-size acquisition totaling $50 billion or more that he has long sought.\n\nWhile he said last year that Berkshire has no interest in owning Occidental Petroleum  , Buffett could change his mind. Berkshire continues to add to its stake and now owns about 28% of the energy company. Occidental is valued at more than $50 billion, meaning Berkshire could well snap it up.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-stock-warren-buffett-underperform-f9539619", "id": "18q43qj", "created_utc": 1703452686.0, "score": 372, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "The majority of Berkshire shareholders don’t hold it for outsized gains - they hold it to avoid large drawdowns.

{"title": "Year end reflections", "selftext": "I've never posted anything useful on WSB, so thought I would take a stab at giving something back to all you regards. Here goes...\n\nFirst off, a little background. Back in 2020 Covid hit and Western policymakers literally lost their minds and embarked on MMT on a truly breath taking scale. Let's use a simple chart to drive home the point. Here is the YoY growth in M2 as per the FRED website ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ke0jg9bmz88c1.png?width=1497&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddadcfddfb53d184e4530f3a14ce8e8dd56e3ab3\n\nInflation skyrocketed and speculative assets went berserk (crypto, spacs, meme stocks etc). Of course the inflation was transitory and almost certainly caused by Covid-related supply chain shocks (sarcasm).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rhvq5j6198c1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=3de93ef0fb8a2aab425198c53b2f0fbff2744d01\n\nYou don't need a PhD in economics to know that Santa Claus isn't real, and you also don't need one to know what caused inflation (hint - it might have been handing out free money to everyone).\n\nEventually the FED decide that inflation might not be so transitory after all, and decided to rapidly increase the FED Funds rate from basically zero to just over 5%. They did this after around 15 years of zero interest rate policy where borrowers had all become addicted to free money. Another hint, people borrow a lot more money when interest rates are low and are therefore even more sensitive to increases.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1nblggkv88c1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a2e05b14a969975b13a1a2b3483c8acdf923c79\n\nAs we can see in the charts above, the M2 YoY growth has gone negative, and interest rates have risen by 5% off of a near zero base. Most investors were expecting this (quite logically) to result in an economic slowdown.\n\nNow, inflation is clearly falling (is that surprising given how far/fast monetary policy has tightened?) but the economy is apparently doing just fine because unemployment is still low. Powell has pivoted and the media is fawning all over him for achieving a soft landing (note, we haven't landed yet).\n\nMeanwhile, are there any signs that maybe we should be worried?\n\n\\- The Conference Board's [Leading Indicator Index](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-conference-board-leading-economic-index-lei-for-the-us-fell-again-in-november-302021055.html) just fell again and continues to signal a recession in 2024.- US credit and auto delinquencies [continue](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-buy-now-pay-later-splurges-raise-holiday-debt-hangover-risk-2023-12-20/) to rise.- China's real estate sector is still [imploding](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bricks-banks-chinas-real-estate-190110747.html).- German property prices are [tumbling](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-home-prices-fall-record-102-third-quarter-2023-12-22/) and Europe is heading for a hard landing.- The UK appears to be [heading](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67799713) for a mild recession.- FedEx just [slumped](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fedexs-stock-drops-as-company-trims-sales-forecast-10478d00) after a profit warning.- We just had an unusually [weak](https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/2023/11/sp-500-2023-q3-earnings-review-aggregate-earnings-reach-an-all-time-high/#) Q3 earnings season.- In the long run current valuations tend to predict future returns, and these look [pretty unappealing](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp-the-buffett-indicator/) in the US.\n\nI could go on and on.\n\nInvesting is a game of probabilities, a soft landing is certainly possible, so is a resurgence in inflation, and so is a hard landing. I find it absolutely mind boggling how confident so many people suddenly seem to be so confident in the soft landing.\n\nI'll leave you with two parting thoughts...\n\n\\- In **November 2023** most people [thought](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more) that interest rates were going to be high for a decade or more.- In **late 2007** plenty of experts were [sure](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN26247192/) that we were heading for a soft landing.\n\nPersonally, I look at all of the data and still think that there is a real risk of a hard landing but am trying to maintain a portfolio that will survive in many scenarios. I hope that this inspires some of you to think for yourselves rather than falling for the FOMO and jumping into expensive equities because indices are surging and there is a growing chorus that you are going to be left behind in the next bull market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "18pw67d", "created_utc": 1703427860.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

My rough approach with my own investments has been to do the following…\n\n- Pay attention to valuations. They help to provide a cushion if your thesis goes wrong.\n- Be a contrarian when it makes sense. There’s no point being bearish on the magnificent 7 at the moment just because most people are bullish. You might get run over by a stampede. It does make sense to think for yourself though. The simple wisdom of buying low and selling high usually requires you to buy when everyone else is terrified and to sell when most others are buying. \n- Diversify. Diversification is the only free lunch. If all your investments are different versions of the same bet, there is a good risk that you will have a big drawdown at some point.\n- Size small. It’s always tempting to take a huge position as soon as something looks cheap. I usually start at around 10% of the size that I want to do so that I have plenty of firepower to keep adding if it gets cheaper. Good examples right now, I’m long Singapore but don’t want to get blown up if China invades Taiwan, I’m short the Nasdaq but want to be able to survive another 100-200% rally.\n- Look at technicals. I used to think these were BS, but no harm in waiting for these to be on your side.  Now I wait for RSIs and moving averages to be on my side before sizing up positions.\n- Get lucky. Investing is hard, anyone who has outperformed has probably also had some good luck/chance.\n\nGood luck and hope that helps you!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Similar experience (CFA charterholder) and I agree with you 100%.
