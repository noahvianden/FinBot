The average return investing at ATHs is actually greater than investing at any other time.\n\nA more prescient question is whether today's valuations and internals support healthy returns over the medium term. That's debatable.[https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc231214/](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc231214/)\n\nTo be clear, the most common next step for an expensive market is to become even more expensive. But it is hard to argue that the path looks great from here. Record margins either have to grow yet higher, let alone at current heights, *while* valuations must do the same - unless we're going to manufacture significant real GDP growth somehow for the first time in decades.\n\nI kind of hate to mention this because the best path for everyone is usually to buy and hold forever.  But this is certainly no cheap market, and no time to be particularly greedy, unless you are an odd lot who can worry not a bit about the short term and invest solely for the maximum value in 30 years or so. Even still, it could be wise to wait for a good entry as it would be quite the ***\"golden swan\"*** if the market *did not* suffer a serious draw down eventually. (yes I just made up \"golden swan). The difficulty in this approach is underperforming for months or years as the momentum continues. This is very difficult to do in practice. Working in your favor is the opportunity to lock in 5-8% returns in fixed income for several years, depending where you want to go on the quality scale.  As weird as it sounds, treasury bills **typically, repeatedly** outperform the S&P over wide time horizons, particularly when valuations are elevated.   \n\n\nTreasuries outperforming the S&P over any extended period sounds bonkers but its true. This is what happens when there are large draw downs. Over the following periods, treasury bills outperformed the S&P:  \nAug 1929 to July 1950  \nDec 1968 to Dec 1987  \nMar 1998 to Mar 2020  \nApr 2007 to Mar 2020  \n\n\nAgain, it sounds crazy, and it obviously requires timing. Missing timing would result in *significant underperformance.* The seemingly more reliable entries to go to T-bills have been during times of elevated valuations such as today. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not necessarily suggesting not own equities (although I guess I am arguing for it  in a way, but hey this is the data!)

Never had a losing year for the next 5 years - i made back all those losses in the 5th year and now I’m up close to 400k in my entire trading “career” (quotes because I have a full time job).\n\nMy accounts and trades are now set up in a way where I can’t have another blow up. I have checks and balances to achieve this - i never keep more than 35k in my account by depositing anything over that to my HYS account (35k because account needs to be over 25k to avoid PDT restrictions, and 10k as a buffer cause options are volatile and you need to give yourself room to operate when positions are going against you). I set a withdrawal limit so I can’t deposit more than 10k in any given day, and even those deposits take 2-3 business days to clear, not allowing me to revenge trade after a bad trade. I hedge my positions when they are up a certain amount, I take profits early when markets are volatile. I put profits from options trading into shares when my HYS account grows too large in comparison to my equity holdings. This is what my definition of being a successful trader is - it’s building a long term plan with contingencies. It’s not about being right or wrong in the short term.
