{"title": "With the markets pretty much back to ATH today, let's review some of this sub's most popular (and most inaccurate quotes) from last year", "selftext": "Back in 2022, this sub was rampant with fear, doom-posting, and just blatantly wrong information.  Some of my favorites include:  \n\n\n1.  \"The market will never recover until it breaks below the pre-covid high\"\n2. \"Historically, the market never bottoms until AFTER the pivot\"\n3. \"Historically, inflation cannot be beaten without raising rates until they are above the highest point of inflation (around 9%)\"\n4. \"A recession is 100% coming in 2023\"\n5. \"Inflation is going to come roaring back once the fed slows rate hikes down\"\n6. \"We are entering another DECADE OF DARKNESS\"\n7. \"Don't fight the fed!! (usually suggesting not to buy into the market until the fed clearly signals the pivot\"\n8. And of course, my absolute favorite: **\"This time it's different\"**\n\nLet me know if I've missed anything.\n\nThese statements were by far the most upvoted statements on this sub last year.  I hope this goes to show that the market doesn't give a shit about what this sub or anyone else thinks.  It's going to do what it's going to do.  The only proven strategy is to continue buying during major downturns and ignore all of the fear and noise.

Give a day or week even because at the end you already bought put option as part of loss insurance. \n\nIf it goes down further, that's when you start DCAing. \n\nFor the lots you DCAing, you can still do buy put option to protect even further downside. \n\n\nAlso if it goes even further down (i.e 5), you can sell 2P with premium. \n\nIf it reaches 2 and have to buy shares as an option seller, there's your valuation you feel comfortable. \n\nIf it doesnt reach 2 but rips like right now, not only you can make profits from premium that expired at worthless, but also then you can sell leap call option. \n\nI did sell 12C expiring SEP2024 (that i bought at 6.0) for 3% premium. If it's at SEP 2024,  and i have to sell my HIMS at 12, ill gladly take profits at 100% gain. No issue at all if i can make 100% profits within 8-9 months\n\nAlso \n1. It's important to use your common sense here. If your sold put premium is close to 0, its best to close the position instead of giving time to get ITM. You can also sell covered call (i sold 12C when i first bought, which is classic definition of options collar but some hybrid strategy involves to sell covered call when and if it goes up to get the most premium)\n\n2. Also because you believe in fundamental analysis of the company in valuation, that means you dont wamma sell all covered calls. I typically leave out net position in case HIMS goes to 50. What would you feel about if HIMS passed 12 (that i sold for covered calls) to all the way 80? So i typically leave 20-40% as net positive shares (but have put option in case economy goes full crash to protect downside in my capital depreciation scenarios)\n\nYou can live off simply selling covered calls if or when HIMS are 80 per shares (which is not likely the case in anytime soon) \n\n\nThis is my tips to overcome fears.

Discovery CEO David Zaslav met with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish on Tuesday in New York City to discuss a possible merger, Axios has learned from multiple sources. Why it matters: The combination would create a news and entertainment behemoth that would likely trigger further industry consolidation.\n\n- Zaslav also has spoken to Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount's parent company, about a deal.\n\n- WBD's market value was around $29 billion as of Wednesday, while Paramount's was just over $10 billion, so any merger would not be of equals.\n\nDetails: The meeting between Zaslav and Bakish, which sources say lasted several hours, took place at Paramount's headquarters in Times Square.\n\n- The duo discussed ways their companies could compliment one another. For example, each company's main streaming service — Paramount+ and Max — could merge to better rival Netflix and Disney+.\n\n- It's unclear whether WBD would buy Paramount Global or its parent company, National Amusements Inc. (NAI), but a source familiar with the situation says that both options are on the table.\n\n- WBD is said to have hired bankers to explore the deal.\n\nBetween the lines: The deal could drive substantial synergies. WBD could use its international distribution footprint to boost Paramount's franchises, while Paramount's children's programing assets could be essential to WBD's long-term streaming ambitions.\n\n- CBS News could be combined with CNN to create a global news powerhouse. CBS' crime dramas, such as \"NCIS\" and \"Criminal Minds,\" could be combined with Investigation Discovery and TruTV.\n\n- CBS Sports' footprint could be combined with WBD's. For example, CBS and WBD's Turner Sports currently share TV rights for March Madness.\n\nBe smart: Paramount is under enormous pressure to find a strategic partner or buyer, as it's staring down a mountain of debt.", "id": "18n5g85", "created_utc": 1703106988.0, "score": 292, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "Perfect, another chance to come up with an even stupider streaming service name.

Tesla is doing it differently by having their cars be on the road, gathering data, recording that data, sending it over to Tesla, and Tesla uses AI to compile that data and teach their vehicles how to drive.

It's too early to see what Tesla's capabilities will be with their Optimus but they only started one year ago and their approach is again, to use an AI-based robot that can act on its own. E.g., if the robot sees a cat in its way, it will move out of its way or if you tell the robot to grab you something, it can do so.

As in Tesla designs their own chips. It's how Tesla is able to push updates quickly OTA. If there's an issue with anything, they can quickly rewrite the software because they designed the chips. Let me explain to you how it works with other auto companies: They outsource their software and chip-designing process to other companies such as Bosch. So every component of the vehicle from the operation of the windows, radio, heated seats, etc., are all written by other companies because these auto companies have no experience writing software. And it's a huge disadvantage for these auto companies because if they need to add features, they are beholden to these other companies who may not be able of delivering the results they need. Hence, why Volkswagen constantly has software-related issues and was a big reason why Herbert Deiss was removed because he couldn't deliver on their failed software innovation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact is, Tesla only started mass manufacturing five years ago. How long do you think it took Apple to get their App Store to be the giant it is today? What about Amazon's AWS? These took them decades. Forget what Elon has said. Name me one auto company even doing what Tesla is doing from supercharging capabilities, self-driving technology, robotics, AI, etc., Ten years ago was 2013. We're not far off from 2033 when the world is going to look very different and the technology advances to a point where you will quickly realize that self-driving and robotics will be a norm. Just 7 years ago, you would never hear about anyone driving an EV. Now, it's the #1 best selling vehicle in many countries.

The results are below.\n\nHere's a summary comparing the potential impact on Tesla (TSLA) under the scenarios of Donald Trump and Joe Biden being reelected:\n\n**Trump Reelection Scenario**:\n\n* **Average Impact Assessment**: 53%\n* **General Outlook**: Moderately Bullish\n* **Key Points**:\n   * Environmental regulations under Trump might not strongly favor EVs, but Tesla's market leadership could provide resilience.\n   * Trade policies could present challenges, particularly if trade tensions affect Tesla’s global supply chain.\n   * Tesla could benefit from favorable corporate tax rates.\n   * Limited federal investment in EV infrastructure could be a downside.\n   * Traditional energy focus might not directly support renewable energy, but Tesla's diversification offers some buffer.\n\n**Biden Reelection Scenario**:\n\n* **Average Impact Assessment**: 85%\n* **General Outlook**: Strongly Bullish\n* **Key Points**:\n   * Biden's strong focus on environmental protection and renewable energy aligns well with Tesla’s business, likely boosting the EV market.\n   * More stable and cooperative trade relations under Biden could enhance Tesla's global operations.\n   * Pro-renewable energy tax policies and EV incentives could significantly benefit Tesla.\n   * Increased investment in EV infrastructure, like charging networks, would directly benefit Tesla.\n   * A shift towards renewable energy under Biden's policies supports Tesla's broader market and energy products.\n\nIn summary, while the Trump reelection scenario presents a more mixed and moderately bullish outlook for Tesla, the Biden reelection scenario is viewed as strongly bullish, with policies more directly aligning with Tesla's business model and market. These assessments are speculative and reflect the perceived impact of each president's policies on Tesla's market environment.

Silicon Valley tech companies typically pay their engineers a combination of salary, stocks, and cash bonus. The stocks are referred to as \"RSU's\" (Restricted Stock Units). They are granted to employees upon hiring, but they vest periodically over four years. After every vesting period you are given a fraction of the stock which is yours to do whatever you want with. That fraction of stock is a large fraction of most engineer's annual income, and for higher level employees it is a majority of their income.\n\nThis initial grant will expire after four years and if the company doesn't do anything, an employee's compensation will drop hugely after four years when that grant is fully vested out. So typically companies offer a \"refresher\" grant every year, which is a smaller grant of RSUs which vest over the next four years. This way after the initial grant is fully vested out, they still have another set of four grants which are continuously rolling and vesting. It also means that in the first four years of employment, an engineer's income will ramp up because more and more grants are stacking on top of each other with none having fully vested yet. The refresher grant is what was skipped this year. \n\nWhat will happen is, any top talent who has the option to work anywhere, who are searching for high compensation - they will leave.
