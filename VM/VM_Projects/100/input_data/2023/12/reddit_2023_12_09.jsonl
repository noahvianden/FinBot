Did you read the whole premise of why housing isn't going down due to lock-in effect? Or are we arguing over nothing when you don't even accept that premise, which most economists agree with, including fed officials and even Powell.\n\nWe've had low supply for years. So did everyone find that out in the last 4 years and no one knew before then?  You actually haven't proven anything regarding demand outstripping supply by the way, just that supply had been low, and your article completely proves my point that the current house price isn't a reflection of true house prices due to lock-in effect, that even existing home owners who benefited from the housing prices boom would NOT be able to move to another house even if they wanted to. \n\n\"Buyers are likely to bear the brunt of the problem, though. A lack of housing options creates a very competitive market, in which many buyers must compete for few available properties.

If you're going to cherry pick facts to make a point, at least get them right. \n\nObviously existing home sales would be low with no new inventory because with low supply it becomes more costly to get a new home, particularly with rising interest rates. \n\nI need proof there's going to be forced selling. All you've said is people move which will kick off a forced selling domino effect but made no attempt to explain causality or offer any proof for it. As for the lock in effect, I never said previous interest rates don't entice people to stay out, but \"hiding the real price\" is just something you made up because of a doomsday causal chain of massive moving leading to plummeting prices, and as someone who demands proof you sure are stingy on providing it. You're not arguing from some sort of trend precedent like you think you are, because there is no comparable prior scenario of 3.7% unemployment to 4.5%. Again, you think 2007-2008 was, but it's not. As new home sales have been low these past years, most ARMs have likely reset already, buyers have been more carefully vetted, and 4.5% unemployment is perfectly healthy. Most homeowners likely won't be forced to sell because it shouldn't be too hard to find new jobs. \n\nSee, you mention Powell and the Fed and what they're saying as if it's some kind of axiom in order to avoid your burden of proof. \n\nYou clearly didn't read the article I linked to, at least in its entirety, because the whole thing laid out exactly why supply dropped to record lows last year and mentioned that the supply has failed to keep up with demand. It was already evident that demand outpaced supply, hence why prices keep rising. That's literally why prices rise, it's economics 101, which I assumed you knew, because everyone does. And that's the funniest bit of irony here, because it's the only axiomatic part of this whole debate, not anything you've contended. \"Low supply\" which you've admitted we are experiencing, is a relative term. Low or high demand or supply only mean anything relative to the other term. X amount of supply is high if there's X-Y demand, but low if there's X+Y demand. And if supply is low relative to demand prices go up, and they go down if the reverse is true. \n\nSo again, you need to prove your argument because this isn't some fantasy world of yours where you get to declare you have precedent to avoid the burden of proof but insist everyone else provide it.\n\nCan you not comprehend that part of the article you quoted? They're literally saying we have low supply relative to demand which is what's driving prices up. That's the very point I've been making. Prices are where they should be because of a supply/demand imbalance. You're literally pointing out how what I'm saying is correct but just saying you think it isn't because reasons. \n\nYou keep alluding to 2008 but you don't seem to understand what happened. Housing supplies grew incredibly fast in the run up in large part due to low interest rates, teaser rate ARM mortgages, and a lack of due diligence from the lenders. When the teaser rates reset many people went into default, killing demand and creating a race to the bottom to sell inventory, which created a spiral effect as other borrowers found their properties underwater. In other words, there was a supply/demand imbalance the exact opposite way, too much supply for not enough demand, the opposite of what us happening now as the part of the article you quoted pointed out. \n\n\"Why would housing affordability be at an all time low and housing not correct to pre COVID levels...\" Not what you said and not what I criticized. You asked \"why aren't prices going above pre COVID levels\" meaning they're lower than pre COVID levels, but also that affordability is at all time lows. This makes no sense since for affordability to be at all time lows, prices would need to be higher than a previous reference point (pre COVID).

GDP has been growing at around 2% while the S&P500 has been growing about 10%. That has a few implications:\n\n* If global economic growth slows down, there's less overseas profit growth for American companies. Headwinds in countries like China and Russia (either for their economies or the ability of foreign investors to take gains) will slow down earnings growth for those American companies that invest and operate there. Or, if some larger portion of the global growth starts flowing to non-western companies, one would expect the earnings of American companies to slow.\n* If labor starts demanding higher pay and benefits, there will be less profits for shareholders even if the enterprise as a whole is economically productive. Worker well being might very well be good for the economy at large in our consumer-driven economy, but will it be good for the shareholders?\n* If interest rates remain high for an extended period of time, bonds with those higher interest rates will be a more attractive investment (higher cash flow from the bonds themselves, plus the upside potential of increasing market values if interest rates go down), which will shift the balance between companies raising money through borrowing versus issuing equity, leaving companies generally more debt burdened with less upside left over for shareholders.\n* Tax policy, antitrust policy, even government investment in infrastructure, research, education, etc., might have broad ranging effects on the ability of companies to maintain high profits. Some of these could cut into profitability of large publicly traded companies while helping smaller firms, in a way that grows the economy relative to the large cap companies that dominate the S&P 500. \n\nTo me, the entire post-2020 economic landscape has been consistent with my broader belief that the economy is due to distribute more of its benefits to non-shareholder stakeholders in the economy.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks Joe", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Economy is a complicated beast.

{"title": "US Retail Group retracts claim that half of inventory loss was due to theft", "selftext": "[Per this article.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/07/retail-theft-losses-inventory-nrf)\n\nI've tried reporting on this fact here many times.  Deceptive companies and entities with agendas have been wildly embellishing claims of crime as the reason for their performance problems.  \n\nTarget (TGT) is a prime example.  In PR and commentary, they kept falsely implying theft as the cause of shoddy results.  But their dry and raw financial results showed theft was minuscule and that the real causes could be linked to executive ineptitude and poor decision making.\n\nTarget was not alone in this, as others used this false smokescreen.  And it was broadly picked up on by naive and complicit media and civilians.  Those who pushed this false narrative knew (correctly) that the more simplistic and salacious fables about caravans of thieves running through lawless cities would get traction, and that only a few of us would actually read the data and recognize when a big lie was being spread.\n\nFor those interested, shrink is not theft.  Shoplifting is actually only one small part of it.  Shrink encompasses many things, most of them fully under the operational control of the executive management team.  When management makes the choice to cut jobs and mishandle returns, the corresponding cost is higher shrink.  When management decides to use crappy packaging or the lowest bid shipper, that drives up shrink.  Buying shoddier perishables that have to be discarded... more shrink.  The examples go on and on.\n\nSo when their shrink balloons, it's easy for them to exploit false social narratives and pretend their poor decisions and poor results weren't management's fault... it must be because of \"rampant\" theft, because they and most people think the big shrink number means theft.\n\nOne exception has been the plain speaking head of Costco (COST) who has mocked industry peers for using this trick.  He outlines that theft is only up an insignificant amount, and that any retailer who actually *did* have a theft problem could easily have mitigated it in a variety of inexpensive ways.  Of course since the theft excuse wasn't authentic, that's why they didn't do the mitigation measures, belieing that they knew their PR excuses were deceptive.\n\n$COST CEO's most recent commentary is that their own most commonly stolen items are paper towels, toilet rolls, bottled water and watermelons.  And that they took measures to reduce that by having a segmented \"under the basket\" focus at checkout.\n\nThe same Costco CEO has debunked other myths around inflation, labor and cost pressures.
