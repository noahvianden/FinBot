{"title": "I am never trading options again", "selftext": "This was the original title and post I wrote up before the events of Thursday transpired. Everything in quotes was written by past me: \n\n\"I’ve disabled options trading. I will dump all my money into blue chips and index funds. I’ve just made 100k over a span of 3 days. \n\n[The contracts gained more value, but I didn't screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/m6328lnwazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a795f81624d5e6cd1fe43471261a27692664af)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ku4wnnqxazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=b802bab4bd2b9cf7c4cf18b79aea65a065133c31\n\nThe screen shots are incomplete because I was trying to sell quick. It’s about 100k profit when you factor in I lost 60k entering the trade on shorter dated puts. \n\nI’m going to be completely candid. Whether that gets me banned or not, I will take that risk. \n\nFrom the moment I uttered this comment, I set fourth the most regarded scheme in history. \n\n[When I decided to hold until recivership ](https://preview.redd.it/hgp4xiumdzxa1.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=9577ebc5463dacf10930ba6fc247f670d1757060)\n\nAt the time, FRC hadn’t halted trading. I reached out to Robinhood support to get their stance on what would happen during a halt. I didn’t show the full conversation, but they were extremely unclear. They said that I would be short if I exercised, but I’d have a hard time covering that short position. Although this is not saying yes or no, it’s definitely terrible communication on their part. \n\nA lawsuit based on the hypothetical scenario we discussed is a complete long shot. Out of curiosity, I asked a lawyer that day. They said I was likely to win if Robinhood backed out but they needed more details. I did not trust this scummy lawyer. I had another option. [Robinhood had previously cracked to social media pressure and allowed people to exercise puts into a short position.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/16/robinhood-bends-to-pressure-and-permits-short-selling-to-replace-put-options-on-signature-bank/?sh=6a7e783c2312) They have a history of bending to social media backlash. There’s even this disclaimer when stocks are halted: \n\n[This is directly from backlash on Reddit when they disabled the buy button. ](https://preview.redd.it/hmv5lc8jbzxa1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e03b956c1bb8cc242788f12d541215efbf27d44)\n\nI thought I could increase the odds by creating viral posts about Robinhood’s misdeeds. Hopefully Robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on the front page of Reddit. WSB backing me would have been helpful but not necessary. I just needed to make noise. \n\nI believed the chances I could cash out were high to begin with. I was sort’ve right. Multiple brokers allowed exercising into a short. Just not Robinhood. They still may have made an exception, as their support told me multiple times it “might” happen. But I wasn’t about to wait till expiration without a fight. \n\nWithin the quest to fight Robinhood, I made this bet: \n\n[The fateful ban bet](https://preview.redd.it/a7vosyp6azxa1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7fae27f31c7a2a414df81c845c96d931e7c0e6b)\n\nRobinhood did not allow short selling for FRC put holders as the terms of the bet demanded. I sold the contracts instead of exercising. \\[Based on the terms of the bet I do not have to pay anything. I still planned on donating a few thousand until yesterday.\\]\n\nWhether this scheme would have worked, I guess we’ll never know. FRC began trading OTC and exercising was not necessary anymore. \n\nDespite being correct, I’ve taken up a reckless unsustainable trading approach. If I continue on this path, I will lose everything. I’ve seen it so many times where someone makes a very intelligent correct trade, then starts thinking they’re a trading genius. They start making reckless bets in things they have no business buying. This is an extremely slippery slope for me. I’ve blown up multiple accounts and I refuse to make the same mistake. I hope I can set an example- don’t keep rolling the dice. Take the money and run. \n\nI know it’s very obvious to everyone; cashing out is the smart thing to do. But in my position the rush of euphoria from a massive win like this is intoxicating. The sobering despair of previous losses melts away. It’s very hard to fight the imaginative ideas of becoming a multimillionaire and retiring under 30. I hope I can set an example and inspire others to break the gambling cycle. Hopefully, I will be able to maintain self control, but the urge to make one more bet is always there. I refuse let myself squander this life altering amount of money.\"\n\n**PRESENT MOMENT:**\n\nI saw PACW tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers. They had already said this in their ER that they were looking to sell assets. I felt the drop overblown fear from FRCs collapse. \n\nI bought when it was at $2.90 but because I didn’t put a limit order in RH averaged purchase price was fucking $3.40 my god. Immediate 40k loss.\n\n[Paper handed while it was dumping after Robinhood's shitty payment for order flow bought the shares at an inflated price. ALWAYS SET LIMIT ORDERS](https://preview.redd.it/4oshkmswbzxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9875c83b56c10d33360ae3f29904aa82b15012e)\n\n Then I think to myself: PACW’s drop is not completely overblown. The need to shore up liquidity is bad in this environment and a recovery is higher risk. So I thought, let me buy a regional that is being pulled down just because everything is tanking: FHN. \n\nThe TD CEO firmly stated they were committed to buying FHN. So any massive drop has huge upside. Surely TD wouldn’t back out of the deal 8 hours after I go all in. \n\n[I sold around 9.70, still lost a ton, but this loss wasn't fully realized](https://preview.redd.it/uu66q2n6czxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=a72df7c25b41d92c98a20335ab656d421f3c6cdb)\n\nI am completely spiraling into whirlpool of gambling and degeneracy. I am trying to control myself. I lost another 50k yesterday and made it back just as quick. I'm playing with fire and I'm foolishly dead set on making back what I've lost. I've finally found an amazing risk reward trade to make all my money back plus profit. Selling WAL puts. I still stand by the idea that this current panic in regionals is far overblown. WAL especially is nothing like FRC and its odds of collapse are extraordinarily low. Currently selling $12 puts for a huge premium while that stock is at $20, this is a very safe bet to make back everything. I will roll into the $2.5 puts for an even safe bet. IV is at 500%, this is almost free money. WAL is not like FRC, even if PACW falls, WAL will be ok. \n\n[Everything is riding on WAL surviving. Very safe bet in my opinion.](https://preview.redd.it/5z83n0mzczxa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36ee99b374712bc3617a4cb469e7f0a5f27595ab)\n\nThen I can finally end this nightmare, quit the gambling and move on with my life. No more sleepless nights, no more insane schemes. I will finally come out on top and follow my original intentions after I made out on FRC. I am jumping into a wild ape cage posting this.

Everything in quotes was written by past me: \n\n\"I’ve disabled options trading. I will dump all my money into blue chips and index funds. I’ve just made 100k over a span of 3 days. \n\nThe contracts gained more value, but I didn't screenshot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ku4wnnqxazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=223b799b39914587b4d0249eb068e76e7d92f942\n\nThe screen shots are incomplete because I was trying to sell quick. It’s about 100k profit when you factor in I lost 60k entering the trade on shorter dated puts. \n\nI’m going to be completely candid. Whether that gets me banned or not, I will take that risk. \n\nFrom the moment I uttered this comment, I set fourth the most regarded scheme in history. \n\nWhen I decided to hold until recivership \n\nAt the time, FRC hadn’t halted trading. I reached out to Robinhood support to get their stance on what would happen during a halt. I didn’t show the full conversation, but they were extremely unclear. They said that I would be short if I exercised, but I’d have a hard time covering that short position. Although this is not saying yes or no, it’s definitely terrible communication on their part. \n\nA lawsuit based on the hypothetical scenario we discussed is a complete long shot. Out of curiosity, I asked a lawyer that day. They said I was likely to win if Robinhood backed out but they needed more details. I did not trust this scummy lawyer. I had another option. Robinhood had previously cracked to social media pressure and allowed people to exercise puts into a short position. They have a history of bending to social media backlash. There’s even this disclaimer when stocks are halted: \n\nThis is directly from backlash on Reddit when they disabled the buy button. \n\nI thought I could increase the odds by creating viral posts about Robinhood’s misdeeds. Hopefully Robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on the front page of Reddit. WSB backing me would have been helpful but not necessary. I just needed to make noise. \n\nI believed the chances I could cash out were high to begin with. I was sort’ve right. Multiple brokers allowed exercising into a short. Just not Robinhood. They still may have made an exception, as their support told me multiple times it “might” happen. But I wasn’t about to wait till expiration without a fight. \n\nWithin the quest to fight Robinhood, I made this bet: \n\nThe fateful ban bet\n\nRobinhood did not allow short selling for FRC put holders as the terms of the bet demanded. I sold the contracts instead of exercising. [Based on the terms of the bet I do not have to pay anything. I still planned on donating a few thousand until yesterday.]\n\nWhether this scheme would have worked, I guess we’ll never know. FRC began trading OTC and exercising was not necessary anymore. \n\nDespite being correct, I’ve taken up a reckless unsustainable trading approach. If I continue on this path, I will lose everything. I’ve seen it so many times where someone makes a very intelligent correct trade, then starts thinking they’re a trading genius. They start making reckless bets in things they have no business buying. This is an extremely slippery slope for me. I’ve blown up multiple accounts and I refuse to make the same mistake. I hope I can set an example- don’t keep rolling the dice. Take the money and run. \n\nI know it’s very obvious to everyone; cashing out is the smart thing to do. But in my position the rush of euphoria from a massive win like this is intoxicating. The sobering despair of previous losses melts away. It’s very hard to fight the imaginative ideas of becoming a multimillionaire and retiring under 30. I hope I can set an example and inspire others to break the gambling cycle. Hopefully, I will be able to maintain self control, but the urge to make one more bet is always there. I refuse let myself squander this life altering amount of money.\"\n\nPRESENT MOMENT:\n\nI saw PACW tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers. They had already said this in their ER that they were looking to sell assets. I felt the drop overblown fear from FRCs collapse. \n\nI bought when it was at $2.90 but because I didn’t put a limit order in RH averaged purchase price was fucking $3.40 my god. Immediate 40k loss.\n\nPaper handed while it was dumping after Robinhood's shitty payment for order flow bought the shares at an inflated price. ALWAYS SET LIMIT ORDERS\n\nThen I think to myself: PACW’s drop is not completely overblown. The need to shore up liquidity is bad in this environment and a recovery is higher risk. So I thought, let me buy a regional that is being pulled down just because everything is tanking: FHN. \n\nThe TD CEO firmly stated they were committed to buying FHN. So any massive drop has huge upside. Surely TD wouldn’t back out of the deal 8 hours after I go all in. \n\nI sold around 9.70, still lost a ton, but this loss wasn't fully realized\n\nI am completely spiraling into whirlpool of gambling and degeneracy. I am trying to control myself. I lost another 50k yesterday and made it back just as quick. I'm playing with fire and I'm foolishly dead set on making back what I've lost. I've finally found an amazing risk reward trade to make all my money back plus profit. Selling WAL puts. I still stand by the idea that this current panic in regionals is far overblown. WAL especially is nothing like FRC and its odds of collapse are extraordinarily low. Currently selling $12 puts for a huge premium while that stock is at $20, this is a very safe bet to make back everything. I will roll into the $2.5 puts for an even safe bet. IV is at 500%, this is almost free money. WAL is not like FRC, even if PACW falls, WAL will be ok. \n\nEverything is riding on WAL surviving. Very safe bet in my opinion.\n\nThen I can finally end this nightmare, quit the gambling and move on with my life. No more sleepless nights, no more insane schemes. I will finally come out on top and follow my original intentions after I made out on FRC. I am jumping into a wild ape cage posting this.

{"title": "CMA bank might be going under soon.... here's the how/why", "selftext": "Let's DD...\n\nI'm going to be referencing their Q1 earnings report along with some reports they presented after that and why I think there was major red warning flags flashing at the bank which were and still are being overlooked.\n\nHere's where you can find their Q1 report: [https://investor.comerica.com/presentations-events](https://investor.comerica.com/presentations-events)\n\nFirst off, the bank is prototypical to the current banks which have failed this far.... Large long term HTM assets which are now losing billions in value per quarter, along with a splurge of covid lending which has begun to lose their past positive gains, if not all of them,  as of the end of Q1, and they are at risk in their loan to deposit ratio due to currently holding massive unsecured deposits which are at flight risk and ballooning the banks Loan to debt liabilities.\n\nThe HTM assets they are booking have been in the multi billions per quarter range while they are in debt \\~15b and only have 9b cash.  **This means all of the cash they claim to have on hand is on paper only due to not having to liquidate HTM assets, YET...**\n\n**In their Q1 earnings report, they had already nearly maxed out their FHLB loan programs, indicated they were already preparing to go to the discount window for 20b and in addition to that... (when no one knew/gave a shit about the BTFP) this bank had already pre-calculated they could go in and get 9b in loans to max on over on the BTFP. (a major red flag!!!!! especially since we can see there's still \\~5bn in BTFP loans outstanding as of today...)**\n\nI believe the reason they had included all these \"features\" of how to access liquidity at this point was because they they had realized they were majorly at risk to far exceeded their deposit to loan ratios  when accounting for  the fact that they had 11 billion in deposit flight just a few months prior, HTM asset unrealized losses, now in the multi billions, and further deposit flight risk with their over 50% uninsured deposit foundation of which they were lending out on.    With fancy math, and not accounting for their Unrealized losses on their lending practices they claimed to have an 85% Loan to deposit ratio.  The problem here is they openly admit they have approximately 64 billion in deposits, of which 53% are basically a flight risk due to being non-interest bearing & uninsured deposits.  The previous quarter saw a 11 billion flight of deposits and they still maintained well over 30 billion of deposits that were at high flight risk.  \n\nLet's make this clear... The bank knowingly has over 30 billion at risk of deposit flight and when tallied along with their HTM unrealized losses and 15b in debts essentially means the bank is at risk of becoming insolvent due to just a few depositors wising up and moving their money to interest bearing accounts...  I think the bank understood this at the start of Q1 once they witnessed an 11billion outflow of deposits but decided to parade around they can get liquidity but that's not the real problem here....\n\nThe bank has increased their lending activities over the last few years to hit 50billion in loans during the covid boom when liquidity was easy and lending was cheap and even won awards for having created the most loans over all other competitors last year... which I think is going to come back to bite their ass soon and here's why:\n\nThe bank has been one of the biggest lenders in Michigan to the corporate/business sectors ever since 2020-2021 but the bank stated in their Q1 report they expected 9% annualized growth in these sectors... yet just a short while later they announced their internal metrics/reporting which showed a decline in business activity by over -4% for the previous quarter...  \n\nHow did they ever calculate that they will hit 9% growth when they just suffered -4% declines in the previous quarter into a rate hiking environment?  The bank obviously had internal tracking metrics here and saw their commercial businesses slowing down but still said they expect a bounce back of 13% over 9 mo into further rate hikes after lending like madmen during peak bubble?    The company in this Q1 report also said they were increasing their allocations for defaults going up to nearly 1 billion, or 2% of their total lending practices.....    **To make it simple...  they're basically just a regarded as all of us here on WSB by expecting 13% growth while at the same time knowingly planning for massive losses and deposit flight risk as we headed deeper into the year with  higher rates...**\n\nLet's make this clear... The bank knowingly has over 30 billion at risk of deposit flight (after already losing 11billion) they still remain at risk from just a handful of customers who can easily get 3-5% on their money.  When tallied along with their HTM unrealized losses, 15b in debts, and 50b in commercial loans which are slowing down and facing increased default rates, pre-planning to access the BTFP (the most desperate grab for cash from the fed of which we know \\~5b is outstanding in the BTFP program....) \n\nSo yeah, I think this bank knows they are actually getting obliterated in terms of growth prospects... but did the song and dance to try and say they weren't a bank on the brink of collapse...\n\nSo to summarize, I believe the bank is at serious risk of becoming insolvent and collapsing due to just a few depositors wising up and moving their money to interest bearing accounts (which may have already happened?) \n\n**CMA bank looks like it's been staging and preparing as a FDIC candidate since Q1 and will likely end up being sold off for profitable acquisition rewards for years away...**\n\nYes they have an okay business model, but it's a business model which became extremely at risk due to higher rates, massive unsecured deposit flight risks, excessive peak bubble lending which is now having increased default rates, and HTM assets which hold multibillions in unrealized losses on their balance sheet.\n\nThe real question here is not if the bank might fail, but more so, how soon?\n\nTBH I thought about this for a good while before deciding to buy puts here, the reality is just plain and simple.... this bank, unfortunately, fits like a cookie cutter perfectly into having the same systemic problems as what's actually been causing banks to go under thus far, and I doubt they are some magical bank that can escape this coming fate.  They claim they might be able to mitigated their HTM damage, but only after we passed 4.5%, the fact still remains that they have a very large deposit flight and had lending practices which are now turning into potential \\~billion in losses...\n\nThe final cherry on top?  Cramer was lamenting that this bank might go under and was being treated \"unfairly\" just yesterday which is what actually made me go investigate their risk/q1 report.
