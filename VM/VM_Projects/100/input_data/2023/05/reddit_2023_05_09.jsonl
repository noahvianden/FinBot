{"title": "Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee", "selftext": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653\n\nHidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers’ actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found\n\nThousands of officials across the government’s executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.\n\nMore than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.\n\nA top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.\n\nThe Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.\n\nThe vast majority of the disclosure forms aren’t available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.\n\n\nAmong the Journal’s findings:\n\n• While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\n• More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.\n\n• More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.\n\n• At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.\n\n• About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.\n\n• When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency’s work.\nNumber of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21\n\nFederal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield “immense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,” said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.\n\nHe said many of the examples in the Journal analysis “clearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public’s confidence in the integrity of the government.”\n\nSome federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. “The buck stops with the official,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. “It’s the official who could benefit or be harmed…. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.”\n\nInvesting by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.\n\nJournal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.\n\nThis article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.\n\nU.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nThe 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges.\nimage\nA view of Washington, D.C.\n\nMost officials’ financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.\n\nSome made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven’t turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)\n\nUnder federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren’t considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn’t restrict investing in diversified funds.\n\nSome federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is “committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government,” said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.\n\nAt the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump’s pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.\n\nMr. Molina’s job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He “reviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,” said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a “personal and confidential representative” of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.\n\nIn the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.\n\nReported trades in energy and mining firms;\n\nmade by spouse through a financial adviser\n\nThe trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband’s account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.\n\nOfficials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don’t conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal’s review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.\n\nIn an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn’t know much about the energy trades. “I can say this on the record: I didn’t even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,” he said.\n\nIn February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn about 2½ years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina’s disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.\n\nIn the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.\n\nTwo months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.\n\nAfter publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: “Neither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‘pool’ of several dozen clients—not for us individually.”\n\nMr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency’s ethics office “counseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.” EPA officials signed Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.\n\nU.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.\n\nThe EPA doesn’t have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren’t working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina’s boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.\n\nGreg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department’s director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.\n\nMr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias’s portfolio.\n\nMr. Zacharias’s office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn’t attend those meetings.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn’t involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. “I could always walk downstairs and ask them how it’s going. But that really wasn’t an interest of mine,” he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.\n\nMr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn’t pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: “I’m just the pipe-smoking science guy.”\n\nThe Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal’s analysis.\n\n“I apologize that things don’t look good on the buy side,” Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: “I just decided that would be a good investment at the time.”\n\nHe said ethics officials didn’t raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be “a little tighter.”\n\nA Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias “worked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.” She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees’ disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.\n\nSome conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies’ misunderstanding of their own rules.\n\nThe FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are “significantly regulated” by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.\n\nAn FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.\n\nMr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA’s planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.\n\nMr. Bertoni’s lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.\n\nThe stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.\n\nThey did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni’s forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. “The FDA’s Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,” the attorney said in an email.\n\nAfter considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.\n\nAn FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family’s holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.\n\n“The FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,” said the spokesman.\n\nWhen federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.\n\nValerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board’s Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.\n\nMembers of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.\n\nMs. Hardy-Mahoney’s office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.\n\nThe NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.\n\nMs. Hardy-Mahoney’s office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers’ rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney’s office dismissed the charge in January 2021.\n\nLast November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.\n\nThe NLRB’s inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.\n\nThe report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney’s office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report—Ms. Hardy-Mahoney—received additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.\n\nMs. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei’s husband.\n\nIn June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank “in a very, very difficult position.” Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he “just would love to see” a clear policy on the matter.\n\nBecause Mr. Powell didn’t dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.\n\nIn early September 2018, Ms. Wei’s husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.\n\nIt then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.\n\nMs. Wei’s husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei’s disclosure.\n\nThe Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.\n\nThe new Fed rules for top people don’t apply to Ms. Wei because she isn’t senior enough. The trades were “permissible then and are permissible now,” said the Fed spokeswoman.\n\nMs. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had “no responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.” She said the Fed “did not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.”\n\nEthics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei’s trades didn’t violate conflicts rules.\nimage\nThe Federal Reserve building in Washington.\n\nRoughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.\n\nIn one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC’s own rules.\n\nThe financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal’s review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020—an average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.\n\nAbout one-third of those reported 2020 trades—2,994—involved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.\n\nOver the years, to safeguard the CFTC’s integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees’ investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC’s role doesn’t include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.\n\nNonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail’s husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission “could possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.” The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission’s statutory authority.\n\nMr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn’t speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the CFTC, “employees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,” said the agency spokesman. “In this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse’s investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.”\n\nMr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: “The FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.”\n\nThe Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.\n\nAcross the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.\n\nReed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\n\nAt the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.\n\nDefense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.\n\nNearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn’t include Alibaba. The company’s stock rose 4% that day.\n\nThree days later, Mr. Werner’s financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.\n\nThe sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn’t involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.\n\nThe Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn’t own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee’s duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.\n\nAt least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon’s top cybersecurity official.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.\n\nMr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn’t direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn’t involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn’t see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.\n\nWithin federal agencies, ethics officials generally don’t consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials’ ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don’t know what employees are working on.\n\nWhen ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies’ inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nA Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.\n\nOne matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse’s financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren’t allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official’s work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.\n\nWhen a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC’s inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: “We take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.”\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nAre stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.\n\nMost federal agencies don’t have protocols to verify that officials’ financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.\n\nThe official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.\n\nAt the EPA, Mr. Molina’s financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.\n\nThe conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not “participate personally and substantially” in matters that have a “direct and predictable effect” on their investments and those of family members.\n\nWhen the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn’t have any influence over environmental policy.\n\nHis “duties are administrative in nature,” his boss, the EPA’s chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. “He provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect” on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina’s financial disclosure.\n\nIn his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn’t file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.\n\nEthics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina “scores” of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.\n\nIn one email, a senior ethics official said his office had “provided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.”\n\nMr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn’t know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA’s electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.\n\nIn September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.\n\n“We have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,” wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, “so I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.”\n\nThe next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. “I feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,” he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.\n\n“If the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,” Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. “I believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.”\n\nEthics officials didn’t investigate Mr. Molina’s trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina’s final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.\n\nMr. Molina wrote out a personal check to “U.S. Treasury” and sent it to officials in the EPA’s ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.", "id": "13cncl6", "created_utc": 1683632845.0, "score": 1817, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Buffet says invest in what you know.", "score": 310, "replies": [{"body": "Ok this one is pretty funny 😂.", "score": 77, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wish I knew insider information!", "score": 31, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "At this point, what even is there to do ?

During these times, short sellers covering their positions likely contributed to increases in GME’s price. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period. Figure 6 shows that buy volume in GME, including buy volume from participants identified as having large short positions, increased significantly beginning around January 22 and remained high for several days, corresponding to the beginning of the most dramatic phase of the run-up in GME’s price.\nFigure 6 shows that the run-up in GME stock price coincided with buying by those with short positions. However, it also shows that such buying was a small fraction of overall buy volume, and that GME share prices continued to be high after the direct effects of covering short positions would have waned. The underlying motivation of such buy volume cannot be determined; perhaps it was motivated by the desire to maintain a short squeeze.

They’re just basically hydraulic pistons. What we want to move to down the road with a Raptor 3, or whatever we end up calling it, would be an electric motor with a screw drive, essentially a big servo.*\n\n*Yeah, a big servo motor. What you don’t see here is that there’s a whole hydraulic system on the vehicle side. That itself has a battery driving electric motors, which drive hydraulic pumps into a reservoir that then feeds the engines hydraulic fluid. This approach is not ideal in terms of total vehicle mass, but we just don’t have time to put electric servo drives on the engine. We’ll do that in a few months.*\n\n*Now with Merlin, you’ve got a source of hydraulic fluid. So with Merlin, it makes sense to have hydraulic actuators because you’ve got a source of high-pressure working fluid, since you use kerosene as a working fluid. You tap off the fuel pump, take high-pressure kerosene to drive the hydraulic actuators, and then the low-pressure outlet goes back into the fuel tank. It’s a circulating system with no losses, and it’s a super easy move if you’ve got liquid kerosene.*\n\n*Since we have cryogens here, it is technically possible for us to use methane as a working fluid in the hydraulic actuators, but it’s very risky. Because the methane will want to gasify. If you get gas bubbles in the hydraulic system, it’s going to get spongy and not work properly. So I insisted that we at least look at the comparison, but the mass difference wasn’t significant enough for having a methane hydraulic system. And it was scaring everyone, including me, so we decided against it. The smart move is going to be having an electric servo.*\n\n*Moving this engine fast is not easy, as it still needs a lot of torque. And it moves so fast, like when you see the videos landing. A lot of the time, it doesn’t actually need to move that fast. But if you have an engine out, then you’ve got to slew all the engines really fast to deal with the engine that went out. So the corner cases drive the slew rate and the torque needed in the actuators.*\n\n*The total gimbal degree is also a factor. Unexpected gusts, buffeting, wind shear, and engine out situations drive the slew rate.*", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Tesla should have maye musk run the pr and advertising, she's a natural.

{"title": "RIVN is undervalued and oversold… I’m leveraged to the tits 🌰🌰", "selftext": "Today I want to tell you why Rivian, the electric car company that is best known for moving people down tax brackets, is now a buy.\n\nScroll to the end if you want the TLDR. Also fyi not a bag holder, my cost basis is $12.60/share ($13.87 now). Full disclosure, I'm leveraged to the tits on this trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Trading Below Net Assets\n\nRivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.\n\nRivian’s market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.\n\nFor comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars\n\nMarques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.\n\nDemand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.\n\nThere's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.\n\nThey’ve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# RJ Scaringe Doesn’t Have To Be A Rocket Scientist\n\nThe CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn’t a grandstanding visionary. He’s slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.\n\nWhen an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.\n\nRivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Emeralds Can Crack\n\nBeing politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn’t have close friends, is cut off from his family and can’t hold down a relationship. There isn’t a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.\n\nThis is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# EV Is Supply Constrained\n\nLast year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.\n\nMeeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Bad\n\nRivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they’d need the share price to significantly recover.\n\nThe founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn’t a sign of confidence.\n\nRivian doesn’t benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn’t as far along with self-driving AI.\n\nAmazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR\n\n**Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**\n\n**Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**\n\n**It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**\n\n\\---\n\nIf you want to see if I'm a regard you can check my previous posts and decide for yourself:\n\n* September 28 2021: [The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pwvway/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/)\n* February 22 2022: [I told you so… The Great Wheeze is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/sygjdx/my_prediction_was_correct_the_great_wheeze_is_here/)\n* May 19 2022 [BUY BUY BUY GROWTH!

Apprehension to new electric car adoption is….lack of range/inability to travel. Tesla fixed this, hence their growing adoption by petroleum fueled drivers. At this stage the consumer just expects to have that access to level of charging capability. Without access to those charging stations is the equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.\n\nIn product design and entrepreneurship one rule I’ve heard over and over, “don’t bring something to market with incremental improvement. Don’t even bring 2…3…5x improvement. If you can’t improve things by 10-15x then no one is going to care.” And this rings true here. Self driving being on par is “acceptable” but no one will care, but…worse than the competition? People will care, and not in a good way. This is shooting your self in your other foot.\n\nEnding the Amazon contract is an awful idea. Why? Social proof. Think about this. I show you a product and you go “oh cool” and I respond with “yeah Amazon is using this for their delivery fleet” I’d be willing to bet you stop for a second and take another look at what I showed you. I do realize this says “exclusivity” but this will get messy because of Amazons investment in the company. To make significant gain they need to end exclusivity and sign a contract with either UPS, FEDEX, DHL, or USPS. The latter runs the risk of being “typecast” like the current mail truck is.\n\nOverall Rivian could (and may need to) pivot into an electric delivery vehicle company and abandon consumer production for now until they get their shit together. Unfortunately they already have vehicles out and this would cause those vehicle prices to plummet. Another option would be to follow the Tesla blueprint - reduce output and create demand.

{"title": "Guys! ABNB Earnings are Today! How are we gonna get a 5-bagger?", "selftext": "It's finally time. Airbnb (ABNB) is scheduled to report their earning results today after hours. As you guys know, the company connects hosts and guests online and allows them to book travel services and accommodation facilities worldwide. For the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 16-21% on a reported basis and 18-23% on an FX neutral basis. This is most likely driven by growth in European travel and a gradual recovery in China.\n\nTo keep things simple, I'm going to put the entire post in jot note form and then provide my conclusion at the end.\n\n**What to Consider**\n\n* Airbnb has been witnessing steady improvements in long-distance and cross-border travel due to relaxed travel restrictions. This is likely to have continued to aid its performance in the first quarter.\n\n* Growing momentum among travelers is likely to have continued driving the [Nights and Experiences Booked](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1193532/airbnb-nights-experiences-booked-worldwide) and Average Daily Rates in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n* Strengthening demand in North America, EMEA and Latin America is likely to have driven ABNB’s performance in the quarter under discussion.\n\n* Increasing guest demand for non-urban nights is expected to have continued driving active listings for non-urban destinations in the quarter under review.\n\n* Airbnb’s consistent efforts to enhance various aspects of its services to gain momentum among its hosts and guests are likely to have benefited the quarterly performance.\n\n* Analyst [Sachin Mittal](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sachin-mittal) maintained a Buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $153\n\n* [Cost cutting measures](https://www.tipranks.com/news/airbnb-nasdaqabnb-trims-headcount-slightly-despite-hiring-plans) taken earlier will reflect higher margins in this quarter.\n\n* However, uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic are expected to have been concerning in the first quarter.\n\n* The impacts of macroeconomic headwinds, including rising prices and geo-political tensions, are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.\n\n* Intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have been an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n**Concluding Thoughts**\n\nIn the end, we have a booming travel industry that's ripping back and above pre-pandemic levels. Airbnb's are *still* cheaper than hotels. The number of users are growing and the platform has been consistently rolling out new features. I'm gonna literally jump in on calls. Last earnings, we saw the stock rise up +14%. Can it do this again? Doubtful. But what the hell, time for a call spread. I'm buying the 5/12 135c for $241 and selling the 140c for $132. This means the spread can be bought for only 109 bucks, and can offer 4.6x gains *if* the stock goes up 9.6%. Historically, the average move (either up or down) has been about this much. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.\n\n---\n\n**Edit:** Selling the 140c, not the 140p", "id": "13d0gwm", "created_utc": 1683654145.0, "score": 170, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|153|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13byuhu/what_im_doing_for_pltr_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13bzvbn/why_im_getting_pypl_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/135v8qm/your_lotto_play_for_amds_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/136t8is/your_lotto_play_for_etsys_earnings_tonight/) \n**Account Age**|4 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/CalmGains, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Buy the 5/12 135c for 109 bucks and sell the 140p for 132 bucks.

This actually was even more painful considering how small our range was and how low the volume was too… BTW yesterday was the lowest volume day since November 25th 2022 which was a half day for the markets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpg8569x8vya1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=341fda15287fd889cc5df801f6e6cb92429c421f\n\nWe also have the president meeting tonight over the debt ceiling right at market close… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y51kmlgy8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bee47e9dcfd2551fb8e503d7d604879c0434ee39\n\n**CPI**\n\nSo everyone wants to know… CPI what will it be and where is it going next? And most importantly how will the market react… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy8ssj6y8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=47ef5a366a1f0c8b92f78eb7013c83003687c931\n\nBased on my analysis here these are the probable numbers we shall see tomorrow… but of course here is my actual prediction… \n\nCPI YoY- 5.1%  \n CPI MoM- 0.5%  \n CORE YoY- 5.5%  \n CORE MoM- 0.4%\n\nSo now the biggest question would be… how is the market going to react? \n\nWell currently the market in my opinion expects CPI (inflation) to continue to unwind… they expect that inflation is under control and will continue to unwind straight to that magical 2% area… well in doing so they have put themselves in a TERRIBLE position… why? Well the markets have priced themselves into a corner where they see a pause in June… no hike/ cut in July… then 3 cuts at the meetings after to get to a 425-450 fed funds rate by end of year…\n\nWhats the issue with this? Well its simple… IF CPI rebounds or shows any signs of plateauing… whats the reaction going to be? Well they are going to have to price in a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting… and that is going to mess up all of this markets plan for 75bps of cuts by EOY. \n\nIf CPI comes in hot on YoY and Mom tomorrow in my opinion we are looking at a true 2-3% melt down and not only that but we are going to continue to sell off the rest of the week… the only thing that could stop that is a cool PPI print the next morning. \n\nIf markets has to reprice their fed funds rate by EOY this could be the catalyst markets have truly been waiting for. \n\nNow if I am wrong and we get a CPI of 4.9% or lower… well lets just say we are probably going to see a rocket ship to 440 within a very short period of time… \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld6nbr1z8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=01dd8b35780a2519f09ede76f219f1c7ff7deedb\n\nSPY daily did not establish a new supply at 412.99 as I was expecting it too… though tomorrow if it is red we should establish a new one there… \n\nI see that we closed directly in the middle of this range… that means our upside target is really 415.56 to 417.03 and our downside target is 404.3 to 405.06. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4xaggz8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=609f6919791c6c72fd232874a4b5150049485a1c\n\nAbsolutely BRUTAL price action today with no continuation and lots and lots of tight ranges… we spent an hour an 6 cent range at one point… \n\nWe have a major downside support at 405.2 then 399 and we have a major upside resistance at 416.8 then 419.5. \n\nPossible CPI Targets\n\nBulls- 416.84 (1.45%+) -> 419.5 (2.08%+)\n\nBears- 405.2 (-1.4%) -> 401.4 (-2.33%) -> 399 (-2.93%)\n\nFor me I don’t think that the upside case is there for me as VIX is so low and really CPI is already EXPECTED to come in lower and lower… a surprise upside beat especially that 5.1% im looking for with MoM rising would absolutely start a huge leg down though… for me im bearish. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/baoys2wz8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=071dcc8e4d1aca0b528c6a05ba6dff5ccd65ad1f\n\nNow interestingly enough futures DID turn 4152 into a new supply (resistance) which means that our target should be 4073 minimum but I still am eyeing that 4040/4055 supplies that we have come ever so close to so many times… \n\nIf we get an upside beat tomorrow then we would look for 4190-4198. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7htphta09vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9286150cd989ea6633a652d28a00a4eb346b8383\n\nFutures impressively only put in a 22 point range today… that’s a very small movement for nearly 24 hours of trading… \n\nCPI potential targets\n\nBulls- 4198 (1.51%+) -> 4237 (2.4%)  \n Bears- 4073 (-1.53%) -> 4055 (-2.01%) -> 4040 (-2.34%)\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jws3dca19vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e46e35f1b68ba3c4ffa902ec2ff074646dcb3c1\n\nStarted tracking the VIX on TOS and idk why just sometimes it just looks nicer then TV… maybe it’s the dark mode… jk light mode for life! \n\nAnyways the VIX continues to hold just under that daily 20ema. You can see we are really in a diamond pattern here which means if we can break through 20.42 (+15.4%) tomorrow then we might actually be looking at a bigger upside push to 22.6 to 24.18… if that happens then we are looking at a fairly big dump on SPY which would correlate with a CPI miss…\n\nHowever, if we break support tomorrow of 17.32 then we are going to look to target 15.72 support once again.\n\nFun fact… this is the LOWEST the VIX has closed pre-CPI in over a year of CPI releases… \n\nOnce again the risk is to the downside not the upside… actually something else that is incredibly impressive to me is the fact that the IV on 1dte contracts for tomorrow closed under 20%... that’s incredibly low… I remember a time when SPX ATM contracts were like $4000/ play… you had to go almost 20 strikes OTM just to get a lotto sized play… IV used to easily hit 80-100% on CPI days… IF we get a big miss and surprises tomorrow puts might see some fireworks. \n\nI did not open up longer term (60dte) puts today… I wanted to but with the cheap 1dte I decided to swing a 1dte put instead… my thoughts here is that if we miss I will win big… if we beat with IV this lower and only being a handful of strikes OTM with the probability of another flat open I should be able to get out relatively unscathed… I would then look for the 418-420 range to start a long term bearish play. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5i6ilr19vya1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=9099cf24ff5ebcc438cda84d6f743a2fe10a0449\n\nToday was another hard trading day with this tight ranges and lack of continuation… I made a few good trades and made some bad trades… the biggest issue was even with 1dte I found that when I was correct the underlying just didn’t move enough to pay us for our efforts. Ended up barely covering commissions today and still have a little red hole to recover from this week. \n\nLooking forward to CPI hopefully letting the markets move outta this painful range.", "id": "13d54bo", "created_utc": 1683664364.0, "score": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "I am also on the bear side tomorrow, that makes the chance of a green day higher?", "score": 117, "replies": [{"body": "we cant all be wrong? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "Thetagang enters.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Right.

So your baseline here is pretty high.\n\nFor context, Brent Oil was $105\\~ in April 2022, the Fed had just started raising rates, and the housing market was still near its peak. CPI is a comparison versus last year. So it's hard to see a major upside surprise. Certainly could see a small miss here, but IMO it's not enough to warrant major price action.\n\nFurthermore, the Fed Nowcasting system is showing some major improvements for May 2023 already. We're on pace for 4.41% CPI in May 2023. The market may already be looking forward and a small 10-20 basis point surprise could have limited impact on the market.\n\nSophisticated trading desks have also become much better at predicting CPI than they were one year ago. Today, these moves contain much less surprise for the overall market. In 2022, CPI quickly began to define market direction. The market was unprepared and was not tracking CPI closely enough based on its impact on price direction. The market has evolved by tracking CPI much more closely and positioning itself appropriately going into a print.\n\nAlso keep in mind that we saw some downward surprises in CPI earlier in the year which really didn't have much impact on the market.

Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
