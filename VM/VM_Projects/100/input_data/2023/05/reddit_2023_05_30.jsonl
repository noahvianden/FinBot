If you paid $1 million per call, your chance at \"significantly more gains\" is quite low.\n\nBoth IV crush and theta decay are likely. You could lose all of your extrinsic value quite easily.

So how in the ever loving fuck did my puts remain practically unchanged?!?!\n\nTheta is about -0.026 so I should lose less than 3 cents per share to time decay. Let's just round it up and say 3 cents. Okay, but delta is about -0.062, which if I understand correctly means my contracts should have risen in value by more than 6 cents per dollar that SPY went down. SPY is down 2.33 on the day. Let's round down and say an even 2 bucks down. Which means at a bear minimum my contracts should have closed at least 12 cents higher than yesterday, minus the 3 cents it lost to theta. So the puts should have easily closed at least 9 cents higher than yesterday, or $3.04. \n\nProbably even more than $3.04 though, because notice how I rounded off all the numbers in a disadvantageous direction.

The \"s\" at the end should be capitalized and stands for \"Securities.\" \"LEAP\" is not the singular of \"LEAPS\". To form the singular, modify put or call. So one LEAPS call, two LEAPS calls. This also avoids implying that LEAPS can only be calls.\n\n> For example, i'm looking at PACW call LEAPs expiring Jan 2025 at 15 strike. The ask is $1.70. How do I know i'm not overpaying?\n\nAny price above zero would be overpaying for PACW calls. We're still waiting for the other receivership shoe to drop on that bank. I've got puts on KRE that say PACW is going to go into receivership sometime this year.\n\nFor any call, LEAPS or not, it's the same process as for shares. How do you know that the current spot price of AAPL or NVDA or BAC is over or underpriced? You have to make some kind of informed forecast for the future price and evaluate either, shares or contracts, against that forecast.\n\nFor nearer term calls, which would rule out LEAPS, there is also an element of volatility. Some amount of volatility is priced into nearer term calls and that volatility can be over or under priced relative to eventual realized volatility, more-or-less independent from the share price forecast. So a forecast for near term volatility may also be needed.\n\nHere's an example of making a volatility forecast: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/13ptef9/expensive_options_case_study_tsm/\n\nIV Rank and IV Percentile are useful tools as well, just keep in mind that they are trailing 52-week averages.

Hence the terms - In the Money (ITM), At the Money (ATM), Out of the Money (OTM) etc.\n\nExtrinsic value is the measure of uncertainty surrounding the possible fluctuations of the Intrinsic value depending on the remaining days to expire. Hence, more days to expiry means more chances for the underlying stock price to go up or down. Thereby, higher price for that contract. So, as an Options contract nears expiry, the extrinsic value component lowers since not much time left to have price fluctuation in the underlying stock. And if the contract is already in OTM, then it'll be worthless on the expiration date.\n\nDid I get it right?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> The price of an Options contract (i.e., premium) at any given point in time has two components = Intrinsic value + Extrinsic value.\n\nCorrect. Further, either or both may be zero.\n\n> Intrinsic value is the measure of how much profitness that contract is sitting on at that point in time (based on the strike rate and the underlying stock price). \n\nClose. Profit is determined by the initial cost. If the cost is less than the total value of the contract, you have a profit. So just call intrinsic value the difference between the strike price and spot price, when that difference is a positive number. There's no word \"profitness\", btw. And \"strike price\", not \"strike rate\".\n\nIntrinsic value cannot be negative, so that means intrinsic value can only be calculated **for a call** when the strike price is equal to or less than the stock price. **For a put**, it is the opposite, intrinsic value can only be calculated when the strike price is equal to or greater than the stock price.\n\n> Hence the terms - In the Money (ITM), At the Money (ATM), Out of the Money (OTM) etc.\n\nITM also means intrinsic value is greater than zero.\n\n> Extrinsic value is the measure of uncertainty surrounding the possible fluctuations of the Intrinsic value depending on the remaining days to expire. \n\nNo, that misses the point. Extrinsic value is the **risk premium** that sellers demand to compensate them for the probability that they will have to honor the contract at a loss. Since that probability is a function of time, extrinsic value can also be called time value. The probability is also a function of volatility, btw. Which is why extrinsic value is sensitive to both time and volatility.\n\nVolatility captures the notion of \"uncertainty\" that you had in your definition.\n\n> So, as an Options contract nears expiry, the extrinsic value component lowers since not much time left to have price fluctuation in the underlying stock. \n\nThat is essentially correct, but that is not the only way extrinsic value goes to zero. Consider a call with 90 days to expiration. That's a lot of time, so from your statement, extrinsic value ought to be high. But what if the strike price is $50 and the stock price is $200, when the price range for the last 90 days was $150 to $250? In that scenario, the $50 strike is so deep ITM that there is close to a 100% chance that the contract has to be honored at expiration. In that case, when honoring the contract is practically a certainty, the seller can demand all the risk premium they want, but no buyer would be willing to pay. Therefore, the market forces the seller to offer the contract at parity (intrinsic value only, no extrinsic), if they want to sell contracts at all.\n\n> And if the contract is already in OTM, then it'll be worthless on the expiration date.\n\nIt may already be worthless. It depends on the volatility of the underlying. Using our $200 spot price vs $150-$250 range again, all of the OTM calls with strikes above $250 would probably be zero or very close to zero, even with 90 days still to go to expiration.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Incorrect in some details.    \n  \n\nYou can buy in the money options.    \nIntrinsic value is not profit.  \n\n\nYou can have a gain on out of the money options and exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Only ITM have intrinsic value which is the difference between the stock and strike price.

You buy-write an 8 month CC at $107 for $3 credit (or $97/share net debit, since it is a buy-write). Four months into that period, XYZ shoots up to $140. There's no chance of early assignment because of substantial extrinsic value in the call (let's say they are worth $35). Since the shares are locked up in the CC, they can't be sold for a gain unless the call is closed, which would be for a substantial loss. A month later, still 3 months to expiration, XYZ declines back to $100, the opening value.\n\nWhat I was comparing that scenario to is no CC at all. Just shares.\n\nObviously, the up front premium of the 8 month call will be more than the 60 day call, but that wasn't my point.

Nowadays **transformers** beat everything most of the time, and usually transformers is a different architecture from RNNs.\n\nI say mostly because RNNs are still at the top for some LM tasks (typically character-level) and there are works that combine the two - being both RNNs and transformers at the same time; those are mostly just research still and not leading.\n\nThough when people talk about LLMs, they tend to refer to more specific available models - like GPT3, PALM, GPT-J, etc. These are all transformers and are not RNNs. It is also a rather small class of rather similar models vs all of the different types of models that people have developed and made it to leaderboards etc. There are some reasons for that.\n\nSo I think what you are curious about is the difference between a transformer and RNN, and why being language modeling would not imply being an RNN necessarily.\n\nSo first you are right that language models typically work by taking some text, feeding in parts of it, predicting a continuation, and then correcting itself vs the actual continuation.\n\nThis type of training is specifically called **self-supervised learning**, and is used by both RNNs and transformers.\n\nThis is not the case for all models though. E.g. BERT masks random words in a text and then predict with having access to both text coming before and after. Which also means you could do things like having a story with a start and end, and then fill in the middle; or suggest individual words to replace to improve a text. This is also considered a type of language modeling, even though it is not just predicting the next token.\n\nAs you can imagine, this is something that RNNs rather struggles with and part of the reason why BERT could be so powerful for segment and classification texts.\n\nThe intuition for this is that an RNN only processes one token at a time, outputs some memory, generates the next token, rinse and repeat. This makes it difficult for it to deal with far dependencies because if something at the beginning of the text is useful, it needs to keep track of that in its memory and keep copying it for every token in the text in the hopes that it will become useful at some point.\n\nTransformers rather work by processing and predicting everything at once - all the tokens get fed in in parallel; go through a number of layers; and then have outputs for all of the tokens. Instead of one token feeding into another, each token instead produces values associated with 'keys' (vectors), and each next token in the next layer picks what values to use based on query vectors being similar to key vectors. That way each token can choose to have its values being influenced by any other token.\n\nSo e.g. if the text somewhere mentions a dog named Dexter, it can create a vector about that, and another token that is curious about whether the text is about a pet can see that vector being similar, and take and use that name. The tokens inbetween need to know nothing about this.\n\nSo the architecture is rather different.\n\nModels like GPT however are called **decoder-only** and they are trained only to predict the next token, one at a time, and hence are also **autoregressive language models**, which they share with but still are not RNNs.\n\nHope you find that useful/interesting!

I certainly wouldn’t buy 10 GPUs and hire 5 people from Stanford to “start from scratch” right? \n\nI just get PyTorch or tensor flow and smash it in there until my model is good enough. That works for 99 percent of use cases right? \n\nAnd also a more technical question I am ignorant on: you only need the GPU to establish your\nModel and run the data right? Once you have the model established, you can ask the model it’s prediction using very simple code on a simple machine. Correct? I seem to be able to do this on my local machine relatively easily", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> And also a more technical question I am ignorant on: you only need the GPU to establish your Model and run the data right? Once you have the model established, you can ask the model it’s prediction using very simple code on a simple machine. Correct? I seem to be able to do this on my local machine relatively easily\n\nThis seems to be our point of departure on the topic. I agree that there will be a pullback after the researchers and startups are done having their go. But in order to run models with generalized intelligence (which is really what has been missing from a lot of APIs: common sense), you'll need some hardware if you want privacy. And privacy won't matter to a lot of companies but, IMO, it'll matter to a lot of companies.\n\nYou also have to consider fixed vs variable costs with regard to context management and just general usage. The reason I got into locally hosted AIs in the first place is because I can run unlimited queries against them without incurring a cost per 4k letters. And that's ignoring opportunities at fine tuning, pipelines, general control of the overall system... I think there's a lot of upside to running your LLM locally hosted.\n\nBut yea, I think it'll follow a similar model to AWS *eventually*. But in the short term: open-source models are passing up closed source models (as the leaked memo from Google indicates). I think if it's a choice of \"pay per letter or pay upfront\", medium sized companies will generally select \"pay upfront\".\n\nI run a company that provides QA for a certain service.

{"title": "Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html\n\nNvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.\n\nSignificantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.\n\nNvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.", "id": "13vr1zd", "created_utc": 1685455008.0, "score": 1430, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 463, "comments": [{"body": "Had two shares that I bought for $166, sold one for $405.

I own SOXX - an ETF that tracks the entire semiconductor sector. 10% of it's holdings are NVIDIA and it's close to an all time high. \n\nI own SOXX as part of my ROTH IRA as I believe it's a good long term investment, but I'm wondering if it's wise to sell some of it or all of it off while NVIDIA is on this huge streak.

Only difference being that I own SMH but they are similar anyway.\n\nAfter pondering a lot, I decide not to sell, for a few reasons:\n\n1. We who own an ETF with NVDA in it, should have a totally different mindset from people owning NVDA directly. For people who own NVDA it's truly their once in a life time to profit a ton from selling it. If NVDA truly popped, there is a chance that they may never get the same price ever again. For you and I however, the semiconductor sector is here to stay. There is no rush for us to sell it now, as even if NVDA popped, we may still have some profit (although lower) caused by the other holdings.\n\n2. If we sell the ETF, we are not only selling that 10% of Nvidia, but also selling the other 90% of non-Nvidia holdings. We don't know whether AMD or ASML or TSM will have a spike tomorrow or next year, but if you sell the ETF, you will lose the potential gains from the other holdings.\n\n3. My own strategy is to passively DCA and own ETFs on a long term including sector ETFs (like a riskier boglehead), exploiting the strategy of 'time in the market' to the max. I also believe that semiconductor, however volitate the industry is, is a great long-term investment - I believe that even in the event that NVDA becomes the next Intel, the sector is still here to stay. If I decide to sell it now, it will create the first crack in my own strategy and belief, and may even tempt myself to go into riskier endavor. I prefer to have bit more principle and patience. \n\n4. I have no use of extra cash right now, nor any good idea where to invest the profit anyway.\n\nFinally, in your case, you may have tax problems if you sell too. \n\nSo that's my own thought.

It’s not fair for you to pigeonhole kids into being straight or gay based on their *non-sexual *behavior as kids since they should be free to figure that out as teenagers when they actually experience sexual urges.\n\nIt’s also unfair to claim that I’m supporting denying the existence of LGBT people. I show my kid books with LGBT families and have explained this to them since they were 3 so to equate not agreeing on children having a sexual identity with denying the existence of LGBT people is not intellectually honest or fair. I definitely didn’t **know** I was *mostly* straight as a kid-I had to go through puberty to figure it all out when I finally found other people sexually attractive.

The cornerstone of my position is something more like: There are plenty of people who are okay with trans people, but don’t want to support large corporations pushing a trans lifestyle onto their kids.\n\nNow, this “fact-check,” is the perfect example of what I was talking about when I said people on the left are watching equally biased news. And it might even be more insidious because so much effort goes into dishonest “fact checking.” I can see that you found many articles “debunking” the idea that target is selling tuck friendly swimsuits for kids. It looks like you have many sources there.\n\nI find it curious that all of those sources treat the issue as though target is only selling these products for adults. If you know any children, unlike perhaps the Associated Press, or Snopes, you might know that an child’s XL is an adult XS. Most kids around 13-14 wear “adult sizes.” A lot of kids wear clothes in those sizes in middle school. There are elementary school kids that are large enough to wear “adult” sizes. \n\nI will be happy to admit that Target isn’t filling their children’s section with tuck friendly swimwear. But what is the motivation to carry it at all? According to the ultra MAGA news source Reuters, 1.6 million us adults identify as trans or non binary. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-study-estimates-16-million-us-identify-transgender-2022-06-10/  \n\nThat is roughly 0.5% of the population. I’m going to guess that maybe half of that population actually fits the demographic for any particular style of tuck friendly swimwear?\n\nSo why would that be commercially viable? That can’t be a material problem Target is having in sales, that they are missing out of the 0.25% of the population that wants this kind of swimsuit. Maybe the reasoning isn’t that they need to meet the high demand of adults that want this product. Maybe it’s because… https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/science/transgender-teenagers-national-survey.html according to the New York Times, another super far right Russian misinformation rag, children are identifying as trans at a rate of about three times that of the adult population, a number that has doubled in the past five years, and still rising.\n\nSo when you confidently posted all of these fact checks, did you find that any of these purveyors or truth mentioned that the people Target would be targeting with “adult sized” tuck friendly swimwear would include children? That actually children would be the vast majority of the target demographic. Did they give you a fair and balanced view of what is happening there? Did they really just “fact check” this for you here, so you would know “the truth?” Unlike us crazy right wingers and our Russian misinformation stupid people news?\n\nI will bet in that same swimsuit section of target, you probably can’t find a size large enough to fit the largest 0.5% of the population. They wouldn’t stock those sizes typically because that wouldn’t be commercially viable. You would probably go to a speciality store to find that kind of thing. That’s probably how Target would view tuck friendly swimsuits if… they weren’t trying to signal that they support the exponential rise of…. encouraging your kids to be trans. And if that sounds crazy, let me take the divisive rhetoric out of it. The only reason Target would do this is not to capture an important demographic for sales, it’s pretty obviously a political statement of being on a side of the issue. “We are selling these things, because we are on this side.”\n\nAnd then it’s really simple. Some people just don’t want to shop there if that’s what they are going to do. Personally, I don’t care enough to boycott Target. I don’t care who makes what beer. But since I appreciate a wide variety of news sources, and have a family, and live in the real world, I don’t think that people that do boycott these products, or make up the roughly 50% of our country that votes a certain way are just “crazy” or “stupid” or “deplorable.” I also don’t think that a diet of strictly left wing news and left wing “fact checkers,” is any better than a strict diet of right wing news. Some of this stuff is as bad as Alex Jones. \n\nDidn’t all of these news sources tell us for two years that Trump colluded with Russia to sway the election? Remember the two to four years when the left wing attacked our democracy? Just kidding, they wouldn’t frame it that way. It’s only an attack on our democracy if the right wing does it.
