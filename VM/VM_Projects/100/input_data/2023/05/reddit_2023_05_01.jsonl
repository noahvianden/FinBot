What is the right way to arrive at the number of option required?\n\nYour criteria are self-contradictory. Either you insure the full 100k at it's current beta-weighted notional, or you insure what's left after a 30% drop, which would be 70k. You can't get 100k in value on insurance when the basis is only 70k. Well, you can, but you'd pay a shit load of money for it.\n\nSince the beta-weighting is 1.0, you can just buy protective puts at whatever share price the 30% drop is. So if SPY was $400 when you had 100k of it, buy the put with a 280 strike. Once SPY falls below 280, you gain dollar for dollar on the put that you lose on the shares, so your net value shouldn't fall any further. Get 1 put per 100 shares of SPY.\n\nFor the more generalized beta-weighted hedging strat with puts, here's a good explainer (which uses XSP puts for various advantages over SPY or SPX puts):\n\nhttps://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/how-to-right-size-hedges-via-beta-weighting-with-xsp-options/\n\nFinally a word about probabilities. Full value hedges cost a lot of money. If the tail-risk you are hedging against only happens 3% of the time, you're basically paying an extra 97% for nothing. So hedges should not only be beta weighted, they also ought to be probability weighted as well. Come up with a few probability ranges, like 80% SPY breaks even or profits, 12% chance it falls up to 5%, 4%  chance it falls 5-10%, 2% chance it falls 10-15%, etc. Then scale the cost of the insurance to conform to the probability weighting.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.\n\nSo 100k is around 2.5 x (400 x 100).

So there are only two legs that can be assigned early.  Realistically, you are never going to get assigned on an OTM option, and only one of the two short legs of an IC can be ITM at any given time.  So you're not suddenly going to wake up one morning and find you got assigned on both at the same time.\n\nNow, technically, the underlying could swing far enough that you could get assigned early on one leg, then swing far enough in the other direction that you could get assigned early on the other leg.

Doesn’t it convert into short position of the underline stock/ETF?\n\nOnly one wing can expire ITM.  If you allow that to happen, with both legs ITM, the long will be exercised, and the short assigned.  This does result in trading shares, but the two transactions cancel each other out and the net result will be a debit in the amount of the width between the strikes.\n\nNote that you could allow it to expire with a short leg ITM and the corresponding long leg OTM, which could result in a loss greater than theoretical max loss.  For example, suppose the short call was at 100 and the long call at 105, and the underlying was at 103 at expiration.  The short would be assigned, and you would sell 100 shares short at 100.  The 105 long call would expire worthless and not be exercised.

Alternatively, the acquiring company may issue new shares to the original shareholders of the acquired company, as part of the deal.\n\nIf the acquiring company offers cash or stock as part of the deal, the original shareholders of the acquired company can choose to accept or reject the offer. If they accept the offer, they will receive the cash or stock as agreed upon in the deal. If they reject the offer, they may be left holding shares that are no longer listed on the stock exchange and may be difficult to sell.\n\nIn some cases, the acquiring company may allow the original shares of the acquired company to continue trading on the stock exchange, either as a subsidiary of the acquiring company or as a separate entity.

{"title": "IBM to Pause Hiring for Jobs That AI Could Do", "selftext": "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/ibm-to-pause-hiring-for-back-office-jobs-that-ai-could-kill?leadSource=reddit\\_wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/ibm-to-pause-hiring-for-back-office-jobs-that-ai-could-kill?leadSource=reddit_wall)\n\n [International Business Machines Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBM:US) Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said the company expects to pause hiring for roles it thinks could be replaced with artificial intelligence in the coming years.\n\nHiring in back-office functions — such as human resources — will be suspended or slowed, Krishna said in an interview. These non-customer-facing roles amount to roughly 26,000 workers, Krishna said. “I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period.”\n\nThat would mean roughly 7,800 jobs lost. Part of any reduction would include not replacing roles vacated by attrition, an IBM spokesperson said.\n\nAs artificial intelligence tools have captured the public imagination for their ability to automate customer service, write text and generate code, many observers have worried about their potential to [disrupt the labor market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-30/tech-ai-driving-job-changes-for-nearly-a-quarter-of-all-workers). Krishna’s plan marks one of the largest workforce strategies announced in response to the rapidly advancing technology.\n\nMore mundane tasks such as providing employment verification letters or moving employees between departments will likely be fully automated, Krishna said. Some HR functions, such as evaluating workforce composition and productivity, probably won’t be replaced over the next decade, he added. \n\nIBM currently employs about 260,000 workers and continues to hire for software development and customer-facing roles. Finding talent is easier today than a year ago, Krishna said. The company announced [job cuts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-25/ibm-to-cut-about-3-900-workers-still-hiring-in-higher-growth-areas) earlier this year, which may amount to about 5,000 workers once completed. Still, Krishna said IBM has added to its workforce overall, bringing on about 7,000 people in the first quarter.\n\nKrishna, who has been CEO since 2020, has worked to focus the century-old company around software and services such as hybrid cloud. He has divested lower-growth businesses like managed infrastructure unit [Kyndryl Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/KD:US) and part of the Watson Health business. The company is currently considering [selling its weather unit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-12/ibm-considering-sale-of-weather-unit-acquired-in-2016).\n\nArmonk, New York-based IBM [topped profit estimates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-19/ibm-earnings-full-year-sales-above-estimates-amid-tech-market-fears) in its most recent quarter due to expense management, including the earlier-announced job cuts. New productivity and efficiency steps are expected to drive $2 billion a year in savings by the end of 2024, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said on the day of earnings. \n\nUntil late 2022, Krishna said he believed the US could avoid a recession. Now, he sees the potential for a “shallow and short” recession toward the end of this year.

They use most of it to buy investments that make them more money, such as making loans, buying stock, or buying Treasury bonds.\n\nSo, to pay almost $100B in depositor withdrawals, FRC had to sell a lot of Treasury bonds, loans, and investments at LOSS.
