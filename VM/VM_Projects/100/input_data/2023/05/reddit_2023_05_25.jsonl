In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.\n\nI think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.\n\nPersonally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price.

You could argue that AWS offers some useful features and services that would make a site like Reddit run slightly better than on Azure, but similar competitor features can be built by Azure and at that point it's just a question of pros and cons. Perhaps Azure is slightly cheaper, but AWS has the better ecosystem, etc. I suspect in time the same dynamic will play out with CUDA as companies look for ways to improve the costs and margins associated with training and hosting of their AI models.\n\nThat said, right now there is no clear competitor so they do have an edge today.

It’s competition will probably be other major players not disruptive startups. \n\nNVDA’s stock price will probably come down (maybe way down) from yesterdays high sometime in the next year but in ten years it will be way higher than it is now. When it does I might buy more after there is some inevitable bad news. \n\nBasically I’m not trying to make a quick buck trying to time things. I think NVDA still has a long way to go so I won’t sell. The rest of this sub is right that it is overpriced right now based on the current environment. if the price comes down I might buy more but at this point it’s one of my biggest holdings so maybe not. But good companies always find new markets and new ways to make money. That’s what happened with AMZN and NFLX. They were overvalued until they opened up new markets.\n\nEdit:  If you wait for a good company to become undervalued (or even fairly valued) you will probably be waiting for a very long time.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You think itll go back down a lot?

MB-TEX and Sensatec. You seem like a smart fella so I don't have to explain what those are to you. Tesla doesnt offer leather options not because they are unable to or cost, its because part of the brands goal is sustainability/environmentalism.

{"title": "Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value", "selftext": "Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.\n\nNvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.\n\nBut the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.\n\nSince Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.\n\nToday, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.\n\nRough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. \n\nArk's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.\n\n**In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was \"very high\" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**\n\n\"We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,\" she told CNBC on February 27.\n\nWood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. \n\nBut despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. \n\nShares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%. \n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cathie-wood-ark-invest-sold-nvidia-stake-before-ai-rally-2023-5?", "id": "13rxgz6", "created_utc": 1685058945.0, "score": 2361, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 400, "comments": [{"body": "She must employ Carter Worth.

But people often risk much more on credit spreads (especially narrow credit spreads) which ramps up their delta exposure to absurd levels.\n\nIn other words: if I have $100 to invest, and I use all of that money to short a stock or sell a call, sure there is unlimited loss but the daily moves I am exposed to are not that much (maybe 1-3% a day, for most stocks). On the other hand, if I use all of that as collateral for narrow credit spreads, I might experience very wide swings of 50-60% every single day. Eventually when I close out my position, it's like betting my entire account on a single coin flip. Double or nothing.

The only difference is that with a debit spread you are paying upfront for the chance to make back what you paid + some, while with a credit spread you are being paid upfront for the chance to lose what you were paid + some.\n\nThere are also differences in vega exposure (IV is a good thing for debit spreads) but those go away if you hold until the spread closes.\n\nThe point here is that you can't use \"limited loss\" as an excuse to gamble all of your account on a coin flip. Arguably, even betting 10-30% of your account on a coin flip is problematic. Limited loss provides some minimal degree of protection because you know you won't ever dig yourself into a hole of margin debt.

Since a debit spread has a defined max loss and gain, by definition a credit spread also has a defined max loss and gain. Assignment makes things tricky for either kind of spread due to pin risk.

But if you get assigned in the very last minute before you can even react then yeah there is some risk for both kinds of spreads.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "and the over leveraging risk if you pay max loss upfront?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There is no risk of getting margin called if you pay the max loss upfront. However, the risk is in the movement of the underlying. Essentially, suppose I gave you three choices, which you must invest your entire life savings into over and over again:\n\nChoice 1: 50% of the time, gain 10%; 50% of the time, lose 2%\n\nChoice 2: 50% of the time, gain 104%; 50% of the time, lose 96%\n\nChoice 3: 90% of the time, gain 10%; 10% of the time, lose 50%\n\nNow, all of these choices have the same expected value: a 4% gain. However, a rational investor would almost certainly pick the first choice over the second choice. You can explain this away by risk-aversion, but a simpler way to look at things is to consider the effect of a single bad trade.\n\nWith choice 1, if you have a bad trade, you lose 2% and you can make it back after a single good trade.\n\nWith choice 2, if you have a bad trade, you wipe out 96% of your net worth, leaving you with only 1/25 of what you initially had. Even if you then have a series of good trades and double your money each time, you have to have 5 good trades in a row just to make back what you lost.\n\nThe choice between 1 and 3 is less obvious. Though it takes you more good trades to make up a single bad trade, it is also more likely to have several good trades in a row. You could use log-returns to calculate this with precision, but that is beyond the scope of this discussion.\n\nBuying a stock is like choice 1. A narrow ATM spread is like choice 2. Selling an OTM put / call is like choice 3.\n\nPosition sizing is crucial with spreads, much more so than people think. It is very risky to simply bet your entire account on a narrow spread. In fact, even using leverage to buy stocks is usually less risky than this (despite the scary \"unlimited loss\"). If you want to simulate leverage without the potential for margin calls, use wide spreads. Even though it seems like you're wasting buying power.\n\nNarrow spreads kill because they are very close to binary options or event contracts.

I'm still up a ton from where I started (\\~70k), but it kind of sucks not being a millionaire anymore. I used to pay the bill every time my friends and I would go out to eat, tip big, get haircuts often, eat out every single meal of the day (and be able to afford extra meat lol), etc. I don't feel secure doing that right now. It felt really good not having to worry about money.\n\nThe worst out of all this is that I promised my parents I would buy them a house, and I can no longer do that. Houses are 1.5m+ in my area, and at one point I could have literally bought it in cash. Instead, I gambled it all away. They were dejected but I can't go back to the past and change what happened. They'll have to live in a shitty apartment unfortunately until I can figure things out again.  \n\nLet's look at the bright side (coping mechanism😔):\n\n1. I made these mistakes at 22. I still have time to recover from losses (hopefully)\n2. I already took out and spent \\~150k buying my parent's cars, paying off their debts, and spending money on myself before I lost most the money\n3. I haven't lost everything. Almost everything, but not everything.\n4. I couldn't sleep at night with my extremely leveraged portfolio. I feel as if a weight has been taken off my back.\n5. I am still alive, and healthy. We don't need much money nowadays to get our basic needs met. We don't need much money to be happy.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm still thankful for everything I've been blessed with. I have clean water, food on the table, and a roof over my head. Sure, you need to strive and work towards greater heights, but you still need to appreciate what you have.\n\nLessons/Mistakes:\n\n1. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions (I literally wrote this on my last post before I lost my money, but I ended up losing it anyways😓)\n2. The market is not rational. It doesn't care about your squiggly (or straight) lines or your discounted cash flow analysis (at least right away). Position yourself accordingly.\n3. Have other things to do other than watching the market. I was researching/watching the market 10 hours+ a day some days. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to my classes. Etc. Just to watch the market and find some sort of alpha online. Being too active made me consistently switch my positions up, and made me unable to sit on my hands.\n4. Position sizing. I would go all in on a single stock a lot of the time. Using margin as well.\n5. Using margin. I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.\n6. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.\n7. Next time around, if I do \"short\", I would need to either do it using puts or be short stock with calls as hedges.\n8. All or nothing mentality. Even when I already made it. This was pretty regarded as well. I could have gone all in on dividend stocks and never had to work a day in my life. But I didn't do that.\n9. Probs a million other things\n\nDon't really have much more to say, but take care of yourselves bros. Start hitting the gym. Talk to that girl (even if she makes you nervous). Make more money. Fix/strengthen your relationship with your friends and family. Find God. Find yourself a waifu (not Mikasa because she's taken). You get the point. \n\nGL frens WGMI 😎", "id": "13rdd1r", "created_utc": 1685008395.0, "score": 4201, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 820, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|685|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I was a idiot.

CPU workloads aren't going away. GPUs are too complicated for many things that CPUs do. It is like saying that since the chainsaw exists, hence the knife industry is going to die.\n\nAnd anyway, most of the software that realistically benefitted the most from GPUs has already shifted to GPU accelerated workloads many years ago. That market is still buying Intel CPUs however, because a GPU can't run most of the general purpose compute that a CPU can or uses a lot more programming time to do so.\n\nAnd before you say that new \"tools\" are going to make it easier. It isn't. The architecture of a GPU means that it is more difficult to interface with.\n\n\\> I work in the industry and I can’t express how much more desirable and competitive Nvidia positions are than either company \n\nI highly doubt that, considering that Nvidia sells accelerators. In simpler terms, it \"accelerates\" some workload. A GPU still needs a CPU to work.\n\n\\> Not in the near future though. Maybe 5-6 years.

Sat on desktop/laptop/server chip laurels due to lack of competition from AMD around 2012-2017ish. Got complacent/unlucky on their fabrication process of 10nm(which competes with TSMC 7nm, and got overtaken by both TSMC and even Samsung). Problems could have been reduced by diversifying the company into separate design and fab operations open to work with others so shortcoming of 1 dont allow for loss of the value of both systems which are separated in every other chip company. \n\n2. Had MBA as CEO when other companies were running with engineer CEOs, which might have meant short term thinking in extracting maximum profit while the sun shone but no focus on the problems bubbling under the surface.\n\n3. Are very late into GPUs even though they have been making integrated GPUs(iGPUs) to run the screens GUI on laptops for a decade. Thus having missed out on crypto craze when GPUs were going for 4x their MSRP. AMD and NVIDIA also benefited atleast a little from this coke binge of a phenomenon. Also missed out on the actual/stock hyping capabilities of being an AI processor company(slightly modified GPUs basically) like NVIDIA has cornered almost and AMD gets leftovers out of.\n\nAll conjecture ofcourse. \n\n\n\nGarbage story time. \n\nTried to get into the smartphone game late, could have even gotten a piece of the pie if they actually made some good phone chips. Intels moat is x86 that it has to share with AMD. The software like windows & used to be macOS that used to only run on x86, stagnated, or even straight up migrated to ARM. x86 is still their moat,but fewer and fewer people even want to get in, as the castle next door at ARM is much better, customisable, energy efficient and generally open.\n\nAMD had beaten INTEL to 64 bit and multi core(2core cpu) but fumbled the bag as Intel soon recovered in the next 5 years leaving AMD dead in the forest. AMD had bet on higher core counts (8 core) to scale performance to the next level whilst keeping costs down. This was a dumpster fire of an execution(ahead of their time concepts in a way) which when AMD was in the shitter, amd sold off their foundry into Global foundries to survive the 2010ish times. This was the clear strategy amongst all chip companies to ditch fabrication and outsource it to the specialists. AMD was among the last to take this strategy when they had no other choice basically. Intel being high on their success at dominating AMD and having a massive legacy felt they were the only real deal company in the space with their own fabs(REAL MEN HAVE THEIR OWN FABS thinking). They enjoyed a good almost decade of absolute dominance in laptops,desktops, servers, but were getting FOMO rightly so, at being left behind in mobile chips. They didn't push hard in their dominance areas as they didn't need to(they didn't have competition- no companies don't just plan to be good or bad, but complacency in more relaxed timelines probably has an effect on slacking when you're winning the race). Most of their effort went into mobile and they bombed hard again and again for 5 years or so from 2010 to 2015ish in the mobile space since at this time phone chips were a league behind laptops or desktop chips, and they always started from their own perceived superior strategy of making big hefty CPUs that had some real performance like a real man, but didn't matter for shit when phone batteries could only power these inefficient cpus (compared to the ARM chips of the time) and ended up running even worse performance a lot of the times when the power budgets were kept inline with ARM chips were taking(ARM chips designed by the likes of Qualcomm,mediatek and later apple)\n\nBy this time AMD had woken up from their death with their aptly named RYZEN CPUs which featured chiplet designs which allowed for much cheaper ways to get to massive amounts of cores. Even their non chiplet CPUs had more cores than Intel had been stuck on for 5 years. Intel held on for 2-3 more years as people finally started buying AMD again (lack of availability of AMD laptops and server CPU order take time and trust to shift,nobody was going to get fired buying Intel, but might be taking risks with AMD for the higher reward(better performance for money)).\n\nThey have just now in 2023 roughly caught upto AMD where they are competing for the better chip every year, but you can't go too wrong buying either one. In response to the AMD revival in 2017-18, they had started cutting selling costs and adding cores by 2018 itself but within the next 2-3 years by 2020 ish it became apparent they were bruteforcing. By the time their stock tanked to be an Evel lower market cap than amd,a much smaller company by revenue, they kicked out the money counting ceo and put in an engineer,hoping someone with a clue as to what's actually going on can focus on the basics. He did do all that, refresh branding, get into GPUs, spin off the fab as a separate market fab open to all. They got some tiny external business from their fabs being opened to all,but nothing of not yet, as they are still in the leading edge region so not cheap, but a clear 3rd compared to tsmc and samsung, so they don't get good orders there either. None the less, it is a good strategy long term of becoming more nimble. They also got a big rimjob from the US govt in the form of the CHIPS act where they collected billions like a stripper collects 1s. But so did everyone else. Their GPUs were alright on price to consumers but they arent making money on the investment just yet as they haven't made a great product and are being forced to rely on undercutting the competition. They also completely missed out on the crypto hysteria by a few months, launching the product just when GPUs were being flooded into the market by crypto miners. \n\nChiplet design (2 chips talking to each other over a pcb. data transfer speeds within a chip are blazing fast, but once you get off the bullet train complex(Silicon chip) to catch the connecting bus(copper wiring on a PCB) to reach the other bullet train complex(chiplet 2 ))this is beneficial as at the kinds of complex small scale fabrication that are used in bleeding edge nodes these days, the margin for error can be larger(100 errors in 1 billion vs 300 errors in 1 billion) this is because if each chip is made of 2 smaller chiplets, a smaller portion of the error heavy silicon has to be thrown away(or sold as entry level chips with half the cores turned off since they had errors in printing)\n\n\nI don't know why I wrote this garbage, sunk cost now.", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "I liked it, dovetailed nicely with exactly when I stopped following along myself.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "So a lot of this is good info, but one thing I always feel the need to dispute is the idea that Intel got complacent with their CPUs.
