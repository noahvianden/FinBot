Only about 1/3 of CVS revenue is from prescriptions, so they’re also competing with companies like Quest Diagnostic for vaccinations and cheaper markets for goods. \n\n\nCVS has a loyal customer base of boomers, which are beginning to die off.

They still make way more money overall than Walgreens just thought this was interesting. \n\n\nPersonally, I just wouldn’t invest in any retail pharmacy.
