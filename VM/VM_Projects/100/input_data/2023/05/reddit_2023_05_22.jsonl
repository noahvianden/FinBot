Or at least to get a rough idea / estimate?\n\nThere is no sure way to connect those two numbers. Earnings calls, and similar high volatility events, have a second variable, IV, that can work in the opposite direction of the stock price. For example, if you ignore IV, you can calculate that your stock needs to go up $5 for you to profit on your call. But what you don't realize is that your call was opened with abnormally high IV, so that even a $5 rise in stock price might not be enough to make up for the $6.90 of value you lose in the call from IV crush.\n\nSo what you can do as a sort of ball park is *add your extrinsic value at open* to the minimum price move needed to turn your call profitable. The latter is a straight-forward intrinsic value ITM calculation based on strike price. So say your call was 100% extrinsic value at open for $6.90. The stock price now (before the ER) is $100 and you bought the $105 call. That means the stock has to go up $5 to get ITM and $6.90 to account for any IV crush. That means the minimum gain on the shares would be $11.90 over the current $100 price before you turn a profit on the call, give or take. \n\nRemember, this is just a guesstimate.

(The prior record goes to Amazon which was stung for $887M for misusing customers data for ad targeting back in 2021.)\n\nMeta’s sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people’s information.\n\n\nEuropean judges have previously found US surveillance practices conflict with EU privacy rights.\n\nIn a press release announcing today’s decision the EDPB’s chair, Andrea Jelinek, said:\n\n> The EDPB found that Meta IE’s [Ireland’s] infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive and continuous. Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive.

Now we get to see if they were right.\n\n5) Hype generally creates a scenario of \"sell the news\". Everyone is aware that the AI hype caused an enormous jump in share price, and that's highly unlikely to be reflected in higher revenue in the short term.\n\nThere are other reasons but these are the main ones. I'm also a big believer that each technology has a limit. How we get to the next level is by adapting an implementing a new technology or new variation of an older one. Moore's Law is still validated at the moment, but I think we are coming very close to a point where it breaks. Even something as small as atoms doubling every two years would eventually fill a limited space. It's illogical to assume that Moore's Law won't be broken, the question is when. But from industry leaders, it's being reported that they're starting to see the end here. It's getting more difficult by the day and the people who were saying Moore's Law would go on forever eventually began saying maybe 10 more years, and now are saying perhaps 5.\n\nThe new technology that can come in and save the day looks to be chiplets. Unfortunately, Nvidia dropped the ball there and are kind of catching up now. AMD got on the chiplet train a little earlier, and they do have a lead in that one area.\n\nWhy is that important? In the long term, I think restructuring of manufacturing chips is going to be an enormous disruptor. In the short term it means allocating more capital to developing a newer technology. That's very cost intensive and could affect the bottom line of semiconductor companies over the next few years.\n\nIt's all a guess of course. But there is too much negative with Nvidia itself right now to ignore.

You are correct.  However the company forecast coming out of that down cycle by the end of last year, 2022.  It's now Q1 they're reporting.   The big indicator here was the GM forcast was moving from low 60s to mid to high 60%.\n2.  The \"engine\" driving nvidia growth is not gaming, it's data center, specifically computation for AI training.  The biggest customers do not have enough of the latest GPUs.   Sam Altman (CEO Open AI) testified in to the US Congress last week he \"can't get enough GPUs.\"\n3. You don't mention Data Center, their biggest segment.   It should come in between $4.5B-$5B in revenue this quarter.  The biggest customers are Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google, Facebook, Google.  These guys are slowing down orders to Intel, not to Nvidia.  Automotive is rising, but not significant, it will turn in \\~5-7% of revenue of data center.\n4. Guidance last quarter increased 8% q/q to $6.5B.   Please explain what was \"not great\" about that.\n5. Hype is a difficult issue to quantify because it is subjective.    Indications are their data center GPUs are sold out through the end of the year.   \n\nNot sure what you think you know about chiplets, but NVIDIA VP GPU Engineering Jonah Alben says that monolithic chips are best if your company can build them and that's why he's sticking with them.  I'd believe him over what AMD thinks simply because AMD aren't winning anything right now in GPU.  In fact, their market share continues to shrink.   So why would anyone believe their approach is correct?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "1) Industry-wide GPU sales figures released just two weeks ago have reported that growth is still slowing.\n\n2) I can't see how recent AI hype could be reflected in this quarter, a point I already made. It takes time to ramp up productions to meet new demand.\n\n3) I don't mention data centers because I know that segment is likely to be strong. It doesn't take enormous slowing across the board to make a dent in the stock price. If they are simultaneously recording slowdowns across multiple sectors, in addition to an increase in data centers, does this warrant a tripling of the share price in a matter of months?\n\n4) 8% is a significant drop from past guidance. It's also a lofty goal. A PE of 150 typically demands more than 8% Q/Q growth.\n\n5) Again, does this justify such an enormous share price increase? You seem to be looking at price action possibilities through a lens that does not put significant enough emphasis on the fact their share price has tripled recently. That puts a lot of strain on expectations.\n\nRegardless whether chiplets are a solution or not, Nvidia is actually investing heavily there. If they were certain there'd be no significant need for them, they wouldn't be trying to compete there. That competition requires a lot of capital, which they are deploying now. If anything the argument that chiplets aren't so necessary only bolsters my point, because it indicates that Nvidia is spending a lot of capital on a technological change that won't bear much fruit for them.\n\nWe clearly disagree a bit here. That's okay. However so far I'm the only one to admit that this is a guess, only an opinion, and anything could happen.

Valuation is something I tend to bring up sometimes even if it's not part of the original discussion/argument.  Why is that?

You could say it's been \"expensive\" by traditional metrics since 2016, yes, but now it is *particularly* expensive - [the most expensive price-to-sales ratio it has ever had in history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/price-sales) \\- and in a rising interest rate environment.   I like to keep it simple and use price-to-sales ratio as a metric when making a bearish argument (as opposed to P/E ratio that others use), because (1) it is generally less lumpy and prone to accounting distortions than P/E ratio, and (2) it allows for more generous assumptions to argue against (i.e. - looking at top-line revenue with an \"even if we assume that expenses are minimal and profit margins are great, it is still very expensive\" lens to make a bear case).\n\nAnd this may be a dumb hot take here, but I don't think *any* MEGA-CAP company trading at over 20x P/S ratio (such as Nvidia) should be owned as a \"long term investment\" ever ever ever.

But Disney is throwing shade at everyone that loved all the properties that they created and those that they are now in control of.\n\nThey are missing on many different things in a dollars and cents way.  Their product is just not nearly as good at it once was and people are growing tired of it all.  I have completely checked out of the MCU and many that I know have as well.  Add in the hit and miss mess they are making out of Star Wars and it all starts to get really nasty.\n\nOutside of that and to the subject of this article, the reality is that Disney Parks is a MASSIVE portion of their profitability and they have been losing ground to Universal Studios for a while now.  Add in the new Epic Universe that opens in a year and a half or so and it is only going to get worse.  Pretty much everyone I know that goes to Universal Orlando for the first time is amazed at the place and can't get over why they put it off in favour of DW.
