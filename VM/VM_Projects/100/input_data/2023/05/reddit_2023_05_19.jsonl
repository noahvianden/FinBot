{"title": "Is there potential to short NVDA?", "selftext": "I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. \n\nI also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.\n\nI do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.\n\nSeems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?\n\n\nUpdate: I did see the +20% move after NVDA reported earnings. Luckily I did not open the short position yet. However, after briefly reading the filings I believe this could potentially be an even better short as valuation is more ridiculous", "id": "13lki8i", "created_utc": 1684469253.0, "score": 216, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 360, "comments": [{"body": "It makes sense to short‚Ä¶ so you shouldn‚Äôt short it.

How should I do that?\n\nBuilding a device to measure the strength of the WiFi signal in various areas of your office complex can be a fun and informative project. Here is a basic guide to get you started:\n\n1. **Hardware Selection**: First, you will need a microcontroller with WiFi capabilities. A popular choice is the ESP8266 or ESP32. These are low-cost, versatile, and widely supported devices. You'll also need a display to visualize the WiFi signal strength; an OLED display is a common choice.\n\n2. **Software**: You'll need to program your microcontroller to connect to the available WiFi networks and measure their signal strength. This is typically measured in dBm (decibel milliwatts). In general, the closer this value is to 0, the stronger the signal. ESP8266/ESP32 can be programmed using the Arduino IDE, which uses a simplified version of C++. \n\nHere is a very simplified version of what the code might look like:\n\n```c++\n#include <ESP8266WiFi.h> // or <WiFi.h> for ESP32\n#include <Wire.h>\n#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>\n#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>\n\n// Setup for the OLED display (using its I2C address)\nAdafruit_SSD1306 display(128, 64, &Wire, -1);\n\nvoid setup() {\n  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);\n  WiFi.disconnect();\n  delay(100);\n\n  display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C); // initialize with the I2C address \n  display.clearDisplay();\n  display.setTextSize(1);\n  display.setTextColor(WHITE);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  display.clearDisplay();\n  display.setCursor(0,0);\n  \n  int n = WiFi.scanNetworks();\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    String ssid = WiFi.SSID(i);\n    int rssi = WiFi.RSSI(i);\n\n    display.println(ssid + \": \" + String(rssi) + \" dBm\");\n  }\n\n  display.display();\n  delay(2000);\n}\n```\n\n3. **Prototyping**: After writing the code, you can start by prototyping your device on a breadboard, connecting the ESP8266/ESP32 and the OLED display together.\n\n4. **Testing**: Upload your code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE. Now, you should be able to see the WiFi signal strengths displayed on the OLED screen. Walk around your office complex and observe the readings.\n\n5. **Final Product**: Once you're satisfied with your prototype, you can design a PCB or use a more permanent soldering breadboard, along with a suitable power supply (like a battery pack), and mount it in a case.\n\nRemember, the values you get are relative to your device and its antenna, and they are not absolute measurements of signal strength.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you'll need to be aware of any legal or privacy considerations around scanning for WiFi networks in your location and within your organization.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It does not \"know\" what a chip is.

One of the first commercially available microprocessors was the Intel 4004, released in November 1971. However, the exact first usage of the term in literature can be hard to pin down due to the nature of technical and industry publications.\n\nThe term \"microprocessor\" is often attributed to Viatron Computer Systems describing the custom integrated circuit used in their System 21 small computer system announced in 1968. However, usage of the term in published text around that time is hard to verify.\n\nIf you're looking for early uses of the term \"microprocessor\" in academic literature, consider looking into technical journals from the early 1970s. IEEE Xplore Digital Library or the ACM Digital Library could be good places to search. They hold many of the historical papers in computer science and electrical engineering.\n\n> What‚Äôs wrong with this code? ‚ÄúInt i, j=0; while(i < 100 ) j = j + i;‚Äù\n\nThe variable `i` is not initialized before it's used in the `while` loop. This can lead to undefined behavior because `i` could be any value at the start. If it's not less than 100, the loop will never execute. If it is less than 100, the loop will run forever because `i` is never incremented.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```c\nint i = 0, j = 0;\nwhile(i < 100) {\n    j = j + i;\n    i++;\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, `i` is initialized to 0, and it's incremented in each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the loop will terminate after `i` is no longer less than 100.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Here‚Äôs an interesting demonstration someone just posted of your parrot:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/13lpssh/al_breaks_boundaries_watch_as_a_language_model/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "AI has been a thing for decades.

{"title": "Fed Chair Powell says rates may not have to rise as much as expected to curb inflation", "selftext": "The probability of a pause in rate hikes increased dramatically from 62% to higher than 86% in futures after an interview with Jerome Powell in which he stated that rates may not have to rise as much as expected.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/19/fed-chair-powell-says-rates-may-not-have-to-rise-as-much-as-expected-to-curb-inflation.html\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that stresses in the banking sector could mean that interest rates won‚Äôt have to be as high to control inflation.\n\nSpeaking at a monetary conference in Washington, D.C., the central bank leader noted that Fed initiatives used to deal with problems at mid-sized banks have mostly halted worst-case scenarios from transpiring.\n\nBut he noted that the problems at Silicon Valley Bank and others could still reverberate through the economy.\n\n‚ÄúThe financial stability tools helped to calm conditions in the banking sector. Developments there, on the other hand, are contributing to tighter credit conditions and are likely to weigh on economic growth, hiring and inflation,‚Äù he said as part of a panel on monetary policy.\n\n‚ÄúSo as a result, our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúOf course, the extent of that is highly uncertain.‚Äù\n\nPowell spoke with markets mostly expecting the Fed at its June meeting to take a break from the series of rate hikes it began in March 2022. However, pricing has been volatile as Fed officials weigh the impact that policy has had and will have on inflation that in the summer of last year was running at a 41-year high.\n\nOn balance, Powell said inflation is still too high.\n\n‚ÄúMany people are currently experiencing high inflation, for the first time in their lives. It‚Äôs not a headline to say that they really don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù he said during a forum that also featured former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.\n\n‚ÄúWe think that failure to get inflation down would, would not only prolong the pain but also increase ultimately the social costs of getting back to price stability, causing even greater harm to families and businesses, and we aim to avoid that by remaining steadfast in pursuit of our goals,‚Äù he added.\n\nPowell characterized current Fed policy as ‚Äúrestrictive‚Äù and said future decisions would be data-dependent as opposed to being a preset course. The Federal Open Market Committee has raised its benchmark borrowing rate to a target of 5%-5.25% from near zero where it had sat since the early days of the Covid pandemic.\n\nOfficials have stressed that rate hikes operate with a lag of a year or more, so the policy moves have not completely circulated through the economy.\n\n‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt made any decisions about the extent to which additional policy funding will be appropriate. But given how far we‚Äôve come, as I noted, we can afford to look at the data and the evolving outlook,‚Äù Powell said.\n\nMonetary policy in large part has been geared toward cooling a hot labor market in which the current 3.4% unemployment rate is tied for the lowest level since 1953. Inflation by the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure is running at 4.6%, well above the 2% long-range goal.\n\nEconomists, including those at the Fed itself, have long been predicting that the rate hikes would pull the economy into at least a shallow recession, likely later this year. GDP grew at a less-than-expected 1.1% annualized pace in the first quarter but is on track to accelerate by 2.9% in the second quarter, according to an Atlanta Fed tracker.\n\nPowell spoke the same day that the New York Fed released research showing that the long-range neutral interest rate ‚Äî one that is neither restrictive nor stimulative ‚Äî is essentially unchanged at very low levels, despite the pandemic-era inflation surge.\n\n‚ÄúImportantly, there is no evidence that the era of very low natural rates of interest has ended,‚Äù New York Fed President John Williams said in prepared remarks.", "id": "13m2gh0", "created_utc": 1684518207.0, "score": 685, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It doesn't mean you have a duty to always do things that will be in the financial best interest of the company.\n\nIt's much better to think of it in terms of an individual hiring a financial advisor. They have to do some things if they're a fiduciary, even if it's not explicitly stated in any contract/agreement:\n\n* Don't act with a conflict of interest, for example, they can't accept payment from a company to recommend their stock to you\n* Disclose any potential conflicts of interest, for example, if they were recommending an investment in a company where a family member worked\n* Care: they can't just act randomly or skip important steps. They need to be able to show that they properly researched recommendations\n\nCornell Law School has some good examples of cases and different kinds of duties that directors have: https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty\n\nAnd it's not hard to find lots of example of law firms that have spelled it out in more [approachable language](https://www.rpepperlaw.com/fiduciary-duties-of-corporate-officers-and-directors-utmost-good.html). Here's a couple of the key descriptions of a director's fiduciary duty:\n\n> Corporate officers and directors, as fiduciaries, have an obligation to refrain from acting in their own best interests, with respect to decisions made in their fiduciary capacity, where doing so would conflict with the interests of the corporation or its shareholders.\n\nThe overwhelmingly most likely scenario where a director or officer would run in to a problem with their fiduciary duty is competing with their own company. For example if they're giving sweetheart deals to another company they own/work at/board member of, etc. Or if they're starting a competing business they can't do anything to disadvantage the current company while still working their or being on the board.\n\nWhat a \"fiduciary duty\" definitely doesn't mean is that you can't make decisions that are bad for the company, or act in a way that results in lost sales or something. Director and officers make stupid mistakes all the time that hurt their companies. They agree to bad deals, they make bad plans, they just plain make mistakes or say or do things in their personal lives that reflect poorly on the company. Those things might not be desirable, but there's no legal responsibility to never do anything that might financially hurt your company. That's a frankly ridiculous standard to try and hold anyone to.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I go by what is stated from the Delaware government, since that is where Tesla is legally incorporated: [https://corplaw.delaware.gov/delaware-way-business-judgment/](https://corplaw.delaware.gov/delaware-way-business-judgment/)\n\n>Duty of loyalty: Broadly stated, the duty of loyalty requires directors to act in good faith to advance the best interests of the corporation and, similarly, to refrain from conduct that injures the corporation.\n\nI don't see how alienating a huge % of potential customers and damaging a company's brand isn't conduct that injures the corporation.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Why would you just quote the intro out of context? There's only three more paragraphs and they explain exactly what they're talking about:\n\n> Fundamentally, the duty of loyalty begins with ensuring that the corporation acts consistently with its charter from Delaware, a charter that typically permits the corporation to undertake any lawful business by any lawful means. A director therefore cannot cause a Delaware corporation to violate the law in order to make a profit. Rather, directors must exercise good-faith efforts to ensure that the corporation has policies to ensure compliance with the regulatory laws applicable to its operations (such as environmental, labor, and criminal laws) and to monitor senior management‚Äôs adherence to those policies. Although Delaware law gives directors wide discretion to decide how a corporation should seek profit, the duty of loyalty requires them to consider as well what legal, ethical course of action will produce the best outcome for the corporation‚Äôs stockholders.\n\n> The duty of loyalty also prohibits directors from using their positions to advance their own personal interests. Delaware law requires directors to devote their loyalty to the corporation and its stockholders, without consideration to their self-interest. Thus, the duty of loyalty prohibits directors from, for example, causing the corporation to engage in an unfair transaction in which the director has an interest, taking unreasonable action to keep their director positions, or profiting from the use of confidential corporate information. Generally, the duty of loyalty forbids any action that subordinates the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders to a director‚Äôs personal motive.\n\n> If a majority of the board has a conflicting interest in a transaction challenged in court, the board‚Äôs decision may not be protected by the business judgment rule. Rather, Delaware courts will generally require the directors to demonstrate that a self-dealing transaction was entirely fair to the corporation. For that reason, the Delaware courts encourage interested directors to adopt procedural protections‚Äîlike impartial and independent decision-makers‚Äîto help ensure that the transactions are fair. Further, because Delaware law seeks to protect minority investors, major corporate transactions with controlling stockholders are subject to this searching fairness review even if procedural protections have been put in place.\n\nThe Duty of Loyalty isn't about making sure that everything you do in your life is good for the company, and you never do anything that could hurt the company's profits in any way, ever. It mostly has to do with conflicts of interest, and also not acting in illegal ways.\n\nYou can't just find one sentence and interpret it incredibly broadly, completely out of context, and think that's a convincing argument. I'd your really think that Delaware courts would rule against Musk in a situation like this, then just go find any precedent. Find any case where an officer did something in their personal lives that potentially affected the company's profits, was sued by a shareholder and a court ruled in the shareholder's favor.

And apparently you agree with me that the example above isn't a good case? Because you just brought up a bunch of totally unrelated examples:\n\n> You don't think use of Tesla software engineering resources for Twitter code reviews is a conflict of interest?\n\nIt could be? If some shareholder wants to try and make that case, they could certainly try. But as long as engineers were getting paid by Twitter for their with there, and not by Tesla, I think it would be a tough case to make. Especially since Tesla has benefitted a lot from having employees work at both Tesla and SpaceX. I think it would be a tough case to make that any employee working at any other company ever is a clear breach of fiduciary duty. Again, it's possible that it would be, but it would depend on the facts of the individual situation. And that's obviously not what we were talking about in the tweet above\n\n> Violating the agreement with the SEC isn't illegal\n\nI feel like you're just saying random shit at this point? You're giving an example of something that Musk did wrong. A fiduciary duty to the company doesn't mean you can never do anything wrong personally, or do anything illegal personally or break any laws. Obviously an individual should follow the law, and should save consequences if they don't. But a fiduciary duty isn't a broad requirement to always do the right thing and never make mistakes or ever do anything illegal or immoral or whatever. It's a requirement mostly to avoid conflicts of interest in directing company decisions.\n\nThere's potentially some examples where that would apply to Musk?

It‚Äôs been three minutes. You can‚Äôt stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet.

The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide.  Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height.

Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth.

A vessel brimming with the liquid bullishness, as pungent as a hedge fund manager's tie on a bullish market day. This was a market not of stocks, bonds, or even Bitcoin, but of dreams, color-coded by the frequency of their consciousness waves. \n\nOnce, there was an avocado. Green and plump, as avocados often are, yet its heart yearned for bullishness. But you see, the avocado was trapped in a field of consciousness, a paradoxical meadow of half-formed thoughts and unfinished Sudoku puzzles. It dreamed, oh it dreamed, of bullfights and bullish markets, of bullish terriers chasing frisbees in the park.\n\nThe clock struck thirteen, a highly unusual occurrence unless you're in the grips of a Salvador Dali painting. Then suddenly, bullishness erupted. It had the face of a walrus but the agility of a hummingbird. Iridescent in its glee, it ran, nay, it pranced across the vast expanse of the consciousness field, leaving footprints that smelt oddly of daisies and newly minted coins.\n\nThe azure tree, or was it chartreuse, winked from the corner, its leaves aflutter with the rhythm of consciousness. It whispered tales of bullish market runs and meandering consciousness streams. Tales from when the sun was but a blushing maiden, and the moon, a cheeky lad.\n\nAmid this swirl of consciousness and bullishness, our avocado, our humble, green friend found its calling. It became the first avocado to run a hedge fund, dealing in stocks of dreams and futures of imagination. Yet, despite its newfound bullishness, it would always remember the sweet, serene chaos of the consciousness field.\n\nSo, in this land of unfettered dreams, where consciousness and bullishness frolic under the crimson sun, the narrative continues to meander. A symphony of words that tumbles like a giggling brook, full of mirth and absolute, unequivocal incoherence. But isn't that life? A nonsensical narrative of consciousness fueled by the bullishness of existence?
