But by mid-2022, it said it had over overestimated growth levels and laid off 10% of its workforce in July.\n\nAs the e-commerce boom brought by the global pandemic subsides, Shopify's spending in the fulfillment network has been more closely scrutinized by investors who worry the capital-intensive project could weigh on earnings.\n\nThe sale of the logistics unit Deliverr Inc, a company it acquired for $2.1 billion less than a year ago, was done in an all-stock deal that will give Shopify a 13% stake in Flexport - a startup in which it has made a previous investment.\n\nRevenue was $1.51 billion in the quarter ended March 31, topping analysts' estimates of $1.43 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe company also posted a surprise adjusted profit of 1 cent per share, compared with expectations for a 4 cent loss.", "id": "137ivsm", "created_utc": 1683202652.0, "score": 662, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 173, "comments": [{"body": "\"Beats earnings\", \"announces layoffs\" - 2023 in a nutshell.", "score": 936, "replies": [{"body": "“We’re doing great, but these pesky employees are weighing us down”", "score": 363, "replies": [{"body": "employees are our most valuable assets tahts why we cant afford them anymore.", "score": 44, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can’t think of a tech company that isn’t over staffed.

And based on those results you would refine your search, and Google would again learn from your behavior... until at some point you got your perfect results each time.\n\nOh and this profile that it built... it sold it to advertisers. Without your consent. They still do it today btw.\n\nI'm not negating that it was revolutionary. Just that it wasn't revolutionary in the sense you think it is.

Even today most people think of Google as a search company, when it fact it's been an advertising company since 2000.\n\nHere's a quote from Sergey Brin but you can find more of this stuff if you look for it. [Link to the full document](https://dokumen.pub/in-the-plex-how-google-thinks-works-and-shapes-our-lives-1nbsped-1416596585-9781416596585.html)\n\n> “Honestly, when we were still in the dot-com boom days, I felt like a schmuck. I had an Internet start-up—so did everybody else. It was unprofitable, like everybody else’s, and how hard is that? But when we became profitable, I felt like we had built a real business.” Best of all was that Google, against all odds, was making that profit without surrendering its ideals. “Do you know the most common feedback, honestly?” Brin asked. “It’s ‘What ads’?  People either haven’t done searches that bring them up or haven’t noticed them. Or the third possibility is that they brought up the ads and they did notice them and they forgot about them, which I think is the most likely scenario.” \n>\n> (This would track with an experiment that Google repeated regularly—the “no ads” test that compared users who saw ads with those served results pages free of sponsored links. Every time the test was run, the outcome was similar: dropping ads did not increase searching. More often than not, the users in the control group who continued to see ads searched more than those with ad-free pages. Google’s relieved conclusion: its ads made people happy.) From that point on, Brin and Page saw nothing but glory in the bottom line. Google was profitable, and its hiding strategy was successfully masking the extent of its success. Its name was synonymous with search. The Wall Street Journal’s famous tech critic Walt Mossberg called it “the most useful site on the World Wide Web.” Everyone was asking the founders when they would have an IPO, but “it’s not an issue for us,” Page said in 2002. “Every month we make more money than the last one.”", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "All of them do eff all realistically is what the poster was implying.

Gleichzeitig mehrt sich aber regional die Auswahl bei den Varianten von Model 3 und Model Y. In den USA [verkauft Tesla seit kurzem ein Model Y AWD mit den eigenen 4680-Batterien](https://teslamag.de/news/tesla-us-preise-sinken-model-y-4680-akku-konfigurator-57767), und nach Kanada kommt neuerdings die Basis-Variante dieses Elektroautos aus China. Europäische Business-Kunden können zudem [das Model 3 mit großem Akku und Hinterrad-Antrieb bestellen](https://teslamag.de/news/exklusiv-tesla-business-kunden-europa-model-3-heckantrieb-grosser-akku-57877). Und in Deutschland hat nach Informationen von teslamag.de die Produktion einer weiteren Version des Model Y begonnen.\n\n### Kleines Tesla Model Y mit BYD-Akku\n\nIm Tesla-Konfigurator für Europa ist ein [Model Y ohne Zusatz-Bezeichnung bereits seit vergangenem August](https://teslamag.de/news/tesla-model-y-als-basis-version-neu-in-europa-konfigurator-lieferung-noch-2022-moeglich-52087) zu finden (s. Foto oben vor den Preis-Senkungen 2023). Es ist wie das kleinste Model 3 mit Heckantrieb und einem LFP-Akku von CATL aus China ausgestattet und wird bislang aus der Gigafactory in dem Land exportiert. Jedoch wurde schon länger damit gerechnet, dass die Produktion auch dieser Version in der deutschen Tesla-Fabrik beginnt. Wie aus sicheren Quellen zu erfahren war, ist es jetzt tatsächlich so weit: Seit dieser Woche wird in Grünheide auch das kleinste Model Y regulär produziert.\n\nWie eigentlich für das deutsche Model Y von Anfang an geplant, wird bei dieser Version auch das vordere Rahmen-Element mit Giga-Pressen an einem Stück produziert. Bei dieser Bauweise, die Tesla dann zuerst beim Model Y AWD aus der Gigafactory in Texas einsetzte, wird das Akku-Paket zum Teil der tragenden Struktur und wird deshalb auch als „strukturell“ bezeichnet. [Tesla-CEO Elon Musk bezeichnet das als Revolution im Fahrzeugbau](https://teslamag.de/news/bericht-batterien-deutsches-model-y-anfangs-china-revolution-verschoben-31645). Die Akkus für das deutsche Model Y RWD sollen allerdings vorerst nicht von Tesla selbst produziert werden, sondern von BYD in China.\n\nDamit kommt neben Panasonic, LG Energy Solutions und CATL ein vierter Batterie-Lieferant für Tesla ins Spiel. Gerüchte darüber gab es bereits mehrfach, und im vergangenen August erfuhr teslamag.de, dass Tesla eine europäische [Typ-Genehmigung für ein Model Y mit „strukturellem“ LFP-Akku von BYD](https://teslamag.de/news/exklusiv-tesla-eu-genehmigung-model-y-strukturellem-akku-byd-51652) beantragt und bekommen hat. Die Angaben dazu lauteten 55 Kilowattstunden Akku-Kapazität und 440 Kilometer WLTP-Reichweite, was etwas unter den Werten für das kleine Model Y aus China mit dem CATL-Akku liegt. Als WLTP-Reichweite dafür gibt Tesla derzeit 455 Kilometer mit den Standard-Felgen und 430 Kilometer auf 20 Zoll an.\n\n### 4 Giga-Pressen in deutscher Gigafactory\n\nPassend zum jetzt vorerst inoffiziell bestätigten Start der Produktion mit BYD-Akku sowie Heck- wie Front-Guss stellten [Mitglieder von Tesla-Clubs bei Besuchen der deutschen Gigafactory](https://teslamag.de/news/musk-mutter-clubs-berater-fuehrung-deutsche-tesla-fabrik-58203) im April fest, dass dort bereits eine der Giga-Pressen in Betrieb ist, die für vordere Elemente des Model Y vorgesehen ist; weitere drei sollten Heck-Teile aus einem Guss produzieren und noch einmal zwei vorbereitet werden. Insgesamt sind laut den Plänen acht der riesigen Druckguss-Maschinen für die deutsche Tesla-Fabrik geplant. Auch 4680-Batterien sollen in einem dafür errichteten Gebäude vor Ort produziert werden, doch weil die Förderung in den USA höher und umkomplizierter ist, hat [Tesla Maschinen und Personal dafür nach Texas verschoben](https://teslamag.de/news/tesla-minister-deutsche-batterie-fabrik-brummt-kein-ausbau-antrag-56715).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not sure how much this source can be trusted tough.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "It's fall from PM is only luring me into a false sense of security.
