There is the old adage of invest in what you know in.  I agree most books and financial planners will agree with your statement. Hell I had them telling me the same thing for over a decade.\n\nI worked for a wholesale/retail company.  Started as lowly SrAcct after five years in audit at KPMG.  Started  wholesale company in ‚Äò92 and we went public in ‚Äò93. I bought 1,000 ipo shares at $7.50 or $7,500.  Would have bought more, but that is all they let us participate in. \n\nCompany was doing $73M then.  I grew in company, led the retail division ( eventually 28% of company - was 0% when I started so I help it grow from ground up) from the financial side as VP Finance-Retail.  Company grew to over $3B with distribution and stores on every continent. With stock splits and growth that initial $7500 was worth about $650,000 when I left in 2013, 20 years after the ipo.  Now I bought in open market a couple times when we dipped hard like in ‚Äò08/09.   Received stock options which I held minimum of 7 years.  The option ranged from 500-1000 per year in most cases.  So not substantial unless in the C-suite.  \n\nI had visibility into daily sales of every store globally.  I had direct lines to CFO and President of Retail and talked frequently with international teams.  So I was dialed in.  I didn‚Äôt own anything else until about 2010.  \n\nBut when I left I sold everything. All of it.  I didn‚Äôt have the visibility any longer and part of reason for leaving was change was occurring. My tax bill was north of $500k that year. Never again, not even ever close again. I retired at 54 in 2017 after working in a venture capital company started by the original owner of the wholesale company. \n\nSo if you are involved enough to know, even if that is being able to discuss with higher ups, then it may be best to keep in a singular company or a majority.  Just depends on how dialed in you are to the current and future.  Hell we could only put 25% of 401k contribution into company stock and I did. When I left, it was 51% of my 401k balance as we grew twice the market rate.  Do note I reallocated it 100% and put into growth funds too, as soon as I departed. \n\nBut it is a fine line of truly having the pulse and just general knowledge.  I left at the peak but change was happening as I noted previously.  After all the splits etc we were at $125 ish when I sold everything in 2013 and it was the right decision to diversify then. I no longer had the visibility or the contacts.  \n\nSo you were right as well as the stock is now under $5, well I checked and damn it is under $3.  \n\nThe books and advice are general guidelines and likely apply to 95+% of employees of public companies.

Debt was incredibly cheap, the government was handing out money like candy, corporations and individuals alike were enjoying tax cuts, gas and diesel were very cheap, and we were clearing huge headwinds in terms of the economy slowly reopening. COVID and the associated lockdowns/slowdown in economic activity (at least, in people leaving the house to spend money) should have caused a large recession. Instead, the Fed and government built a massive economic bridge to carry us over the trough to essentially pretend the recession wasn't happening, and as reopening began the only way to go was up. \n\nThe economy was running on free debt, massive inflows to the stock market, cheap input costs in terms of fuel and commodities, and consumers flush with government money and and an urge to spend it. Compare that to now.\n\nThe inevitable result of this money supply expansion was massive inflation. While American companies were unable to produce goods and services for months, we substituted with imported products and the trade deficit opened wide. After reopening, American (and European) companies roared back with the help of cheap debt, but commodity, fuel and shipping prices began to soar, leasing to increases in prices. We saw modest GDP growth in exchange for a massive (>25%) money supply expansion, and the USD began to be challenged as the COVID-triggered flight to safety began to reverse and foreign holders found themselves sitting on a massive pile of dollars courtesy of our yawning trade deficit as inflation began to take off. (At this point, does it seem the Fed really cares about inflation, or were they primarily concerned about foreign outflows collapsing the Dollar's value in foreign exchange?) With interest rates nominally covering inflation now, the Fed may well have saved the Dollar, but at the expense of massively increasing the costs of debt loads acquired years ago.\n\nInput prices have retreated from the peak, but they're generally not dirt cheap, especially compared to where they were a few years ago. Corporations, consumers, and governments are sitting on a massive debt load acquired when debt was cheap, and it is growing much more expensive to manage. The reckoning is coming for those debts, and I believe it is only just starting. The American economy may be able to chug its way through this headwind, but without the accommodative environment that enabled the 2020-2021 bull run. Best case is modest growth for a few years, and the worst case is a massive recession. The stock market only keeps melting upward as the massive cash pile from the 2022 selloff tries to find a place to go. We won't see an accommodative environment or, likely, a Fed reversal, without a recession, so this bull run rests on a tenuous best-case thesis and could come crashing down at the slightest challenge.\n\nOnce we stop buying puts.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "There have been so many \"slight challenges\" the last 9 months:\n\n\\-fastest interest rate hiking\n\n\\-debt ceiling issue\n\n\\-CRE problems\n\n\\-banking crisis\n\n\\-high inflation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bottom was in back when inflation was 9.1%, probably going to be flat or move up slowly rather than a full on recession.
