Do you have a video showing how they're controlling it when it's walking around or interacting with its surroundings? I understand that the autonomy might be really basic or heavily restricted but it looks to me like it's got some level of autonomy.\n\nThe efficiency of a humanoid bot isn't in the way that it interacts with objects, it's in the manufacturability of the bot. If you want the bots to cost $10,000 each then you have to be able to manufacture millions of them. In order to manufacture millions of them they need to be able to perform many different types of tasks. Because the world has been, for the most part, built for humans, the best form factor for a general purpose robot is humanoid. The fact that you don't understand this kind of puts your whole entire anti-thesis on the bot into question. This is a critical feature of the bot to understand the vision. Obviously if you are designing a bot to put a rivet into metal then there are other more efficient form factors for that exact task. But you're missing the entire point of the bot. That rivet bot won't take out my garbage or pick weeds in my garden. And if I design a \"weeding bot\" that's going to cost $500,000 each.\n\nI think you're confusing \"being first\" with \"being innovative\".

They are focused on bringing the manufacturing costs down and the usability high.\n\nThe entire bot has been developed by Tesla. They are now creating all of their own motors and actuators that are purpose built for their tasks. They have created a photorealistic training environment that they can use to train the visual neural net in the bot. \n\nAgain, I have no idea what point you're trying to make. I think you're stuck on some idea that because Tesla didn't invent the concept of robots or AI that they haven't done anything impressive which is a dumb argument. The same thing could be said for current impressive large language models. Just because someone didn't invent something doesn't mean that their developments and rates of progress are not impressive. Henry Ford didn't invent the assembly line nor the automobile but the Model T was incredibly impressive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, your logic is analogous to the following: someone says \"Michael Phelps is a great swimmer\" and you respond with \"Ya well people have been swimming for thousands of years and many cultures have independently come up with the concept of swimming\".

Therefore, market makers have an incentive to buy or sell shares to drive the price to max pain.*\n\n*For example, let's say that a stock is trading at $100. There are 100,000 call options with a strike price of $100 and 100,000 put options with a strike price of $100.
