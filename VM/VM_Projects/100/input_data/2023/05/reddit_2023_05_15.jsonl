In my late 30's I devoured books on how the stock market worked to really understand the mechanics of how they function and history.  As my career took off and we had started buying rental properties there was not a lot left for buying stocks, but eventually I opened a Scottrade account to put some money in and started buying stocks.\n\nThe stocks did well and I was able to find some good companies to buy and collect dividends, then sell the shares when they gained value to slowly build the account.  In 2008-09 some of my stocks were underwater when I started using covered calls to collect some premiums from these unproductive shares.  I also had excess capital available to buy shares in companies like GE where the stock price had plummeted and I was able to buy a lot of shares in this blue chip company.  While this was a risk as GE had some exposure to the mortgage market, I saw them as a big conglomerate at a fire sale price.  Over the coming months and years the stock price recovered where I made a substantial profit.  I learned through this the value of knowing the company very well and buying when a good stock is on sale due to larger market forces.  \n\nLearning covered calls was easy and I found out that selling cash secured puts could result in profits without owning the shares which started my interest in the wheel strategy (although I didn't know it was called that at the time).    \n\nI don't think there is any training that covers it all and can take into account your goals, style, suitable strategies, account size, and risk tolerance . . .  My suggestion is to start paper trading with some basic strategies like covered calls and selling puts on high quality stocks.  While nice to know all the greeks and the inner working of options, there is not that much to learn to effectively trade.  \n\nIt is easy to get overwhelmed learning all of the details of options when you may not need or use them.  Very few options traders use much in the way of technical analysis so going deep into charts and indicators is not required, especially to get started.  The idea any chart can tell you when to make the best or optimal trade is a fallacy IMO.   \n\nIMO start paper trading covered calls and spend your time learning about how to analyze stocks to trade will be very helpful to getting started with options.  This will be more helpful than taking entire courses that teach you things you may not understand until you have some real world experience.  \n\nThis is a very good overview of stock anlaysis - [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/09/become-your-own-stock-analyst.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/09/become-your-own-stock-analyst.asp)  \n\nThis is a good overview of covered calls - [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/covered-call.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/covered-call.asp)  \n\nIf you do want complete and structured training OIC has some of the best - [https://www.optionseducation.org/theoptionseducationcenter/occ-learning/](https://www.optionseducation.org/theoptionseducationcenter/occ-learning/) \n\nSwing trading is a hard way to be successful as it requires some timing of the markets.  I started thinking day or swing trading was the way to go and the most significant thing I learned quickly is no one can predict what the market will do.  When the market moves unexpectedly  this causes losses.  If it were me I'd wait to have enough capital to trade the wheel and spend this time developing your trading plan and stock selection processes.  As you may know, the stock being traded is the most critical part of the wheel and is the built-in hedge or risk management.\n\nLike many I was doing well trading my early version of the wheel, but was always looking for something better so I tried all different kinds of strategies.  Most losing money and being difficult to manage.  Since the wheel works best I started building a trading plan that has served me well for many years and is posted here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the\\_wheel\\_aka\\_triple\\_income\\_strategy\\_explained/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/) \n\nI'm not a pro, but do consider myself a \"full time\" trader even if trading only takes a few hours each week.  The online brokers along with trading the wheel using a trading process that allowed me to still work full time and trade.  Over the years as I was doing well with trading, and the rental properties had increased in value I sold them and used the capital to fund the trading account.  I've enjoyed the freedom to make money without having to go to an office or work a formal job so it is a laid back lifestyle.  \n\nSome key things to help you be a proficient and comfortable trader are to also know how much risk you have and be able to handle whatever happens.  If you are ever losing sleep or stressed in any way with trades, then you are doing something wrong.  This stress leads to emotional decisions that often cause losses.  \n\nMaking and refining your trading plan is key.  I post a lot that the difference between a successful and unsuccessful trader is the success one has a well thought out and documented trading plan they follow.  If you're having unexpected or unforeseen losses then stop trading and refine your plan.  Mine took a good 2 years to dial in as you see it in the link above and as you will note I've even made adjustments to it over time and continue to look at ways it could be better so will never be finished.  \n\nBack to emotional trading it was a key inflection point for me when I read **Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas** and I strongly recommend you read and digest it as soon as possible.  It may have been a number of things coming together all at the same time, but soon after reading this book and putting what I learned into action my results improved and I've stayed profitable.\n\nTwo last things.  One is you will need capital to make a decent return.  Think about an average of a 15% as a benchmark return most knowledgeable traders with 2 years of experience can reasonably achieve.  This would be about $15K on a $100K account in this example.  Want to make $100K per year in trading profits will take a substantial 6 figure account.  Some traders can do better than 15%, but this is often not consistent with some years being higher and other years being lower.   \n\nAny ideas you have starting with $5K and turning that into $100K in less than 10 to 20 years just through options trading should be quickly dismissed.  You'll need to save or find a way to add significant capital depending on what your goals are.\n\nThe last thing is to paper trade to both learn and set-up a good powerful broker platform (I use TOS) as well as learn and dial in your trading plan for whatever strategies you wish to trade.  Unfortunately, paper won't give real prices or returns since it is a sim, but the practice will help you learn the tools and strategies to dial in your trading plan.  \n\nMy last comment would be to start simple and don't think you have to learn all there is to know about options to trade the simple basic strategies like CCs and CSPs.  Picking good stocks to trade along with even the basics of options such as using delta for probabilities and understanding theta decay ramps up in the last 60 days, meaning opening 30-45 dte is considered the sweet spot, avoiding earnings reports, and closing at a 50% profit are good practices.  Then, along with fully and clearly recognizing how much risk is at play (what is the worst that could happen?) are the things that most find important starting out.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Wow thank you", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> First, I’m particularly interested in your story of how you first started trading?\n\nWhy?

If you are in the Central or Eastern timezones in the US and work 9 to 5, this will be tough, since your work hours mostly overlap with the market hours. Even if you have a timezone or work shift advantage, you may have demands on your time that constantly interrupt you or distract you. \n\nThe ideal is to have at least 30 minutes of uninterrupted time every day within the first half of the market session. If you can't manage 30 minutes contiguous, that's fine. Breaking it up into 10 minute or 15 minute segments during work breaks can work.\n\nJust understand that the more you have to compromise on that ideal, the more limits you place on your degrees of freedom in how you trade. If you only can look at the market during breaks and you only get three breaks a day, including lunch, you shouldn't be day trading and you shouldn't be doing trades that require perfect entry/exit timing to the split second, like 0 DTE.

{"title": "EU approves Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, clearing major hurdle", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-activision-deal-eu-approves-takeover-of-call-of-duty-maker.html\n\nEuropean Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.\n\nThe EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.\n\nMicrosoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes.", "id": "13ia8cg", "created_utc": 1684161583.0, "score": 2231, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 302, "comments": [{"body": "Microsoft Excel Loot Crates confirmed", "score": 711, "replies": [{"body": "Clippy skins", "score": 157, "replies": [{"body": "Wait, I unironically want that!", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "I think Clippy had a few skins?

The \"promise\" is the problem. \n\nIt's about whether behaviour remedies are sufficient to address regulator concerns. The EU regulator has similar concerns about cloud gaming, but it accepts behavioural remedies (e.g the promise to support all platforms).\n\nWhereas the CMA has recently evolved it's thinking again and it doesn't think behavioural remedies are enough anymore, there needs to be structural remedies. I.e. they are not interested in monitoring if Microsoft is doing every thing it promised. In 2019 two reports came out basically saying previous behavioural remedies especially for digital/tech mergers were under enforced. They promised things they didn't do and no one bothered stopping them\n\nThis is from a speech by the head of the CMA earlier this year. \n\n>On behavioural remedies, we have been clear that the bar to show that such a remedy can address a competition concern is high, for 2 reasons.\n\n>First, a behavioural remedy does not typically address the underlying causes of the competition concerns identified by the CMA - instead it seeks to manage market outcomes by controlling the behaviour of the merged entity for a period of time. As such, it may involve arrangements that the parties would not enter into under normal commercial circumstances. And once the remedy expires, the underlying causes of the concern may remain and then have a significant effect on competition.\nSecond, even where a behavioural remedy might in theory be capable of restoring competitive outcomes in a market, there are many practical challenges to designing an effective behavioural remedy.\nThese concerns are not theoretical – they are supported by case study research.[8] One particular challenge is that a remedy can become ineffective or be circumvented as market conditions change, particularly in a sector where technology or business models are changing quickly. Another is that the monitoring and implementation of behavioural remedies can be very challenging, particularly given that there are information asymmetries between suppliers and customers.\n\n>Some of these difficulties can be mitigated, of course, by the use of mechanisms such as monitoring trustees or fast-track arbitration. But if those mechanisms aren’t effective, the remedy will fail to work properly, or the CMA may end up in the role of a referee in a market for an extended period of time.

Additionally,  how do you think this will effect the next largest company, EA, which would now be in competition with a company that dwarfs its output two times over?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Will it not come down to who makes a better game?

Worldwide there are around a dozen viable competitors.  So essentially we're saying let's let US companies combine, heading towards monopolies because this is the best way to compete internationally?  Additionally there are vertical monopolies, which history shows doesn't work well for the consumer.  They're promising they won't restrict software to their platform.  Ok, and once the merger goes through and they do?  We hit them with a tiny fine?", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Absolutely absurd to act like the UK should have any say in the size of another country's company.  They're a dying empire they don't rule the world anymore the US isn't one of their colonies that they get to tell what to do.  Not to mention the monopoly argument is kind of stupid here since this purchase is only making the console market MORE competitive since it's helping Xbox be able to compete at the same level as the other two companies (who are way ahead right now) so that those two companies have to work harder to please consumers in order to hold onto their current market share.

They should actually have logical and ethical reasoning behind it. Like imagine if Japan had stricken down the deal because they want Xbox to be in a weaker position since the other two major players are both Japanese companies that they want to see grow stronger.  They have the right to do that but it's a gross abuse of power.  Why are you acting like we can't call that out?\n\nThe CMA claims they're blocking this deal over how it will affect Cloud Gaming in the UK.  Let me repeat, they are blocking a $69 Billion dollar deal over a market so small that Xbox has a cloud gaming server capacity of less than 5000 devices in a country of almost 70 million people.  It's obvious bullshit.  The CMA just wants to flex their newfound power post-Brexit (no longer being beholden to the EU) and are also doing this for philosophical reasons as opposed to the good of their people; frankly given how biased they were right from the start it wouldn't even surprise me if they were also being lobbied behind the scenes.  By the end of this ordeal basically every country in the world is going to approve it except for them (unless they end up backing off).

Microsoft doesn't absolutely need to acquire ABK, it doesn't really matter. But the potential for a monopoly in cloud gaming, which Microsoft has indicated they are going all in on, would be extremely damaging to the consumer so the regulators are trying to prevent that from happening. \n\nI think the regulators at the CMA and the EU, who both agree about the cloud gaming monopoly, know more about this and have more reasonable takes, than some random redditors. \n\nYour point about Japan makes no sense as the uk has little in the way of massive gaming companies. The big three are Sony xbox and Nintendo, none of which are uk companies so I don't know what point you're trying to make there.\n\nWhy do you think this deal is going to be good for consumers? Are you a gamer? It honestly just sounds like you want the companies to merge cos more games or something.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Monopolies are bad for consumers, so why are you pushing so hard for one? Right now Sony is absolutely dominating the high end console market (riding on their overwhelming success from the previous generation) and as a result they've been able to get away with working a lot less hard to please consumers and it has had a noticeably negative impact on consumers.  Allowing Xbox to increase their IP / Developer roster through this deal increases the likelihood that they're able to compete on even footing with Sony thus resulting in a fiercer fight to hold onto industry market share which let me once again emphasize is good for consumers.\n\nIt's absolutely absurd to act like anytime a company gets bigger it automatically means monopoly, you WANT underdog companies to get bigger.  Anti-Trust laws aren't about keeping companies small, they're ensuring fervent competition since generally the fiercer the competition the greater consumers prosper.  And the Console Market is the real concern here, NOT the Cloud market despite what some regulators claim.  I've already stated how small it is, and any future it has is FAR off like several decades (these weak ten year deals won't do crap).  Besides these extra games would have virtually zero impact on how strong a presence Microsoft will have in the market, the issue here is that Amazon and Google (who can match Microsoft's server infrastructure) have little expertise on Gaming within their companies to properly compete, and Sony and Nintendo don't have the server infrastructure to compete.\n\nIn regards to the EU agreeing with their concerns, to some degree but they clearly didn't consider it that big of a concern considering how small the concessions were that they asked for.   Also you're acting like holding a high position in government automatically means someone is qualified to pass judgment in some completely unrelated field.  They have to make a guess based off the information they're presented and that's if they can even properly take in the information (which clearly they haven't fully been able to do). These people are old and out of touch, there are some concepts you can try to explain to an old person and no matter how many times you do it just doesn't get through to them due to them simply not growing up in the proper era surrounded by the subject matter.   They are also unelected and working in government, often that's because these kinds of people were too incompetent to actually make it in the private sector or to win a vote.  Finally they have shown a gross misunderstanding of the industry at many different points throughout this whole ordeal.  By your logic if for example women complain about some archaic abortion ruling a bunch of 80 year old men make in congress, I can just go well given their position I'm sure they know more about this than a bunch of random women on Reddit.

Regulators in the UK are generally quite separate from the government. Often people in the regulators are heavily involved in the industry they are regulating and your claim that it's people too incompetent to work in industry is just utterly nuts conjecture.\n\nYour entire viewpoint is so heavily based on biased viewpoints with zero evidence. The notion that the workers were too incompetent to work in industry, the notion that the cma is full of old people uninvolved in the industry, that Microsoft is somehow an underdog and them acquiring a huge publisher would only put them on even footing with Sony.\n\nXbox already has vastly more resources than PlayStation. They have more studios but they squander everything they have. Microsoft does not need an acquisition to compete with Sony, it needs to restructure xbox because they've thrown away so many hard hitting IPs like Halo and gears of war. They have no really successful recent big games despite having so many more studios than Sony.\n\nAn acquisition is absolutely not required for xbox to compete.

For example you can be an expert in for example law but that doesn't mean you're an expert on all types of law or even well versed in them or even good at grasping them.\n\nThe CMA is technically Independent but let's be real here not really there's plenty of cross over in the people working there and also the government can absolutely mess around with their process hence the recent talk about the PM working on applying pressure on them.  Also what I said about government workers absolutely holds true.\n\nAlso what do you mean \"so many more studios\".  A measly four more (23 compared to 19) is so many lmao?  Also size and quality matters a lot.  Also there's non-owned partner studios that play a big role too.  Also obviously Xbox has other ways of catching up (Game Pass is probably the only reason they're even still able to compete in the race) and is clearly run worse than Sony but acquiring more studios is a valid tactic of competing.

There’s plenty of speculation that because he placed such a large bet on baht, Soros helped engineer the Asian crisis via his political connections. Yet Soros wasn’t the biggest single speculator to hold a position against the currency. Julian Robertson’s Tiger Fund had three times the exposure of Soros with almost $3 billion bet against the baht. If anything, Julian Robertson would have been more motivated to engineer Thailand's decline.\n\n> In an attempt to resist devaluation, the Bank of Thailand, purchased baht with dollars in the foreign exchange market, raised interest rates and restricted foreigners access to baht during the first few months. All of these measures decimated the bank’s credibility.\n\n> The central bank’s comedy of errors only served to attract more hedge funds to speculate against the baht.

Stock markets across asia took a beating and some stock markets were even suspended or closed. Malaysia stopped the contagion by pegging the Ringgit to the US dollar, which played hell with trade and exports for a while. There was a bitter war of words between the malaysian prime minister Mahatir Mohammed and Soros, but by that time the main damage was done already.

I’d prefer more direct action outlined, definitely. But what it says is pretty common-sense. Your statement makes it clear that you think “not prosecuting” means letting all crime run wild. I don’t see any evidence that anyone is doing that or wants that, though I’m sure Fox News can tell you all about it if you want. But prosecuting some things is obviously a total waste of time and everyone knows it. It’s also true that murders are trending higher in places where prosecutors are supposedly “tough on crime”, so that’s not helpful. \n\nHe argues that poverty should not be considered criminal and that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. I agree with all of that. Those are all crimes I’d rather a DA not prosecute.\n\nI don’t wish to make any assumptions about which DA who refuses to prosecute which crimes you are referring to. I will say that the current NY mayor is a joke, I didn’t vote for him, I would never have voted for him, I think he’s utterly unfit for the job, and he should be thrown out. But certainly not because of his policy (I think it’s a policy) of not prosecuting drug users. I think he’s just got a case of the ol’ no-brain. \n\nAnd besides, can’t people vote for who they want? He’s only bankrolling them; I think if people have an issue with a candidate’s policy, they could vote for his opponent, right?\n\nI want to see people incarcerated for murder, sexual offense, fraud, abuse, gun trafficking, etc. and for things like industrial sabotage, malfeasance, scams, oversight of abusive policies, large-scale pollution or misuse of funds  — committing real, tangible crimes, where there’s a victim and a perpetrator and intent — and not for things like being a drug addict or for being homeless. \n\nI don’t believe prison solves most problems because the goal is not rehabilitation but rather reincarceration - as the prison *benefits financially from having more prisoners*. (They get $50k a year per inmate from DC - more than most prisoners lived on in their real lives — and the prison also gets free unpaid labor from the same inmate, which is slavery with extra steps.) That the goal is to keep people in prison, and not to help them be better at living in society, is a huge issue. We make it very difficult for people to ever have a normal life again after prison. They’re in a position where they’re vastly more likely to re-offend because they have nothing, finding work is 100x harder, and fewer people will help them. That’s not to say all prisoners deserve a soft landing, because many don’t, but many shouldn’t have been in prison at all. \n\nNot to mention, $50k a year is more than I usually pay in taxes. I hate to see a MULTIPLE of my annual tax bill going to waste on a single person like that, when it could do so many better things that benefit many people. \n\nI also don’t think we should have private prisons at all, I don’t think unpaid prison labor should be allowed, and I think taking away voting rights from felons is incredibly Orwellian. It sounds like by incarcerating fewer people, we would be able to prevent some people from losing their constitutional right to vote, and prevent more institutionalized slavery, which I also support. \n\nIn terms of actual fixes, he says to spend more money on youth outreach and prison education and using mental health professionals in crisis situations to avoid throwing people in jail for “resisting arrest” when they’re, idk, catatonic or having a psychotic break or whatever. That’s obvious common sense and very overdue. Police are largely pretty bad at interacting with the (able-bodied) public on a good day. They don’t need to be fighting with someone who thinks their skin is full of beetles and is hearing the voice of Number Six from Battlestar Galactica and thinks the squad car is going to eat them.

{"title": "How and why OIL is being used to slap the VIX", "selftext": "Had a lot of questions about how OIL is being used to compress the VIX.  I will attempt to explain in terms I understand.  DM me if you want a technical explanation and I will send you over to TWTR.\n\nThesis: Oil is one of the tools being used intraday to compress the VIX.  Central banks use various oil contracts intraday to control the VIX (but its only one tool; others are USD and the new VIX ETFs - SVIX, UVIX, etc. and the 1dte VIX options).\n\nI am not a graphic designer so excuse the simplicity of the following but I like to keeps things simple.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hswp3wamm10b1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=531e32c068c03f778e3bd455434081afd9da4d65\n\n# Suppress Oil and suppress VIX - easy to see.\n\n# In the above its easy to see why Oil is so important.\n\n* If the Fed wants to support the market, it must lower inflation.\n* To lower inflation, it must keep oil low.\n* If it can keep Oil low, inflation stays low, interest rates stay low, the VIX stays low and the market goes up.\n\n# The Fed has a problem:\n\n* Inflation has been rising, and I dont care what the Fed says because I see it food prices, mortgage rates, everything.\n* Rates have been RISING.\n* The way to lower inflation is for the Fed to PULL money out of the system.\n* BUT THE FED HAS BEEN INJECTING LIQUIDTY TO PREVENT THE COLLAPSE OF BANKS.  This is seen by the growth of the Fed's balance sheet:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz11l2i4i10b1.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c66b09c228077377ae11c091939c86702b1a23a\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet grows when among other things, they lend more money to banks via the Discount Window.  They can do other things but this is the primary way.\n\nHere's the problem and its simple supply and demand:\n\n# When there are more dollars (liquidity) chasing the same amount of product, the prices of the products rise (inflation).\n\n# THEREFORE: the Fed should be pulling liquidity not adding if they are worried about inflation.  But they are not.  Why?????\n\nThese are the reasons:\n\n1. If they pull liquidity then banks balance sheets will worsen and more banks will fail.\n2. If more banks fail, then economies and countries will worsen.  Credit Suisse??\n3. If countries fail, then the US has much less control over how those countries behave.\n4. And if countries and banks fail, then the bankers behind both make a lot less money, or in some countries, they go to jail.\n5. If bankers go to jail, politicians at the very least dont get reelected and at worse, they die.\n\n# Ok, so now that we have the relationships and the possible outcomes, how does the Fed monkey hammer the oil market down???\n\n**First, look at this chart.  The purple is the VIX.  The bars are oil.  Here's the last couple of months.  When Oil goes down, VIX for some reason goes down.  Pretty easy to see.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wng8og3xo10b1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb64b014845d2d5d853a2a8239d401baf917b825\n\nIf the VIX goes up:\n\n* Rates go up = BAD\n* Market goes down = BADDER\n\n# HOW ARE THEY DOING THIS?\n\n1. Well the release from the SPR helped but there is only so much oil in SPR.\n2. Through the oil futures market\n3. Through the oil options market\n4. Through the oil spot prices\n5. With help from its friends Japan, Europe, the devil (JPM), etc. <--- they also use #2-4 to assist.\n\nThere you go.  An oversimplified explanation how oil is being used to suppress the VIX and why keeping the VIX low is so important.\n\nOf course, as I shared, the Fed has many more tools to compress the VIX which supports the market.\n\n* The Fed ~~can print more money~~  **can pull liquidity (CORRECTED - thankyou** u/animalturds**)**  from the system which has the effect of lowering interest rates which is deflationary. Less dollars chasing the same products forces the product prices down.\n* The Fed can lend less money to banks - WAIT, NO THEY CANT BC THE BANKS WILL FAIL.  HAHAHA - Fed is stuck.\n* The Fed can let the VIX rise and let the market fall, which is very devaluing.  NOPE, CANNOT DO THIS BC BANKS WILL FAIL.\n\nThe Fed is playing whack a mole - my bet is that sooner than later they fail.\n\n# Bottomline: The Fed is stuck between supporting our economy, THEIR JOB, and saving banks that shouldn't have been saved in 2008 - $CS et al.  They are trying to do both but at the end of the day, they know if they let more BIG banks fail, then everything gets much worse.  Remember that Credit Suisse has $17 Trillion in derivatives.  If they fail, game over.\n\n***FINAL: I havent been able to answer all the comments from my last post.

I believe the Fed is doing what they can with the very, very limited tools they have to fight inflation (monetary policy alone without fiscal policy is not as powerful). My personal belief on what rates have been rising and inflation is persistent is because we are unwinding decades of globalization due to covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Globalization was a deflationary boon for decades and now that unwinding coupled with trying to unwind the quantitative easing Bernanke unleashed following the GFC is creating a perfect storm for sticky inflation.\n\nBack to the topic, I don’t think the Fed cares much about VIX. Also, I do not believe credit markets care much about VIX right now either. Deposit flight and quality of loans, including commercial real estate loans, are what’s driving yields coming out of debt markets. The market is asking itself currently, what is the appropriate high yield spread over treasuries? What is the value of office properties, of which have large maturities looming over the next ~24 months? Questions remaining unanswered, market participants moved to the sidelines. You can see this in CMBS trading volumes, which have cratered.\n\nYour Oil-yields-VIX linkage I think was (1) never really established in your post and (2) even if it was, I’m going to say is not the best explanation for what is happening in markets today.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Did you not see my Star Wars special effects worthy graphic?\n\nHigher VIX correlates with higher yields.\n\nHigher Yields correlates with higher inflation\n\nHigher inflation correlates with higher price of oil, which is a regressive tax btw.\n\nTherefore, if you want to supress inflation-yields-VIX you suppress oil.  Look, I am not saying its perfect but when I see immediate moves in the VIX after oil getting hammered, almost daily, then yeah, something is going on.  It is the best explanation I can come up with.  The added bonus is a low VIX supports the stock market which the Fed most definitely doesn't want to go down.\n\nThe huge drop in CMBS = I think we agree.  Falling property values, crashing is more like it, and forced refinances at much higher rates has contributed to the fall in CMBS activity.  But the real issue is no new issues really because no new building bc why build when you can buy much cheaper?\n\nGlobalization: thats pretty broad so I dont understand the reference.\n\nThe GFC: the banks got easy money which they were supposed to lend out.  they didnt and instead they put it into the market.  The Fed is going to have a lot of problem unwinding that without the entire asset class dropping, doing the unwind for them, no?\n\nInflation: until the Fed removes liquidity it will persist, or get worse.  Bank failures put them in a tough spot.  Its not all their fault anyway since I dont remember them pushing Covid bucks for all.  They are partly cleaning up the mess of Trump and Covid.\n\nAs for whats happening in the markets today - I am all ears, why do you think the VIX doesnt move?  Something is keeping it down.

I saw your graphic, it establishes correlation sure but your argument requires proving out the causal mechanisms you have laid out.\n\nI don’t believe the Fed cares about where the stock market is at. Their mandate is (1) keep unemployment low and (2) keep inflation low.\n\nThe drop in CMBS activity is because typical buyers of CMBS paper are sitting on the sidelines. CMBS is a tool for lenders to lend more than what their balance sheet can support and no lender is taking the risk today assembling a loan that they will not be able to offload into the market. Borrowers and sponsors are the forever optimists, they will borrow if you let them. CMBS is also not only used on new buildings, it’s primarily used on asset trophies because their valuations are too large for a lender to keep that loan on their books.\n\nGlobalization is in reference to supply chains being moved offshore for cheaper labor and the push towards just-in-time inventory management. Major cost savings, but the drive for efficiency created a complex system which was brittle. Covid and the Russian invasion created huge ruptures. Companies are solving by bringing manufacturing back to their local markets where the goods will be sold (i.e., the U.S.) as well as hoarding more inventory moving away from just-in-time. Toyota is the automobile example, they hoarded semiconductors when Ford didn’t. During the semiconductor shortage, Toyota faired better. Folks took it as a lesson that they need redundancy engineered into supply chains - this coupled with the inefficiency of reorganizing supply chains away from being labor cost optimized is creating increased costs and shortages of goods. Both inflationary and both trends I am arguing will persist.\n\nQE following GFC was not only to create liquidity for banks to lend out. It was also to address bank runs. Everyone was panic selling paper and the argument was these loans were good, it’s just everyone wanted to trade loans for cash today out of fear. The Fed used their balance sheet to allow folks to trade loans for cash with the belief the loans will ultimately pay off. That turned out to be true, but what did not happen was the Fed never increased rates and the Fed never began to shrink their balance sheet. The Fed continued to use interest collect on the paper they bought following the GFC and continued to buy new paper in the market (when the Fed stops buying paper, that’s QT). The Fed also never raised rates, Powell tried in 2019 and he he ultimately pivoted. Then covid happened, everyone is scared. The Fed deployed the same playbook as the GFC and starting buying more paper and grew their balance sheet even more. The Fed is at a position where either we face very painful, quick tightening or they implicitly say money doesn’t matter anymore.\n\nI agree, inflation is tough and I think the Fed paying for the sins of our parents. I believe the hope in the 20-teens was the U.S. economy would grow-away the problem, i.e., kick the can down the road.\n\nLastly, to be honest I don’t know and I do not follow public markets daily. Motivation for posting is giving folks who may come across this another perspective. My overall understanding of what is happening in public markets today are (1) they are priced as though a deal on the debt ceiling will be made and (2) the overall S&P is today more than ever heavily concentrated (due to market cap methodology) in your large tech stocks like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN (and I think Amazon is consumer discretionary so indices that track those companies are heavily influenced by Amazon). I think in today’s world, it’s first focusing on who are the largest buyers / sellers in those stocks and understanding their motivations. I can’t think of any large player having to rebalance their portfolio today, so unsure why today had downward pressure. Over the past 18 months, the public market has been “priced to perfection”, every piece of news pushed stock prices whether or not the news impacts the fundamentals of the underlying company.

The CPI is an unbiased metric for measuring inflation, it’s a very credible source, that’s why CPI numbers move the market because everyone knows it’s trustworthy. \n\nThere’s also this bullshit that he thinks an increase in the fed balance sheet directly correlates with inflation. FUCKING STUPID. You need to compare the types of increases in the balance sheet. For example, the Covid increases went to regular people thus having a huge inflationary effect. In comparison, the fed lending program is injecting money that will be tied up in the banking system. This will not have the same inflationary effect since lending standards have risen and there is a credit crunch. There’s no evidence this lent money will trickle down to everyday people in a way that would material impact inflation. \n\nOk there’s so much more BS I could write about, but those are just a few examples of why this guy is a REGARD.
