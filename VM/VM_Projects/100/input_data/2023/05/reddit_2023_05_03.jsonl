Arguably their main job is to prevent bank runs and ensure the credibility of the banking system. So to your point that it's not the Fed's problem that banks are failing, yes it is. It's their job to regulate the banks and it's their job to provide liquidity to the banking system. And I'd argue it's even more their problem today since they caused the mispricing of bonds with QE which is what's causing these bank failures. \n\nOf course, the Fed also has their \"dual mandate\" in which they need to try to balance interest rates with employment and price stability. That is unless they decide inflation is fine and continue to pump the economy with trillions of QE, like they did in 2021 before suddenly changing their minds and smashing the breaks from full throttle with the most aggressive tightening cycle in history.\n\nWe know it takes a while for rate hikes to work their way through the economy and we know MoM inflation reads have already collapsed. Generally real yields of around 2-3% are sufficient to cool the economy and bring down inflation. Today we're somewhere around 2-4% (it depends on how you measure) suggesting the Fed probably needs to pause because financial conditions are likely already tight enough and the full impact of the most recent hikes has now even yet been felt. And that historic 2-3% real yield target is probably much lower today given our debt burden is so much higher today.\n\nYour point on historic interest rates is totally irrelevant. What the appropriate rate of interest is depends on the inflationary pressures in the economy. Interest rates have been low in recent years because the Fed has been struggling to meet their inflation target. There's a lot of reasons to believe this recent wave of inflation isn't because there is suddenly more structural inflation in the economy than there was pre-pandemic, but because the Fed created an asset and savings bubble in 2020 - 2021 which we are now paying for with temporally higher rates.\n\nWe now have to hope that the Fed doesn't over do it with monetary policy again and cause an unneeded economic crisis in their effort to bring down inflation.

I genuinely wasn't sure if the commenter was aware that it's the Fed's responsibility to maintain the stability of the US financial system given their comment. Although fair play for the snarky response back.\n\n>Yes buddy, that is the Feds job, and you would be out of your own pretentious mind if you don't understand or see how the Feds' job today is different than it was back in 1913. Are you aware of how the economy has changed, including the reduction of the number of banks from \\~18,000 to 4,500 now? Avoiding bank runs is at the bottom of priority of the Feds today compared to 1930.\n\nThis is your opinion. In my opinion the Fed views maintaining the stability of the financial system as one of their primary roles. We can disagree on nuances of their priorities, but at the very least what I am saying isn't that controversial.\n\n>Banks are well regulated considering the number of banks in the country, and again, the Feds didn't cause the collapse of the regional banks, the regional banks caused their own collapse by their poor risk management and funny business.\n\nI think it's very naive to argue that the Fed had no responsibility in the failure of several perviously well-respected regional banks on the back of their monetary policy decisions. I wouldn't go so far to say it's entirely their fault, but the interest rate volatility that caused these bank failures was largely their doing. The Fed themselves have also admitted the failure of SVB was partly due to a failure of regulation and Fed oversight.\n\nI think if it was just SVB that collapsed you could reasonably argue it was an isolated incident, but at this point not questioning why so many banks seem to have made the exact same mistakes as SVB would be unreasonable.\n\n>The fourth paragraph is really your personal opinion, which holds zero value since it is not even backed up by single data point\n\nSo on my \"the Fed probably needs to pause\" comment, I did give my reasoning in the previous paragraph. For clarity I'm looking at the 3-month annualised inflation numbers of CPI, PPI and PCE. And the comment around real yields needing to exceed inflation is just the Taylor rule.\n\nSo it's not really my personal opinion unless you believe my trust in the data and my belief in the Taylor rule is just my personal opinion or something. Although if that's the standard here, I'm not sure how I'd please you.\n\n>Low interest rates and loose rope enabled a lot of bad habits, and more importantly overflood the equity market with free money. The public been subsidizing Wall Street since 2009.\n\nI think we probably somewhat agree here. But in reality it's not that simple, because you would need to assume higher interest rates would have been better for the economy which is unlikely given you probably would have had deflation in such an event.\n\n>And again, only morons and Larry Summers think cutting interest rates in 2008 that fast, that low was the right decision.\n\nQuestioning my creditability while calling Larry Summers (and presumably all the economists that agree with him) morons is very bold, but you're entitled to your opinion. I don't mean that in a derogatory way either, it's just I think you would have a lot of explaining to do to justify your position here.\n\n>J Powell did excellent job in 2018 by getting ahead of the curve and raising interest rate despite the \"fake economy softening\" and \"listen to the market\" folks, which you clearly listen to all time because who cares about data?\n\nThe Fed was raising rates prior to 2018. Powell just continued until late 2018 when he realised he went too far and was forced to cut. I'm not sure I'd personally categorise this as an \"excellent job\", but I think what he did was reasonable.\n\n>Oh you mean the Feds created the bubble when they shut down businesses and official unemployment was coming at 13% with real unemployment coming close to 20%? The 3rd largest unemployment cycle in US history? Is that the bubble Feds created, or the problem JP solved?\n\nThe Fed created all of these problems by making lockdown policy viable. The lockdowns were funding by trillions in debt which the Fed enabled via low rates and QE. But I'm happy to give you this one because it's debatable and quite nuanced. It certainly wasn't just the Fed's fault.\n\n>\"unneeded economic crisis in their effort to bring down inflation.\" Do you hear yourself out? In which universe long stagflation is better than a temporary recession? Are you on the ground with common people?\n\nStagflation for who? As I've commented on before real wages for the poorest workers are now rising faster than inflation. Long-term stagflation is unstable and I'd argue it's not even possible without fiscal irresponsibility.\n\nAgain though these are nuanced points I'd need to argue in more depth than we can do here. I'd just leave this at a belief that rates are high enough to already address inflation and since I believe we've very likely won the battle on inflation I don't see the point in now risking an economic crisis.\n\n\\------\n\nAnyway, I appreciate the detailed reply.

However, based on the information I found online, I can give you some possible scenarios and estimates based on different sources and methods.\n\nOne source uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the intrinsic value of Tesla stock based on its future cash flows. According to this method, Tesla stock is worth $402.38 in 2028, assuming a 10% discount rate and a 20% annual growth rate in free cash flow. This implies a 149% increase from the current price of $161.81.\n\nAnother source uses a market share approach to estimate the potential revenue and earnings of Tesla based on its expected vehicle deliveries and margins. According to this method, Tesla could deliver 9.5 million vehicles in 2030, with an average selling price of $40,000 and a net margin of 10%. This implies a revenue of $380 billion and an earnings per share (EPS) of $36. Assuming a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, which is lower than its current P/E ratio of 53.493, Tesla stock could be worth $1,800 in 2030. Discounting this value back to 2028 using a 10% discount rate, Tesla stock could be worth $1,237.76. This implies a 665% increase from the current price of $161.81.\n\nA third source uses a consensus approach to estimate the average price target of Tesla stock based on the opinions of various analysts who cover the stock. According to this method, Tesla stock has a median target of $186.20 in the next 12 months, with a high estimate of $300 and a low estimate of $714. Assuming a constant growth rate in the target price, Tesla stock could be worth $255.63 in 2028. This implies a 58% increase from the current price of $161.81.\n\nAs you can see, these methods give very different results for Tesla stock price in 2028, ranging from $255.63 to $1,237.76. The most likely price may depend on which method you trust more and how optimistic or pessimistic you are about Tesla’s future prospects. However, based on these estimates, I can say that the average Tesla stock price in 2028 could be around $631.92, which implies a 291% increase from the current price of $161.81.\n\nPlease note that this is not a recommendation to buy or sell Tesla stock, but only an analytical assessment based on available information.

And it's shocking to me how people who supposedly value public transit so much are blind to all the advantages of the Boring Loops. Sure, peak capacity would be higher with a train, but that's not really a factor for most cities. The thing holding Las Vegas back from building public transit in the past wasn't that they couldn't get enough capacity. It was all the other limitations of subways, and the Loop solves basically all of them:\n\n* Faster and cheaper to build\n* *Much* faster to expand or to add more stops\n* *very easy* to adjust routes, or add more capacity to specific stops/route\n* Adding more stops to make them more convenient actually increases total system capacity instead of slowing it down\n\nThe ability for a city to make a small investment in a small public transit system, and then grow it over time, is an enormous benefit. It takes away the main hurdle that most cities have to making the initial investment in public transit. And then they can make adjustments over time in response to real world usage numbers. It's an amazing ability that you'd give up if you switched to subways instead.\n\nMaybe at some point, hopefully, a Boring Loop will get so popular that higher density transport will be needed. But switching out regular Teslas for a van/pod will be a big jump, and getting rid of drivers and going autonomous is another way to increase capacity a lot.  Eventually you could get close to subway like throughput (at the tradeoff of some convenience) that would be a little less efficient overall. But it would still have the benefits of being able to make adjustments and expansions incredibly quickly and cheaply.\n\nBy giving up on peak density at the beginning (which doesn't matter), you gain *so many* benefits that make it easier and better to get a system running at all.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What I like, its that since is a lot cheaper to build, you can add lots of new tunnels, so making the network huge and interconnected is not that difficult.

And since the tunnels are 3D, you can virtually build infinite numbers of them, so if there is need for more capacity, just dig another tunnel\n\nThe negative is that you require FSD fot it to scale, but seeing how good is getting at significally more complex situations in real roads, I am optimistic they will get FSD working inside the tunnels", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "if anyone on twitter wants to reply to any of the naysayers i did a little *cost / time to completion* comparison here contrasting 1.7 miles of boring company tunnel to 1.7 miles of the san francisco muni central tunnel:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12xnlgl/_/jhlakij/\n\n1 year @ $50 million\n\nvs\n\n12 years @ $2 billion", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Nice analysis!   \n12 years is crazy for such a short distance.  \nBy the time a new tunnel is needed, approved, then finally built,  the needs may have changed already.  \nFor example, stadiums in America on average last only 30 years.

{"title": "APPL DD", "selftext": "Hello fellow Regards, I am about to make all of us rich our the fucking wazoo, listen closely because it’s not that fucking hard to fat finger the put button. \n\nOk to begin we can see apple trading between 150-170 these past 3 months right? Right, now if you take a look at the calendar you can see that apple is coming up on its next earnings this Thursday at close which means that Friday will be the market open where we see the actual effect of this earnings call.\n\nNow follow me here on this one because it’s gonna get very complicated but today we saw Jpow talking about the rate hikes and how we will not be seeing them go away for some time correct? Well immediately after that a whale at JP was seen selling 500,000 shares on the whale watcher app. This whale selling out seems reasonable correct? WRONG, after checking senator listing Nancy pelosi purchased roughly 20 million equivalent in shares instantaneously after the sell off of this whale. Still not seeing the connection? Well if it wasn’t obvious enough Nancy pelosis husband works at JP Morgan and he most certainly sold off those shares to tax harvest his losses on Rivian, this may seem ok until you remember that tomorrow is thurday and apple earnings effect is on Friday which means that Nancy told Jpow to tank the market or at least make it seem like a whale would want to sell off a large portion to offset suspicion. I wouldn’t have even bat an eye at this until I saw Jpow use his phone after announcing the rate hike and if you know anything you would know that he most likely texted pelosi or even bought apple for himself. \n\nFurthermore, if you look at cnbc headlines you can see fear mongering, this implies they are bullish and would like to maximize profits being up 121% YTD in all positions, it’s a ploy to increase credibility of the companies reports correct? Correct! So I took this knowledge along with my degree in mathmatics and saw the chart once more to see slow purchasing of whales while offset by sell offs of average Joe traders like me and you, this is what we call the market being so efficiently priced in because the big boys know what’s gonna happen already. Now this may seem crazy but that’s not all, let me ask you when is the day of beast feast? This may seem irrelevant but beast feast is a national holiday celebrated on may 5 also know as Cinco de Mayo. Cinco is 5 in Spanish however in Latin (pre erazoic) it is 2, two days after Friday is Sunday? What is open on Sunday? Not Chic fila a! Therefore this implies every 7th year not considering the leap year we have a reversed beast feast due to the timing of the market. How is this important? Well we know that Tim Cook is a hardcore conservative Christian and he cannot eat Sunday post Cinco de Mayo, so he is gonna be fucking raging mad right? So am I saying puts on apple, fuck no you dumbass clearly you aren’t following me. He is gonna be so fucking mad that the only way he can offset his mood, based on my chemistry background, he must find an equilibrium with the external environment and therefore to decrease enthally( heat generated by anger) he must increase entropy naturally. Root word tropy (trophy) means that there is a reward waiting for us created by him. Friday is his offset with nature. \n\nSee technical analysis below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour are regarded \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: Calls on apple, unless we have monkey market?", "id": "136yzts", "created_utc": 1683146773.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|41|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Calls on apple, unless we have monkey market?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This didn’t age well.", "score": 276, "replies": [{"body": "Jesus this is even tougher after seeing the new post.", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "Jesus is his new investment plan", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I’m dead", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Let's hope bro get some karma off his shit... its God's will", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Probably OP too", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Broooo 🫠🫠🫠🫠", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "no better example of, \"everyone gangsta until margin call\"", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Facts😂", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "And what drugs did OP take to go on such unhinged ramblings about Cinco de Mayo and Chick-fil-A?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Nah he was just overconfident and too hype", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "the most potent drug of all: the degeneracy of r/wsb", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "This dude in my opinion is most likely the result of someone going on chatGTP and asking it to ‘make funny wallstreet bets post’.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "He got a house inherited from his parents, used it as collateral for a 600k loan and lost all the money on stocks…don’t be like OP, only spend money you can afford to lose.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Well he did make someone rich", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wondering whether this whole thing is a troll.
