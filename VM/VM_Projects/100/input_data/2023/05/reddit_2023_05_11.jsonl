The reality is that the majority of people who are diehard fans of any group format does it largely for the group experience, which is impossible to truly replicate via a screen in your house. That’s not to say there aren’t people that will absolutely love being able to do the workouts from their own home and don’t care about being surrounded by other people; there definitely are those people. But they’re almost certainly going to be the minority of the amount of people who are interested in regularly doing indoor cycling workouts. \n\nI think in a lot of ways Peloton lucked out from COVID. They are one of the few fitness companies that did well, and even probably strengthened, because of lockdowns and general reluctance (outside of the lockdowns) to cram into small spaces with other people. But we’re getting past that phase, even if there are many who are still somewhat hesitant to be in crowded spaces. \n\nIt will also be interesting to see how subscribers react to the changes in the approach to Peloton’s videos. My wife has a subscription (though not one of their bikes) that she uses periodically. She was complaining the other day that during COVID the videos were shot with only the instructors, which allowed them to focus on the camera and build engagement through the screen, while current videos are being live streamed/filmed in actual, live classes. Being an actual class, the instructor focuses on the people in the studio which eliminates a lot of the engagement with the camera and the people watching from their own homes. This may not be as jarring for subscribers who bought in before the pandemic (I assume it was the same way then), but I could see it turning off subscribers who became invested when they were filming without the live group element.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I think you’re thinking of $GOOG", "score": -3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Rumor for a while last year was the Swoosh.

You'll need the strength for masturbating to the gain porn:\n\n# 0. TLDR\n\nA company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈.  I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects.  Bill Gates is invested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n1. Intro\n2. Water and Chips\n3. William Henry Gates III\n4. The Stock\n5. Water Treatment and Sanitation\n6. Further Reading\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. Intro\n\nWelcome to the \"It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies\" series.  A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting.  I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century.  I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts.  This one is specifically about $ECL.  I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter.  I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit.\n\nI've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion).\n\nAt this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt.  \"Millionaires are made in Recessions\" as they say.  So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more.  There are really two different angles here that I will discuss.  The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Trick Is To Let Them Cook](https://preview.redd.it/7bdstuxty8za1.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be1b9ec7d4f290b9d52deb330631a50bec18454)\n\n# 2. Water and Chips\n\nThe massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. [Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-us-fabs-everything-we-know).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[It Was There That I Started To Question About Water](https://preview.redd.it/jjd9lxo1z8za1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=04940d607af69b4ddc735b5d3bdf462caf25e933)\n\nWhat strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries.  Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task.  To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately **2,200** **gallons of water**; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below).  So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to **4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day.** T**his equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty).**\n\nwow. numbers man... crazy.  Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is.  If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool](https://preview.redd.it/0xmsfyz3z8za1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ba57f17cf61968a7df9503a069f4dca1b5e5e1d)\n\nThis Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size.  It holds about  660,000 US gallons.  Which means, that for a large facility, you would need  7.3 of these fuckers full of water **a day** (copy and paste this image 7.3 times).\n\nIn a tropical climate, such as Taiwan,  droughts can bring production to a screeching halt.  Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC.  The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way.  Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and [the Water Wars are already starting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/arizona-scottsdale-water-cut-off-rio-verde-foothills-drought?ref=upstract.com).  I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that.  Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are **not** going to happen I would be grateful.\n\nSo, why do they need so much water?  A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water.  But, it's not *just* water. It's Ultra Pure Water.\n\n[Ultra Pure Water (UPW)](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/support/tools-resources/dictionary/purity-on-another-level-ultrapure-water/) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water.  The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB.  No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2.  From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive.\n\nSo, what does it mean when \"they use a lot of pure water\". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain.  There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste.  They recycle it.\n\nThis is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group [NALCO](https://www.ecolab.com/nalco-water).  Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation.  See where I am going with this?  Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011.  I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at  $38.80 per share.  It has pretty much been forgotten about.\n\nIf you look up $ECL description on RH it says (>!Slut\\_!<Spoiler Alert: >!it doesn't mention semiconductors!<):\n\n>Ecolab, Inc. engages in the provision of products and services in the field of water, hygiene, and energy.

Trust me bro.  I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine.  [https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726](https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726).   I think they want to keep the details \"water-tight\".   This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet.  The Plants are still being built.\n\nIf you are wondering about the \"Data-Center\" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center \"US West 3\" in Arizona.\n\nThe future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock.  This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon.  When they do, **I THINK** the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment,  carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up.\n\nThe best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL.  Bill Gates has done it for you.\n\n# 3.  William Henry Gates III\n\nI don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks.  My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile,  and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan.  If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft.   This isn't a surprise as the [largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bill-gates-ecolab-stock-51660936071).  He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022.  Billy knows a LOT about the  semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame.

Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert.  Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves.  Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and [anything / anyone else he can use](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/environment/water-restoration-arizona.html).  It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure.  He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future.  Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some.  \n>  \n>Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice.  With wells already dug and everything. What Luck!  It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants.  Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water.  Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse.  They are used to dump waste water into though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pcexjsfz8za1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=22085c48f4ab14d24613e8b39885b4891f9d54f0\n\n>The top land per state is:\n\n1. Louisiana\n2. Arkansas\n3. Arizona\n4. Nebraska\n5. Washington\n\n>That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and \"Carhenge\".  I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood.  Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA.  Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji!\n\nI believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for \"[global warming](https://twitter.com/goddeketal/status/1655658051855065090?t=0fqTNBwM8Q2B5HNU86b4Aw&s=19) causes\", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on.\n\nThe major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers.  Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc...  What he wants to do: [Smart City](https://www.facebook.com/worldeconomicforum/videos/10154914651546479/) of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch.  I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part.\n\n# 4. The Stock\n\nAt the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: [Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ECL/insider-trades/).  Last Buy was August of 2022.\n\nCurrently, ECL is trading at $173.67.  Wish it was cheaper.  If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish.  Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon.  You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48.  Probably for taxes.  Probably...  Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, \"in may go away\" chestnut etc...  In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/576jmmyhz8za1.png?width=1657&format=png&auto=webp&s=86770f22973aa28b9dae9a183ab3f09f5ec020f7\n\nYou see a steep decline from  [late December to Febuary as supply chain crunches and lawsuits and recalls affected the company negatively](https://www.google.com/search?q=ecolabs&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:12/22/2021,cd_max:1/31/2022&tbm=nws&sxsrf=APwXEdezFqmiEYFwTD8sg18MvQ6VcoER9A:1683405957982&ei=hbxWZKnMO7TC0PEPzvmGWA&start=20&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwjpoo3xx-H-AhU0ITQIHc68AQs4ChDw0wN6BAgEEBk&biw=1588&bih=761&dpr=1.21), as well as higher costs affecting their profits.

Water Treatment and Sanitation\n\nThe other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation.  Their bread and butter.  Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say \"EcoLabs\" on them.  Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts.  Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends.  Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this.\n\nAs other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions.  There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further.\n\nCurrently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc.  The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap.  After that it's free game.  However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs.\n\nThings like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds.  There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment.  It's all about the control and efficacy of water.\n\nRecently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Carpet is Ohio](https://preview.redd.it/v1wpsj2jz8za1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d35db595b1fad9281ba17918684e06db40b9362)\n\nSome people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. [Holy Shit](https://preventchemicaldisasters.org/chemical-facility-incidents/).  Just like Bill Gates had an investment in [vaccines](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/bill-gates-turns-10-billion-into-200-billion-worth-of-economic-benefit.html) pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?!  The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a  campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue.\n\n# 6.
