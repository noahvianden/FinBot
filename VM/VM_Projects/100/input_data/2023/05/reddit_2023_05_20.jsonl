You could just buy an additional $100 of the ETF on margin, but interests are 6.5 - 13%, so very expensive. You could just buy a 2xXYX leveraged ETF which would have an interest rate slightly above the EFFR rate or roughly the 3 month T-Bills (not bad). However you could do better with options which actually have an even lower interest rate.\n\nFirst OTM as usually traded here are super leveraged instruments with non-linear leverage so not ideal for this strategy. The best is actually synthetic leverage using a Call and a put, problem is that involves a naked put which requires level 4 options. Options' *interest rate* is essentially the spread + premium paid + dividend lost. On highly liquid ETFs/stocks this will usually mean lower interest rate than other means of leverage by 1-2%.\n\n**Deep ITM LEAPS**\n\nGoing back to our $100 XYZ ETF. To get 2x leverage you would buy a 2 year call option with an option price of roughly $50 dollars which would be roughly a $50 strike price as well. If you think about it, if you hold this option for 2 years, you are essentially controlling $100 of XYZ while using only $50. But if the market drops 50% by that time your option will expire worthless therefore losing $50 dollars. So it behaves like regular leverage. \n\nWhat about 3x leverage. You buy an option with a price of $33 which would be roughly a strike price of $67. This allows you to move $100 using $33, but if market drops 33% your option is worthless. As mentioned you do actually pay a premium/interest rate so the strike price will actually be higher than $67 in reality accounting for 2 years of leverage at that interest.\n\nIt still tends to be an efficient way to get leverage assuming XYZ options are fairly liquid.\n\nI will skip over futures because they behave similarly in that you in choose how much money to risk to achieve the desired leverage, but have a more complex tax structure and many brokers don't offer them.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "They cost less than shares, therefore leverage over shares for roughly similar returns (assuming an ~0.9 delta).

Deep ITM far LEAPs are a relatively safe way to gain leverage on a \"buy and roll\" long term strategy. That is, you identify a stock you are bullish on in the long term, buy at a price point where extrinsic value is negligible, and hold for a long time, rolling when necessary (basically, until you stop believing in the company). This can get you close to double the bang for your buck.\n2. Main caveats are tax events when rolling and missing out on dividends. That means you want a stock where most of the total return comes from growth and buybacks. Again, the loss of extrinsic value is real, but it can be quite small.\n3. Collecting premium on short term calls is an assumption you know short term stock movements better than the market. You don't, and would be safer just holding your LEAPs.\n\nAs for your specific question around timing for these stocks, no one really knows. Find a great company at a fair value and this strategy should work.

Google started up Google Brain (Their internal AI division) in 2011.\n2. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014. At this time, DeepMind was their No.1 competitor in AI.\n3. Google announced they are an \"AI First\" company in 2017, even though they'd been AI first since at least 2014 (year of the DeepMind acquisition)\n4. Google Brain publishes a whitepaper on \"transformer networks\". This is the underlying technology that's powering ChatGPT4. In fact, ask Sam Altman about it. He'll tell you that ChatGPT4, or ChatGPT anything, wouldn't actually exist if it wasn't for Google's in-house ML engineers that released that whitepaper.\n5. Microsoft has been an \"AI First\" company for maybe two years tops? I know their investment in OpenAI was July 2019, but that was more of a dipping their toes in the water moment than anything.\n6. Google employed thousands of ML/AI engineers across all their divisions as far back as 2014. Microsoft maybe had a hundred (if even that) ML/AI engineers in 2014?\n7. Sergey Brin and Larry Page have recently come out of \"retirement\" to help steward the merger of Google Brain and DeepMind into a singular unit within Google. The ultimate AI brain trust.\n8. LLM's (Large Language Models) aren't the alpha and omega of AI advancement. It's just one small aspect of the overall AI field.\n9. Bard might be FAR behind ChatGPT4 as a LLM, but we don't know with any certainty that Google doesn't have something far more advanced than Bard that they simply don't intend to reveal to the public anytime soon.

One is that falling from 300+ to $59 may mean it's been significantly derisked.  Another is that the market should reward them when the current failed CEO gets replaced.  \n\nAnother big one is just the recurring pattern we keep seeing.
