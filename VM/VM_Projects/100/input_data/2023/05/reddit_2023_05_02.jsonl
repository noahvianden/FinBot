Understand when to buy vs sell options. Time is always working against you as a buyer, so you need to make sure you’re trading on a high vol day, otherwise you’ll have to be nearly perfect on timing your entry to make money consistently. A normal day for the S&P 500 is about a 10-20 point movement (in either direction). I personally try and avoid buying on these days and prefer to sell CSEPs or spreads. For buying, I prefer to wait for ~25+ point swings in order to trade with the momentum. Makes timing your entry not as critical, but always understand why the market is moving before just jumping in. \n4. Most important: HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY! Even if your plan is to 5x your money, place the closing trade immediately after entering to avoid getting greedy and losing it all. Same goes for the downside. Know what you’re comfortable risking and be disciplined when you inevitably lose a trade. \n\nUltimately, it’s just going to take practice and time to get good at anything.

In 2017 Azure made 28 billion dollars revenue while AWS was making 17 billion. Now Azure is at 60 while AWS is at 80 billion.

That means more potential customers than the entirety of the United States. Of course they wont have as much money but the potential growth is enormous. I'm not even talking about countries where they already have operations running. Many people like to point out it's not profitable yet. But neither was Amazon US for the first 10 years. Many countries that they operate within have less favorable conditions than the United states. So profitability may take 15 years.

They now still use pillpak but also have amazon pharmacy. In January Amazon announced a $5 subscription for generic medicine (RxPass). Last month Blue shield California said they’re “relying less” on CVS and expanding their roster to include amazon and a few other newer companies. Clearly all of these moves are growing their pharmacy business and taking some market share away from the major players. On top of these moves they offer a better work place for their techs and pharmacists where the major companies (Walgreens, CVS, and Riteaid) are know for terrible work conditions and tight scheduling for necessary staff making the job difficult. Amazon also offers WFH jobs for a lot of their pharmacists and techs which isn’t an option with the other companies (note these have not been impacted with the RTO that amazon has for other employees). These advantages allow amazon to pay their pharmacists significant less than their competitors, in my area CVS is offering around $80k sign on bonuses and $140-160k salaries. Amazon is $10k sign on bonus with $115k salary and $10k RSU. Amazon also has a soft hiring freeze due to low amounts of employee churn while CVS and others are desperate for pharmacists and still can’t find them with the higher pay. \n\n\n\nOn the more medical side amazon purchased One Medical which had 850k patients I think in 2022, it’s still a bit early and I don’t have much insight into how this is doing yet. But I suspect it will do well and has significant growth potential. By leveraging their 200million prime subscribers it gives them a unique position to offer tele health, prescriptions and other medical services either bundled in or through add on subscriptions like their RxPass. \n\n\n\nTo note, on the negative side amazon already made a telehealth segment in 2018(?) which they ended up closing in 2022. So it is a difficult area to break into and they clearly didn’t feel comfortable doing it without making additional acquisitions. But the $4B they spent on One Medical is a drop in the bucket for them and can lead to very high ROI.

Falsificationism is an interesting idea when applied to IR - how do you falsify one-time events? Given the history of the world, there is only one way it could be (the way it really is) and we can't re-run the experiments or re-roll the dice, so falsifying a theory must be quite hard if there isn't enough data, or trivially easy if there is too much data.\n\nReminds me of Lakatos' idea of \"research programs\", as an extension of Popper/Kuhn. His idea was scientific theories aren't actually as falsifiable as we think they are because if an experiment \"falsifies\" a theory, you can actually just jettison a non-core part of the theory. You can think of it this way: a theory T is made up of various hypothesis, call them H1, H2, H3, and H4. Suppose an experiment comes along that falsifies T. What that means in practice is maybe you lose H3, or maybe you can get away with ditching H4, leaving H1, H2, and H3 intact. But generally in the history of science, researchers fairly stubbornly stick to a research program that has some axiomatic hypothesis' that they won't give up until the very end. \n\nPresumably the authors of the book can do something similar, where falsifying data actually just trims parts of the theory rather than the whole thing.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You seem to know more about that than me!

And if our best theory of how people will act is something like folk-psychology, then that does blow a huge hole in the project of positivism.\n\nThis is what a lot of people got wrong about Putin. He was literally *telling us* in the runup to the invasion where his mind was at, which was: \"Ukraine shouldn't exist, it belongs to the Soviet Union/Russia, it was a mistake to cede it\".

When the private sector (literally every single person and all the businesses and arguably non federal government) goes into deficit, that's when we risk either immediate recession or ballooning private debt to cover to difference.

If the government runs a surplus, it is taking money away from the private sector, by definition, which is the opposite of what a growing economy needs. That difference can be made up by selling stuff for other governments' money, but they have to run a deficit for us in that case, or by banks lending more, which increases private leverage, has a default risk, and has a much much much higher rate of interest.

AI is different in that it allows for computers with infinitely faster processing power than the human brain to solve problems for us. Industrial revolutions worked because the tech developed gave you a new set of problems to overcome. This still required humans to overcome them. Think of a firm like general dynamics or Raytheon. On the edge of tech when it comes to engineering and mechanics. Employs thousands of people to come up with the new best thing and ways to solve problems. Sure they use computers to model and interpret data, but tht still requires someone to write the algorithm, enter the data, analyse what it means, change variable to run tests on specs that lead to failure etc. With AI one single computer can replace hundreds of these jobs and be faster at it.
