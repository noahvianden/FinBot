So suddenly the amount of available cash is not so high. So the buybacks have to come from high FCF going forward, which requires thermal pricing not to melt down. Now I think at today's prices it is a good deal, but... so are other coal names. Had so much cash not been tied up, sure, it would have been an easy double, to $35-40 a share. But the imminent catalyst is really much less exciting. Long term holders will likely see excellent returns in all coal names, but right now, with thermal pricing going down the drain, being optimistic is difficult. At least their small buyback (5-7% of float a quarter?) will be able to suck up even more shares. There are some technicalities about convertible debt but tbh I don't fully understand it. Some credit experts on Twitter are saying BTU is never going to get favorable terms on that to be able to take it out.\n\nI'm not adding a lot of BTU, as I have a comfortable sized position--enough that I don't really care if it keeps falling.

The point of FSD Beta isn't to make everyone comfortable and to try and provide as many disengagement free rides as possible to impress us. The point of FSD Beta is to get data, that means using it but also intervening and disengaging.\n\nLet's look at this situation:\n\n* The intersection was very busy. Technically, no one should enter the intersection if they don't think they can be clear by the time the light turns red, but practically no humans actually drive that way. If FSD Beta followed the rules exactly it would be much more uncomfortable\n* Like a human, Beta crept forward in to the intersection and it seems like it probably would've been clear by the time the light turned red\n* There's a bicyclist coming the other way that's turning left. They don't have the right of way, but Beta yields to them. Probably because Beta is *very* cautious around pedestrians/cyclists/etc. Which makes sense, that's a situation where a small mistake could kill someone, so they err on the side of caution\n* Beta gives the cyclist room and then starts moving forward. The taxi cuts off Beta (and the car the left) as well. This car doesn't have the right of way, and might even have to wait for a green arrow to make any turn (I can't tell from looking at the intersection, but it's a possibility) \n* Personally if I was in that situation I would've honked and then gone around the car instead of yielding. Beta is more polite (and can't honk). It's not clear if Beta would've actually hit that car, it certainly didn't stop at a comfortable distance to yield, but it's not clear it was intending to yield. If the taxi had hit the Tesla while illegally cutting into traffic that would've clearly been the taxi's fault. If the taxi got in front of the Tesla, it should obviously stop instead of hitting it. \n* The driver made the right choice to do the thing that they're there to do. Give the car feedback when it doesn't something uncomfortable and take over.\n* So far the system is working perfectly. Everyone's safe, the car has driven mostly like a human, although somewhat more safely in parts and somewhat more aggressively in others. And also the driver  has provided feedback and data for improving the system while making sure that everyone is safe.\n* The Tesla and the two other cars that were stuck in the intersection after the taxi cut them off are in the intersection when the light turn red, but get out of the way fairly quickly\n\nBeta got in to the same exact situation that the car next to it did. In both cases they yielded to a cyclist, then got cut off by the taxi. \n\nTesla could try and make sure the car never gets in to any situation where the driver might feel like they should take over? But what would be the point of that?? To create less training data? To try and impress people testing the software? The point of a beta isn't to impress people, it's to make the software better.

You all remind me of those fucking apes in 2001 too afraid to step forward and transcend by touching the monolith  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWs3c3YNs4 . But this ape, /u/ShittyStockPicker ain't afraid to take a fucking risk. \n\nI‚Äôve been hearing about the impending recession since covid started, I‚Äôve been hearing about the collapse of the dollar since 1990. The internet is full of bears who want to see America punished for its imagined sins: greed, debt, laziness. Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   \nBut I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. \n\nThe hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none. The culture we have built worships talent and those stupid enough to risk everything for a dream.  And we don't give a flying fuck if you're a queer dragon-kintyped non-binary star planet. If you're stupid enough to try the impossible, we're going to fucking cheer you on. And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   \n\n\nIt's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   \nIf you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, \"Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel.\" You said, \"fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!\"   \nAnd that's still the America I believe in. And I believe that's the America /r/WallStreetBets believes in.   \nSo is it any fucking surprise then, that once again the United States is at the forefront of yet another technological revolution that is going to profoundly transform global society, rearrange international power structures, and change everything? \n\nI've been struggling to explain what AI means to people. But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost. The AI boom is different from the Information Technology boom because it is the beginning of the generation of new information at 0 marginal cost.***   \n***Information Age: Sharing information at 0 marginal cost***  \n\n***AI Age: Generation of new information at 0 marginal cost***  \n\nLet that fucking sink in. *Generation of information at 0 marginal cost from newspapers to rocket designs.*  \n\nI don't know if you had the chance to listen to the $NVDA conference call, but holy shit I fucking creamed myself rubbing my dick to it. There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. \n\nWhat the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!\n\nMany current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*\n\nThe first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA. Demand for their chips is going to be insane. The next wave, we'll see this show up in six to twelve months or so, is going to be the companies who adopted AI early and found obvious and unexpected ways to take advantage of 0 marginal cost information generation. ***The moment a company who adopted AI reports that an AI technology led to a blowout quarter we're going to see an explosion in stock prices and unimaginable GDP growth.*** \n\nWe‚Äôre not going into recession, we‚Äôre on the brink of pushing the world into an unprecedented era of GDP growth and exponential growth in the rate of improvement of living standards.\n\nWe‚Äôre months away from new all time highs on the Nasdaq.

For example, the DEA, in collaboration with the HHS, would assess eight factors, including a drug‚Äôs potential for abuse, scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, the state of current scientific knowledge about the drug, its history and current pattern of abuse, the scope, duration, and significance of abuse, and risks to public health.\n\t3.\tCongressional role: Even if the DEA and HHS agree that a drug should be rescheduled, Congress also plays a role. The user correctly pointed out that legislative changes could be required to alter the status of a drug. That‚Äôs because some federal laws explicitly list marijuana as a Schedule I substance, and rescheduling marijuana could conflict with these laws.\n\t4.\tExecutive Order (EO): This part is slightly less accurate. An EO can direct administrative agencies to take certain actions, but it‚Äôs not typically the vehicle used to reschedule a drug. A formal rulemaking process, including a period for public comment, is often required for such a regulatory change.\n\t5.\tTimeline: The timeline for this process can indeed be lengthy. Studies need to be conducted, the public usually has a chance to comment, and there‚Äôs often internal deliberation within the agencies.\n\nThe comment seems to capture the general spirit of the process, but it slightly oversimplifies the role of the President and the process by which an EO might be used.

An old book from the 50s I‚Äôm reading discusses that the 1920-21 depression stemmed from commodity price inflation and the 1929-32 deflation stemmed from inflated brokers loans. In 1929 the situation was thought harmless because there was no commodity inflation like the last crash before it but there was mass inflation in other areas.

In 08 the variable rates killed housing but now that most are on fixed it should be ok right? But the fixed mortgage has created unwilling new sellers and consequently new buyers. As the mortgage market is massive, the slowdown in this arena could be a slower death than 08 was. Commercial real estate was not much an issue in 08. Consequently its not taken as seriously. All the ear marks are there. What is consistent with these crashes is the fed. No crashes occurred without a raised federal funds rate.

How severe it will be only time will tell. But they will take too much time to detonate most likely around 2024-25. But yah its centered around in the commercial side rather than the household.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there are rough times ahead and Fed has to be really careful in managing the soft landing but since they depend on the lagging indicators rather than leading i suppose an accident is more likely to happen. Also right now inflation kinda feels like embedded in the system which has moved from the goods to the service sector like in the 70s.
