At it's worst I'd say the build quality is inconsistent. For example, I've seen a few Teslas at the charging stations that have gaps around the doors and/or frunk. This isn't the case for my car nor my bosses Model S.\n\n>I saw a year old Tesla built in the parking lot? The entire interior was rusting. \n\nWhat do you mean by built in the parking lot? Assembled? Parked there? Surely you cant mean you were driving past a dealership and they were assembling the car there?\n\nGoing on 2 years now, and I've yet to notice any rust inside or outside my car. So, perhaps this goes back to the inconsistenc? For me, the absolute worst thing I've dealt with was a moldy smell from my air filter needing to be replaced. However, that was a quick and easy fix that I was able to do all on my own.\n\n>body shop waiting for parts for Tesla from a routine accident. Normally a few week turn around but it’s been sitting in the shops yard for 6-8 months when last I heard.\n\nDepending on the body shop and when this occurred (during Covid), this doesn't surprise me. To be bluntly honest, I ripped the entire back bumper off my car while recklessly accelerating through what I thought was a shallow puddle (it wasn't). Had my car at a local body shop for 2-4 weeks, give or take, where the biggest issue was sourcing parts that matched in color due to supply chain constraints. However, the shop I went to had some official Tesla approval of repairs, so perhaps that explains my luck?\n\n>Plus the cars haven’t been redesigned, “licenses” for self drive and other features can’t be sold with the car, and don’t move from the client to their new car, like why would I buy a new one if self drive and heated seats don’t transfer? That’s really screwing the customer so bad it hurts the company.\n\nI haven't looked into this, so take this next paragraph with a grain of salt. I imagine that these features are already pre-installed into most cars and that you gain access through your account/profile and any supported vehicle under your account. For example, I have both heated seats and steering wheel on my Model 3, hypothetical let's say I upgrade to the Model S. As a result of purchasing this on my profile and then adding the new car to my profile, both cars should have access to heated steering and seats. If I were to sell my Model 3 or unlink it from my profile, I imagine access to this feature would be disabled until the next account that has access to it is linked to the car.\n\n Again, I could be entirely wrong about this. However, there was an option to buy heated back seats in the car on the screen, leading me to conclude all these \"extra\" features are already built in and access is determined by account. If you know for a fact that this isn't the case, please, do share because I am genuinely curious.\n\n>Subscriptions are bullshit too.\n\nYeah, agreed. Atleast with the FSD.

[Multifamily starts are at 40-yr highs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST5F), [rent inflation is below pre-pandemic trends](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data).

This has forced many would-be homebuyers to stay in the rental market, exacerbating already high demand. A chronic shortage of housing is another factor. \n\n> Expect above-average rent price gains in 2023\n\n> Year-over-year rental price growth will rise from 5.8%, as of June 2022, to 8.4% as of May 2023, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas forecast that uses data from the federal government's consumer price index.\n\n> Similarly, an upcoming Moody's Analytics forecast predicts a rent growth rate of 5% to 7% during that same time, says Thomas LaSalvia, a director of economic research at the financial analytics firm.

As a reminder, the “shelter” component of CPI – which includes both renter-occupied and owner-occupied housing costs – is the single largest component of topline CPI, comprising one-third of the overall index. And because costs for owner-occupied housing are measured with the concept of “owner’s equivalent rent,” trends in market rents are the key determinant of not just the rent component, but of the shelter component as a whole.\n\nRents can still fall while CPI remains elevated.

On average my buy price is 51$. I strongly believe it's a 130$ stock when analyzing cash flow and combining it with a moderate 15% YoY growth which is well below the average 50% it had till now. So I'm using low numbers.\n\nAt a 17.5% average growth YoY for the next decade you're looking at a company with 5.2B+ revenue whose costs don't rise at the same rate (NET expenses raise mostly in sales and administration, running the business as it is, is relatively cheap). This yearly revenue would be 30% of their current market cap. As a comparison, Apple's immense revenue, is still below 10% their market cap. Do what you want with this information. And that's assuming a 17.5% rate. At 20% your'e looking at 6.2B+ revenue. At 30% you're looking at 14B.\n\nThings I like: \n\n- their security services protect between 20 and 25 % of the internet. There's lot to monetize. It's not an easy market to compete and having a team that builds threat handling experience everyday poses you miles ahead of potentially new emerging competitors or smaller competitors.\n\n- they have by far the lowest latencies globally when it comes to CDNs, they are highly distributed in more than 200+ data centers. They don't need to invest that much in new ones. Cloudflare is already a sleeping underutilized cloud vendor on top of being a security company.\n\n- they have a lot of room for growth eroding AWS market share on services like hosting/cdn where they beat Amazon both from a technical and most importantly price point of view. This would increase their bottom line albeit I don't think it's that profitable it could lure lots of customers for their more expensive services.\n\n- the products are super good and their R&D team is great\n\nThings I **don't** like:\n\n- CEO regularly selling his options every month. Not really inspiring.\n\n- Cost of sales seems high. Which is both good in one sense (they can easily become a cash cow) but bad as well (they aren't priced as a cash cow but a growth company)\n\n- if NET becomes a threat, bigger players can wage a price war against it but with much deeper pockets and insanely different cash flows.\n\nRisks:\n\n- as with any growth stock you live and die by quarterly earnings and future projections. While I believe the company is undervalued, nothing stops it from being much more undervalued (I could see their market cap fall below 10B easily)\n\nI will keep buying more of it up to 65/70$ish as I find it a relatively safe bet in the space. But this is no financial advice, just my analysis. Also, last but not least, I'm an IT professional and compare those companies in the sector not just from an analyst but user/reseller of cloud/security services which makes me even more confident of their good outlook. But again, you're hearing all of this from a random over the internet.\n\n**edit**: I provided an analysis answering a question and all I got was downvotes.

It could already yield 3+% ish dividends as of now while cutting costs. Thus I would even be comfortable holding it if revenue growth slowed down. I'm not worried. There's plenty of room to cut costs and milk the clients (which are generally very happy with NET, it has a very high retention rate of customers).\n\nRevenue grows quicker than costs, and even tho, as I listed before cost of sales seems insanely high, Cloudflare has essentially already a very profitable business.\n\nMy calculations are that sales will keep growing less than revenue while the other costs of the business growing even less than sales. Whether I'm right about that that's a coin toss, but has been reflected in current quarterly trends every 3 months.\n\nEspecially I believe that Cloudflare has a lot of room of growth outside America especially due to their very distributed nature of the business.\n\nWhile competition is tough in the cyber security world, it is an umbrella for many different threats. Of all the common ones such as DDOS Cloudflare again has both a competitive advantage due to their many data centers all around the world, expertise, as they deal with insane attacks pretty much every time we breath that competitors cannot replicate without doing investments that NET has done already a lot of time ago.

There's a difference between what the goal of the FSD development program is in the long term, and what the goal of the *FSD Beta* program is trying to do with each version release.\n\nObviously the *eventual* goal of the beta is to get out of beta and have a final product that's fully self driving. But that's not the goal of each version along the path. There's no release notes that are like \"We think we've got it all figured out now, it should be perfect, let us know if you have any problems.\"\n\nThe goal of the beta is primarily to collect data, to get lots of feedback from lots of people and lots of clips and sensor data to go with it. If they didn't need a ton of data there would be no reason to open it up to the public, they have enough employees and safety drivers to tell if the software is truly self driving or not. They don't need 100,000 people to demonstrate that.\n\nThe reason we have the software is so that we can generate data by taking over. And then they'll use that data to prioritize development and try different solutions and fix problems iteratively. Eventually, that process should hopefully result in a version at some point in the future that won't need the \"beta\" label. But there's two goals that they could potentially have for the intermediate period, and they're contradictory to each other:\n\n* Has as many intervention free drives as possible\n* Not get stuck in a local maximum\n\nAnd they've obviously picked the second. Which makes sense to me. It seems like a much better idea to build a solid foundation, even if that means some/many interventions, and then once that's built they can finetune the driving behavior that's built on top of it. Trying to finetune to create intervention free drives now before the foundation is working nearly perfectly, is exactly how you get stuck in a local maximum. \n\nWould you rather they prioritize making long term progress or prioritize impressing us now?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Jesus Christ Bro, I was just pointing our how these particular scenarios haven't yet shown improvement from V11.3 to 11.4.\n\nI already said I agreed with pretty much everything you wrote.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Mind not blown v 11.4.1", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Reserving judgment till we see Chuck's take.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "oh another elon overhyped fsd update. should be v12!!!", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wait and see how it develops over point releases. 11.3.6 is far better than 11.3.3 was when it was first released to testers.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You can have a 1 day or a 10 year timeframe everybody hates the market makers", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Citadel is a real pain", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Shitadel", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "If Rob gonna choose shareloft over covering this imma have to dock him some points", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "FSD Beta v11.4.1 First Impressions - An Honest Review - Smooth and Natural Driving at Night\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3fhL2n608](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb3fhL2n608)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies if this has been posted before\n\n Model 3 - Beta FSD 11.4.1 - Test Loop 1 - 2023.7.5 - 11 May 2023 (James Locke)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQsl5FsLJgI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQsl5FsLJgI)", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "I love the smell of new books.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Linda Yacarino from NBC/Universall will be the new Twitter CEO\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/12/nbcuniversal-ad-chief-yaccarino-resigns-as-sources-say-shes-in-talks-to-be-twitter-ceo.html", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That other twtr vp that wanted it gonna be furious", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That twitter vp seemingling had no experience selling ads which is the one thing Elon has no clue about since he's never even bought ads.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yah she's useless", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "looks like somebody has a case of the fridays", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Why is it named Zelda, it should be named Link", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "because the goal is to make it inside zeldas dungeon ;)", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wrote a letter to Nintendo explaining that when I was 13, especially since Zelda isn't even really in Majora's mask 😂\n\nThey were nice enough to write back thanking me for my letter and explained it was about keeping continuity", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Because all life flows through the women, it’s a damsel in distress quest for the most part which has many parallels in todays world a lot of what you do is to procure your own goddess.

That's right, the floppy fish, the derpy drifter, the splashy spazz. Get ready for a journey into the realm of the truly sublime.\n\nFirst, let's talk aesthetics. Magikarp is a Pokémon with the style and grace of a potato in a tutu. You might think that's a dig, but you're dead wrong. The sheer audacity of its design is a bold statement against the over-complicated, over-designed powerhouses you all drool over. Charizard? A dragon wannabe. Pikachu? A yellow rat with a lightning fetish. Meanwhile, Magikarp is over here just being a fish, and it doesn't give a single Goldeen's fin about your opinion.\n\nMoving on to the meta. The meta of Pokémon games has always been a hot topic. Most of you are probably caught up in this or that stat distribution, movepool, or ability. That's where you're going wrong, folks. Magikarp's power is in its simplicity. It's got Splash, Tackle, and Flail, moves so basic they make a Geodude look like a theoretical physicist. But therein lies its power. Like a Zen master, Magikarp shows us that true strength lies not in flashy displays, but in doing one thing and doing it well. And what does Magikarp do well? It flops. It flops like no one's business.\n\nAnd let's talk about that evolution. Gyarados. This beast is the definition of zero to hero. From a fish that could barely wiggle its way out of a puddle, we get a monstrous, water-flying type dragon (still not a Dragon-type though, because Game Freak logic) that'll Hyper Beam your Arceus into the next region. And you know what? You don't deserve that evolution if you can't appreciate the beauty of the journey. If you can't cherish your Magikarp for who it is, then you don't deserve its majestic, wrathful evolution.\n\nLastly, Magikarp is the embodiment of Pokémon's greatest lesson: Never judge a Pokémon by its cover (or its base stats). Like the underdog Ash Ketchum who somehow wins every League by friendship and sheer willpower, Magikarp is the embodiment of the series' spirit. So next time you're fishing in-game and pull up another Magikarp, don't groan in frustration. Give a salute to the real MVP of the Pokémon world.\n\nMagikarp isn't just superior, it's the ultimate Pokémon. It's an underappreciated, misunderstood masterpiece that is just waiting for the truly enlightened to recognize its splendor.

While the platform has held together from a technological standpoint, Elon's behavior has eroded trust.  His attempt to extort NPR and his declaration that accounts idle for 30 days would be purged, show that any Twitter user is at his complete mercy.  \n   * Would you trust your digital life to a man who could wreck it almost instantly because you pissed him off?  I wouldn't.

His word that he won't, is frankly worthless in light of his repeated stock sales during 2022. \n* It is still an open question whether Elon's actions connected to Twitter will have lasting damage to Tesla's finances.\n   * If Tesla's sales continue to grow and margins improve due to economies of scale at Berlin and Texas (both now running at 5k units/week or higher), the answer may very well be no.  \n   * I believe that Q3 '23 and Q4 '23 results will give us more insight into this.  Strong sales and margins in a relatively high interest rate environment would help us enormously.\n\nTSLA had a terrible start to 2019, with similar trust issues.

It harms relationships with theaters and it also makes piracy a million times easier. Now you can get DVD rips a week after it hits the theater instead of having to wait months. Ironically Disney probably thought they were being clever by cutting out the middle man (ie, no cut to share with the theater) but instead they're shrinking the pie. \n* the parks were surviving on momentum IMO.

To be a master it takes years and TBH, I certainly cannot claim to have mastered options, but I do know them. When you do progress to becoming a consistently profitable trader it can be a very rewarding experience and I have learned along the way that there are certain rules that need to be adhered to. Some, you may think are obvious but I can tell you, I have seen other people break every single one and everyone will likely have done at least one of them at one point, if you end up doing this long enough...\n\n1. MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS!\n\nDo not enter a trade just because someone else told you to! Do your own research, you need to know everything about the trade you are entering,\n\n2. ALWAYS TRADE WITH A STOP LOSS OR MAX LOSS IN MIND.\n\nBefore you enter a trade , already KNOW what you are prepared to lose on it and it should ALWAYS be less than you are hoping to make. (I would suggest as a guide that your loss should be no more than 50% of what you are hoping to make. Your stop loss can either be set based on technical, events or based on your affordability. It should basically reflect the loss that you are willing to accept to lose on a position. Irrespective of whether you are trading on the long side or on the short side, always you need to have that level where the position is just wrong and you need to have that discipline to exit a loser. (The only addendum I would add to this is that with equities or futures, you can put in an electronic stop which once placed, takes out the emotion of having to exit yourself, however, I would advise not to put it (stop-loss) in on an electronic platform option strategy, because it will likely get triggered when it shouldn't have due to liquidity. In this instance, if you have a system that can evaluate your option position at any given time, you will be able to see where the value is, so just know where your stop-loss level is and if your theo value gets there then you have to have the discipline to get out.) Which brings me to...\n\n3. DISCIPLINE!\n\nDo not move your stop-loss. If it gets triggered, accept it and walk away. The same can be said for booking profits. Profit is what is booked; all else is book profits. Keep taking your money off the table at regular intervals. There is NOTHING WRONG with making a profit. YOu may see something go further afterward, but that's fine, you have MADE MONEY and that's all that counts. I personally would use a trailing stop, which moves up along with my profitable trade.\n\n4. NEVER LET A WINNING TRADE TURN INTO A LOSING ONE.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I have used a stop that moves up with my winners (eg; I book the profit if it retraces 10% off any recent high if it hasn't got to my target) but once clear and in the money at the very least put in a stop that will get you out for no loss.\n\n5. NEVER CHASE/ADD TO A LOSER\n\nDo not add to your position if your position is losing and you cant bear to take a loss, this is not a winning strategy. If your strategy is to average into a trade over a price range then that is totally fine, but doubling down in the hope the market will turn will burn you to the ground eventually.\n\n6. DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER\n\nThis is very important especially if you have had to book a loss. Traders tend to look back and over analyse. Also, when traders book profits and the stock goes further up, they tend to look back at the notional losses. Both are not advisable as they tend to detract from your core trading strategy.\n\n7. DON'T OVERTRADE/TRADE OUT OF BOREDOM.\n\nNot trading is also a strategy. This is something most traders tend to miss. Traders believe that trading strategy either means to buy or to sell in the market. But the most productive strategy can be to not do anything. This is very relevant when the market is very confusing and traders can get hit either way. Have your own plan and STICK TO IT!\n\n8. COSTS SHOULD BE CALCULATED INTO YOUR STRATEGY\n\nRemember, when you trade your cost is not just the brokerage you pay. There are all kinds of other charges like stamp duty, turnover tax, exchange fees etc. If you take delivery of shares, there are also expenses related to your account. The point being, that I know of traders who have grossed over $2mil at a firm and seen every penny of it eaten up by costs. And then there is margin. For all of you options and futures traders and anyone else who trades on margin, you should have a good understanding of how changes in a position may require more money to maintain them, even if they are doing well. All these costs and how margin changes (how much capital you'll need to maintain the position) over time need to be factored in when you project your trading profits and entering the trade.\n\n9. BE AWARE OF OVERNIGHT RISK\n\nDecide on a strategy that you like and stick with it market. Positions are normally intraday or for a few days. One of the biggest risks you need to be conscious of if the overnight risk. When there is uncertainty on the economic or geopolitical risk or there is a major event coming up, it is always advisable to be as light in the market as possible or at least understand what you really have at risk if things go pear-shaped but you're not there to do anything about it.\n\n10. STAY ON THE SIDE OF MOMENTUM\n\nWhen you are a trader, trend is your friend. You are more likely to make money as a trader if you trade according to the momentum. Trying to short a bull market does not make sense. Similarly, trying to catch a falling knife is also not the right idea. You trading strategy should be aligned to the direction of the momentum.\n\nRemember that there is NO WISHING, HOPING OR PRAYING. This isnt a game, you are here to make money. Decide on a strategy that you like and stick with it. If you stick to rules, learn from your mistakes, be humble and respect the market and you will become a successful trader.\n\nsource: [https://www.leviathanfm.com/blog/golden-rules](https://www.leviathanfm.com/blog/golden-rules)", "id": "13fmmo9", "created_utc": 1683901387.0, "score": 476, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: 1.
