{"title": "Nobel Economist Paul Krugman says the economy is doing better than people think and \"those recession calls were clearly a false alarm\"", "selftext": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/paul-krugman-economy-nyt-recession-unemployment-growth-2023-5\n\nAmericans are still fretting over a potential recession, but the economy is actually faring much better than most people think, according to Nobel economist Paul Krugman.\n\nIn an op-ed for the New York Times on Monday, Krugman pointed to widespread pessimism about the US economy, despite indicators that show economic activity is fairly healthy.\n\nThough 93% of CEOs expect the economy to tip into a recession within the next 18 months, according to the Conference Board's latest survey, Krugman noted that the job market is the strongest it's been in decades, with the US adding 6 million jobs since December 2021. The unemployment rate has also dropped to its lowest level since the 1960s, while job satisfaction is at an all-time-high.\n\nAnd while inflation was a top concern for Americans in 2022, prices have been coming down for much of the past year, cooling to 4.9% in the April Consumer Price Index report. That's over 500 basis-points lower from where prices where in June 2022, when inflation notched a 41-year-high of 9.1%.\n\n\"The interesting question now is why, at least according to some surveys, the public remains very negative on the economy – as negative as it has been in the past amid severe economic downturns – even though those recession calls were clearly a false alarm, and the economy is actually looking remarkably strong,\" Krugman said. \n\nMarkets grew particularly skittish about recession risks last year when the US slipped into a technical recession defined by two straight quarters of negative GDP growth.\n\nBut official recessions are declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which uses other data to determine if the US is truly in a recession. So far, those other indicators say that it is not, Krugman said. \n\nHe speculated that the gloomy outlook on the economy stemmed from Americans who were assuming others were facing economic difficulties, though most people themselves are still dealing with upbeat personal fortunes. The odds of a future recession have also been widely publicized through media reports, which could be creating a negative bias.\n\n\"While many Americans tell surveys that things are terrible – which says something about how people respond to surveys and where they get their information, this doesn't contradict positive assessment,\" Krugman added.\n\nStill, other experts have warned a downturn is still possible this year as the Fed signals it will keep interest rates high. Bank of America strategists said a downturn could start as soon as this quarter, judging by a notorious bond market indicator that predicted the recessions of 1990, 2001, and 2008.", "id": "13kk16m", "created_utc": 1684371939.0, "score": 730, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 497, "comments": [{"body": "isn’t he the guy who is always wrong on an almost jim cramer level?", "score": 626, "replies": [{"body": "Economics in theory is vastly different from practice.

Theyre fine with bailouts to the banks because they will swallow the liquidity through other measures to prevent banks from loaning the money out... but youre seeing banks collapse around you left and right and inflation is still way higher than normal.... no logical person would conclude that everything is fine and we will get through this and the market will start pumping again... were about to get rocked this year on the stock market and main street will see work dry up over the next 2 to 3 years.

It's a fairly complex financial event that can occur when the underlying stock price begins to move sharply, due in large part to the actions of market makers who sell options contracts.*\n\n*Let me break this down a bit further:*\n\n*In options trading, an investor can buy a \"call option,\" which gives them the right (but not the obligation) to buy a stock at a certain price before a certain date. The seller of that option is often a market maker, which is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell a particular stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price.*\n\n*Market makers aim to remain neutral and not be exposed to price changes in the underlying stock. So when they sell a call option, they will often \"hedge\" their risk by buying some of the underlying stock.*\n\n*Here's where \"gamma\" comes in: Gamma is a measure of how much the market maker needs to adjust their hedge (i.e., how many shares of the underlying stock they need to buy or sell) for a given change in the stock price. If the stock price begins to move up, the market maker needs to buy more of the stock to stay hedged. This buying can push the stock price up even further.*\n\n*Now, a \"gamma squeeze\" can occur if the stock price starts to move up rapidly. This can happen due to actual positive news about the company or speculative trading behavior, like a short squeeze. In this scenario, the market makers need to buy a lot of the underlying stock quickly to stay hedged. This buying can cause the stock price to move up even more quickly, which forces the market makers to buy even more stock, and so on. This is the \"squeeze\" – the rapid upward price movement fueled by the need to hedge options positions.*\n\n*Keep in mind that this is a simplification of a complex financial process. There are many factors at play in options trading and stock price movements, and not every rapid price increase is a gamma squeeze.*", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you AI 🥰", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Supposedly more ndx calls have been traded recently than in the past 9 years.\n\nRemember TSLA gamma squeeze to ath?

Just as each note in sheet music is precisely written out to create a specific sound, each line of traditional code is written to achieve a specific result.*\n\n*On the other hand, neural networks are more like jazz, in the sense that while they do have a basic structure (like a jazz standard), they can improvise and generate new, unpredictable outputs based on the data they receive. Just as a jazz musician might improvise a solo based on the chord changes of a song, a neural network \"improvises\" by using learned patterns to process data and generate an output that wasn't specifically programmed by a developer.*\n\n*In both cases, you need an understanding of the underlying principles to create the music or the code. For sheet music, you need to understand notation, rhythm, melody, and harmony. For traditional code, you need to understand the programming language, algorithms, and data structures. For jazz, you need to understand the basic chord changes and song structure, but you also need to be able to listen, adapt, and create on the fly. For neural networks, you need to understand the basic structure of the network and the principles of machine learning, but the network also learns from data and adapts its output accordingly.*\n\n*One more parallel between jazz and neural networks is that sometimes, even the performers/developers themselves can be surprised by what comes out. A jazz musician might play an unexpected lick that sounds great, or a neural network might find an unexpected pattern in the data that provides new insights.*\n\n*Just as with jazz, however, this improvisation can also lead to unexpected and less than ideal results.

A survey in 2011 found that 61% of unmarried men and 49% of women aged 18-34 were not in any kind of romantic relationship, a rise of almost 10% from five years earlier.” \n\n“Around 42 percent of the men and 44.2 percent of the women admitted they were virgins.” \n\nSo there are 42% of Japanese men in that age group must be at least a couple of million potential customers. How many of these you could convert to actual sales I don’t know. \n\nThere’s the argument with rising house costs and living expenses that people fear they will never be able to afford a family and a house etc: “\"It's too troublesome,\" says Kishino, when I ask why he's not interested in having a girlfriend. \"I don't earn a huge salary to go on dates and I don't want the responsibility of a woman hoping it might lead to marriage.\" Japan's media, which has a name for every social kink, refers to men like Kishino as \"herbivores\" or soshoku danshi (literally, \"grass-eating men\"). Kishino says he doesn't mind the label because it's become so commonplace. He defines it as \"a heterosexual man for whom relationships and sex are unimportant\".”\n\nFound this on the same article which is weirdly relevant: “Aoyama cites one man in his early 30s, a virgin, who can't get sexually aroused unless he watches female robots on a game similar to Power Rangers.” \n\nPersonally I’m inclined to agree with you.
