A call today with a narrow bid/ask could be a wide bid/ask tomorrow, and vice versa, since competition for contracts varies over time.\n\n> and when I sell or buy it always gets the bad end of that. \n\nI'm going to guess this is because you are using a market order instead of a limit order.

I trade fairly wide spreads on OTM contracts and never pay the ask nor sell for the bid.\n\nBTW, a .30/.40 spread is NOT a \"very large spread\". Try .30/1.69. That's a wide spread.

A lot of Apple's value is based on anti-Chinese trade war activity. The gov's foreign policy basically revolves around attacking the foreign economies that can support US big tech rivals nowadays, and you can link market moves to significant policy actions. Every time Chinese tech stocks start to recover, like last Winter, there's a new round of escalation of US foreign policy hostility, like Chinese balloons, anti-foreign-investment legislation, a big ratchet up in chips tech barriers to Chinese companies, more arms to Taiwan, bringing the Philippines into taking a newly aggressive South China Sea stance and so on.  All of that I just mentioned, is just what has happened in the first 2 quarters of this year. There is very high correlation to tech stock valuations moves and changes in US foreign policy actions. Notice that conservative and liberal presidential administrations both seem to have trouble producing long-overdue privacy and anti-trust legislation that might constrain some tech giant practices. \n\nThe same is true of energy prices and US energy policy. US energy policy is currently correlated more to keeping energy prices down and keeping energy stocks volatile enough to terrify retail investors from investing in them, than it is correlated to long term planning (actual supply and demand and production issues). Driving down energy prices by historic levels of Strategic Petroleum reserve dumping, to the point where it destabilizes energy markets and energy stock investments, is obviously short term thinking aimed at creating scary energy prices market volatility and other market manipulation, and not reasonable long term energy policy, when you consider that energy demand has been rising, not falling, over time. \n\nMost US foreign policies and other policies are tightly correlated to stock market and other investment asset driven agendas, i.e. market manipulations, which is why, in my opinion, lawmakers and executives in government should be forced to divest from any investments that can be affected by their lawmaking. But that's just my personal opinion. \n\nOne thing that is clear, is that Buffet does not account for federal market interventions, foreign policy agendas and other ways that government can rig a commodity or stock market, in his forecasting.

The current generation of online investors are like the rest of their generation: they refuse to admit or acknowledge that crony capitalism exists in our democracy. This current generation of online Americans are, in fact, completely incapable of thinking critically about what our federal government does or of driving any reforms in regulations or policies. All they care about, being raised on social media, is personality, culture wars and social capital (popularity and influence). They have no way to think about, or debate, political leaders' policies and governance. \n\nCurrent generations are 100% social media creatures and have never developed that part of their brains that enable them to engage in a democracy in any way other than teaming up with the political group that expresses the social culture they want to side with and trolling/bashing the other side. This is why US politics has devolved into populism. The ability of Democrats to critically review or debate what a Democratic president's administration is doing, or how it does things, or the ability of Republicans to criticize or debate what a Republican president's administration does or how it does things, literally does not exist today. Everything that is not supportive of the side you are on, is taken as an attack. \n\nPeople have entirely replaced any critical thinking or discussion about governance with online social herd behavior. This is why Western-led global politics and global trade are reversing to cold wars, shooting wars and trade wars: the American public really only cares about personalities and social culture and most other discussion about governance too complicated to fit into a short form video or tweet just does not exist. \n\nThe trade war vs China is really obvious, but people become outraged if you try to mention it. In the 1970's and 1980's the US did almost exactly the same things to break Japan's rising economic and technical momentum, right down to characterizing Japan's ability to produce advanced semiconductors as a national security threat. The trade wars vs Japan and the national security threat rhetoric didn't let up until Japan was successfully steered into a long period of economic stagnation. The difference between then and now is that people weren't too biased to call what the US was doing back then as trade protectionism, or admit the impact of the trade war and tariffs on inflation. Now, people cannot discuss any of that, or even admit to a tech trade war, and everyone acts mystified about how inflation wasn't transient and why it's persistent. And then they claim that market moves are irrational.\n\nThe government, if it is in your own party's hands, is automatically right in everything they do, and any criticism is either a conspiracy theory or the trolling of a left-wing or right-wing shill. If most young people online are Democrats, then crony capitalism only exists when a Republican president is in office.

A lively being, resembling a squirrel, was gifted to the boy by an enigmatic stranger. This creature, named Whiskers, was brimming with life, an embodiment of the spirit of the townsfolk, their tales, their wisdom, and their shared laughter.\n\nHowever, an unexpected encounter with a flamboyantly blue hound named Azure, a plaything of a cunning, opulent merchant, set them on an unanticipated path. The hound, a spectacle to behold, was the product of a mysterious alchemical process, a design for the merchant's profit and amusement.\n\nOn returning from their encounter, the boy noticed a transformation in Whiskers. His fur, like Azure's, was now a startling indigo, and his vivacious energy seemed misdirected, drawn into putting up a show, detached from his intrinsic playful spirit. Unknowingly, the boy found himself playing the role of a puppeteer, his strings tugged by unseen hands. Whiskers had become a spectacle for the townsfolk, and in doing so, the essence of the town, their shared stories, and collective wisdom began to wither.\n\nRecognizing this grim change, the townsfolk watched as their unity and shared knowledge got overshadowed by the spectacle of the transformed Whiskers. The boy, once their symbol of unity, was unknowingly becoming a merchant himself, trading Whiskers' spirit for a hollow spectacle.\n\nThe transformation took a toll on Whiskers, leading him to a point of deep disillusionment. His once playful spirit was dulled, his energy drained, and his essence, a reflection of the town, was tarnished. In an act of desolation and silent protest, Whiskers chose to leave. His departure echoed through the town like a mournful wind, an indictment of what they had allowed themselves to become.\n\nThe boy, left alone, began to play with the merchants, seduced by their cunning words and shiny trinkets. He was drawn into their world, their games, slowly losing his vibrancy, his sense of self. Over time, the boy who once symbolized unity and shared knowledge was reduced to a mere puppet, a plaything in the hands of the merchants.\n\nEventually, the merchants, having extracted all they could from him, discarded the boy, leaving him a hollow husk, a ghost of his former self.

My subscriptions (you seem to know Amazon so you know there's a discount and a second one if you get more than 5 or so items each period monthly, bimonthly, etc.).  Well mine generally comes in several boxes but despite that they still repeatedly pack rat poison with foods and medicine. Powdered rat poison gas ended up on food.  It doesn't take a genius packing boxes not to mix these not a genius programmer to not let automation do this.  Poisons and chemicals should go out boxed separately.  They've been doing it for well over 6 months and every time they just refund it all and I toss the stuff in the garbage.  \n\nI'm taking your comment sorta as a \"Hmm well here's what I'm experiencing.\" But my point is the change in delivery service, warehouse packing service (I got power towels wrapped in shipping packaging???), and customer service is now just abysmal.  They claim to be the most customer centric company in the planet.  They just are not anymore (they once were!).  I imagine Canadian operations and laws differ from US ones.  But even if it is a mistake falsely advertised items is illegal in the US and our FTC will levy 6-7 figure fines depending on chronicity and severity.  Either do 2 day shipping or stop saying you will both in general and on the item you lust it on.
