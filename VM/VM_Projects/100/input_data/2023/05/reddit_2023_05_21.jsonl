{"title": "We Have Had 2 Recessions And 2 Bear Markets in 3 Years, Will It Be 3 In Just 4 Years?", "selftext": "I have watched the stock market since the 1970s. Never in my life have I seen so many people think a recession was coming before. Yet this has gone on for about 9 months, and no recession. In fact, when recessions do come it is normally when people are optimistic. The below charts confirm my perception is correct, it terms of maximum recession fears.  (Note for charts, symbols and links search for the title of this post and you will find the article that has them)\n\n\r  \n\"Since 1973, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has been polling small businesses on their outlook on the U.S. economy and business conditions in general. In April, the NFIB’s Optimism Index sank to 89, the lowest reading in a decade and, as the organization points out, the 16th straight month below the 49-year average of 98.\n\n\r  \nWhen asked if the next three months were a good time to expand, only 3% of small businesses said yes in April—meaning 97%, or nearly all, said no. This is slightly up from 2% in March, but on a three-month moving average, the reading is 3.7%. That’s the lowest point since March 2009, when the S&P 500 bottomed during the financial crisis.\" This quote is from an article that thinks things will get worse but provides valuable info.\n\n\r  \nCould we have 2 recessions in 3 years? Think that happened in late 1978-1980. Well, it just happened again, in 2020 and 2022. In 2022 2Qs in a row of lower GDP, the classical definition of a recession. Yet a politician declared the rules did not count anymore and news organizations, who are aligned with him, went along and pretended it did not happen. Will we have 3 recessions in 4 years? We had none for the 11 years before that. To the best we know the USA has never had 3 recessions in 4 years. Yet as the chart above shows 97% think now is not a good time to grow a business, they are fearing recession.\r  \nWe have never had a Covid like shutdown in USA history. Commodity demand boomed coming out of that. China is the biggest commodity user in world, and they just ended a far longer shutdown. So that should cause an even bigger boom in demand, and it is starting already.\n\n\r  \nSupply? Copper has lowest stockpiles to use ratio ever is an example. Bringing on copper and nickel mines, etc. is super slow, and oil is also slow, but faster than copper.\n\n\r  \nI agree commodities look great here, and their producers. Canada oils are maybe the cheapest and highest potential stocks out there. 1 to 3 PEs, high growth and high dividends. One I have has a monthly dividend yield near 1% and is about 3 PE. That is after it has 20 bagged for me since 2020. Maybe you are doing the math on that now, yes that means I am getting near 200% dividends per year on my investment, on top of the 20 bagger. I bought more of it this week.\n\n\r  \nSo, to sum it up why would we go into a commodity recession, after 2 recessions in 3 years and with the biggest user just ending the biggest lockdown likely ever in world history?\n\n\r  \nSomething to think about, when we are hearing the opposite over and over. During the worst of Dotcom crash that started in 2000, in which the NASDAQ crashed about 90%, people were less frightened than today. Imagine what will happen if we go from 3% thinking the future is OK to a still dismal 21% thinking so?  It would be 7 times more businesses investing to expand and thus increasing commodity demand a great deal.\n\n\r  \nCheers", "id": "13o4poo", "created_utc": 1684699274.0, "score": 460, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 193, "comments": [{"body": "Everyone seems to keep forgetting Covid policy was wild and exaggerated the markets.

This will cause a huge slowdown in consumer spending – hence the repeated pauses and reluctance to begin forcing everyone to pay off their loans. \r\n\r\nAlso, republicans are pushing for rate cuts wherever they can get them – meaning less money for government spending. Less money for programs such as the CHIPS act giving semiconductor manufacturers $50bn of taxpayer money to “compete” with other superpowers. \r\n\r\nMarkets have rallied, at least according to financial propaganda, because both republicans and democrats are negotiating for a deal and it appears likely the debt ceiling will be raised by the deadline.

I would rather bet on TSMC (being higher in the chain) than NVDA.\n\nRegarding TSLA if you actually wanna go the pump & dump route (how many promises has TSLA kept from its forecasts regarding the availability and specifications of technologies? Self driving? Tesla bot? Battery exchange? Solar roofs? Tesla Semi?…) why don’t you invest in Memecoins? PEPE had an enormous growth!\n\nAt the end of the day BYD is much more interesting than TSLA which has to lower prices consecutively to keep up with the sales numbers. The cybertruck isn’t even out and Ford has already the F150 giving it hard competition. In the sports car range Porsche Taycan Turbo S has beaten the model S performance not only regarding performance but also built quality, safety features & quick charging. In the mid range tier KIA EV9 seems also to be a better pickup. Low-end tier (which TSLA doesn’t even offer although it was promised for years to have stuff below 20K) BYD is dominating the whole market and has surpassed VW in sales.\nNot to mention that APPL is working on a high-end fully self-driving car that can be called on-demand using a subscription system — GOOGL is also heading into the market.\nSo good luck regarding the future performance of your TSLA stock!\nMaybe the issue relies in the fact that we are different investor types — short term gambling vs long term investing — could be the answer given the explanations you mentioned…\n\nSorry I regret that I even replied (I‘m usually not in this sub active and just reading here & there based on notifications).
