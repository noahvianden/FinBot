I've bought at $15 (split adjusted) and never sold anything. Went through very high highs and very large setbacks. I've always understood that the company is trading far above financial valuation so I was ok with the lows.\n\nMore importantly I actually know the company beyond it's p/e ratio and always had a good understanding for the reasons as to why their revenue/earnings rose or fell. I was even the person that added \"artificial intelligence\" as one of their industries on Nvidia's wikipedia. I don't mind that their inventory of gaming GPUs is currently building because it has happened like 15 times before in the company's history. It's literally why NVDA used to be a cyclical stock. I'm saying \"used\" because I believe they're moving away from that.\n\nToday more people than ever talk about NVDA stock but it's always a very superficial discussion, mostly revolving around how ridiculous their PE ratio is and how AI is supposed to be a buzzword. NVDA has had several different hypes and commentators consistently missed the point. They only talk about the current thing (crypto/metaverse/ai) on a not very in depth level and miss the various things NVDA is doing.\n\nBarely anyone seems to understand their investment as an investment in the company. People always throw around financial metrics of the stock rather than discussing what is actually fundamentlly going on with the company.\n\nnoone talks about their rising automotive prdocuts and partnerships\n\nnoone talks about their digital twin solutions (anymore)\n\nnoone talks about the Mellanox part of the company\n\nnoone talks about wht they're doing in healthcare\n\n...\n\nPeople literally think NVDA's AI-story is just them providing the chips for AI. Meanwhile Jensen Huang stated years ago that chips are irrelevant in the long run and it's all about software. They've been transitioning to software for over a decade now. Their R&D has been going to software mostly for ages. They've used software to sell their hardware since damn PhysX and theyve become extremely good at it (CUDA, RTX, DLSS, Broadcast...).\n\nRetail is bearish on NVDA while it's at $700B market cap. It's not a TSLA type of situation where there's a gigantic cult following helping fuel the stock and the products. NVDA is at $700B market cap because of institutional buying. Because of people buying that take more than 10 minutes to \"research\" NVDA. Because of professionals buying with way more information available to them than a retail investor could ever have.\n\nI can only laugh at retail NVDA bears today. Yes the current valuation could turn out to be too rich right now, but the company is still one of the highest quality companies on earth and it makes sense to be invested in it.\n\nRight now if someone doesnt have a position in NVDA then yes Id say its an extremely risky investment at this valuation, there's no point in denying that. But someone who is actually interested in investing in NVDA as a company will simply buy some NVDA now, buy some more in 3 months and buy even more in 6, 9 and 12 months. Then theyll have invested in NVDA with reasonable risk.\n\nNoone talks about such things though. Since NVDA has caught the masses' attention the discussion is full of bullshit.

Buying stocks at half their intrinsic value based on DCA to perpetuity, then selling them when they correct to intrinsic value within 1-3 years, is a perfectly legitimate strategy and an example of what I just said. \n\nThe idea that it has to generate its own market cap within 10 years to be worth it only makes sense if you expect to sell the stock for $0 at the end of those 10 years. \n\n>This is why I'm using a long time frame, not short time frame. Year to year returns are pretty chaotic. \n\nOkay, so how about 5 years? You'll find the expected return is still negative, but less negative. How about 15 years? You'll find the expected **annual** return becomes more and more positive. *The longer you forecast out under your method, the better your* ***annual*** *return projections will look*. This is because your system is inherently flawed. \n\nAlso, you're not using a market cap to GVA model because that is a model used to value the S&P or american business as a whole and simply cannot be applied to a single business, as a single business does not have a GVA number in the same way it does not have a GDP number. I've just read Hussman's blog post, introducing market cap/GVA, and he talks exclusively about using it to value the S&P. Also, don't know how relevant it is, but Hussman has returned about 2% a year over the past decade so I don't know if it would be wise to listen to him. \n\nAs for the last bit about Buffett and Munger - in the first quote, Buffett is talking about the DCF model. He is making a comedic parallel between Aesop's quote and the correct way to value something, the DCF. \n\nIn the second quote, Munger is talking about how, while DCFs are correct in theory, they are not useful to the investor in practice (so long as you understand the concept behind them - which is that future cash flows are worth less than present ones, and that a business is worth the present value of its future cash flows). I agree with this - while DCFs are technically correct, they are not hugely helpful and I haven't physically written one out in years. Understand, though, that what Buffett (along with all good investors) is doing in his head is effectively an imprecise DCF. That's what the next couple quotes are about, too. That using a DCF gives the illusion of accuracy via precision in your maths, when the real source of uncertainty is the business's future prospects. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now for a quick bit of honesty - I have never argued with anyone quite so infuriating as you.
