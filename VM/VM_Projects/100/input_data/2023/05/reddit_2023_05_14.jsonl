{"title": "Money Supply Falling Rapidly", "selftext": " The Money Supply Has Plummeted In The Biggest Drop Since The Great Depression. The last time the year-over-year change in the money supply slipped into negative territory was in November 1994. (Bond crash).  \n\n\nMoney supply growth can often be a helpful measure of economic activity and an indicator of coming recessions. During periods of economic boom, money supply tends to grow quickly as commercial banks make more loans. Recessions, on the other hand, tend to be preceded by slowing rates of money supply growth.  \n\n\nThe fact that the money supply is shrinking at all is so remarkable because the money supply almost never gets smaller. The money supply has now fallen by $2.2 trillion (or 10.2 percent) since the peak in April 2022. Proportionally, the drop in money supply since 2022 is the largest fall we've seen since the Depression. (Rothbard estimates that in the lead up to the Great Depression, the money supply fell by 12 percent from its peak of $73 billion in mid-1929 to $64 billion at the end of 1932.)  \n\n\nThis all points toward rapidly declining economic activity in an economy where real savings and investments have been hollowed out by more than a decade of easy money. Bitcoin has only ever existed in easy money. Easy money, easy gains. ...

They studied the spread of COVID in a restaurant.  Patrons who sat under an air conditioning vent all contracted COVID while patrons sitting nearby did not.  This illustrates something called minimal viral load.  The virus might be in the air but to get COVID, you need to get a certain minimum amount.  So, you can see how masks work.

The US government has an unprecedented amount of debt.

So my idea is that they'll cut rates eventually or at least let them be significantly below inflation so the government can inflate the debt away, QE when nobody wants to buy the bonds anymore.\n\nBut we might be a long way until there, a recession might speed all that up. Many indicators are already pointing towards a recession, the market is held up by a few mega cap names while the SP500 equally weighted trades like shit. It's not bullish if everyone hides in more and more narrow names at insane p/e's. Apart from rates, the FED continues to perform QT for now which drains liquidity of the market. Once the debt ceiling is resolved, this will drain massive amount of liquidity as well since a lot has to be refinanced at once. One could argue that the rally over the recent months is partly fueled by excess liquidity because none went into new bond issuances... Excess liquidity means higher asset prices, as seen very well after COVID and the following QE. All of this, adding geopolitical problems has me quite bearish on the economy and asset prices over the next months and maybe years but good buying opportunities for well-run companies will present themselves after shit hit the fan.\n\nTl;Dr: I think the FED might be forced to cut and QE once the recession actually starts, they will want to raise more because this is gonna fuel inflation again but they're gonna be constrained by the debt/GDP.

He's big into networking.  The general vibe is caution.  Many are anticipating a recession later in the year.  This is in part why you might see some high revenue and profits from companies, especially early this year.\n\nThis is almost entirely a supply chain problem, one on a global scale that needs to sort itself out.\n\nWhen Covid hit, it forced a lot of industries to shut down, lose employees, erode away any safety stock, and create a void of demand.  Equally, these companies had to restart, find employees, somehow buy inventory and materials when everyone was short, and make product.  The huge suck out was massive.  It hit quite hard summer to fall of 2021.  Companies found huge challenging buying parts and materials.  Something you could get in a day or two had 6 month long lead times.  The cost of steel quadrupled almost overnight and you could hardly get any.  Many businesses saw massive negative margins when reviewing the 2021 year and planning for 2022 pricing.  Many companies were forced to raise sell prices by 60% to 100% or more to cover huge cost, inventory, and logistics issues.  2022 rolled through, and the supply chain was still terrible.  Some areas got better by spring/summer, but some markets are still out a year on lead time even today.  Price adjustments again went up 10% to 20% again for the 2023 season.  This is just to get margins back to normal at all the market costing.  I want to be clear.  This is a global efficiency problem.  There are many, many factors that are generating micro and compounding inefficiencies at every layer of every process, and everyone ultimately is seeing costs go up and up.  It all rolls through to the end consumer.  You pay for it all.\n\n2023 is the first season where businesses have finally adjusted likely completely to the higher costs seen from 2021 and 2022.  For 2021 many companies were negative margin.  For 2022, many companies had very lean margin and scarcely break even on the whole.  2023 seems to revenue and profit rich only because margin has finally adjusted up to pretty normal percentages.  At higher input costs, this does equal higher revenue and profit dollars.\n\nBut, there's a catch.  Consumers aren't more cash rich.  If you don't have more money in your pocket, you aren't buying more from companies.  Yes, per sale, there's more revenue and profit, but through the year, it may be likely that the late season will be lean on sales.  Additionally, the supply chain is still not fixed.  For example, steel is still 2x the price it's supposed to be, even a couple years later.  At some point, companies will find consumers wallets will run dry.  There's also other issues like inflation, several areas of the supply chain not really getting much better, and companies still struggling with cash flow.  Ultimately, the sentiment is leaning towards some level of recession later in the year.\n\nNow all of this is an efficiency problem, so it's all on the back of the world wide supply chain.  If it gets better, costs will go down.  If it gets worse, costs will go up.  Additionally, it depends on consumer wealth and lending interest, so it depends on what further actions the government takes.\n\nFor businesses, it's basically a hold pattern.  Q1 and Q2 look hot, but it's a flash in the pan, a lot of show.  What will really matter is Q3 and Q4.  If they hold strong, we likely won't have a recession, and we should even out at the bottom in the market.  If Q3 and Q4 are sales light, then you'll see that drop.  Now, if the supply chain also improves, this still could counter loss of sales.  Pricing won't really adjust until Jan 2024, so light sales with low costs still equals strong revenue and profits.  The margins will just go high.  What'd be nice to see is the supply chain improve appreciably to allow prices to drop for once.  This can mean consumers could see a sell price drop for the first time in years which will yield improved buying power and sales.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Are you suggesting Seana Smith a well known reporter at YF is using ChatGPT to help her write the article?\n\nIf so kudos to her as long as she doesn't report incorrect facts and edits carefully!", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "I was just referring to your thread content.

{"title": "Third time is a charm? Nearing the End - long post", "selftext": " I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.\n\nI am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.\n\n# When will this tight range end?\n\nWay back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.\n\nWhats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.\n\nA couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):\n\n1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.\n2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)\n3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.\n\nI have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.\n\n# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?\n\nSo a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.\n\nHere is what has happened recently:\n\n# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:\n\n1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.\n   1. [Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Could Cut Production At Any Time | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Minister-Says-OPEC-Could-Cut-Production-At-Any-Time.html)\n2. Then there is this: [Iraq And Iran Ignore U.S. Sanctions In Talks To Expand Energy Ties | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Iraq-And-Iran-Ignore-US-Sanctions-In-Talks-To-Expand-Energy-Ties.html)\n3.

So bad that the Arab league suspended Syria's membership in 2011.\n   1. Of course, the NeoCons in the US govt respond by doing this: [US lawmakers introduce bill to combat normalization with Syria's Assad (yahoo.com)](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-combat-135934548.html)\n\nThe Middle East seems to be getting MORE peaceful, not less, Israel excluded of course. Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.\n\nIf the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.\n\n# RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.\n\n# TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS\n\nLots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen. I don't know if the US will default, probably not a full default anyway. BUT, the mere appearance of the possibility of the US defaulting will cause risk assets to plummet.\n\n1.

[McCarthy blasts Biden after White House debt ceiling meeting (axios.com)](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/mccarthy-biden-white-house-debt-ceiling-meeting)\n\nLook, they will raise the debt ceiling at some point. The question is how long it will take and who will blink first. However, the longer it takes, the more nervous the markets become.\n\nDon't forget this too: ***The Treasury General Account fell to $154 billion, down from $184 billion on May 9th. In fact, at this rate, the account will be EMPTY on May 19th. OPEX.***\n\nDon't be fooled by the chatter of deals and more deals. Yes, a deal will get done but the point is the SP500 is not trading like there is any concern.\n\n# RESULT: The empty TGA will force the US government to RAISE rates it offers to investors to fund operations. Raising rates is bad for the market.\n\n# TRIGGER #3: SHORT SELLING BAN on bank stocks.\n\nBeyond the hypocrisy of this, compounded by the fact that other than Yellen, the main spokesperson trumpeting this idea is the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon, is the fact that the last time they did this in 2008 after Lehman, 3 months later the XLF was down 51%.\n\n1. [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants US regulators to consider a ban on the short selling of bank stocks | Business Insider India](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-wants-us-regulators-to-consider-a-ban-on-the-short-selling-of-bank-stocks/articleshow/100169845.cms)\n2.

IF IT OCCURS, BYE BYE MARKET.\n\n# TRIGGER #4: MONEY IS LEAVING AAPL.\n\nAAPL is close to an all time high. As AAPL goes so goes the market. AAPL's earnings S U C K E D unless you are a fan of gains due to outsourcing of labor overseas. Also, Foxconn, AAPL's largest supplier, reported a 56% drop in net income ( [Apple supplier Foxconn's Q1 profit plunges, outlook \"conservative\" | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-supplier-foxconns-q1-profit-falls-56-yy-worse-than-forecasts-2023-05-11/) ). Oh and Samsung Electronics profit fell 95% in first quarter. But yeah, AAPL is fine.\n\nBut while the stock is going up, money is leaving:\n\n1. 2 billion left the stock May 5\n   1. Money flowed in May 10th\n2.

Sure, that makes sense.***\n\n# RESULT: AAPL rolling over will pull the techs and the rest of the market down.\n\n# All it will take is FOR ONE OF THE ABOVE THINGS TO HAPPEN and the market goes down.\n\n# But wait, thats not all. Here are some possible \"canaries in the coal mine\":\n\n# The VVIX, which is the volatility of the VIX, is going UP when the VIX is being manipulated going down. HUH?\n\n1. The UAE announced a $10 billion short position on US stocks last week. What's odd is how public this announcement was.\n   1. I believe this was another warning to Washington to knock off their manipulation of the oil markets.\n   2. Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.\n\n# OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:\n\n1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance.\n2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things.\n3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired. By the way, this is the great idea our leaders Washington have if China invades: [US Threatens To 'Blow Up' Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Firm If China Invades The Island; Taipei Unhappy (eurasiantimes.com)](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-threatens-to-blow-up-taiwans-semiconductor-manufacturing/) WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS LIKE US...\n4.

Trucking rates are WORSE than the 2019 \"Trucking Bloodbath\" when 10 large trucking companies went bk. Truck rates are down to $1.19/mile with operating costs up $.30 mile since then. This doesnt even include rising finance costs. (thanks to Craig Fuller@freightalley on Twitter).\n5. Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.\n\n# And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%). But not this time I guess. VIX is purple, Yields are green.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tipkjui2zpza1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ada7f1cef1f3769528f987f8266d8250d930167\n\n# CONCLUSION:All it will take is for one card to fall in this humongous house of cards. And I only listed a couple of them.\n\nThe US stock market is apparently not concerned. Since the VIX is sub 17 and headed to 0.\n\nThe FED is controlling what it can. They are running out of time and money.\n\nThe next two weeks are crucial and I have little confidence in Washington <--- they will screw up enough where they can't hide it.\n\n# KEY EVENTS:\n\n* OPEX this Friday\n* TGA runs out of money - probably this Friday\n* Debt ceiling talks get ulgier - already happening.\n\n***Watch for these for a blow off top:***\n\n1. ***Celebration over universal*** *~~healthcare~~* ***FDIC insurance.***\n2. ***AAPL sets a new ATH***\n3. ***VIX collapses below 14***\n\n**Disclosure**: I am LONG VIX calls from June to October.

So i did what I always do, I find out.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I'm really struggling to see, if your goal is to be \"on the field\" so to speak, how this is a better option than doing a progressive DCA of shares into VIXY or something similar.\n\nIt seems you're taking on substantially more risk for little potential gain.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "It has to do with the way I think.  The farther out the timeline, the further away you get from the data points that originally made me make my investment decision, so the more risk and the lower probability.  I like higher prob and lower risk which caused me not to want to own anything long term.  I had some advantages such as the time to constantly be looking for investments since it was my day job.\n\nSo, over time I developed a love for options.  But not the way 90% of people use them which is as a cheaper alternative to the stock.  Thats not smart.  I use them when the variables I want are present.  I also have a LOT of actual real life experience figuring out what duration works best for what I want to accomplish.  Generally speaking, I live quarter to quarter in options bc of earnings releases.  They can be an outlier and therefore something I cannot quantify.  SO I arrived at a style where why max hold is typically 30-45 days.\n\nIn the event I am forced to hold longer, I also have the ability to roll them.  I used to use iron condors or I was a seller of premium but tbh, it was too much work, and not very effective over a large sample of trades.\n\nDollar cost averaging doesnt work for me bc when I invest, its a binary decision: its going up or going down.  If it goes opposite the direction I chose, then I was wrong and I move on.  Maybe I get stopped out and the same stock/etf comes up again on my screening process.  I enter a new trade based on new data.\n\nBut the big advantage and why I like options is leverage.  I can capture, depending on the strike relative to the underlying, 50% to 70% of the move, if I am right, for a fraction of the capital.  that results in less capital at risk which means I can have more positions.\n\nI used to tell my clients: I want to date a stock not marry it.  I totally mean it.  I dont want to have to read through all the filings, all the news, for months and years.  I want to do my analysis, make my decision, and then move on.\n\nIts probably why I enjoy daytrading also.  I dont like long term.  If I am right, I want to get paid, today.\n\nFinally, the way I do it allows me to be in cash when I want to be thereby reducing my exposure significantly.  The portfolio I post in my sub, real time, was up a lot in Feb of this year ( took january off after i retired in dec) - since then, I have given back about half bc of stops taken, but i am still up a lot.  More than you would think.  Point is, I have less time risk, less overall work bc I dont have to track every single news or filing, and I have less stress.\n\nWhat I do works fine for stocks too but I just like options.  the VIX and SPY positions are different than my core anyway -they are what I call \"story plays.\"  I am making an educated guess on what I think could happen and then calculating a probability for it, as well as my expected return if it does happen, and my loss if it doesnt.  My expected return is never less than 3x my possible loss.  usually its much higher.\n\nI hope that makes sense.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

If the news outlets (who are in bed with the banks and fed and treasury and everyone thats corrupt) are selling bearish news - that's like a sports book offering you a recommended bet. I don't think they want you to win in the long run so in general I would do the opposite of what they're saying is going to happen because they have no repercussions from being \"wrong\" (with their public predictions) and there's nothing stopping jamie from having his traders inverse what he's saying.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">  inflating dollar is bearish for the dollar in the long run\n\nThis is the misunderstanding I think. The dollar is almost surely going to keep inflating and its ability to buy real things will continue to decrease. \n\nHowever, the dollar inflating is not necessarily bearish for the dollar index. It would only be bearish for the dollar index if the dollar inflated *faster* than other currencies, which it is not. The US dollar is in the best situation right now by far compared to most of these other countries. Europe and Japan don't have nearly the same amount of room to keep their monetary policy tight. \n\nIt seems like you're confusing the relative strength of the dollar against other currencies with the absolute strength of the dollar (ability to buy real things).\n\nI agree with you that the news outlets are in bed with the banks but I don't see that much bearish stuff on the mainstream news right now, at least on Bloomberg. I would say the majority of the commentary is bullish, though it remains mixed.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thinking September UVXY calls and AAPL puts...far enough dated out??", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "thanks, gonna take an inverse position tho. not because i disagree with what you're saying, but because there're quite a few awards for a low upvote post, and my lizard senses tell me that means to take the opposite position.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "LMAO yall got infested with culty amateurs again posting nonsense novellas.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Any thoughts on the bonds", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So basically what you’re saying is the market will continue to climb a wall of worry", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "“Another regard eating crayons” post.
