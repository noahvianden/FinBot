When Warren was born, Howard had just launched his own small brokerage firm, and he was struggling to make a name for himself in the financial world.  \n\nOnce he was old enough, Buffett went to work in his grandparent’s grocery store, but that wasn’t his only source of income. He had a paper route, he collected lost golf balls and sold them back to players, and he developed the skills necessary to quickly and efficiently detail cars. \n\nThrough his various projects, including his paper route, Buffett earned enough to make a tax return necessary when he was 14. It’s worth noting that even as a teenager, Buffett was careful about avoiding unnecessary expenses. He minimized his tax liability by deducting the use of his bicycle and his watch against the income earned through his paper route.\"\n\nDoes that sound like a spoiled son of a rich guy or a kid with a work ethic who grew up in dire times?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "How can someone be this wrong so many times and still believe he's right.

Not to mention most supply chain experts predict the implementation of some of the current proposals would actually lead to ***more*** global waste - not less.\n\nFor Right to Repair to effectively work on everyday electronics, the government needs to require businesses to produce a large surplus of parts every year - most of which will never be used. The proposals usually require the company to have a lot of extras on hand for every single part, of every single product, just in case a customer or dealer wants to buy some. Since the re-tooling of manufacturing equipment and adjustment of production lines is a very expensive and time-consuming process, most companies would be forced into producing an additional x%, of every single part, before the product's production run ends. Almost all of those parts will sit in a warehouse, collecting dust and doing absolutely nothing until the law's time requirement is met (usually 3-5 years after the last sale depending on the proposal). After that, the parts will be promptly thrown out to make space for the next rounds of useless surplus parts. The cycle will continue until we all realize how stupid the law was. Not only does it cause a bunch of extra trash/pollution, but also makes both the company and the government waste a bunch of resources. It would require a government agency and a large number of resources to effectively monitor and enforce all of the companies/products that would be affected by something like this (resources that would likely have a greater societal impact spent elsewhere).  Not to mention the vast majority of these products and parts are manufactured or assembled in foreign countries by foreign companies which makes legislating and enforcing something like this basically impossible.\n\nSo while a law like this may mean fixing certain things will be easier for ***a small percentage of people***, it will also cause the products to be more expensive and less innovative while adding to global waste, increasing the industry's barriers to entry (slower macro innovation), and more taxes/government debt ***for everyone***. Again, I love the idea behind the law but it's not very practical to implement. It would be almost impossible to keep regulations meaningful, up to date with technology, and enforced around the world without negative side effects that easily overshadow the law's benefits.\n\nRealistically, the vast majority of people don't care about fixing their own electronics. Most people already want an upgrade by the time they have a significant failure on their phone. So getting it fixed just isn't a priority for them. For those of us who like fixing things/saving a little money, if the demand is large enough (affects enough people) the market almost always provides us some sort of solution (even if they aren't \"official\" Apple parts).

And Apple isn’t sueing anyone because of it. Funnily enough, a big reason why most tech companies (and many other industries) used screw heads other than flat/Phillips is to prevent themselves from getting sued by customers who open up a product, electrocute/hurt themselves, and then try to claim they didn’t know they shouldn’t open it. \n\nAlso, nobody is stopping anyone from doing repairs, lol. The whole argument is whether Apple should be forced to maintain Apple warranties even if repairs are done by 3rd parties repair shops with unofficial parts (who may or may not know what they’re doing). For obvious reasons, Apple only wants to support warranties on repairs done by authorized dealers with authorized parts.

Like if you replaced your charging port or screen by yourself and then the CPU failed it would be wrong for them to say we aren't covering your CPU failure because of that.\n\nbut as far as like requiring someone to produce a bunch of extra repair parts, it's an interesting idea. I don't have much an opinion on it but I can imagine something like Apple refusing to sell replacement charging ports, and saying that third parties cannot license/manufacture them, to force people to buy new iphones - should be illegal. But I think most people are more on the side of just \"stop oppressing people who repair/try to repair\" not on the \"you will produce a bunch of spare parts\" side.

Heading into 2023 the bull case = earnings will exceed estimates and stocks outperform, base case= earnings meet or modestly undershoot estimates stock remains range bound and bear case= earnings estimates undershoot estimates massively and stocks re-rate with a lower multiple.  Through q1 bull case played out to a T.  And if you look at earnings estimates across the board for 2024, base case estimates are for earnings to be up 15% vs 2023.  Stocks will front run this by 6-9 months and the bear case has imploded due to earnings coming in much stronger than expected and avoiding the dreaded double dip.  Tech stocks driving the markets is not a new narrative and 70% of s and p 500 return over last 10 years is from less than 10 stocks.  So this isn’t new, it isn’t abnormal and due to market cap weighting stronger earnings from megacap tech has an outsized impact on overall s and p 500 earnings.  So your point about lack of breadth is really it relevant in the context of the market.  Buybacks from big cap, Google, meta, apple and Microsoft also create a strong buoy of buying pressure that is limiting volatility and create a low volume rally year to date.  As it relates to interest rates, you don’t really understand what rates the market is focused on when determining equity risk premium, aka premium stocks trade to bond vs cash.  That multiple is driven by interest rates but also by earnings growth not just trailing multiples and if you look at longer term rates ten year, 30 year, they are off from high at 4.4% to 3.5% currently and 4.3% to 3.8%.  The myopic view you are looking at is the remedial optic someone who isn’t in the business looks at which is fed funds rate.  We have an inverted yield curve and longer term rates peaked last fall and heading lower as inflation forecasts continue to weaken in tandem with macro economic weakness being priced in to future cuts in fed funds rate.  Market is front running this, and stocks aren’t expensive, they are very reasonably priced and will re-rate higher as we head into a cutting and easing cycle.

For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious\nmistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.\n\n\"The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground\".\n\"Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?\"\n“Idk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted\".\n\nWherever he went , \"off colour\" remarks were expressed.\n\nAt the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz\".\nAt the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: \"This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and\n FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro\".\nAt his wedding to Burry: \"I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis\".\n\nIn Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target.\nHe wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis ☄️☄️☄️. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle 🔴 . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, \"The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate\". In it, he was quoted as saying \"bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully\".\n\nConvinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts.\nHe sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98’. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color. After he ordered on uber his supper (salmon seasoned with bulls' crushed hopes and dreams, the more the better), he sat at his monitor and viewed his portfolio. To his utter\ndismay, NVIDIA had made a ALL TIME HIGH TODAY (currently at $295.47). His portfolio was shredded , pain in his heart now embedded. His puts now nearly worthless, shattered the bear who was once fearless. He didn't know what to say, think, or do, only managed a GUH as ControltheNarrative did too.\nHe eventually regained some composure, and begged the market for this to be over. When he shouted \"THIS ISNT FAIR\", that’s his mans, Burry, walked in, \"Honey, your salmon\nis here, seasoned perfectly to our liking, tonight, we shall feast like vikings.” With tears streaming down his face, Rizzly knew that he had just lost their place 🏡. The monitor, with one hand he tried to cover, and with the other halt his mate's enter. However, it was too late. Burry saw the look on Rizzly's face and [knew of their fate](https://ibb.co/xmXSZjc).\n\nAlas, my fellow regards, he was never a bear, but an ostrich with too much flair.\nAnd I, what positions do I hold? Why 30 NVIDIA 285p's of course, all told.\n\n😏 TLDR: BUY NVDA PUTS ☄️☄️☄️", "id": "13k37ln", "created_utc": 1684333377.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|427|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Rizzly is a bear who got burned by shorting NVDA.

He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.\n\nIn this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in \"puts\", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.\n\nTo fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.\n\nThe story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths. The narrator of the story then reveals their position: they hold 30 Nvidia put options, meaning they too are betting on Nvidia's stock price to decrease.\n\nThe TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of this post is: \"Buy NVDA puts\", meaning the author is advising to purchase put options for Nvidia's stock, betting that the price will drop.
