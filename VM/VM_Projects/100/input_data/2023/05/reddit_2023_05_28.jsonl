Recently, OpenAI released a new abstraction layer called Triton which works with high level languages, and aims to be more developer friendly than CUDA.  Since Triton is open source, over time I can see it growing quickly to support hardware from other companies in addition to NVIDIA and AMD. On top of this, PyTorch 2.0 provides some additional optimizations by compiling your ML code with Triton, and it already supports NVIDIA and AMD Radeon/Instinct. This can drastically cut down the effort needed to develop ML and increase the number of GPUs you can use as now you don't need to perform the optimization step with CUDA since PyTorch does it for you.\n\nI am not saying that CUDA is the only advantage NVIDIA has in this space.

They cut tons of jobs, are getting out of and selling parts of their business, and have changed employee compensation which will hurt them talent wise. \n\nAmd has had some hiccups occasionally but more importantly their CPU’s are just legitimately competitive and Intel can’t price their chips with insane numbers anymore so they have to price them a lot lower. This is an issue really every where for Intel where to get their products sold they have had to take substantial hits on margins.  \n\nThe other thing is chiplet design on most of AMD’s products means that it’s much cheaper and more efficient for them to make working CPU’s making prices easier to slim down on, making margins lower for Intel if they want to stay competitive. \n\nOther than MobileEye Intel really isn’t doing fantastic anywhere. The only place where it’s “good” is with Laptop sales and when you own 75% of the x86 laptop market it’s a lot easier to lose marketshare then to gain headway.

I know they have defense contracts for chips when they build their new foundries but that’s gonna be a while. Additionally they are what 3rd possibly even 4th place in this market. What happens when these foundries are completed ? Unless a massive discount is offered they are going to lose tons of money. \n\nThen there is the issue of roadmaps and execution. Intel has cancelled tons of products that companies were looking forward to. And a lot of companies are questioning whether said products that are being promised now are ever gonna come out. This is a really bad thing because it makes it easier for companies to make a switch. Additionally if not cancellations, extremely long delays like the delays of Sapphire Rapids. \n\nThis brings me to the last issue and probably the second biggest not named IFS.

Often touted as containing C or D list characters because they didn't have Spider-Man or the X-men.\n\nClearly the X-men are worth far more than that initial offering. The X-men side of the Marvel universe contains several times more A list characters, both heroes and villains, that they can cast younger and have characters last longer throughout the movies. They can spread out the introduction of the A list X-men to allow the MCU have a continual constant A list cast that will keep the MCU going for decades.\n\n1 billion is unbelivably underselling their worth even just going by the initial Marvel purchase, which is a ridiculous way to value them after the MCU has proven itself (and so many other cinematic universes have been attempted and failed.)\n\nThe Fantastic Four is certainly less valuable, but a couple hundred million is also ridiculous. A single movie could make that much in profit. A trilogy absolutely would. But their value, again, is the contribution to the MCU as a whole and not just as stand alone films.\n\nThe X-men stories traditionally were often completely isolated and separate from the rest of the Marvel stories, while the Fantastic Four often worked hand in hand with the Avengers and Spider-man and others and more easily integrate into the current MCU, helping to fill out holes left by the departing original Avengers and help fill in the transition to the inevitable expansion to the MCU being more and more dominated by X-men characters and stories.\n\n1 billion and a couple hundred million respective valuation is just plain ludicrous.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Na.

I.e. Apple has an iphone release and we're waiting on numbers to come out, and people speculate that sales are like +100 million but they really end up +80 million.\n\nThat's a \"sell the news\" event because the reality winds up having a lower target than the speculative information. It can also happen if the forward expectation of an event evaporates once it hits.\n\nWhat happens if AAPL get 120 million sales? Does the stock sell off?\n\nNo, in that case the stock melts up because the valuation is higher than the fundamentals position.\n\nNVDA had a case like this last week. Lots of bears thought NVDA earnings was a sell the news event because of high speculative value being higher than they thought AI-oriented hardware sales were... and it went the other direction and those bears learned a very real, serious lesson about how sayings aren't always literal.\n\nI don't have a crystal ball or anything, but the speculation around the debt ceiling was anxiety speculation, which restrains long positioning across the market. Right now, you can see that in the breadth of the market, which many people on this sub take to mean that tech stocks are getting overextended, but the reality is that breadth dynamics of great divide are actually more likely historically to push the market up (or at least the chances are indeterminant in the condition) since bullish patterns often have sector leaders that then turn into breadth thrusts, where the breadth of the rest of the market catches up.\n\nIn other words, if you ignore the runner, the rest of the market is broadly positioned in a fear state. In part due to the debt ceiling, but also due to expectations on earnings and those are going up. Now the debt ceiling is part of the bear case for this year, and institutions are restraining buys because of default risk.\n\nSo which direction is reversal on this news? Which direction is the \"sell\"? As an anxiety event, the direction on realization without the world falling apart is typically up.\n\nStop and think about it. Your \"sell the news\" argument is basically that the market is positioning betting FOR a default and this would surprise the direction of capital to the down side without it happening.\n\nThat's not what the market's doing.

Those are momentum plays, and they can insane and run for a long time, which will be easier with funds released at institutions after the threat of a default is over (It resets the potential risk-free rate of return lower). \n\nThe AI play is institutions. I think it's a bubble, but I don't know where we are in that bubble.\n\nWhat I can say definitively is that the overextension in much of tech right now is based in expectations of CapEx investment over the next 6-12 months. It's gonna take that playing out for there to be a significant deleverage like bears want in that space. It's not just a defensive story, and that's apparent in NVDA's earnings announcement, it's about forward CapEx and sales expectations.\n\nSo these aren't speculative overdrive yet driven by ramps and squeezes, they're forward-looking positions. To get the move we got in NVDA this week, you have to have institutions building position.\n\nNow there's some rationality in the nearterm to your position, where the auction cycle will eventually slow and pressure will come off the float and price will come down then... but we just don't know where we are in that process.\n\nBut that argument is about the auction cycle and where mean reversion will end up... not about a sell the news event.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Disagree on not being a squeeze… for now.

Im of the belief it’s been a technical rally from bullish positioning with AI icing on the cake\n\nI didn't say it wasn't a squeeze. It's absolutely a squeeze. There is 100% a technical component to this.\n\nBut a squeeze is not the same thing as a pump and dump. \n\nA pump and dump is a squeeze where institutions don't take long positions, so the valuation collapses. When a meme stock runs when it's highly shorted and about to go bankrupt, that's a pump and dump. People evaporate positions during the run and they aren't real, so the valuation deflates as the float relieves all pressure. \n\nWhen a stock squeezes because people keep buying options and institutions are buying (they buy options for their positions, too), then that's a momentum run. In momentum runs, float pressure remains high, resulting in higher and longer runs that often don't deflate entirely at all.\n\nI absolutely did not say this wasn't a squeeze. :) It's just not a pump and dump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> But volatility has been seeing much more call liquidity, especially after a note from JPM came out (I think it was them) telling their clients to snatch up VIX calls. There are signs that this bullish positioning is starting to abate \n\nInstitutions always do this during accumulation runs. VIX calls are a common hedge. They do not necessarily imply a change of direction.\n\nThey can also go up for short periods of time with the market, which is one of the reasons institutions like them as hedges. People get surprised by this every few weeks on the daily thread. We don't see the correlation with upswings on the longterm graphs that people use because they get flattened out with the longer timeframe as the longer uptrends reduce the VIX further, but going from flat ranging to a big move up also (for a short period of time) drives volatility up, too.\n\nVIX calls are what you use when you don't know but just expect a big move. If you think there's a change in direction, you direct a sell on the market or a tighter hedge. Basically VIX hedges allow you to keep the long net position.\n\nNot to mention VIX hedges are warranted at the technical SPY 420 level anyway just because of the risk of resistance... purely as risk management, because it's either going to reject and drop or break and run at some point in the nearterm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There is some mix of concrete institutional buying with positioning chasing. I lean more towards positional chasing. AAPL, ORCL, AVGO for instance are essentially at all time highs with zero AI slant so far. META and NFLX are at yearly highs with both being pretty muted on AI. So how much of MSFT’s run is AI hype versus safety buying and positioning? Who knows. But some chunk of it is that will get cashed out \n\nSure, but my point is that at this point we don't know what is what, how much, or when.\n\nPart of the reason all of this is running is because this quarter's earnings are seriously overperforming against current position expectations. \n\nLike significantly. To the extent that earnings expectations and S&P 500 top level expectations are going up. Firms that were pricing in 200 earnings are adjusting to 215... not on forward expectations, recession's still the base case in many cases there, or at least a pullback of some type, but on the simple fact that the earnings being higher now means earnings projections for the year have already outperformed, which changes the balance sheet expectations.\n\nYou have to think about this like an institution with a balance sheet: they're positioning for adjustment relative to forward earnings, which are now officially significantly higher across the S&P than bearish projections... actually closer to more bullish projections. That's in the bag, not speculative.\n\nThat means idle capital has to go to risk assets to compensate and not be left behind... that's why we're seeing position-building.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I lean towards the mean reversion happening sooner than later. The recent rallying has ignored rates going up \n\nSo this is not exactly what's happening. It's not that they've ignored rates, it's that the relationship between rates and stocks have changed because the flow relationship has changed. \n\nStocks don't always correlate opposite rates. In fact, they quite often run with rates, but which correlation you have depends on the part of the market cycle you're in and how flows are going.\n\nIn the very short term, yields may be rising, but they're on the longer term compared to the end of last year on a bull steepening run. Post-SVB, yields dropped out more and values raised, this increases values on bonds against par with already locked-in higher yields. While yields going up slightly may be higher than the recent low, it's still in a downtrend even with the debt ceiling shrinking.\n\nAnd institutions aren't stupid, they know a default would skyrocket rates, and that higher \"risk-free\" (wouldn't exactly be risk-free anymore, but would still be a safer bet than most equal yield bonds) rate represents both a balance sheet  risk and an opportunity.\n\nBasically, the current bull steepening happening, and inflection in the yield curves to steepening, results in positive correlation between yield movement and stock market movement because of accumulation of flows from bond holdings into risk equities. That's driving yields up because of lower bond demand buys (due to lower rates several months ago and the expectation of future higher rates). And you better believe they were holding excess capital because of the balance sheet default risk and risk of yields going up imbalancing offset holdings. \n\nAnd if there's no default, then that threat's off the table. Think like an institution, not a retail trader putting everything on black. Institutions have balance sheets and risk departments. (I used to be an officer in one... now I just write and maintaining the modeling software they use... fewer long nights, less overall stress, more money LOL)\n\nSo the bond market/stock market correlation behavior has changed, and it doesn't have to go back just because we're used to it being inverted.\n\nThis is also why the 60/40 portfolio is working again. In fact, that's your sign that this is more the recent normal behavior... it's making the common retirement plan standard distribution behave normally.\n\nNow the last risk is a recession and/or bank failure at the end of the year.\n\n(Continued...)", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": ">it’s ignored the dollar going up\n\nThat's kind of a bigger risk, so I'll give you that one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>it’s ignored fed fund futures pricing in more hawkishness\n\nIt's not ignoring, it's that the Fed raising another 25 or 50 bps is an expected risk and unless it causes a bank collapse or recession, it's a smaller risk compared to a default.\n\nIt's just that this is less than the current anxiety threat.\n\n>GS is estimating over half a trillion of treasuries being issued very quickly over the next 2 months. It’s gonna pressure rates upwards, it’s going to require more dollars and push that up, it’s going to remove liquidity from the market that’s more than offset QT up until now. These things catch up and the amount of issuance is a big enough catalyst in my mind\n\nIs it, though?\n\n[https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-treasury-securities-statistics/](https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-treasury-securities-statistics/)\n\nThe treasury already issued $1-2T every month this year, and even if that $.5T is on top of the normal, spread over 4 release periods (treasury issues bonds twice a month) we're talking with in the normal range of fluctuation. And a lot of bonds are maturing, so there's also hundreds of billions rotating in this period.\n\nIt's not crazy to think that excess bonds will drive up yields a bit and put flow pressure on things, but it's also mostly fear based on the Fear of Large Numbers. They do need to rehydrate the general fund, but I don't think people understand how much money moves through the bond market on any given month, because it's A LOT more than half a trillion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My guess for the near term is a gap and crap to put it mildly. Brief euphoria to start the week.\n\nThe week itself is a wildcard for me. It's anyone's guess within a couple percent barring any other news, but I just don't think \"heavy capital pressure on fear\" is really matching the actual capital dynamics of non-default here.\n\nI'm more thinking the next few months. I think there's still risk, but some of the assumptions people are making are based on continuation of fear and expectation of market crash, rather than a view of the balance sheet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Short QQQ / long XLE+XLF is my personal play.

No I'm not proposing to create a law to limit corporate profits. I'm trying raise awareness so that consumers understand that many if not most of these companies are taking advantage of the inflation situation to increase their profits. Ultimately, consumers have the pricing power, and the earlier they stop willingly pay for the high prices without thinking twice, the earlier companies will be forced to find ways to cut cost without raising prices.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "They sucked everything they could out of us.", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bingo!

The trader buys a call option with a higher strike price and sells a call option with a lower strike price. Both options have the same expiration date. This strategy is used when a trader expects a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset.\n2. \"The higher strike acted as insurance to cap his losses.\" The call option that the trader bought (with the higher strike price) limits the potential loss to the premium paid for the option. This is because the most the trader can lose is the premium paid for the option, no matter how low the price of the underlying asset goes.\n3. \"Except NVDA blew way past even his upper strike so he was looking at maximum losses on all his spreads.\" NVDA is the ticker symbol for Nvidia Corporation, a technology company. If the price of NVDA goes above the strike price of the call option that the trader sold (the lower strike price), then the trader is obligated to sell the stock at the lower strike price, even though it's worth more in the market. This is where the loss comes from.\n4. \"Just look at his 370/380 spread. Since NVDA was above $380 he was down the difference of $10 (380-370) x 100 or $1000 on that contract before the premium he collected.\" Here, the trader sold a call option with a strike price of $370 and bought a call option with a strike price of $380. Since the price of NVDA went above $380, the trader had to sell the stock at $370 (the strike price of the call option he sold), even though it was worth $380 in the market. This resulted in a loss of $10 per share. Since one options contract represents 100 shares, the total loss was $10 x 100 = $1000, not including the premium he collected from selling the call option.\n5. \"From the last pic he had 88 of the $5 spread contracts and 19 of the $10 spread. That’s a $63K loss (less premium collected) if he didn’t close them early.\" This is just multiplying the number of contracts by the loss per contract to get the total loss. The $5 spread contracts resulted in a loss of $500 per contract (because $5 x 100 shares = $500), and the $10 spread contracts resulted in a loss of $1000 per contract. So, the total loss was (88 x $500) + (19 x $1000) = $63,000, not including the premium collected from selling the call options.\n6. \"Dude went balls deep on one ticker and got his face ripped off.\" This is a colorful way of saying that the trader took a big risk by putting a lot of money into options on one stock (NVDA), and it didn't pay off.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "😦 that made it too easy to understand.
