{"title": "Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally", "selftext": "Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).\r  \n\r  \nThe founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.\r  \n\r\n\nNvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  \nIt hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.  \nWith the Nasdaq Composite (\\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.  \n\"Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,\" Wood tweeted.  \nThere will be \"dozens\" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).  \nWood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.  \n\"(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,\" Wood wrote.  \nWith several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.\n\n  \nWood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.  \nBut as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.  \nThe fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.", "id": "13wi9do", "created_utc": 1685528570.0, "score": 907, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 369, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds salty.

CPI this month is expected to come in at 4.1% YoY, down from 4.9% last month. Sure, core PCE has been stuck around the same level but it tracks the stickiest forms of inflation, such as services, that is usually one of the last inflationary pillars to fall. \n\nPausing and letting the impact of the 5% rate be felt for longer is the right move imo", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Core inflation is proving extremely sticky.

It's a bumpy downtrend.\n\nYou should also consider the [fed's flexible average inflationary target (FAIT)](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/assessing-the-federal-reserves-new-monetary-policy-framework/) monetary policy approach that they're undertaking.\n\n> The FAIT framework is well designed to counter the disinflationary bias imparted by policy being constrained by the ZLB from time to time. **FAIT promises to make up for inflation below 2 percent by aiming to run it ‚Äúmoderately above 2 percent for some time‚Äù‚Äîa flexible form of price-level targeting**. That implies easier policies for longer than if the Fed were simply aiming to return inflation to 2 percent without the makeup. The point of the averaging is to make sure expectations are indeed anchored at 2 percent. In effect, deliberately aiming for inflation to exceed 2 percent for some time and likely allowing the overshoot of maximum employment necessary to achieve that results in an upward inflation bias that offsets the downward bias arising from the ZLB.\n\n\nBasically, the fed doesn't mind if inflation remains elevated for longer as long as the overall trend is downwards and averages 2% over time, such as a decade. If we do see a real spike in inflation and not a one or two month increase then, yes, the bear case will be real and I'd expect pain in stocks.

A significant amount of people were able to utilize free cash during the significant downturn in 2020 and the amount of wealth gained was massive. \n\nThen, pair that with the significant influx of buyers of homes from 2020-2023. A large portion of those were \"side-income/easy-income/2nd-homes/passive-investment income\". Everyone wanted extra homes for AirBNB/VRBO or rentals. That ate away at supply significant considering that interest rates were so low that it was almost like they were giving away free money. Top that off with the general construction rate that dropped significantly AND the lumber prices/hardware prices that shot through the roof due to supply distribution issues (remember the whole COVID global shutdown). A lot of people were refinancing during that period, staying in their homes, not selling but they were buying more homes. The general market supply for homes dropped significantly.\n\nSo, what happens when the interest rates go up? Well, naturally one would expect that the amount of mortgage applications/home purchases would go down and supply would rise. Well, due to one of the greatest amount of wealth building, along with significant supply problems, and the increase in the amount of people who needed homes during this period, what you see is a continuing median/average home price increase, or at least not much of a drop. The issue is that the people who can afford homes are still shopping around with little supply due to those who cannot afford the 400k median price for a single family home. Most people who \"could\" sell, would not currently be able to afford a similar home with a mortgage rate that is most likely 1-3% higher than what they are in right now, even if they got 2-3x what they originally paid for it.\n\nOn top of that, those who can afford a home, don't really care that the mortgage rate is 2-3% higher than last year. They are typically dual income professionals, or children who have parents that are willing to help finance those homes. When you have these 2 classes of people that still really need homes and the supply is still remaining low, esp when not many people can go from a $900/mo mortgage to a $2300 mortgage for the exact same house, you will not get that magical real estate crash you are thinking. \n\nIt did drop technically a couple months back I believe like 10%, but it's going back up again.

The biggest issue is that there are so many buyers still in need of homes and there is a lack of supply.

We'll need a big unemployment rise (not showing yet which is crazy), less job positions open (going the opposite way as seen today), and significantly more supply come on to the market. Right now, people are paying either asking price or paying over. There are very few markets where the price of real estate have dropped. Those markets have other significant drivers of those reasons due to local governing. NYC, LA, San Fran, Chicago are in the top 10 currently for value loss. That's mainly due to political discourse, crime issues, homeless issues and significant drug problems. Most other places have seen either a stagnating real estate price in the last month or an actual increase. The issue is that the median price for real estate was 200k prior to the pandemic. Then it went to 450k+. Our \"correction\" in real estate so far on single family homes was literally 10%. So, in reality, housing pricing is still significantly higher than pre-March 2020.\n\nThe whole thing is crazy. There are so many little nuances that caused this.

{"title": "Earning plays for CRWD, CRM, AI, OKTA, and JWN", "selftext": "*Let's do the shotgun approach.* I'm going to be discussing all five earning plays in one post, and then put my conclusions at the end. All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let's get into the details of this post. \n\nStarting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.\n\nCrowdStrike‚Äôs first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. The increasing number of people logging into employers' networks has triggered a greater need for security and might have spurred the demand for CRWD‚Äôs products in the fiscal first quarter. A strong pipeline of deals indicates the same.\n\nStellar revenue growth in subscriptions might have contributed significantly to the first quarter‚Äôs top line. Further, the increasing number of net new subscription customers may have acted as a tailwind.\n\nMoreover, CrowdStrike‚Äôs collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an upside, benefiting the company from its products‚Äô availability on the AWS platform. The expansion in the volume of transactions through Amazon‚Äôs AWS Marketplace, growth in co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have contributed to CRWD‚Äôs earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nHowever, elevated expenses for enhancing sales and marketing capabilities and increased investments in research and development are likely to have weighed on the company‚Äôs fiscal first-quarter bottom line.\n\nNext is the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider **Salesforce (CRM)**, wallstreet expects CRM to post adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share, which is on the higher end of the company‚Äôs guidance and nearly double that of the Q1FY23 figure of $0.98 per share. CRM has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the [past eight quarters](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm/earnings), with a strategically built portfolio covering virtually all aspects of digital transformation. So far this year, the stock has gained 59.9%, outperforming the S&P 500's 10% gain.\n\nSimilarly, the analysts expect Salesforce to post revenue of $8.18 billion, which is also on the higher end of the company‚Äôs outlook and represents a 10.4% year-over-year growth. However, sequentially, the revenue expectation shows a modest decline of 2.4%.\n\nSalesforce‚Äôs first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nThe company‚Äôs ability to offer integrated solutions for customers‚Äô business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm‚Äôs products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.\n\nSalesforce‚Äôs quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management software provider‚Äôs focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.\n\nAlso, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM‚Äôs top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its four major cloud service offerings, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Platform, and Other and Marketing & Commerce Cloud, is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce‚Äôs subscriptions and supported its revenues.\n\nHowever, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war might have affected Salesforce‚Äôs fiscal first-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.\n\nOn May 26, Goldman Sachs analyst [Kash Rangan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kashrangan/) reiterated his Buy rating on CRM stock ahead of its earnings report. Rangan has set a price target of $325, implying a massive 50.8% upside potential from current levels.  \n\nRangan is highly optimistic about Salesforce‚Äôs quarterly winning streak and the potential tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Even so, the analyst cited that this will be the first time that CRM will recognize a sequential decline in subscription revenue.\n\nDespite that, Rangan noted, ‚ÄúAs a system of record with a plethora of customer data that can help train its LLM (large language models), CRM can benefit from Generative AI. As the macro begins to inflect, we see CRM being well positioned as it realizes the benefits from sales efficiency efforts and workforce reductions of recent quarters.‚Äù Salesforce said it will integrate its [generative AI](https://www.crmscience.com/single-post/generative-ai-and-salesforce-transforming-business-processes-with-innovative-ai-solutions) Einstein GPT into every facet of the company - sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction. Pricing details were not disclosed.\n\nI know everyone wants to hear it, next is **C3.ai (AI)**. There's no denying it, the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, in particular ChatGPT, is more than just hype. It is real. As you may have noticed, one company that's riding high on the AI wave is C3.ai, which has seen its stock more than doubled as interest among investors surge. The stock has gone on a breathtaking run over the past thirty days, rising close to 90%, compared with the 3% rise in the S&P 500 index. On a year-to-date basis the performance looks even more astonishing, skyrocketing 194% compared with the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index. How much higher can its shares go?\n\nC3.ai is benefiting from the increasing adoption of its services, including C3 Generative AI Product Suite, C3 AI Ex Machina (wasn't that a movie?), C3 AI ESG and C3 AI CRM. An expanding product portfolio is expected to have remained a key catalyst in driving demand for the company‚Äôs fully-integrated AI products in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nDuring the to-be-reported quarter, the company made significant development toward its Generative AI platform, facilitating the ease of use and the capability of its enterprise AI applications. This is expected to have driven the top line.\n\nC3.ai has been benefiting from strengthening industry and technology-specific partnerships. From its industry partnerships with the likes of Baker Hughes in oil & gas & chemical markets and Booz Allen in government defense sector, C3.ai has been leveraging domain expertise to expand its customer footprint.\n\nWith its tech partners, C3 has been benefiting from strength in its sales capabilities besides tech and product functionality. Partnerships with the likes of Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Accenture are expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAside from recently announcing that its generative AI product suite is now available as a public offer on Alphabet's Google (GOOG , GOOGL) Cloud Marketplace, the company also issued preliminary results that included positive cash flow in FQ4. This suggests that the company‚Äôs $800 million cash currently on its balance sheet will grow. Its management has sought to change the company‚Äôs business model, shifting the business away from short-term revenues to a transaction-based pricing method, while boosting long-term revenues by growing its customer base.\n\nThose initiatives appear to be working with growth rates starting to re-accelerate. CEO Thomas Siebel said, \"Since we announced C3 Generative AI, we've had intense interest from current customers and prospects to get these capabilities deployed and in use across their systems.‚Äù The product suite features enterprise search, allowing businesses to search across their database to locate and retrieve relevant information. On Wednesday, the company will look to prove that it is here to stay and has a sustainable path towards profitability.\n\nFor the three months that ended April, Wall Street expects the Redwood City, Calif.-based company to post a per-share loss of 17 cents on revenue of $71.32 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was 21 cents per share on revenue of $72.32 million. For the full year, the loss is expected to be 46 cents per share, narrowing from 73 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $265.67 million would rise 5.1% year over year.\n\nThe company still has a lot to prove and important questions to answer. Namely, does it have a strong enough moat to establish a leadership position in enterprise AI software? C3.ai ended Q3 with 236 customers, the same total reported at the end of Q2. In other words, there has been no sequential growth in the customer base, suggesting there‚Äôs a lack in competitive advantage and/or product interest.\n\nAs noted earlier, a few quarters ago, the company moved towards a new pricing model to help onboard new customers at a lower startup cost. This will allow the company to charge more when these same customers utilize the software at higher levels. As a result of the pricing change, there was a noticeable dip in Q3 revenues. Although the company surpassed consensus estimates, producing Q3 revenue $66.67 million, the figure declined 4.45% year over year.\n\nThe Q3 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share did surpass estimates by 16 cents. Despite the nearly 5% dip in revenues, the stock soared higher. Investors looked beyond the current numbers and instead focused on the fact that the trough in revenues had been reached. The belief is that the company‚Äôs consumption-based pricing model is now poised to generate even more revenue than the subscription model it once used. As such, the guidance the company provides today will be a key factor in the stock‚Äôs near-term direction.\n\nStrong demand for the company‚Äôs Enterprise AI software, driven by accelerated digital modernization across major industries, is expected to have aided fiscal fourth-quarter performance.\n\n**Okta, Inc (OKTA)** is next. analysts expect earnings of $0.118 per share compared to losses of $0.270 per share from the same quarter last year. They expect Okta to report sales of $511.0 million, an increase of 23.16% over the same period last year. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.760 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.040 per share.\n\nThe company‚Äôs first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect the benefits of increased use cases of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio.\n\nOkta is expected to have experienced strong demand for its Workforce and Customer Identity solutions. Continuous innovation in its solutions have helped Okta score notable enterprises such as Sonos, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MassMutual and OpenAI. Its products‚Äô ability to automate processes, secure data and reduce costs has been another positive.\n\nDemand for the company‚Äôs solutions has been strong due to the deployment of cloud and hybrid IT, digital transformation projects and the adoption of Zero Trust security. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThese factors are expected to have expanded the customer base in the fiscal first quarter. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Okta added 550 customers, bringing the total customer count to 17,600, up 17% year over year. Customers with more than $100K in Annual Contract Value increased 27% year over year.\n\nHowever, Okta is expected to have faced challenges in execution and heightened attrition. Challenging macro environment and unfavourable forex are potential headwinds. These factors are expected to have hurt its fiscal fourth-quarter prospects.\n\nFinally, let's take a look at **Nordstrom (JWN)**. Their first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of decelerating demand trends. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners. Analysts expect losses of $0.105 per share compared to losses of $0.060 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They also are expecting the company to report $3.16 billion, an decrease of 11.59% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $1.87, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.69.\n\nManagement expects the impact of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues in fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal first-quarter results. I anticipate a decline in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, I expect sales to decline for both the Nordstrom banner and  the Nordstrom Rack segment.\n\nIn order to maintain healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom has been undertaking additional markdowns. The higher markdowns have been weighing on gross margin, which is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nHowever, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset the aforementioned declines.\n\nNordstrom has been focused on technology advancement by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, supply-chain channel improvement, and marketing efforts. The digital business has been witnessing gains from improved digital traffic across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, as well as increased utilization of Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store service. Its mobile app has also been performing well. Alongside these, the integration of Rack.com into [Nordstrom.com](https://www.nordstrom.com/) is anticipated to have contributed to the company's top line in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n**So what to do for earnings?**\n\nJust to keep it sweet and simple, I'm getting calls on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA.
