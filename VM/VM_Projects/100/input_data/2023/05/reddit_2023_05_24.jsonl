So here is what you do if you want to lock in that gain after hours.  \n\nFirst, you short 100 shares of NVDA at 390.  The reason you do that is if the stock goes down in the aftermarket, you will profit from the short.  If the stock goes up, you will lose money on the short, but you have a call covering the 100 shares and that will increase in value the same as your loss.  \n\nIn the morning the next thing you do is sell the call, and cover the short.  At the very least you will profit $60 a share.   In the best scenario the stock gives back all its gains and then some, where you can also profit even more.   Say if then warn and now the stock craters to 290.  Your short will profit $100 a share, while your call will be worthless.   \nThe only way you don‚Äôt get the max profit on your call is if the stock continues to go up after you short it.

Chips are gold. China and US are about to fight for them. Should tell you all you need to know about how important they are. They are used in EVERYTHING.\n\nNot right, until we can produce our needs and not rely on Taiwan making 60% of the worlds chips and 90% of the advanced one's we cannot replicate, yet, demand will keep soaring. Intel, AMD, Semiconductors, the list goes on. This will help fix, over time, the lagging chips we need to make more vehicles. I'm hoping that, should China actually invade and we don't stop them quick enough, Taiwan just hands us the plans and destroys their manufacturing plant's. We cannot let China control the Chip market, period, so imo I think those variables will extend this for a bit longer. \n\nI'm not finding the logic in the fundamentals comment. I mean, based on what I just said, the fundamentals are, like I said, microchips are gold. What that 25% did for me, is insane. I still have the chucky cheese grin. :) You can still get in, I see 400+ before it starts to drop as supply catches up.

Being a student of history, or at least the history I am aware of, I can point to 4 times the US has defaulted.\n\nNow, before you get your underwear in a bundle, a default is when the issuer doesn't pay the debt/bond holder. I know people like to play fun with words but that's what it is, period.\n\nHere are the Greatest hits of the United States Default tour of 1862 to ????.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. 1862 - US sold Demand Notes to fund the Civil War. Government printed paper money ie \"Greenbacks.\" and they devalued vs gold. Default #1.\n2. 1933 - US issued Gold Bonds which could be redeemed for gold coin. Until the Govt decided instead to \"pay back\" the gold bonds in paper currency. Default #2\n3. 1968 - US refused to honor the terms of Silver Certificate Paper dollars which stated that they could be redeemed for actual silver dollars. Adding insult to injury, the Govt voted in 1965 that Silver Dollars no longer had to be Silver. Default #3 and Screwjob #2034\n4. 1971 - Dollars held by foreign governments were supposed to be able to be redeemed for gold, under the Bretton Woods agreement, the agreement that forced the world onto the dollar. Govt said nope, and the world has never been the same. Btw, the dollars for gold was the FOUNDATION of the Bretton Woods agreement.\n\nSo, the US government has defaulted FOUR times.\n\nInterestingly, #2 went to the Supreme Court where the power of the US Government to default was upheld.\n\n\\#4 great quote: Then Treasurt Secty said in response: \"The dollar is our currency but its your (foreign nations) problem.\"\n\nAnd the trend of the US saying F U to other nations, began. Freaking Nixon.\n\nLook, the world and US citizens have already experienced the US govmt sayin nah, we ain't paying. And yet, the US marches on.\n\nAgain, to me one of the greatest risks for the country financially and geopolitically is the overt move by nations to move OFF the dollar. If I was them, I would want to do the same thing. The dollar is the single greatest weapon that the US has.\n\nFinally, I reiterate that all of this drama is BS. Seriously, This would not be the first time the US defaulted. Nor the first time the US was downgraded.\n\nI like my SPY calls, my QQQ calls, and my VIX calls.", "id": "13qpw4d", "created_utc": 1684944699.0, "score": 303, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 239, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|413|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1273jda/went_long_qqq_calls_today_i_feel_very_dirty/) \n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The US has defaulted 4 times in history.

They are built only for specific tasks. That is, the TPU and Tranium are more restrictive.\n\nYou can see this in googles own docs: [https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/intro-to-tpu](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/intro-to-tpu)\n\n>Cloud TPUs are not suited to the following workloads:  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Linear algebra programs that require frequent branching or contain many element-wise algebra operations  \n>  \n>Workloads that access memory in a sparse manner  \n>  \n>Workloads that require high-precision arithmetic  \n>  \n>Neural network workloads that contain custom operations in the main training loop\n\nOn top of that, Google and Amazon have no intention of releasing their chips to the public which means you have to use their cloud platform to use their chips. This is again a big restriction. For example, I run my machine learning servers in house so I don't get the option of using their tech.  \n[https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/google-ai-supercomputer-nvidia-h100](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/google-ai-supercomputer-nvidia-h100)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey so I also work in the field. I was under the impression that NVIDIA was dominant in the industry due to the large number of operator fusion being optimized with CUDA. Amazon already supports custom operators via AWS Neuron and PyTorch for nonstandard workloads. Same with Google and TensorFlow. With the PyTorch 2.0 and Triton release, I can see the chip ecosystem becoming less reliant on CUDA, especially since Triton operates at a higher level of abstraction. IIRC PyTorch 2.0/Triton is the stack running on AMD chips.\n\nEven disregarding the tech, theres a major bottleneck with regards to the number of chips that can be produced. With Meta, Google, Amazon, and now Microsoft/AMD joining the custom chip club, Nvidia has to compete with them to get access to TSM's fabs. If TSM raises prices for individuals in the queue, I can see Big Tech winning out. In this sense, maybe TSM is the shovel maker to the shovel seller in the AI gold rush analogy haha.\n\nNvidia has some great tech, but its so expensive that everything has to go right for the story to work out.

Lately, I've been seeing a bunch of newer people on here actively correcting people and acting like \"being short\" can only mean \"short selling equities\" - which is kind of hilarious to me because this sub has totally become the blind leading the blind. Guessing someone just looked up the definition of short selling without understanding the macro concept and now a bunch of people are just regurgitating it.\n\nIf having a short position just meant something was sold short, the term would have no directional meaning without also specifying the instrument that was sold short. This just adds a bunch of unnecessary confusion when you're trying to distill the concepts behind more complicated trades. When people in the industry use short/long, they are generally using them to describe the overall direction of the trade. If they want to get into the specifics more they will use long/short in tantum with the investment instruments used. If an investor says \"they're short (asset x)\" without classifying the instrument, they mean the trade will make money as x's price decreases. Likewise, when they say \"they're long (asset x)\" they will make money as x's price increases.
