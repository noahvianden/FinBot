In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.\n\nThe imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the ‚Äúflattening,‚Äù said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.\n\nThis phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. **Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.**\n\nThe November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta‚Äôs ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.\n\nWorkers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately.

It's really interesting actually, their capex spending on AI datacenters for 2022 and 2023 actually exceeds that of Google and Microsoft. Meta is seeing huge ROI on AI because it will help them make their discovery engine more relevant. You can always improve relevancy of ads and content. Improving relevancy of ads will get users to convert, and improving relevancy of content will keep users to be more engaged and stay on the platform for longer. Compare in contrast to Google, who makes majority of its money through search ads. Search ads are served based on keyword bidding, so the room for improvement is actually quite low, because you already know what the user wants to search for. You can never recommend a search ad that someone never knew they wanted (which is what has been recently becoming possible due to AI), because you are restricted to recommend stuff related to the search term. On the other hand, you can argue that google can improve the ai to understand user queries better, which has definitely happened in the past couple of years with transformers (btw google invented it). I think we shouldn't discredit it and I do believe it has led to revenue gain in the past years, but the thing is that unlike Meta, improving relevancy of searches won't be as effective in getting people to engage more with the product itself. In meta products, people will engage more and stay on platforms longer if the relevancy of the content improves, but for Google improving search relevancy won't get you to search more, because most people use it as a utility whenever they need it. I think people like to talk about who is king in AI recently, and really the wau I see it is that you should ignore it.

Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors‚Äô bubble this week. \n\nFed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He‚Äôs expected to discuss February‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated ‚Äúongoing‚Äù rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a ‚Äútighter stance of monetary policy.‚Äù\n\nMunster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not ‚Äúoverly hawkish‚Äù‚Äîrepeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance‚Äîevery time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts.\n\nAs a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell ‚Äúretreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone‚Äù during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed‚Äôs benchmark interest rate.", "id": "11l1jod", "created_utc": 1678201149.0, "score": 928, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 320, "comments": [{"body": "The funny part is that Powell and the Fed have been extremely consistent, saying the same thing over and over for the past few months.\n\nAs the market rallied in 2023, every time Powell has a chance to speak he reiterates that the Fed will hike rates higher than the market thinks and will keep rates there longer than the market thinks.

{"title": "Fed Chair Powell says interest rates are ‚Äòlikely to be higher‚Äô than previously anticipated", "selftext": "* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.\n* ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,‚Äù the central bank leader said in prepared remarks for appearances this week on Capitol Hill.\n* Powell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.\n\nCiting earlier data this year showing that inflation has reversed the deceleration it showed in late 2022, the central bank leader warned of tighter monetary policy ahead.\n\n‚ÄúThe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,‚Äù Powell said in remarks prepared for two appearances this week on Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúIf the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.‚Äù\n\nThose remarks carry two implications: One, that the peak, or terminal, level of the federal funds rate is likely to be higher than the previous indication from the Fed officials, and, two, that the switch last month to a smaller quarter percentage point increase could be short-lived of inflation data continue to run hot.\n\nIn their December estimate, officials pegged the terminal rate at 5.1%. Current market pricing is a bit higher than that, in the 5.25%-5.5% areas, according to CME Group data. Powell did not specify how high he thinks rates ultimately will go.\n\nThe speech comes with markets generally optimistic that the Fed can tame inflation without running the economy into a ditch.\n\nHowever, January data show that inflation as gauged by personal consumption expenditures prices ‚Äî the preferred metric for policymakers ‚Äî was still running at a 5.4% pace annually. That‚Äôs well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% long-run target and a shade above the December level.\n\nPowell said the current trend shows that the Fed‚Äôs inflation-fighting job is not over.\n\n‚ÄúWe have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe Fed has raised its benchmark fund rate eight times over the past year to its current targeted level between 4.5%-4.75%. On its face, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending. But it feeds through to a multitude of other consumer debt products such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\n\nIn recent says, some officials, such as Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, have indicated that they see the rate hikes coming to a close soon. However, others, including Governor Christopher Waller, have expressed concern about the recent inflation data and say tight policy is likely to stay in place.\n\n‚ÄúRestoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúThe historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.‚Äù\n\nPowell noted some progress on inflation for areas such as housing.\n\nHowever, he also noted ‚Äúthere is little sign of disinflation‚Äù when it comes to the important category of services spending excluding housing, food and energy. That is an important qualifier considering that the chairman at his post-meeting news conference in early February said the disinflationary process had begun in the economy, remarks that helped send stocks higher.\n\nMarkets mostly expect the Fed to enact a second consecutive quarter point, or 25 basis points, rate increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month. However, traders are pricing in close to a 30% probability of a higher half-point increase, according to CME Group data.\n\nPowell reiterated that rate decisions will be made ‚Äúmeeting by meeting‚Äù and will be dependent on data and their impact on inflation and economic activity, rather than a pre-set course.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/fed-chair-powell-says-interest-rates-are-likely-to-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/fed-chair-powell-says-interest-rates-are-likely-to-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated.html)", "id": "11l1ui8", "created_utc": 1678201856.0, "score": 1285, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 451, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday cautioned that interest rates are likely to head higher than central bank policymakers had expected.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Truly insightful summary", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Money printer goes shhhhhh.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Choke me daddy Powell.", "score": 428, "replies": [{"body": "He is doing a lot more than that", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "> Drop your coat and grab your toes, I'm gonna show how high the fed rate hikes go.\" -Jerome Powell-\n\n[Gotchu homie](https://imgflip.com/i/7dmpni)", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "Meow", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Jpow is my daddy.
