So, to make the calculation of \"grind it out\", you have to be fairly confident that you can average credits of at least 2.30/month (20.70/9 = 2.30).

For example, you could sell the April 28, $235, calls for 3.80. Of course, you will have you collateralize the $10 spread between those strike prices ($1,000).  If the price suddenly jumps (which would be a good thing), you'll roll the April calls out and up so you don't get assigned on the 235 calls.

Hold till it turns green, sell for a profit, rinse and repeat.  If things don’t go your way, there is an infinite time horizon with shares (there are always exceptions), so you can hold indefinitely.\n\nObviously, if you are selecting a stock over an ETF, you need to make sure you understand the company and its financial picture and ideally the factors that are causing historical price movement.  You can use FinViz to find tickers with heavy insider buying.  There are many reasons to sell, but only one reason to buy.  If the ticker is a growth stock, it most likely makes no money, so make sure you understand the case for growth.  If it has a positive P/E, perform at a minimum an 8 pillar value analysis on its financials.  Value stocks are less risky than growth stocks for this strat but tend to be less volatile as well, limiting your upside.\n\nThis strat would count as a yolo and goes against traditional investing advice and diversification but since you are messing with options, I don’t think you are interested in the status quo.

And remember I'd suggested to OP to have a $5k cash bankroll after having first building up about $25k in equities.\n\n4 weeks away would have been, give or take, Apr 21.\n\nIf you wanted to write a put for 10% lower, that's $24.27, but strikes generally come in either $1 or sometimes $0.50 increments. Looking at the Apr 21 option chain, BAC has $1 increments. So I'd plan on the $24 strike to base the contract on.\n\nA contract is for 100 shares. So you have to be ready to have $24 x 100 = $2400. If you have that in your account when you sell the put, you're writing a \"cash secured put\".  Apparently those puts sold for $0.67 late yesterday, so you would be paid $0.67 x 100 = $67 for the contract.\n\nYou would have to see what kind of fees and commissions would apply for your particular broker. Within the US I would expect that it cost you nothing if you were assigned, and that you would have been charged $0.66 for selling the put contract (0.65 commission to the broker, 0.01 fee to the exchange). So you would have received 67.00 - 0.66 = 66.34 cash for selling the put. Your broker probably refers to that transaction as a \"sell to open\".\n\nIt is up to whoever bought the contract to decide if they exercise it or not, and when they exercise it (since these are American-style options). The most likely scenario for exercising a put would be after the close on Apr 21, but that isn't an absolute guarantee. If BAC trades for less than $24 at the close (or even shortly after the close) then you'll definitely get assigned.\n\nNote that if BAC dropped to $22, you'll still pay $24. That's the agreement you made. \n\nSo, back to the $5000 cash. You needed to set aside $2400 to be ready for assignment. You were paid $66.34 for the BAC contract. So you have $2666.34 to use to write another put, either on BAC or something else.  If I were focused on accumulating BAC then I would notice that the options chain has a lot of buyers at $23 and $22.  I would probably sell another contract for $22 (which sold for $0.40 x 100 - $0.66 = $39.34).  That way, if BAC really dumped then I would have been assigned 100 shares at $24, 100 shares at $22, and my average cost basis for my 200 shares would then be (2400 - 66.34) + (2200 - 39.34) divided by 200 = $22.47\n\nSo instead of me being in a mad rush to buy 200 shares of BAC today for a cost of $26.97 a share, if the stock dumped I would have paid $22.47 a share.

The “magic” behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.\n\n>Our research indicates, however, that Block has wildly overstated its genuine user counts and has understated its customer acquisition costs. Former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.\n\n>Core to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked” segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West” approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.\n\n>In an apparent effort to preserve its growth engine, Cash App ignored internal employee concerns, along with warnings from the Secret Service, the U.S. Department of Labor OIG, FinCEN, and State Regulators which all specifically flagged the issue of multiple COVID relief payments going to the same account as an obvious sign of fraud.\n\n>Congress passed a law that legally caps “interchange fees” charged by large banks that have over $10 billion in assets. Despite having $31 billion in assets, Block avoids these regulations by routing payments through a small bank and gouging merchants with elevated fees.\n\n>Block includes only a single vague reference in its filings acknowledging it earns revenue from “interchange fees”. It has never revealed the full economics of this category, yet over one-third of Cash App’s revenue came from this opaque source, according to a 2022 Credit Suisse research report.\n\n>Competitor PayPal has disclosed it is under investigation by both the SEC and the CFPB over its similar use of a small bank to avoid “interchange fee” caps. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request we filed with the SEC indicates that Block may be part of a similar investigation.\n\n>In sum, we think Block has misled investors on key metrics, and embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst-practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.", "id": "11zjhuq", "created_utc": 1679576034.0, "score": 802, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 186, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 640, "replies": [{"body": "My favorite part was the youtube compilation of rappers using cash app in their songs lmao", "score": 254, "replies": [{"body": "Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StjWk3Mj-M4", "score": 61, "replies": []}, {"body": "Two years of work right there", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "its the new investment strategy", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I got to that part.

That is almost 80% of commercial mortgages held by all banks.\n\nWith the [banking industry in turmoil](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-failures-like-earlier-shocks-raise-odds-of-recession-beb1e376?mod=article_inline), regulators and analysts are growing increasingly concerned about commercial real estate debt, particularly loans backed by office buildings, according to industry participants. Many skyscrapers, business parks and other office properties have lost value during the pandemic era as their business tenants have adopted new remote and [hybrid workplace strategies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-hybrid-work-is-changing-offices-of-the-future-275d7368?mod=article_inline).\n\nHigh interest rates also have wreaked havoc with commercial property valuations. Many owners with floating-rate mortgages have to pay much more monthly debt service, cutting into their cash flows. Owners with fixed-rate mortgages will feel the pain of [higher rates ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-faces-tough-decision-on-rate-increase-681d6abc?mod=article_inline)when they have to refinance.\n\nThis year will be critical because about $270 billion in commercial mortgages held by banks are set to expire, according to Trepp—the highest figure on record. Most of these loans are held by banks with less than $250 billion in assets. \n\nIf those loans pay off, it would reassure markets. But a large number of defaults could force banks to mark down the value of these and other loans, analysts say, reinforcing fears over the financial health of the U.S. banking system. \n\nMany of these borrowers will have a hard time paying off their loans, said Tomasz Piskorski, the Edward S. Gordon professor of real estate at Columbia Business School. “The destruction of value is quite big,” he said.\n\nWhile a number of banks have seen drops in the [value of their bondholdings](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bondholders-risk-fight-with-fdic-over-silicon-valley-bank-f47c8bc4?mod=article_inline)—a key factor in Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse—figuring out by how much the value of their mortgages has dropped is trickier because they aren’t publicly traded and every building is different. ", "id": "11z98su", "created_utc": 1679547023.0, "score": 531, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 232, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|7 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4692|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The commercial mortgage debt crisis is set to test the financial health of small and regional banks, which are already under pressure following the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 357, "replies": [{"body": "We can buy a skyscraper in Manhattan and put a casino in the lobby", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "Or we could buy an old casino in Atlantic City so the casino is already in the lobby.

Earnings reports: If the company releases earnings reports that fall short of market expectations, investors may reevaluate their positions, leading to a decline in the stock price.\n2. Market sentiment: Shifts in market sentiment, driven by factors such as macroeconomic data, geopolitical tensions, or changes in the industry landscape, can affect stock prices. A negative sentiment shift could lead to a repricing of an overvalued stock.\n3. Changes in the competitive landscape: If new competitors emerge or existing competitors gain a significant advantage, it may impact NVIDIA's market position, triggering a repricing of its stock.\n4. Regulatory changes: Changes in regulations or government policies that negatively affect the company's business prospects can lead to a decline in its stock price.\n5. Analyst downgrades: If prominent market analysts downgrade the stock or lower their price targets, it could lead to a selloff.\n6. Sector rotation: If investors start moving their funds from the technology sector to other sectors (due to changing market conditions or a perception that other sectors offer better growth opportunities), it could negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.\n7. Profit-taking: If a significant number of investors decide to lock in their gains and sell the stock, it may cause a decline in the stock price.\n\nIt's essential to remember that predicting specific triggers for a repricing is difficult, as market dynamics are complex and constantly changing.

BONUSES ARE OFF THE TABLE.\n\nNow getting sick of the complaints... The talented people started leaving... we didn't need them anyways. We need a reset. This is all going poorly... everyone mandatory back in office. No more hybrid employees, they must be bad for culture.\n\nEveryone is angry at each other now. What happened? This used to be a FAMILY. I'll just take a 401k loan to pay off the wine cellar, these interest rates are KILLING ME.\n\nI can push back retirement a few years, just bad luck I suppose.\n\nWait, what do you mean you are letting me go? I HELPED BUILD THIS PLACE. That's fine, YOUR LOSS. Ill tap my network and be back at it in no time.\n\nWHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE ONLY HIRING IN THE INDIA OFFICES. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING, I HAVE A MORTGAGE TO PAY!\n\nDefault default default. Depression. Divorce. Domestic Violence.\n\nThere will be no bailout for these people. So the next time you read a headline about recessions or rate hikes or inflation, think of the people affected the most - the VPs. Personally I am all in on pokemon cards, so that when the next wave of millionaires and billionaires become 30-40 years old I will have something they want.
