I doubt anyone but the most hardcore EV enthusiasts could even name one of their EV models that they've announced.\n\n* Lucid - At least it had promise with it's vehicle. But the problem is it simply entered the market too late and only sells very high end luxury vehicles. Also the Saudi backers are undermining the stock by forcing them to build a factory in Saudi Arabia, a country that's a good distance away from all 3 of the largest car markets (China, the US, & Europe) and where there's very little demand for EV's.\n\n* Nikola - The thing was clearly a scam from a mile away. And Hydrogen powered vehicles are NOT EV's, it doesn't matter to the consumer if the hydrogen is turned into electricity to run the car when there's no hydrogen refueling stations near them. IMO it's flat out false advertising to claim that Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are EVs given that it can confuse consumers.\n\n* Nio - Their battery swap stations make no sense. Tesla explored this many years ago in their early days but ditched it for good reason, it's way more expensive to scale then building out an EV charging infrastructure.

A good chunk of their investor presentation was about cost reduction and the methods they will use to achieve that.

Both like a 5% chance of happening at best. For my 2030 bear case I take the average of the worst and expected case, and for the bull case I take the average of the best case and expected case.\n\nThe numbers I was talking about above are my expected case, where Tesla sells 15M cars a year by 2030 (I don't quite expect them to hit their 20M target). The way they get there is by building out Giga Berlin/Austin to at least 2M units produced per year (each of these is significantly larger than Giga Shanghai that already does 1.2M), Shanghai to do 1.5M and Fremont to do ~800K, so that's ~6.3M of the current models. On top of that, they'll introduce the next gen car in Mexico, which is rumoured to be doing at least 3M cars a year. A few years later they'll add a factory somewhere in Asia and maybe even a new factory in Europe.\n\nI expect ASPs of ~$50K, slightly lower than today. Driven down by ~50% of sales being the cheaper next-gen model, but driven up by inflation and a share being the more expensive Cybertruck and possible a van. Of this $765B in revenue, I expect ~$150B to hit the bottom line. I can talk you through how I think they'll increase their net income despite selling cheaper cars if you like, but it's a lot to go through.\n\nThe other half of the net income is a combination of the Semi truck (conservatively expect them to sell 300K a year, but I think I will have to increase this over time) for $35B, energy for $50B as it's currently ramping up extremely fast while there's virtually endless demand (backlog is already 3+ years long), and another $30B from other operations (Supercharging, Insurance, AI-as-a-service (Dojo), HVAC, maybe even some Optimus robots, and unannounced products).\n\nWhich brings us to the last part being FSD. I think the data very clearly suggests robotaxis will be happening this decade, and once they do Tesla will be making unbelievable recurring software revenues. For the expected case I'm expecting ~64M Tesla's on the road in 2030, with a 40% take rate at $300 a month (I think this is very conservative for true robotaxis that can easily earn $1000-2000 a month) and 85% margins, leading to ~$70B in net income.\n\nThat brings you to a total of $335B, at a PE multiple of 25 is a market cap of $8.1B. With roughly no dilution (there will be some, but I expect it to be offset by buybacks later in the decade), that's a share price of $2,350.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Robotaxis...

CS and DB are both banks... how are they separate? That literally just one sector and for the record its not all banks.\n\nBonds fluctuate all the time. This is not a new phenomenon. Banks learned to mitigate the risk long ago, especially older ones. But some banks got greedy and thats that. DB and CS are not a major banks except in their own countries. Outside of that, they are barely the size of a regional bank here in the USA. And as stated, as long as this is isolated to just banks and doesnt run off to real estate, this will have little effect. The problems only happen when real estate gets involved, namely residential.\n\nWhere do you suppose people will put their money after a run on the bank? Under the mattress? Nope, just another bank that they deem \"safer.\" That bank will then have better ratios and make up the difference and round and round we go.\n\nYou need perspective on defaults. Defaults are up from last year and 2021... but are at historic lows otherwise. As in, they are still lower than any point in the last 30 years. We are barely back to like 2005 levels which was the lowest defaults we had had since 1995 (when the chart is drawn at FRED). Down from 2021 or 2022 literally means nothing because those years were absurd. This is bad perspective. We arent even back to 2019 levels and even that was very low.\n\nUnemployment expected to rise according to who? I have been expecting it to rise since early last year and I am far more intelligent than most folks. It didnt happen so I got it wrong and had to adjust. Reason is business growth has happened all along and we cant replace boomers fast enough to maintain our businesses. What is happening is a shift from high to average pay. Thats undeniable and with that disposable income is down. Hence economy slowing but no one is having trouble finding work. They are just taking lower pay. But as long as there are jobs, thats good enough to keep their homes. Which brings us back full circle to real estate and banking.\n\n21x valuation is historically high prior to Reagan opening the floodgates (supply side economics plus deregulation). Since then, investment valuations skyrocketed and unless you undo those policies, valuation will remain high because thats where money will be plowed. No where else to put it.\n\nMarket valuations prior to the 90s also need perspective. Back then, growth was low and dividends were very high due to tax policies. This, obviously, kept valuation lower. When corporate rates dropped (starting with Carter ironically), they kept more and more while reducing dividends. As a results, they started growing faster making them more valuable. You will note that there was almost no earning growth from the 60s all the way into the mid 80s. Then it exploded as the new tax policies started to take effect. Those policies have not changed, for better or worse.\n\nThe last time rates were around 5-6% was around 2008. We cant seriously compare the onset of the great recession to current economy...\n\nSo yea, you can quote me if you like. Outside of a war on our soil, there wont be a major crash the next 2 years.

I think they'll always try to ship as many of the long distance deliveries as possible at the start of the quarter, so ~10% or 50K might be realistic.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "But we also know that even more ships are in-transit now than at the end of last quarter.

I'm too lazy to conduct an in-depth analysis on size, assuming it would roughly average out. Maybe some of those will get delivered in time, others won't.\n\nActually, there's another interesting thing that I found out: If we look at a similar six-week period at the end of Q4, and also the ships departed in the first 5 days of Q1 (likely to have been produced in Q4, therefore also 'in-transit' during that quarter), it's actually 14 ships -- more than Q1. So, maybe I have to backpedal here a little bit. Suddenly, the in-transit ships between Q1 and Q4 look a lot more comparable than I would have assumed (though, hedging again, Q1 is still subject to change in the next week so could again surpass Q4).

Capital of Tuscany aka wine country. Our favorite spot by far. \n       - 3 days exploring in town to visit the Duomo Cathedral (climbed the bell tower for a sweet view). Saw Michelangelo‚Äôs David, Uffizi Museum to see Da Vinci‚Äôs work. Visited Piti Palace and Boboli Gardens. Ponte Vecchio bridge. All within walking distance. If you stay near the Duomo (10min walk from train station) \n       - Incredible food in Florence, literally the best in all of Italy. Also lots of leather factories in the area so the shops have great handmade leather products for cheap. Bought a leather jacket, some shoes, belts, wallet. Wife bought a few purses. \n       - 1 day to do bus tour of Tuscan countryside and visit a few vineyards for wine tasting (gorgeous) with tour group called Ciao Florence which picks you up in Florence on coach bus and takes you out to the countryside.
