Morgan warns U.S commercial real estate may be the next bomb", "selftext": "When the Fed slams the brakes, some passengers are thrown out of the windshield, for example the burst of Cathie Wood‚Äôs investment bubble, or the collapse of Silicon Valley bank. And according to JPMorgan, US commercial real estate would potentially be the next bomb that could explode.\n\nSpeaking at the $2.5tn asset manager‚Äôs European Media Summit on Tuesday, George Gatch, CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management warned that commercial real estate forms one of the critical areas of risk in global markets after the aggressive monetary tightening by the US central bank. \n\n‚ÄúWe saw it (the stress of rising interest rates) in a huge repricing in fixed income, in UK pension funds‚Äô liability driven investment strategies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCommercial real estate is an area of concern. We have higher interest rates for property developers, how does that impact the real estate market and lenders in that space?‚Äù\n\nCommercial property values have started to slide in recent months, as rising borrowing costs have hit investors‚Äô ability to transact. Investors are keeping a close eye on real estate funds. Earlier this month, BlackRock, a world-renowned top-tier investment firm with a strong family history, went as far as to fall into a $560 million CMBS default.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackRock's US$71 billion real estate investment trust BREIT, a barometer of the commercial real estate market, has continued to trigger monthly client withdrawal caps since November last year, both highlighting the awkwardness of commercial real estate in the face of rapid interest rate hikes in Europe and the US.\n\nIn a note on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs also said the commercial real estate sector was dealing with a ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù environment. ‚ÄúThe recent stress in the banking sector has fuelled growing concern about spillover effects on the commercial real estate industry. With over half of the $5.6tn of outstanding commercial loans sitting on bank balance sheets, bank lending remains the primary source of funding for the sector. This is particularly the case for small banks which capture the lion‚Äôs share of lending.‚Äù\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Bank of America said investors in its monthly fund manager survey were more bearish on real estate than they have been since October 2020, having taken cautious positions on the asset class since September. ‚ÄúConcerns over commercial \\[and\\] office real estate are driving growing anxiety over the sector.‚Äù\n\nView more market insight on [https://www.ainvest.com/](https://www.ainvest.com/).", "id": "11yfnmx", "created_utc": 1679483531.0, "score": 430, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "This is this economic downturn's worst kept secret.

{"title": "Fed hikes rates by a quarter percentage point, indicates increases are near an end", "selftext": " [Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/fed-hikes-rates-by-a-quarter-percentage-point-indicates-increases-are-near-an-end/ar-AA18WXGA?ocid=hpmsn&cvid=9a254d7389014e1196147670c115d53c&ei=14)\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted a quarter percentage point interest rate increase, expressing caution about the recent banking crisis and indicating that hikes are nearing an end.\n\nAlong with its ninth hike since March 2022, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted that future increases are not assured and will depend largely on incoming data.\n\n\"The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy,\" the FOMC's post-meeting statement said. \"The Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.\"\n\nThat wording is a departure from previous statements which indicated \"ongoing increases\" would be appropriate to bring down inflation.\n\nThe softening tone came amid a banking crisis that has raised concerns about the system's stability. The statement noted the likely impact from recent events.\n\n\"The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient,\" the committee said. \"Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\"\n\nDespite the warnings about potential implications from the banking crisis, the committee unanimously approved the rate hike.\n\nThe increase takes the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range between 4.75%-5%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but feeds through to a multitude of consumer debt like mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\n\nProjections released along with the rate decision point to a peak rate of 5.1%, unchanged from the last estimate in December and indicative that a majority of officials expect only one more rate hike ahead.\n\nData released along with the statement shows that seven of the 18 Fed officials who submitted estimates for the \"dot plot\" see rates going higher than the 5.1% \"terminal rate.\"\n\nThe next two years' worth of projections also showed considerable disagreement among members, reflected in a wide dispersion among the \"dots.\" Still, the median of the estimates points to a 0.8 percentage point reduction in rates in 2024 and 1.2 percentage points worth of cuts in 2025.\n\nThe statement eliminated all references to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMarkets had been closely watching the decision, which came with a higher degree of uncertainty than is typical for Fed moves.\n\nEarlier this month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had indicated that the central bank may have to take a more aggressive path to tame inflation. But a fast-moving banking crisis thwarted any notion of a more hawkish move ‚Äì and contributed to a general market sentiment that the Fed will be cutting rates before the year comes to a close.\n\nEstimates released Wednesday of where Federal Open Market Committee members see rates, inflation, unemployment and gross domestic product underscored the uncertainty for the policy path.\n\nOfficials also tweaked their economic projections. They slightly increases their expectations for inflation, with a 3.3% rate pegged for this year, compared to 3.1% in December. Unemployment was lowered a notch to 4.5%, while the outlook for GDP nudged down to 0.4%.\n\nThe estimates for the next two years were little changed, except the GDP projection in 2024 came down to 1.2% from 1.6% in December.\n\nThe projections come amid a volatile backdrop.\n\nDespite the banking turmoil and volatile expectations around monetary policy, markets have held their ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up some 2% over the past week, though the 10-year Treasury yield has risen about 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage points, during the same period.\n\nWhile late-2022 data had pointed to some softening in inflation, recent reports have been less encouraging.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index, a favorite inflation gauge for the Fed, rose 0.6% in January and was up 5.4% from a year ago ‚Äì 4.7% when stripping out food and energy. That's well above the central bank's 2% target, and the data prompted Powell on March 7 to warn that interest rates likely would rise more than expected.\n\nBut the banking issues have complicated the decision-making calculus as the Fed's pace of tightening has contributed to liquidity problems.\n\nClosures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and capital issues at Credit Suisse and First Republic, have raised concerns of the state of the industry.\n\nWhile big banks are considered well-capitalized, smaller institutions have faced liquidity crunches due to the rapidly rising interest rates that have made otherwise safe long-term investments lose value. Silicon Valley, for instance, had to sell bonds at a loss, triggering a crisis of confidence.\n\nThe Fed and other regulators stepped in with emergency measures that seem to have stemmed immediate funding concerns, but worries linger over how deep the damage is among regional banks.\n\nAt the same, recession concerns persist as the rate increases work their way through the economic plumbing.\n\nAn indicator that the New York Fed produces using the spread between 3-month and 10-year Treasurys puts the chance of a contraction in the next 12 months at about 55% as of the end of February. The yield curve inversion has increased since then.\n\nHowever, the Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker puts first-quarter growth at 3.2%. Consumers continue to spend ‚Äì though credit card usage is on the rise ‚Äì and unemployment has held at 3.6% while payroll growth has been brisk.", "id": "11yrbvs", "created_utc": 1679508541.0, "score": 1470, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 461, "comments": [{"body": "The word near is doing most of the heavy lifting in the title.", "score": 685, "replies": [{"body": "I am having real hard deja vu right now.\n\nI've seen this post title and this comment together before.", "score": 179, "replies": [{"body": "The memories are more vivid as we get closer to the end of the simulation", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "You can say we getting near the end", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "It's almost over", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thank god", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "r/technicallythetruth we are nearer than last time.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Impossible to simulate the present moment.

We are much closer than we were before, but we have 15 years worth of QE to undo. QT wasn't suppose to be easy. We all knew it would suck. Now we have reached a stage where we are seeing the first signs of things cracking under the pressure. Like SVB (which imo was more about negligence by the bank than anything to do with the interest rates themselves considering the FED made it clear they were being hiked), which points to a need for better regulation... not necessarily a rate pause or pivot. A lot of experts estimate we would need interest rates of about 14% to be really effective. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the pain we are putting on the global economy. As an American I benefit the most, but that is because our currency is the global reserve currency. As we raise our interest rates we are basically exporting our inflation. It doesn't just disappear. Look at how high inflation is in countries not closely tied to the West. We have to be careful not to implode other currencies in the process. \n\nThe war in Ukraine remains a huge issue that can only lead to further inflation as governments struggle to keep funding this war of attrition. And the threat of China looming over Taiwan creates uncertainty as well. \n\nThe FED seems to benefit the most from this banking crisis. As the public loses faith in the current banking system it creates a better case for adopting the FED's rollout of their new CBDCs. \n\nWe have a lot of moving pieces going on and a lot of them play in to eachother. Some are smokescreens. Either way the issue of inflation remains and isn't going away anytime soon. If we reverse (pivot) and return to QE, it'll only be a matter of time before we suffer from out of control inflation and ultimately hyperinflation. And if the global reserve currency experiences hyperinflation, that would be devastating for the entire world. Nobody wants that. It's time for citizens to start really paying attention to everything that is happening and prepare accordingly. \n\nIt is still unclear if the \"soft landing\" theory is still possible, but personally I feel it best to just expect the worst and be prepared as best you can.

What‚Äôs potentially more important is the dot plot and where they think interest rates will be a year from now. Market pricing in rate cuts, sometimes as much as 100.\n\nWhy I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll cut or posture that possibility for now. People are concerned about the hikes and bank failures. It‚Äôs not the actual rate, but the pace of hikes that caused these paper losses (that disappear at maturity or eventually rates come back down). So it‚Äôs more of a duration problem more than anything.\n\nThe big banks have no liquidity issues with a bank run, but the smaller ones still do. Especially with unique clientele. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre back stopping depositors to hopefully keep faith in the current financial system and not cause more bank runs.\n\nWhat I think jpow will say is something like inflation is still too high. They realize the rate hikes have a lagging effect and they‚Äôre keeping a close eye on how it‚Äôs making its way through the system, data dependent and all. Parts of inflation is still too sticky and they need those parts to come down. What this means is that maybe the peak rate will be lower than what people were thinking before bank failures, but still held higher for longer (no cuts). Once again, keeping rates high doesn‚Äôt break the system, just the pace of the hikes in a time frame with current assets.\n\nWhy I think he has to say this. If he postures with pause or cuts, and inflation gets higher, they are now essentially forced to hike even higher and faster to try and curb inflation again. If current system is that fragile, even more hikes faster will truly cause problems.
