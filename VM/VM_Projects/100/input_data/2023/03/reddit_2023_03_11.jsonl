{"title": "Why SVB is just the beginning, Analysis of the fall of SVB from a Financial Analyst", "selftext": "Ignore the headlines and news anchor, they don't really understand shit. But stuff is just about to kick off and I am going to help explain what is happening and will be happening in the coming weeks and months.\n\nFrom the start of this fed cycle, I have been wondering who has been eating losses. Basic financial equation 101 teaches you that the present value of an asset is a function of the discount rate applied to its future cf or coupon rate. When the 10/30 year went from 1.5-2.0% in 2019-2021 to 4-5% this year, this meant the market value of those bonds would have fallen by close to 20-25%.\n\nFor example TLT, which is the 30 year teasury ETF, has fallen by about 21% in the LTM.\n\nMost people don't understand the bond market in the US is the largest in the world, dwarfing the stock market. It is about twice the size of the stockmarket and is the deepest and most liquid securities market in the world. Within this market, the deepest and most liquid part of the market is made up of US treasuries and mortgage backed agency MBS securities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuaouidc91na1.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2253c2fa00b34fffb1c3d835a530a2f063ca266\n\nWith the sudden spike up in rates over the last 12-16 months, the mark to market losses of the bond market is probably somewhere to the tune of 4-6 trillion. And I have always been wondering where that was going to show up and blow something up in the financial market. And the answer is in the banks.\n\nDon't believe what they tell you, Silicon Valley Bank was a very conservative bank. Out of their \\~200 billion in assets, very little (<0.5%) was venture debt lending. As you can see in their Q4 Balance Sheet, they had 15 billion in cash/cash like securities, about 120 billion investment securities and 70 billion in loans.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1txj1mjma1na1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1545218bb68e66ee4af075437b9fb9f170a36432\n\nwithin that 120 billion investment securities, it is almost entirely treasuries and Agency MBS/CMO and CMBS with a touch of muni bonds. You can't build a more conservative book if you tried. As these are all effective government securities as the GSEs are still in conservatorship under the treasury. For years due to Basel III, US banks have been derisking and now most of their balance sheets consists of government or quasi government securites which have almost no default risks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsa5410ab1na1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4996cc97b23bbf068198fd88faa4c631a1d3a3c\n\nNow looking at the loan book, you can see the bulk of it is in global fund banking and investor dependent. Global Fund banking is an extremely safe segment, it consists of largely funding or bridging loans to venture capitalist making transactions. So for example if a VC  wants to invest in company A, but they want to wait 2 months before drawing down from their LPs, they will go to SVB to get a credit line for this purpose. This is an extremely safe business model as Venture/PE Funding is contracted funding and there has been basically no defaults on these types of loans ever in history. Then you have private bank, which consisted of lending to rich people over collateralized through the value of their houses, which is also a pretty safe business model as their asset coverage typically exceeds 150% of the loan value.\n\nEven the investor dependent segment is typically very safe book, as they will write loans as simply a bridge when a financing round for the company has already closed, but are still waiting a few months for the all the papers to be signed and the funds to be transfered.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r44w54mdc1na1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=66d0b5e8df56629b339215eadf3c7c41a6fd9560\n\nSo wtf is happening, this is a bank that is holding like 2/3 of its book in government papers and the rest in fairly safe lending. The speculative lending to early tech business represent <0.5% of the book.\n\nThe answer is the federal reserve, this guy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55mo4dswd1na1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f1e109a395c4eb8712e6b1cd9b917ea2b86b3c4\n\nHe basically fucked over the entire banking sector. Remember that 120 billion in agency backed papers  and treasuries in the investment securities section of SVB , well, most of that is HTM (Hold to Maturnity). Its a bank, get over it, a duration mismatch is expected. But the amplitute of the loss is proportional to the raise in rates due simply how bonds work. In the SVB book, the average maturity is around 6 years. Some simple math point to about a 10% loss in this investment book that hasn't been marked to market, representing about 12 billion in losses. This wiped out all the equity of the bank and some of the  value of the bonds.\n\nOverall the Agency papers and treasuries can be sold over the course of the next couple of weeks and depositers will get about 60 cents on the dollar and the remainder will be sold over the next 12-48 months and I expect most depositers to get back close to 90 cents + on the dollar.\n\nWell that's great, you might say. NO, IT IS NOT GREAT. BECAUSE SVB was not a bad bank, it was actually a pretty conservative bank. It also wouldn't be insolvent if it wasn't for the fed. What it did suffer from was a unique deposit base that was largely not FDIC insured. Since it was largely catering to start-up companies, most accounts went above the FDIC limit of 250k, as a result, this was simply a bank run similar to during the great depression. It doesn't matter how safe the bank was, if there is a run, you won't survive it. And the uniqueness of start-ups which are most often cash burning and therefore extremely senstivie to the lack of cash just meant they were more flighty depositers. Marry that to the game theory dynamics of the low cost of getting your money out first so you can meet payroll mean't that once it starts, you can't stop it.\n\nOk, you ask, what the hell does it all mean for the future. Well, here is the thing. If SVB is underwater, are all the banks are underwater?\n\nHere are the assets of JPM, again, for the major banks, JPM has a 3.5 trillion balance sheet, and BOA has a 3 trillion balance sheet. JPM only lists out 641 billion of that 3.5 trillion as trading securities and thus and they reported a loss of \\~50 billion or \\~8%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pskuutvch1na1.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbd2fe255159ceca0284c2093bae9ffbf6182420\n\nThis is a similar picture with BOA, which lists out trading securites of 300 billion, but there is another 2.7 billion in other assets, of which 1 trillion are longer dated treasuries and agency securities. If we mark to market those losses, there is another 80-100 billion in losses which are not being marked to market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwn7vmluk1na1.png?width=1775&format=png&auto=webp&s=a593d96bc08e6bf8f25ca66921421307aecedc56\n\nAgain, going back to the original thought, someone lost 4-6 trillion through the bond market from fed raising rates. Close to 2 trillion is lost through agency securities with the reminder from treasuries. Unironically, close to 15% of this is lost from the fed itself, due to its own balance sheet of treasuries and agency papers. It looks like around 30% of those agency security losses or about \\~600 billion is through the commerical banks. I suspect probably another 300-400 billion though treasuries. So the banking sector has lost about 1 trillion in the past year, of which only maybe 100-200 billion has actually been marked-to-market down as losses.\n\nRemember, the size of the losses in Subprime was only about \\~100 billion. Now, every 50 bps increase by the fed results in close to that much in losses to the banking sector. So yes, Mr. Powell wil likely blow up the entire banking system.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rc3npwezm1na1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=6679401a95b4c44e6a8d86bd33ffb109b19b7e26\n\nEdit 1: Alot of people are pointing out that the deposit base of other banks are signficantly different. Yes 100% agree, but the run on liquidity of a bank can come in two ways. One is on the deposit side (see great depression and SVB), the other way is through the interbank funding market (alas 2008). I will write a part II in the coming days of the drying up of that source of liqudity.\n\nEdit 2: Also a lot of people keep pointing to hedging and managing duration risk. This is BS as all the banks have this unrealized loss on their balance sheet, go look.Imagine God telling everyone he is going to destroy your house, now go and try to find insurance on your house for less than the cost of building a new house. And to the smart asses mentioning swaps. Go ahead and try to swap your house for a new house for anything less 0. Now think termites slowly destroying your house over the course of a year instead an earthquake, good luck being the person trying to hedge that. But the most relevant point is that a security that is classified under the HTM category, it cannot have any hedges. So to all the people who think this was a risk management issue, go look at all the other banks, they have not hedged their HTM securties either. To compound this, the fed in 2021 signaled very strongly to market that rates were going to held at zero until 2024, and then pivoted in 12 months, throwing everyone in for a loop. There was no realistic way for any management or risk management team to have handled this. So yes, the blame lies largely with the fed here.\n\nEdit 3: on all the people saying the larger banks are so much smarter and know what they are doing. SVB had the most liquid portfolio of any bank out there. They had about 8% of their desposits in cash and about \\~45% in GSE/treasuries which is the most liquid instrument out there and can be sold down in a weeks notice. None of the other/largest banks are even close to that. The larger banks have a much lower deposit base like \\~25%-30% of their capital base and maybe 10-20% in equity and 50-60% are based in interbank financing (hello 2008). The finiky parts of the larger bank's capital structure aren't deposits, most of these are FDIC insured (but still probably only half or so as the business accounts certaintly aren't), it is the intrabank financing part. You know, the stuff that blew up lehman and bear sterns.\n\nAlso people don't seem grasp what a bank is and think they should be 100% in cash or something. You do understand banks make money from spreads. Signaling to investors you are taking depositer cash, and investing them in 3-month t-bills yielding 0.25% is a great way to tell them you don't actually have a business model and is a money losing startup like Wework or some shit.", "id": "11obkuc", "created_utc": 1678511875.0, "score": 2207, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 986, "comments": [{"body": "On one hand this sounds like some really intelligent analysis.

There is absolutely no reason for any of the banks to utilize this accounting method for bonds that they hold. They will be using a historical cost accounting basis for the bonds.  \n  \nOp says someone lost 4-6 trillion on the bond market. No, no they did not. Bonds have 4 values that determine their price, the face value of the bond, the interest rate paid by the bond, time to maturity, and it's trading value. A $100 5year bond that pays 2% annually will sell for $100 if the prevailing inters rate is 2%.(I'm ignoring the risk of interest rate change) If you buy it and hold it to maturity you will get $2 every year and then your $100 back at the end this is hold to maturity. If the prevailing interest rate is 5% and none of the other parts of the bond change the bond with sell for $87 which just so happens to be what you get if you discount the $100 by the difference in the prevailing interest rate and the coupon rate(the rate paid by the bond) or 3%. If there was only a year left until bond maturity and all the other parameters were the same the bond would sell for $97. So the longer you hold bond the less effect the interest rate disparity has on the market price and at maturity there is no difference in price. So now that we understand that we can go back to that $4-6 trillion \"loss\" number that OP claimed. Those aren't losses that will ever be realized that represents the opportunity cost in terms of interest rate differential between low interest rate bonds that had been purchased prior to the fed beginning it's interest rate hikes and the current prevailing interest rates. However to take advantage of the interest rate hikes the investors who supposedly lost $4-6 trillion would have had to have all their investments in cash which is not feasible.  \n  \nNow lets address Silicon Valley Bank and OP's assertion that it was a conservative bank. Did SVB have a pretty conservative portfolio? Sure. Does have a conservative asset portfolio necessarily equate to conservative bank management? Absolutely not. The fact of the matter is that SVB courted a unique clientele. Specifically, they courted a clientele that had high withdrawal needs and were more likely than other types of clients to draw down their deposits over time. To account for this type of client risk and manage the bank in a conservative manner SVB should have held a much larger percentage of their assets in short dated bonds and cash equivalents so that they had the funds available to meet client withdrawal demand.  \n  \nLong dated interest bearing assets are not cash equivalents, but in a flat or declining interest rate environment can effectively be treated as such. However, in an increasing interest rate environment like we've had over the past 18 months long dated interest bearing assets become effectively illiquid due to the decline in the market value of the asset. The effective illiquidity is a result of the fact that the sale of long dated interest bearing assets will turn what amounts to lost investment opportunity into a real monetary and accounting loss as the seller of the asset effectively takes a loan against the asset but is required to pay the interest on the loan upfront out of the value of the loan.  \n  \nNow that we have the above information we can work out a general picture of what happened. SVB's assets and deposits grew massively over the past 5 years. Most of this new money was used to acquire long dated interest bearing assets while serving a clientele that relies on have easy access to their cash assets and that due to the nature of tech and venture capital investment are more likely to need greater access to their deposits in an increasing interest rate environment which SVB was already over exposed to due to their \"conservative investment\" choices. As a predictable consequence of the increasing interest rate environment, depositors started to need more access to their deposits than they have previously. This increased deposit withdrawal started to deplete SVB's limited cash assets. SVB needed to raise new capital to shore up it's cash assets or it would be required to start selling it's illiquid long dated interest bearing assets. SVB for some reason was unable to raise capital prior to this information becoming public. Depositors got wind of this and started pulling non-FDIC insured assets setting off the bank run downward spiral.  \n  \nSVB's collapse was predictable, and the result of an completely inappropriate mix of maturity dates on its assets. Frankly the incompetence shown by the SVB's leadership and CEO is staggering especially for someone who was on the board of the San Francisco Fed.  \n  \nIn conclusion OP's analysis is almost as bad as Greg Becker's understanding of how to responsibly run a bank.

That sucks because now I have a shitty rate by comparison...but my bond should still get me 3% (if it pays). That 3% rate that I locked in hasn't changed.\n* But, a lot of the time, I don't buy the 30 year bond expecting to actually hold it for 30 years. I just bought it as a low-risk place to put money, and I plan to sell it in a year or two when I want to reposition my money.\n* But, a year later, there are bonds available that pay 5%, so no one wants to buy my comparatively shitty bond that pays 3%. So, if I want to sell it, I have to lower my price so that the buyer's effective payback is comparable to bonds that are now available. In that way, the value of my bond has dropped, even though the terms of the bond itself haven't changed.\n\nThat's the very basics.

FINDINGS OF FACT The Commissioner of Financial Protection and Innovation (‚ÄúCommissioner‚Äù) finds: 1. Silicon Valley Bank Silicon Valley Bank (the ‚ÄúBank‚Äù) is, and was at all times mentioned in these Findings of Fact, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of California and authorized by the Commissioner to transact commercial banking business in the State of California. 2. Liquidity and Insolvency On March 8, 2023, the Bank announced a loss of approximately $1.8 billion from a sale of investments (U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities). On March 8, 2023, the Bank‚Äôs holding company announced it was conducting a capital raise. Despite the bank being in sound financial condition prior to March 9, 2023, investors and depositors reacted by initiating withdrawals of $42 billion in deposits from the Bank on March 9, 2023, causing a run on the Bank. As of the close of business on March 9, the bank had a negative cash balance of approximately $958 million. Despite attempts from the Bank, with the assistance of regulators, to transfer collateral from various sources, the Bank did not meet its cash letter with the Federal Reserve. The precipitous deposit withdrawal has caused the Bank to be incapable of paying its obligations as they come due, and the bank is now insolvent.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "The rate hikes lowering the value of federal bonds is intentional.

It also wouldn't be insolvent if it wasn't for the fed. What it did suffer from was a unique deposit base that was largely not FDIC insured. Since it was largely catering to start-up companies, most accounts went above the FDIC limit of 250k, as a result, this was simply a bank run similar to during the great depression. It doesn't matter how safe the bank was, if there is a run, you won't survive it. And the uniqueness of start-ups which are most often cash burning and therefore extremely senstivie to the lack of cash just meant they were more flighty depositers.\"\n\nYou contradicted yourself. The issue is fundamentally tied to their client base which is heavily skewed to being reliant on cash flow, having poor - if any - profits, and a deposit base that is extremely underinsured. While rates may have been an issue for them in terms of ability to sell assets to meet capital demand, the fact is until there was a run they were fine. If the particulars of their client base had allowed them to raise capital they'd have been able to stabilize. \n\nHopefully other banks have been looking at their unrealized losses on bonds as large risks in the short term, and they have been able to raise their available capital. I'm not in the US but in Canada over the last few months regulators gave required banks to increase their capital holdings for the same reason - risk. Many lenders have also tightened lending and underwriting rules as a result of risk too. One thing that I think we share though is pretty trashy simple deposit savings rates. If large banks started offering 4% high yield cash deposit accounts tomorrow, they all become more well capitalized as well. But they're not so that's part of the issue. Ppl are going to locked in bonds and money market funds instead which are handled differently and also don't help bank capitalization in super liquid low risk ways. \n\nFact is the bank had \"safe\" investments sure. But the environment made them inherently less safe since, as you noted, it's an issue of maturity for low yield bonds having to be sold at a loss to compete with high yield alternatives on the open market. \n\nUnless the government buys those treasuries back with no interest paid out, they will lose value. And doing that is a moral hazard that devalues risk planning because, ultimately, safe treasuries are not safe when sold early. And to avoid that risk, given their clientele, SVB should have begun preparing months ago as rates rose and inflation persisted. \n\nOther banks aren't immune from the same error, but they may very well have significantly more runway if they've been preparing for a while, and if their clientele isnt anywhere near as cash sensitive in both nature and degree.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "[Bill Ackman's take:](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1634564398919368704)\n\n\" The gov‚Äôt has about 48 hours to fix a-soon-to-be-irreversible mistake. By allowing [@SVB\\_Financial](https://twitter.com/SVB_Financial) to fail without protecting all depositors, the world has woken up to what an uninsured deposit is ‚Äî an unsecured illiquid claim on a failed bank. Absent [@jpmorgan](https://twitter.com/jpmorgan) [@citi](https://twitter.com/citi) or [@BankofAmerica](https://twitter.com/BankofAmerica) acquiring SVB before the open on Monday, a prospect I believe to be unlikely, or the gov‚Äôt guaranteeing all of SVB‚Äôs deposits, the giant sucking sound you will hear will be the withdrawal of substantially all uninsured deposits from all but the ‚Äòsystemically important banks‚Äô (SIBs). These funds will be transferred to the SIBs, US Treasury (UST) money market funds and short-term UST. There is already pressure to transfer cash to short-term UST and UST money market accounts due to the substantially higher yields available on risk-free UST vs. bank deposits. These withdrawals will drain liquidity from community, regional and other banks and begin the destruction of these important institutions. The increased demand for short-term UST will drive short rates lower complicating the [@federalreserve](https://twitter.com/federalreserve) ‚Äôs efforts to raise rates to slow the economy. Already thousands of the fastest growing, most innovative venture-backed companies in the U.S. will begin to fail to make payroll next week. Had the gov‚Äôt stepped in on Friday to guarantee SVB‚Äôs deposits (in exchange for penny warrants which would have wiped out the substantial majority of its equity value) this could have been avoided and SVB‚Äôs 40-year franchise value could have been preserved and transferred to a new owner in exchange for an equity injection. We would have been open to participating. This approach would have minimized the risk of any gov‚Äôt losses, and created the potential for substantial profits from the rescue. Instead, I think it is now unlikely any buyer will emerge to acquire the failed bank. The gov‚Äôt‚Äôs approach has guaranteed that more risk will be concentrated in the SIBs at the expense of other banks, which itself creates more systemic risk. For those who make the case that depositors be damned as it would create moral hazard to save them, consider the feasibility of a world where each depositor must do their own credit assessment of the bank they choose to bank with. I am a pretty sophisticated financial analyst and I find most banks to be a black box despite the 1,000s of pages of [@SECGov](https://twitter.com/SECGov) filings available on each bank. SVB‚Äôs senior management made a basic mistake. They invested short-term deposits in longer-term, fixed-rate assets. Thereafter short-term rates went up and a bank run ensued. Senior management screwed up and they should lose their jobs. The [@FDICgov](https://twitter.com/FDICgov) and OCC also screwed up. It is their job to monitor our banking system for risk and SVB should have been high on their watch list with more than $200B of assets and $170B of deposits from business borrowers in effectively the same industry. The FDIC‚Äôs and OCC‚Äôs failure to do their jobs should not be allowed to cause the destruction of 1,000s of our nation‚Äôs highest potential and highest growth businesses (and the resulting losses of 10s of 1,000s of jobs for some of our most talented younger generation) while also permanently impairing our community and regional banks‚Äô access to low-cost deposits. This administration is particularly opposed to concentrations of power. Ironically, its approach to SVB‚Äôs failure guarantees duopolistic banking risk concentration in a handful of SIBs. My back-of-the envelope review of SVB‚Äôs balance sheet suggests that even in a liquidation, depositors should eventually get back about 98% of their deposits, but eventually is too long when you have payroll to meet next week. So even without assigning any franchise value to SVB, the cost of a gov‚Äôt guarantee of SVB deposits would be minimal. On the other hand, the unintended consequences of the gov‚Äôt‚Äôs failure to guarantee SVB deposits are vast and profound and need to be considered and addressed before Monday.

Hedging is literally taught in textbooks.\n\nHere‚Äôs some quotes from a textbook I used to teach a grad level fixed income class. \n\nTextbook ‚ÄúFixed Income Securities: Valuation, Risk, and Risk Management‚Äù by Pietro Veronesi (2010)\n\nFrom the Preface:\nAs the world of fixed income securities becomes more complex, I believe that anyone who studies fixed income securities must be exposed more directly to this complexity.\n\nIn addition, in modern financial markets, countries‚Äô central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, actively intervene in fixed income markets to affect interest rates in the attempt to spur real growth and keep inflation low. A fixed income book cannot sidestep the central banks‚Äô influence on fixed income securities.\n\nThe book also highlights the fact that most of the analysis of fixed income securities must rely on some models of the term structure, that is, some particular assumptions about the movement of yields through time.\n\nChapter 3 contains the basics of risk management: The chapter introduces the concept of duration, and its use to design effective hedging strategies, as in asset-liability management. The chapter also introduces the popular risk measures of Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall.\n\nChapter 5 introduces basic interest rate derivatives, such as forwards and swaps. Besides describing their properties and their pricing methodology, several examples throughout the chapter also illustrate the use of such derivative contracts for an effective risk management strategy. The chapter ends with a case study discussing the risks embedded in a popular trade, a swap spread trade, a case that also provides further understanding of the swap market itself.\n\nA book on fixed income securities must mention the impact that monetary policy has on interest rates. Chapter 7 discusses the Federal Reserve policy rules, and covers in particular the Federal Funds rate.\n\nFrom 3.3 INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT\nInterest rate risk management is a key activity for banks, bond portfolio managers, corporations, governments, and, in fact, households.\n\nFrom 3.4 ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT\nAsset liability management is the most classic example of interest rate risk management.\nMany financial institutions have a duration mismatch between their assets and their liabilities,\nas illustrated in Table 3.4. For instance, a commercial bank collects deposits ‚Äì a\nshort-term liability whose interest rate changes daily ‚Äì to make medium- and long-term\nloans to other business or households. If the medium- and long-term loans have fixed\ncoupons, as in fixed rate mortgages for instance, then the duration of the assets is relatively\nlong, for instance 5 years or more. On the other hand, deposits have a duration close to\nzero, as the short term interest rate needs to be adjusted frequently as market conditions\nchange.\n\nWhat happens if there is a hike in interest rates?\n\nThe analysis in previous sections shows that the value of the assets drop, while the value\nof the liabilities does not change. In flow terms, the bank now has to pay a high rate on the\ndeposits, but still receives a low coupon from its assets.

It is actually valid to some respect but it leaves out key information. Like for instance the profitability, capital buffer and accounting standards used. So lets take JP Morgan:\n\nOP claims there is a 50bln pnl gap between the amortised cost method and fair value (actual market price) methodology. First this is almost but not entirely correct. Accounting standards differentiate 3 kinds of security status: held until maturity, available for sale and trading. OP is right that when held until maturity suffers a fair value loss, it will not be accounted for in the PnL statement. however if there is a loss in available for sale it will be accounted for in a section called other comprehensive income and it will actually hit the shareholders value. JP Morgan has a profit of 35bln after tax but reported a comprehensive income of only 20bln, mainly accounting for the loss suffered in the available for sale section (around 11bln). So we are actually only talking about 37bln loss which has not hit the balance sheet (not income statement) yet.\n\nWhich brings me to the second point. JP Morgan made a profit of 46bln pretax, (or 31bln accounting for the other comprehensive income loss). Which is entirely enough to cover the unaccounted losses incurred in the held until maturity section (u also get tax back if u have a loss). Also JP Morgan still has 292bln in shareholder value to cover these losses as well. So to say that JP Morgan will blow up after total incoming 75bps raise in interest rate is a bit ‚Äúfar fetched‚Äù, also taking into account that mainly it is the short end of the yield curve steepens. So a 75bps raise will impact the bonds maybe in total by 30-40bps.\n\nAlso keep in mind, high interest rates are fantastic for banks in the long run. JP Morgan already reported a 30% increase of net interest income.\n\nI would not be surprised if the FED slows down after the SVB collapse. Especially after the good unemployment figures and wage growth last week (3.6% vs 3.4% expect, 0.2% vs 0.3% expected).
