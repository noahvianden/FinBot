If banks fail while rates are paused, the fed will have to QE and slash rates which will instantly vaporize purchasing power and the value of the dollar overnight. Markets of course would go up, but so will the price of bread. So you might as well just buy bread now, save it, then sell for a profit that pays off the house. In other words, hyper inflation. Same thing happens if rates were slashed right away (no pause).\n\nI can't think of any other way this can play out without causing more problems for inflation. Hopefully the greedy owners of said banks will be on the hook for these losses just like how capitalism should work. The means to socialize the losses has reached full capacity. If the fed can grow a pair and just let these greedy banks fail, we just might see a future for us in 10 years. Will there be some serious consequences for larger banks that fail? Ya, absolutely but there is no other alternative to this situation. We can't keep printing money. If the country saw another 9/11 happen or COVID it's game over. The fed isn't going to simulate the economy because it can't without prolonging rate hikes and increasing inflation.\n\nOtherwise, expect the dollar to become worthless, world economy in shambles and the new reserve currency being the asset backed currency currently being built by nations in the East.

Recently banks have taken out huge amounts of loans from here to prepare for any continuation in panic outflows that have arisen from the SVB and Signature Bank debacles. \n\nThe amount of money banks take out as a loan isn't decided on what they will need in the likeliest scenario. It's decided on how much they will need in the worst case scenario. Banks are trying to gather enough liquidity to not only survive the outflows that are happening now, but to also survive the second and third wave of panic outflows in case other banks would fall, think of First Republic Bank.\n\nThe loans banks have taken aren't meant to be pumped into the economy through assets or commodities. They are purely meant as short term liquidity backstops for risk prevention. It's why I expect the vast majority of these giant loans given out by the Fed to be returned as soon as possible, likely in the next 3 months. \n\nThese 5% fed loans are expensive, and banks can not rely on them forever. That's why smaller banks will intentionally give out less loans to reduce risk on defaults and to maintain more liquidity. \n\nBy slowing down the amounts of loans these banks give, the economy automatically slows down with it.                 \nBy slowing down the economy, you slow down inflation. \n\nThe people with the idea that the fed liquidity will increase inflation has the whole story completely twisted, inflation will actually have double downwards pressure from here on out.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why markets have started pricing in rate cuts already.
