Much of the loss is due to rising healthcare costs which is a separate form of inflation that has little in common with what we’re discussing here (majority of employers have little control over healthcare inflation independently).\n\nIf you are keen on understanding how the most recent banking crisis happened, I’d suggest this as a decent primer of the situation: https://concentratedcompounding.substack.com/p/some-thoughts-on-banks\n\nSorry if I’m coming across being patronizing.

The only supply side incentives we try are unaccountably giving money to businesses (tax cuts, ZIRP, etc.) instead of tying those to actual increases in business capacity. We have disproportionately rewarded growth in market value of a company. This is part of the reason that stock buy backs and similar financial schemes contribute to inflation: too few goods.

It ends up in banks, and then those banks store it with the Federal Reserve and receive interest on it.  Check that out here:\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS)\n\nIt's not like banks receive money from QE and then immediately lend that out to consumers and producers.  Most of them hold it at the Fed.  The transmission mechanism of QE isn't exactly direct, it's about getting lower interest rates and not necessarily increasing the money supply.\n\nHere's a good take about how QE might contribute to inflation:\n\n\"\\[During the '08 financial crisis\\], banks chose to hold the proceeds of QE as excess reserves rather than increasing their pace of lending and thereby creating money. While QE was in progress, the Fed and the BOE were pushing on a string.In these circumstances, QE is not inflationary. It may become inflationary if it achieves its intended purpose of stimulating more economic activity by fueling bank lending and money creation.\"\n\nSource: [https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/364\\_whats\\_up\\_quantitative\\_easing\\_and\\_inflation](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/364_whats_up_quantitative_easing_and_inflation)\n\nJust take the case of Japan. They've been running QE for 20 or so years now and are only now facing inflation of over 4%.  So it's clear that there's not necessarily a direct link between QE and prices.\n\nThat's why I'm hesitant about people like Peter Schiff and Michael Burry saying that \"we're going to have hyperinflation because of QE\".  A more balanced approach recognizes the potential inflationary potential (though not necessarily hyperinflationary), and even admits the possibility of deflation.\n\nWhy deflation?  Because as we've seen this week (and also in UK gilt markets in October of last year), a sudden increase in interest rates after a long period of low rates can be very destabilizing to the financial system.  If something breaks and we have a financial crisis and recession, then that's deflationary.  Debt also becomes more expensive to pay because, during deflation, the real value of debt increases with time, leading to a vicious cycle.  And there's also the possibility that the Fed's QE ceases to be stimulative, which has been the case for Japan for the last 20 years.  For more about how loose monetary policy can lead to deflation, see here: [https://www.dallasfed.org/\\~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)\n\nThe same source does say that there's some evidence for hyperinflationary tendencies with these policies.  I suppose hyperinflation or prolonged, elevated inflation could be a risk if the Fed is forced to give up on their fight on inflation and inflation expectations become unhinged.  That said, they say that recession and deflation are a more likely outcome.\n\nIn sum, there's very real risks with these policies.  There may be an inflationary effect of money printing, based on increased lending, and inflation expectations may even become unhinged, as mentioned above.  That forces the Fed to tighten.  But at the same time, given our addiction to low rates, that sudden tightening can lead to a financial crisis.  That may result in a deep recession and even deflation.\n\nIMO this is a much more balanced and academic analysis rather than Schiff and Burry's \"money printer = hyperinflation\".  We simply haven't seen anything like that.\n\n/u/absoluteunitVolcker /u/Sad-Round8961 you may be interested in this as well.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is fascinating, thank you very much. I didn’t realise the link between inflation and QE was much more nuanced but it makes sense. So why is Japan’s QE inflationary and it wasn’t before? Because banks are now lending out to producers and consumers surely but what caused that change. Also if you have QE and low inflation and something breaks..that means you’re screwed because there aren’t many tools at your disposal to deal with it right? Or do you not agree with that.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">So why is Japan’s QE inflationary and it wasn’t before? \n\nI'm not sure if the inflation Japan is experiencing is directly caused by QE.  It may be the same factors that are affecting prices everywhere: supply chains, war, de-globalization, etc.  Monetary policy is just one factor that affects price, just one of many.\n\n>Also if you have QE and low inflation and something breaks..that means you’re screwed because there aren’t many tools at your disposal to deal with it right? Or do you not agree with that.\n\nThat's exactly right.  This is precisely why central banks like the Fed aim for 2% inflation, and some economists are even saying (and have been saying prior to all of this) that we should aim for something higher like 3-4%.  Imagine if we have something disinflationary, like a recession.  If inflation is already at 2%, there's more room for inflation to fall before we hit deflationary territory.  \n\nBut imagine if inflation is at 0%.  In that case, during a downturn, it's likely that we head directly into deflationary territory.  If we were at 3-4% by default, we'd have even more \"room to maneuver\".\n\nSome amount of inflation is seen as good because it means people are spending and the economy is expanding.  Deflation is seen as bad because it means the opposite.  So we want to try to grease the wheels and always stay in a place where things are growing, but not in such a way that interferes with price stability (like the inflation we've seen recently).\n\nWhen QE is already being run and rates are already at zero, which has been the case in Japan for 20 years now and 15 in the USA, and things aren't being stimulated, then yes, there's not really much else you can do.  This is why central banks are becoming more innovative.  QE itself is targeted at longer-duration interest rates, as opposed to traditional interest rate policies which are aimed only at short-term rates.  The Bank of Japan buys Japanese stock ETFs.  Some European countries, and also Japan, have been experimenting with *negative* interest rates.\n\nBut you're right, when you're already running massive easy money and inflation is low and things aren't growing, there's not really much else you can do.  This is called the \"Liquidity trap\".  No matter how much money you pour into the system, or how low rates go, people just don't want to invest or expand.  All of these innovative solutions, including QE, were designed to address that.  Whether they have been effective is up for debate, though the mainstream view is generally that they have been.  A heterodox view that's not Peter Schiff territory would say that, yes, they can be effective, but there should be other solutions as well and they also come with dangerous side effects, such as the build-up of financial instability in the system.  We're arguably seeing that now.\n\nOther solutions could be making targeted investments in specific industries, like semiconductors, green energy, infrastructure, tech, etc.  We're seeing some of that now with things like the CHIPS act, but not nearly enough IMO.  This is seen as an alternative to just throwing money at the system which more often than not seems to end up sitting in banks and then going into assets, causing their prices to rise.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Don't know.

But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.\n\n> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.\n\nSo financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.\n\nThe firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works?

Since you are long stock B the gains in stock  B should \"cancel\" the future losses in stock A.\n\nNext if you sell calls on stock B (covered call) you should be able to start collecting premium to cover the losses on stock A.

You manage the bad hedge just like you would a covered call. If you pick a very high correlation though, the likelihood of that occurring is much smaller than the likelihood of you continuing to hemorrhage money from your bad position. Think of it like \"buying your way into a lower risk position\"\n\nEdit:\n\nAnother note, if two things have a low absolute Pearson correlation coefficient, it does not mean that they are not correlated. But if something has a high absolute Pearson correlation coefficient (ie: 0.9) then that means with a high degree of certainty they are linearly correlated.

If they center around .8-.9 then you have a high degree of certaithat they are linearly correlated strongly\n\nTip 3: don't over hedge, you will never find an asset that move perfectly with another unless they are specifically designed that way (think spx, spy) so better to under hedge so you commit less capital and have more room to adjust in the worst case scenario\n\nTip 4: When in doubt, roll.

The increase in deaths since the lockdowns has been massive, and negative effects that don't involve death are also way up like child language issues, antisocial behavior, suicidal ideation, etc etc.\n\nOK, let's look at excess deaths during the \"lockdown\" period.\n\nIn the United States, the trend of excess deaths averaged 97,000/yr, with the majority being related to \"hypertension\" (which doesn't actually kill you, it's another event related to it that might kill you) and heart disease... fully 1/3rd of them.\n\nOf the rest, diabetes is heavily represented.\n\nThese are both heavily weighted in 2020, where we know that bad testing and stressed systems resulted in a built-in undercount of COVID deaths (which is common for viruses, particularly new viruses since detection is imperfect). The PCR tests have a false negative ratio in studies of about 30%, and the antigen tests individually have a whopping 50% false negative ratio.\n\nIn other words, a LOT of these are COVID deaths which were not classified due to testing limitations, and the primary factors related to COVID mortality are heart and diabetic issues because they interact with how ACE2 infecting viruses affect the body.\n\nBut OK, I'll accept that there was an elevation in non-COVID related heart, hypertension-related, and diabetic deaths... pandemics and political turmoil are very stressful, as is isolation. No doubt... but you'd have had this anyway just because of the extreme stress and fear of living in a pandemic and a politically turbulent period.\n\nThe rest are alcohol and drug abuse related, largely... which has been trending up for years before the pandemic, so this is not specifically a pandemic-related issue.\n\n[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00469580221139016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00469580221139016)\n\nBut the pandemic has societal impacts, which you can see in these numbers. Your entire argument hinges on the fairy tale that \"without lockdowns\" everything would have been normal. That's just beyond fucking stupid. It's so fucking stupid I can't believe I have to say how fucking stupid it is.\n\nAnd worse, the claim is beyond idiotic when assessed not just as issues with excess mortality outside of COVID, it's idiotic when tested against the alteranative:\n\nA totally open, normal society like you're claiming should have existed.\n\nAt 1% mortality rate and a 2-year timeframe, assuming 80% infection with the original virus or delta due to no controls, you're talking annual excess COVID mortalities in excess of 3 MILLION in the United States.\n\nSo I don't know, which number's higher and more impactful to society? 97,000, or 3,000,000?\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that you don't know any of this because you say \"look at the excess non-COVID deaths\" but... you've never actually looked at them. You just read it on a meme somewhere and built an argument around it to reinforce your presumptions.\n\nBut I also must account for the fact that you clearly did not read or understand any of the sources you provided, which suggests you are at least somewhat functionally illiterate and cognitively deficient, so I don't know... maybe you actually DO think 97,000 is a higher number than 3 million.

COVID spread \\*within\\* the household (which means heavy exposure) was high across the board, regardless of vaccination status, which has a very solid reason. which we'll get into in a bit. \n\nWe don't have significant data on household spread for the original variant with vaccinated households because, as you said, by the time vaccine uptake became common, delta was the dominant variant.\n\nYour contention here is that COVID transmission went from a mythical, non-existent 0 under the original variant to this number because you're falling victim to the framing of a clickbait headline and a bad rhetorical dichotomy that intellectually limited people have fallen into where vaccines, to work, have to stop infections.\n\nThat's not how vaccines fucking work. What they do is allow the immune system to fight a virus sooner and potentially block low level initial infections.\n\nVaccines don't put up a magic shield against viruses. If you're around a virus that you've been vaccinated against, its particles will get into your nose, and its RNA will be present, as will the immune factors involved in fighting the infection. Again, there's no fucking magic shield.\n\nSo it's not a surprise that people who live in households tested positive even if vaccinated... that's just fucking physics related to how the test works. Basically physiological reality.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the vaccine caused a drop in this metric at all... in fact, a 35% drop. That's because of how vaccines work, by allowing the frontline defense to fight an infection, duration and severity of illness drop, as does chance of spread (testing positive doesn't matter as much as chance of spread to others). \n\nBasically, this data doesn't mean what you're presenting and the data doesn't exist to prove your claim. This is a part of a pattern. Your arguments are basically all logical fallacies.\n\nLiterally, the only data you've provided here says that vaccinated people are LESS likely to spread/contract/be detected with COVID than unvaccinated people. I'm glad we agree on that. There's no data here that proves your claim. Also if you actually read your article, proximity to vaccination was the real determinating factor, but that would require actually reading an article and understanding it rather than buying a clickbait headline.\n\n \n\n>Which was a personal decision because lockdowns and vaccines did very little to prevent transmission.\n\nFalse. If you get vaccinated and your infection is at a lower level and lasts for a shorter period of time, you emit less virus, meaning you're less likely to infect others.\n\nThis is another in a string of logical fallacies where you, like others like you, use binary dichotomies without data to try to make a claim.\n\nBut it's also irrelevant because I \\*never\\* said anyone had to get the vaccine. I generally agree that it's a personal choice, but I'm not going to manufacture a bullshit argument for that like \"there's no difference to communicability when you're vaccinated\" when you actually just shared data that shows that in fact, there is.\n\nBut it's irrelevant because you're not responding to anything I said, you're just emotionally jousting with a strawman because you're emotionally compromised on this topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The COVID vaccine was adopted faster than any other vaccine in human history and we had more deaths in the months after everyone got vaccinated. \n\nBecause viruses expand exponentially as they mutate, and that was during the delta wave which was more deadly. \n\nYou're suggesting that the vaccinations didn't stop the deaths or maybe expanded on them and the data says that's not the case. There's a very clear reason why deaths (primarily in the unvaccinated per-capita) increased, and vaccination can't stop that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That probably has more to do with the way COVID deaths are counted, but the point is that transmission wasn't hindered at all. \n\n\"bigger number mean thing not work\" it's  not that fucking simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So it became a personal choice - if you want to take the vaccine to prevent serious illness, that's on you.

All of the branches around now are Omicron, and with most people having either 3 vaccine shots+ or having contracted it 3 times, T and b cell response is more robust.\n\nThat virus killed over 1% of its infected hosts. We're looking back at Omicron with rose colored glasses pretending that it was original novel COVID. It isn't.\n\nThe original thread starter says it has a 1% mortality rating, as if that's small for a virus (it isn't), especially one that spreads like COVID did originally, and \"would have infected everyone.\"\n\nOK, let's assume they're right. That's 80 million people dead, and probably close to 400 million disabled because the original form of the virus inserted into the ACE2 and replicated in such a way that organ damage was very common very early on.\n\nSo the real story isn't that we got everything wrong. The real story is that the science was right and it effectively protected people and our system and advantaged the less deadly variant of the virus. But we'll forget that because we're looking from having survived the event with a current reality that is far, far less deadly or debilitating than a novel virus.\n\nPeople are citing the economic and market damage here, but they have no fucking clue what kind of economic damage 80 million excess deaths and at least 5x as many taken out of the work pool in a year or two would have been. We'd be in a real depression right now, not a Fed invoked maybe-sort-of-recession.\n\nAnd the entire argument relies on the idea that everyone would have lived like normal during a pandemic... and that absolutely was not going to happen.

And how come they weren't wiped off the map?\n\n\"Locking down\" is what China did: Literally locking people in their apartments.\n\nIt's not an argument between \"full quarantine\" (locking down) and \"no controls whatsoever\"... there's a space in the middle, which is what most countries did. People need to quit using absurd binary dichotomies here, they don't make people sound smart, it makes you sound irrational. It may earn points with your \"team\" but many of us aren't taking team sides. My \"team\" is science and reality and humanity, and there's no room for absurd binary dichotomies here like this or like \"Why wasn't Sweden wiped out?\"\n\nHere in the United States, there were only a handful of government mandates that had serious impacts on people, and most weren't even serious. The most contentious of these were mask mandates, public space shutdowns that the government had control over (public parks, music/sports venues/etc), and vaccine mandates (which most people weren't affected by in the end). There were occasional, short-lived curfews in some places that were almost entirely unenforced. All of these are powers the government has and are regularly enforced in some form or another in other contexts.\n\n90% of what people attribute to the government - companies shutting down, etc - were the companies/people voluntarily taking an action.\n\nWhich happened pretty much everywhere, including in Sweden. In fact, if you look at Sweden's policies when COVID-19 emerged, they look a LOT like the United States.\n\nIn fact, Sweden didn't start taking their travel, public congregation, and other restrictions off until February 2022, and didn't conclude that process until last month, a full year later. (I'm looking at their public health site right now.)\n\nSo what was Sweden criticized for?\n\nWell, I'm glad you asked. Sweden is criticized because their public health office  figurehead made a claim that Swedes didn't need to adhere to controls because the virus would go away once everyone caught it and became immune.\n\nHe was entirely wrong, obviously.\n\nThis morphed in our media into the claim that \"Sweden wasn't doing any COVID controls\" which was an absolute lie. Aside from the government controls, many companies went to remote work there just like here. Just like here, people limited public congregation. Just like here, mandatory quarantine for infected people existed. Just like here, public spaces were regulated and swedes engaged in social distancing.\n\nAnd even if they didn't, viral propagation is exponential and people travel between countries and localities, meaning all places that had fewer controls benefitted from the effect of those who did more to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nIf controls don't work, then how did places like China put off their spike until later? I don't agree with the extent to which China took things, that is literally locking down and I would have opposed it here, but it kind of destroys the idea that controls didn't work. (Not that I fully trust China's data, but the spike in cases we just experienced there corroborates it on the larger scale.)\n\n>There is no correlation between reaction to the virus and the resulting death rate.\n\nThis is false. This is a bullshit statement that got propagated because of bullshit studies like the Johns Hopkins School of Economics study which have flawed methodologies.\n\nPeople are comparing states and larger regions to each other without accounting for degree of adherence and consideration for other conditions like income and cultural factors that influence behavior.\n\nFor instance, a lot of these studies look at places like San Diego county as monoliths, and compare them to places like Riverside county. San Diego county had stricter COVID controls than Riverside did, and San Diego is also culturally far less conservative than Riverside. People cite that SD had 5,810 COVID death and Riverside had 6,807.\n\nSimilar, right?\n\nWell, aside from the fact that Riverside's hard numbers are higher to a statistically significant extent, meaning they aren't the same, you also have to adjust for population.\n\nRiverside has 2.5m and San Diego county has 3.3 million people, meaning mortality in each is:\n\nRiverside: 0.3% mortality across the whole population.\n\nSan Diego: 0.17% mortality.\n\nThat's a pretty significant per capita difference. It's almost double. And that's just death rate.\n\nRiverside's vaccine uptake for the primary series is 60%, whereas San Diego's is 80%... that's how big the cultural adherence difference was for controls between the two locations... it's a massive gap that resulted in a massive difference.\n\nWhat flawed studies like the Johns Hopkins study do is jumble all the counties together and shape the data in such a way that these differences no longer show up. That study in particular has a massive methodological flaw in that it only counts a policy as effective if it had an immediate impact on infections and outcomes, and we know these policies lag.\n\nWhen you get down to zip code in San Diego, the same patterns as the Riverside/SD county dichotomy show up, where zip codes that are more affluent, more politically left, and more educated have a MUCH lower rate of infection compared to other less affluent, more politically right, and less educated areas like East County and the city region, and that tracks directly to adherence and local enforcement factors.\n\nControls and behavior ABSOLUTELY correlate to outcomes for COVID-19. Full stop.\n\nCut the fucking crap. It's been 3 years. You have no fucking excuse for being incapable of understanding any of this.\n\nJust think about how fucking silly the argument is that behavior doesn't influence viral spread patterns... it's fucking absurd on its face. Why argue something that is so blatantly fucking absurd aside from bias and lack of cognitive ability? \n\nYou might as well argue that gravity doesn't exist because we can't show that people haven't walked off of buildings and floated into space... saying behavior doesn't influence chance of viral infection and outcome is just equally absurd.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "If an apocalypse virus ever appears, the world is doomed.  \"This is fake just like Corolla\"", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "That's exactly what's going to happen.

The run was caused by Thiel and his portcos, and down the line by everyone who got wind on their slack groups pulling cash, but the people left were all still rich people or the investments of rich people.\n\nThe FDIC recoups their money by selling the assets of the bank and making depositors as whole as they can over time. It is a process that happens almost every year, since banks fail almost every year. Depositors over 250k are rarely made entirely whole, bur over the period of a year or two, are made mostly whole. Member banks pay the expense for FDIC, and the failed bank assets pay as much as possible towards deposits over 250k. \n\nCovid years were exceptions to this, since no banks failed during that time period. This is likely a function of crazy fed liquidity injections since the hiccup at the beginning of 2020 that spurred the fed into a two year mega stimulus.\n\nSo to summarize, the FDIC was never in trouble, the depositors were.

And I'd rather pay 20$ for a banana but 100 000$ for a house than 0,43$ for a banana and a million for a house. Also, company valuations are insane, most startups are completely useless but tons of money go to them. Banks are full and full of money. So, inflation there is, it was just hiding in plain sight.

It is generally caused by a mismatch between supply and demand. Inflation can be triggered by both the demand side and the supply side or both together. Can this be caused by an increase in the money supply? Sure. Can it also be caused by a supply shortage? Yes. \n\nThe general idea with increased money supply is that as the money gets into the economy, more money chases the same amount of goods, bidding prices up. \n\nExcept that if you look at the velocity of money (how quickly money is exchanged in the economy), it's at the lowest level it's ever been. \n\nA lot of this cash is just sitting on bank balance sheets. They have it as the fed and other CBs have been buying up assets to try and spur economic growth (until last year) but there are still lending standards that must be met in order for people to get their hands on it. It isn't just being dumped into the economy - which is why QE never created inflation prior to the pandemic. \n\nWhat's causing inflation is literally just the fact that the entire global economy was shut down and re-started. It caused a LOT of problems supply wise AND demand side. Companies operated just in time supply chains. People locked at home and unable to spend money on travel or on the bar suddenly started buying TVs and shit which ruined the fragile supply chain. Things were starting to unwind and get better until Putin started the war. \n\nIs some government spending keeping inflation a bit more sticky than it should? Yeah probably.

Brokers are refusing to honor Puts on halted bank stocks…YOU WILL LOSE 100%", "selftext": "\n\nIf you’ve missed this drama among the noise here’s what’s going on…\n\nMany traders (myself included) have been expecting the collapse of Silvergate and Signature banks since last year after the crypto bubble popped, buying puts and opening shorts. \n\nThe banks going under should result in a massive windfall for Put option holders, who should be able to collect maximum profit on the contracts. \n\nBut earlier this week it came to light that many major brokers were not allowing holders of put options on SBNY expiring today 3/17 to exercise them. The reason given was that because the stock was halted, a short position would have to be opened against the trade…and the brokers didn’t want to let that happen. \n\nTheoretically the stock should start trading again somewhere close to $0 via OTC so the shorts would be able to cover, but it’s unclear when that will happen.\n\nThe OCC from their end put no restrictions on the options contracts, and sent a memo to brokers instructing they can allow clients to exercise, but many of them still refused. \n\nA huge retail-lead campaign in the media and social media put a ton of pressure on the brokers and Options Clearing. Some of them (like Robinhood) finally caved and allowed the exercises. Many still did not allow it.\n\nOf the brokers who eventually allowed exercising , multiple required extremely high margin requirements (like 2-3x the last trade price of $70 per share per contract).
