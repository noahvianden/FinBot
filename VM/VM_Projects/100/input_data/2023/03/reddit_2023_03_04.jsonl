Sounds like you have an understanding of China's economy based on what CNN, FOX, and other main stream headlines say, without actually understanding how China works.\n\nWith the situation of China's real-estate, it's a problem, but the Chinese government has known that the real-estate bubble has to be taken care of. The Chinese government has known this for decades and has been wanting to shift investors sentiment in China from real-estate to companies,bonds, and invesments that lead towards the countries growth. China is deleveraging and implemented The Three Red Lines. With real-estate, the problems impact other economies as a reactionary affect. This comes in the form of U.S. treasuries held by Chinese investors by up to around 15%?\n\nHome ownership in China is over 90%. Property investments and real-estate isn't the same as in the U.S. I would argue how China handled their real-estate crisis has been the exact opposite of the 2008 crash. \n\nForeign investors, overseas speculators, Chinese investors, got screwed. The average home owner in China benefited. This isn't the same as in the 2008 crash, ordinary Americans got screwed over while Wallstreet was bailed out.\n\nAs for chips, it's important to realize that the restrictions always have work arounds. If you look at Russia, the average Russian is not noticing the differences too much because Russia managed to diversify its trades. China manages to control the entire supply chain, while countries like the U.S. do not. China also has more talent/skill in aggregate, this will probably be reflected in chip manufacturing. But the U.S. also loses out in trade as well. SSMEE ASA800 has been worked on by China for over a decade. China isn't starting from the ground when it comes to developing chips. It wouldn't be ideal though. I think this will backfire on the U.S and will push China to develop key infrastructures even faster. \n\nYou're getting all your views and info from talking heads from U.S. propaganda and competition.

Yeah I agree here. But I still think the U.S. is much worse than China in aggregate and will be moving forward. Could I be wrong? Yes, but I don't think I am.\n\nAlso, as for freedoms in America, to vote, etc. My experiences being in Japan, China, U.S. and U.S. territories makes me honestly believe that the U.S. sense of freedom are declining drastically. I also don't think China, Japan, and the U.S. are all much different, even with freedom. I also think China will become more freer over time while the U.S. declines in correlation to economic/societal decline over time.\n\nI don't think China's political system is good or bad, but I think it's better in terms for humanity versus the U.S. as of now, this could change over time. The U.S. system isn't that free when compared to China. We had great candidates like Andrew Yang go through media blackout, oligarchs, and came to the same choices between two old white men perpetuating a far right imperialist country. I also think despite all this, it's good if the U.S. comes down and other countries rise. More equality means more checks and balances, which could lead towards more global democracy, rather than one country rule all. I think while China may be overt in their ruling socially, the U.S. is more covert in their ruling, but both hardly free, but both much more free than other countries. \n\nI think China and other countries surpassing or at least being truer equals to the U.S. is good, it means more equality for all and more checks and balances. Let's pretend the U.S. did bomb Nord Stream 2, that's not okay regardless on your stance on this matter. Only China can really hold the U.S. accountable, which is good imo. Chinese in China along with the government can call out flaws and acts of imperialism the U.S. does on to others, while the U.S. can do the same towards China, this is also good. So I want China to rise because the only people truly being screwed over is the poor and middle class, and most people are generally good. \n\nAs for voting. In China you can vote. In the U.S. you can vote. But I'd argue the voting systems in both countries are set up in ways where voters may not feel or believe that their vote counts, voters are also misinformed, and that regardless of who they vote, the system remains keeping the status quo. The outcome generally would have been the same if it were Biden or Trump, 2 old white men of the same coin perpetuating a imperialist system that screws over the world. And the U.S. and China both have smaller provinces/state governments where it's easier to see more immediate changes, corruption, and strict quotas. The U.S  FED is definitely not promoting global or internal freedom.\n\nSo they're very similar countries. Because of this, I choose to invest in China. I've had good roi, have family in China, and I love and want China to grow. I want the country to succeed and be a world leader. \n\nAlso, as for freedoms in the United States. You're probably a white man or white passing. I'm not, so my perspective is different. As an Asian Hawaiin who grew up in poverty, saw what systemic poverty traps have done, been subjected to inequal systems and treatment in America. I don't share your same views. My ancestors in Hawaii were sent to internment camps in WW2 despite being American, we lost our businesses, assets, homes, savings, and got a shetty $20,000 reparation, family died in the Japanese internment camps. So where was there freedom? And all we lost? I feel that, and so do my parents. My grandparents told me stories and share their experiences. And being part Hawaiian, we still fight civil courts for our land back, so where was our freedom again? And this racist and prejudiced country with rising sinophobia, Asian, person of color hate, where is all this freedom and equality you talk about? The system itself perpetuates a dominate white hierarchy while persons of colors are treated as less than, and when we bring this up for decades, we get called terrible things or that we're delusional. Things have gotten better, but all this freedom isn't something a black man, asian man, dark man, hawaiian man, etc, share with a white man, we aren't treated as equals economically, socially, politically, media, etc. I do enjoy Thomas Sowell, but he's the exception, and doesn't reflect the reality of things. So again, what freedoms? Now we have laws where Chinese can't buy land in Texas? Okay but an Italian, African, Japanese, can? It's stuff like this that adds up.\n\nAgain, freedoms? What about COVID-19 essential employees and non essential employees? Poor people are generally essential employees who were forced to work during COVID-19, pay cuts, exposed to COVID-19, no hazard pay, no nothing. But non-essential workers were collecting standard unemployment benefits + CARES ACT BONUS weekly enhances, $10,200 tax credit, and had leisure time to focus on education and skill building. Essential employees in the U.S were not allowed to opt in for the enhanced unemployment benefits and stay at home, so where was our freedoms then? If the pandemic was so deadly to the point we shut down a global economy, why didn't essential employees have the freedoms to opt in for unemployment benefits and stay safe from COVID-19? Nah, the United states government decided whose live matters and forced slavery.

Anecdotally, all three had a huge positive impact for Tesla who uniquely benefitted from all three variables. 1 and 2 are self-explanatory, but I personally feel that 3 is under-appreciated.

A place were investors should be a bit more savvy. \n\n1) Being first does not mean you will be the only one or the best in what you do. At this point yes Microsoft came first but we have no clue what Google or even Apple or Meta is planning. MSFT seems to be winning for now until the next player launches something in the search space which could be even bigger or better than what MSFT did. Remember the most notable examples in this are Facebook and Google who both dethroned their competitors almost overnight and they were not even the big companies they are now. \n\n\n2) It‚Äôs not about the idea but the execution. And I cannot stress that enough. Say Google comes back with a much better AI, returns much better results, has found a smart way to monetize it and is years ahead of OpenAI in terms of engineering. Unless they find a nice way to present it and market it to customers they are doomed to fail. Launching a product is not just about the engineering of the product. There is so much more to it. From marketing to business model to public perception to privacy to customer support and to the product itself of course. Remember Google waves ? An internal tool Google used, much like slack-before slack to communicate? They launched it to public but figured their UX and product execution sucked so they killed it. Later on slack came along and showed them that they had the right idea but the execution was poor.  Do I also need to remind you Betamax vs VHS? One was an engineer marvel the other just had better partnerships and was ticking more boxes for the users. \n\n3) Google is never going all-in in a product. So far Google is known for killing projects if they see they cannot monetize in the short term. Google‚Äôs product cemetery is quite huge . They still work like a VC betting on 100 products to get 1 right so their successful product/cemetery ratio is not that promising. \n\n\nAll in all, we don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs going to end but it‚Äôs really weird looking comments like Google has already something or MSFT was there first. No Google does not have anything unless they decide to launch a proper product to the market and find a better product-market fit than the competition.

{"title": "$ABML has $1.2 Trillion lithium ü§ØTonopah Flats property in Nevada one of largest lithium deposits in US, company says", "selftext": "Hello there, \n\nI‚Äôm gonna try keep this short and sweet for all you highly regarded folk. There‚Äôs a lithium mining/battery recycling stock going by the ticker $ABML, which just recently hit the $500 million market cap ($547 million to be precise) meaning the stock can now be spoken about on WSB. \n\nI may be a little special and I‚Äôm quite baked rn but I‚Äôm going to try lay out for why I think this stock is a potential 10X stock and why you don‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity. \n\nFirstly, the stock is currently up 78% over the last 3 months, largely as a result of its mining flats in Tonopah being assessed by a third party to contain upwards of 15 million tonnes of Lithium. That‚Äôs the largest supply of Lithium in the entirety of the USA! A country, which until now has been struggling to source and have any real security of its own affordable battery metals. I believe the Biden administration has been looking into ways to sure up America‚Äôs battery metal supply chains, as importing it is costly and relying on other countries isn‚Äôt for Uncle Sam. $ABML may have just stumbled upon the answer and if they have the stock is about to go parabolic.\n\nYou know that shit Daddy Musk and every other car company puts in his car batteries? The shit that currently costs more than gold at $70k per tonne‚Ä¶ This company has basically found itself with lithium deposits that are the same weight as 128k fat Jonah Hills. That‚Äôs pretty fucking fat.\nSo back of the napkin math 15 million tonnes X $70k = $1.25 trillion. That‚Äôs right $1,250,000,000! \n\nAnd the best part? $ABML controls 100% of the mining lode claims in the Tonopah flats and the subsurface minerals without any royalties. \nThe company also plans to expand the area to the north and south of the property and explore to greater depths. \n90% of the 15 million tonnes is easily recoverable.\nAnd if that‚Äôs not perfect enough, their factory is only 25 miles away from the Tesla gigafactory! \n\nSecondly, this is a company I‚Äôve been following for years, and it‚Äôs fair to say management hasn‚Äôt always been the best. The company is currently down 75% from it‚Äôs ATH of $4 per share, attributable to the slow progress they have made up till now. However, this company is now run by their fairly newly appointed CEO Ryan Melsert, an ex-Tesla employee who realised the importance (and financial benefits) of securing America‚Äôs battery metals supply chain. The guy is an absolute genius, the company has won countless awards and government grants for its unique, patented and environmentally-friendly way of recycling battery metals. \n\nThe whole point of switching to electric cars is to reduce carbon emissions and damage to the environment. This company allows for what may be the most environmentally-friendly and scalable battery recycling process in the world. $ABML have a factory 25 miles from Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory and have signed agreements to recycle Ford, Chevrolet and GM‚Äôs battery feedstock. \n\nThe company is currently pre-revenue, however I do believe that will change this year with the opening of their pilot plant. Despite the negative economic outlook we are in at the moment I can really see this stock outperforming the broader market. They‚Äôre flush with cash despite burning through it due to building their new factory. The amount of Lithium within the Tonopah flats alone is worth more than Amazon. \n\nWho‚Äôs to say Musk doesn‚Äôt buy the company outright? I really don‚Äôt see that as an impossibility given the company‚Äôs purpose, it‚Äôs location and the CEO‚Äôs ties to Tesla. If that happens I‚Äôd probably need to repaint my ceiling cuz my erection would be doing all sorts of damage to it.

Drillholes were spaced approximately 200 feet to 3,500 feet apart. **All holes were  drilled vertically and ranged from 400 to 885 feet in depth. Lithium mineralization was encountered in all  21 drillholes submitted for analysis.** \n\nAnd\n\n>The Tonopah Flats deposit is comprised of lithium-rich sedimentary claystone with negligible work index and abrasion, and readily disaggregates when suspended in water. Standard assaying of head grades was performed using a representative array of samples selected from 21 drillholes. For metallurgical leaching trials, bulk samples from the Tonopah Flats lithium project were prepared for lithium leach trials using roughly 700 pounds of cuttings from the 2021-2022 drillhole program. These metallurgical leaching trial samples were collected from drillhole TF-2208 where **the average head-grade for lithium was found to be about 790 ppm**.  \n>  \n>The sample was homogenized by cone-and-quarter methods and pulverized to 100 mesh to obtain a statistically repetitive sample. Mineral processing was carried out at the University of Nevada, Reno‚Äôs Ore Dressing Laboratory. The claystone is responsive to dilute acid leaching under agitation as well as several methods of selective lithium leaching. **Leaching trials were carried out in-house by ABTC using statistically representative homogenized bulk samples, and these trials demonstrated that over 90% of lithium can be leached from the claystone within a few hours.** Following leaching, treatment of the pregnant leaching solution by pH adjustment/neutralization, filtration, solution purification, concentration, conversion, and final solution polishing/crystallization, or battery grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate can be realized.

However, it has a relatively low natural abundance of 7.56 percent in natural lithium, for the bulk of lithium is lithium 7. For use in nuclear energy, weapons or tritium production, the lithium 6 fraction must be typically increased to 40-95 percent of the lithium via a chemical enrichment process. If the lithium 6 is for tritium production in a reactor, the fraction of the lithium 6 in the targets placed in the reactor is limited to about 40 percent to prevent failure of the targets. For use in nuclear weapons, a 95 percent fraction of lithium 6 is desirable\"\n\nI'm not sure what fraction of Lithium-6 they would target for nuclear fusion reactions.\n\n\"The mercury exchange process involves an amalgam of lithium and mercury which is made via electrolysis. Subsequently, the mercury lithium amalgam is mixed with an aqueous lithium hydroxide (LiOH) solution. Lithium 6 has a slightly higher affinity to mercury than lithium 7, so lithium 7 diffuses out of the amalgam more quickly than lithium 6, leaving the amalgam with increased, or enriched, concentration of lithium 6. The lithium 6 can be separated from the amalgam. The tailings fraction of Lithium 7 is electrolyzed from the aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide. Afterwards, the lithium hydroxide can be reused\"\n\nSo it's quite the process!

{"title": "VIX Gang, Stand Back and Stand...BUY!", "selftext": "TLDR; YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBears, if you would like a nice little rub and tug, look no further. This post will explain why buying shares of leveraged volatility products cannot and will not go tits up.\n\nI am down 37 bands since I last posted[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vj63p9/my_plan_for_intergenerational_wealth_uvxy_svxy/) 8 months ago. I haven't given up my thesis or my dollar cost averaging and I won‚Äôt until capitulation occurs, be it next year or next week. As I see it, the longer this equities bubble persists, the more time I have to build up my already quite large position. In this post I would like to discuss my perspective on: **Why the VIX is asleep, Hypothetical price targets for UVXY, and How my strategy has changed.**\n\nDisclaimer: The 2x volatility index that I trade is below the $500mm market cap (or AUM in this case) allowed by WSB, so I will be focusing on UVXY for this post. Check my positions at the end of this post to see exactly what I am doing.\n\nAnother Disclaimer: I‚Äôm quite regarded. While my DD should be solid from a factual standpoint, only imitate my positions if you don‚Äôt mind the possibility of having a few extra inches added to the circumference of your anus.\n\nWithout Further ado.\n\n**Why the VIX is Asleep**\n\nAs many of you may know, the VIX index is calculated using a very complex equation, but essentially is tracking the spread of options premiums on the SPX. In uncertain times or market downturns, as traders scramble for downside protection, these spreads can get sporadic and the VIX will spike.\n\nSo what gives? Why hasn‚Äôt there been a meaningful increase in the VIX index since the market has fallen \\~20% last year? I mean, the VIX spiked over 150% with the Fed rate hikes in 2018 while the market dropped \\~18% from September to December. Well the answer has to do with a worrying trend that has started getting out of hand in the past three quarters: institutional investors and hedge funds trading 0DTE options on the SPX. These types of trades create ample liquidity in the options market, rocketing the indices to new highs (remember when QQQ closed +7.35% on 11-10-22 ?) and suppressing the VIX index. This can lead to a vicious cycle with lower lows in the VIX begetting higher highs in the SPX, encouraging further 0DTE  gambling. But every cycle must come to an end‚Ä¶\n\n[0DTE SPX volume at an all time high, while the VIX and VVIX make sharpest declines since Volmageddon](https://preview.redd.it/eassycii7sla1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3f57df1c42927d19e44168e9a502016170e9a9)\n\nThese types of trades generate large profits for the institutions who are able to sell far OTM options without posting collateral. However, as we all know, trading 0DTE comes with its risks. When the narrative regarding the economy changes (consumer debt is at all time highs, while household savings is nearing all time lows btw), or a large player in the 0DTE market leaves for whatever reason (drying up liquidity) hell will break loose. When the price stability in the options market goes haywire, VIX will spike. On top of this, scrambling for 0TE puts to hedge will drill the SPX as MMs need to sell SPX short to gamma hedge.\n\nTo conclude this section, trading 0DTE works very well‚Ä¶ until it doesn‚Äôt. Now onto the fun part: price targets.\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nFirst things first, this volatility spike will not be like Dec 2018. How can I be so sure? Well, because if it was, we would have seen it happen already. In early October 2018, the market reacted swiftly to Fed policy, with the VIX following closely behind.\n\n[VIX reacts to market declines immediately in 2018](https://preview.redd.it/o0xiim3u7sla1.png?width=3785&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f7fb142b058b3da191ea3ee1c3754d12acb33cd)\n\nCompare this to what we see now. A sell off, comparable in percent decline, without the fireworks on the VIX:\n\n[VIX stays calm despite 20&#37; drawdown](https://preview.redd.it/qlli2yfy7sla1.png?width=3767&format=png&auto=webp&s=5873c41a1c61979f1c7f7c975cf88e9aa2d18e4a)\n\nOkay, so VIX is dead, so what? Well I‚Äôd like to convince you that this is a premonition of something far more violent than the VIX spike in late 2018. I believe that this first 20% leg down was orderly selling by institutions, all of which are preparing for a monstrous capitulation in the coming year. I‚Äôd like to remind you that despite the fact that we are off of the all time highs of Jan 2022, we are still in a massive equities bubble that is only exacerbated by earnings contraction and the weakening consumer. Given that we are at the end of a 12 year secular bull run, I think it‚Äôs appropriate that we look at the behavior of the VIX in prior recessions.\n\n**2001**\n\nMarch 2000 to June 2001-- SPY: -22.7%, VIX: +40%\n\nJune 2001 to September 2002-- SPY: -38.1%, VIX: +113%\n\n[VIX trades sideways until second leg sell-off](https://preview.redd.it/ybyjqrm28sla1.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&s=217e09c8e4f44c5ede93348e8a5d10690f42796e)\n\n**2008**\n\nOctober 2007 to August 2008-- SPY: -16.7%, VIX: +3.3%\n\nAugust 2008 to October 2008-- SPY: -24.8%, VIX: +419%\n\n[VIX snoozes until MASSIVE spike during OCT '08 capitulation](https://preview.redd.it/nk2rnqq68sla1.png?width=3790&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2e14783f9bb9ec6fd2eaa487a35c6e68bd4ffa6)\n\nIt is apparent that when a big recession is brewing, the VIX will remain relatively tame during the first leg down, before exploding during the final capitulation. So what are my price targets for the coming capitulation?\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nI am going to use the historical prices of UVXY during the COVID crash to extrapolate what we may be able to expect from a leveraged volatility ETF during a full blown panic. I am aware that the COVID crash was a rather unique scenario, with the first pandemic in a century adding extra fear and volatility to the sell off on the way down. I am not here to argue about the exact price that VIX will reach, but given the recent 0DTE gambling, declining housing market, impending wars, persistent inflation, etc. I think it is reasonably realistic to use COVID crash as a model example (especially considering how much larger the bubble has gotten since 2020).\n\nUVXY hit an intraday low of 105.5 on February 19, 2020. After a wild month of trading, UVXY topped out at 1350 on March 18, 2020. This astounding 1180% price increase is a testament to how extreme leveraged volatility ETFs can behave in uncertain times. But wait, UVXY is only a 1.5x leveraged VIX futures product. What if we wanted more leverage? Hypothetically, the 2x leveraged ETF that I own (that I shall not name) would return a staggering 1606%. This is like going from 16.18 (it‚Äôs closing price on Friday 3/3) to 276.06. Remember, this is just based on the COVID crash. Whether or not this next spike will come up short or surpass this return, no one can know. What I do know, is that your returns will likely be so significant that you cannot lose money buying shares of these products.\n\n**WHY YOU CANNOT LOSE MONEY BUYING UVXY**\n\n[A painful chart to look at](https://preview.redd.it/8ixiplob8sla1.png?width=2294&format=png&auto=webp&s=7067aa1e76977b6a89021327e48c803a9b7ecb2d)\n\nUVXY decays, we know. We also know that the return needed to break even on a losing trade becomes more and more daunting as your percent loss increases. For the sake of this DD or (perhaps more accurately) hardcore bear porn, please indulge with me. Imagine that on Monday a crash similar to COVID crash begins, it won‚Äôt, but just imagine. What does this mean? It means that over the next month, UVXY will go from 4.57 to 58.48, an 1180% return. Wow! If you bought on Friday at close, that's a great return! But let‚Äôs be real, that would never happen. We all know that timing the market is extraordinarily difficult. This is the number one reason I quit options. Suppose you still wanted to capture some of the return from that incredible spike in UVXY. Well, what if you dollar cost averaged? I can already hear the replies, ‚ÄúDCA in UVXY?!?!?! What a regard‚Äù and on and on. Well I think this strategy may have more merit than you give it credit for. Why? Two reasons: dollar cost averaging allows you to build up a massive position in UVXY (or another volatility product) while not having to time the crash. Sounds like a win-win.\n\nNow, consider the chart I posted above. Consider that in order to break even on this hypothetical UVXY spike you would have had to buy UVXY and then sustain a 92% loss.\n\n12.80x = 1\n\nx= 0.078\n\n1-x = 0.92 = 92%\n\nDo you understand what this means?? It means that to lose money on this trade you would have to own shares of UVXY at an average share price of 58.49 or greater. A price not seen since May 2021! Jeez even I‚Äôm not \\*that\\* early on the trade. What‚Äôs more, is that you would have had to buy at that price and not have accumulated any more shares. If you so much as bought any shares after that date, you would be in the green due to a lower cost basis.\n\nNow yes, this math works for the COVID crash scenario. Okay, well lets say UVXY only spikes a measly 800%. To break even you would need to buy at an 89% loss. That‚Äôs like buying UVXY at 41.13‚Ä¶ again, in May 2021.\n\nReference the chart above for other scenarios, but I think you get the picture. Keep this in mind as you consider the percent drawdown in my positions (aka unrealized loss porn) below. Know that my cost basis decreases weekly.\n\n**TO CONCLUDE**\n\nThe 4 phase plan is the same as it‚Äôs been with a minor change. I will:\n\n1. DCA into a volatility product until capitulation\n2. Put earnings into SVXY or similar index and ride the volatility back down\n3. **Put money into QQQ** (instead of SPY) with as much margin as I can get\n4. Wait for the real estate market to bottom and buy a house\n\nAnd the most damning evidence that this trade will work:\n\n[can't go tits up](https://preview.redd.it/llm51tik8sla1.png?width=1557&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c5640cc3ce2dd3b9a660c4a58ccf728ae73b0dc)\n\nMy LOSS PORN (so far):\n\n[at least they'll be long term capital gains lol](https://preview.redd.it/0r2ewu9n8sla1.png?width=2920&format=png&auto=webp&s=59fac0d9fbcdb2553f660d841f79121e4acae30e)\n\n\\*probably, we'll see", "id": "11icg21", "created_utc": 1677962117.0, "score": 131, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "Thnx for letting me know that my VIX calls r fucked.
