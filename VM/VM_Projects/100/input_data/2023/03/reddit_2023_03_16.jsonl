If in the aggregate, the economy wants to consume less than it is able to produce, you will get unemployment (as output will decrease until supply is in balance with demand). \n\nSo there is a tradeoff between inflation and employment. Higher unemployment may not be *necessary* to reduce excess demand. But policies which can reduce this gap tend to be policies which could *potentially* also reduce employment. For example:\n\n1. Fiscal policy in the US currently has a large inflationary bias. The CBO projects that over the next decade, the US government will increase its debt held by the public by ~ $7.5T more than GDP is projected to increase. Most of this spending fuels consumption, rather than investment (which could increase output), so it will potentially contribute to inflation. Excess consumption demand could be reduce if fiscal policymakers were to bring their budget more into balance. \n\n2. Monetary policy, by increasing short term rates relative to longer term rates, can encourage more savings (reducing consumption) and also more investment (which can help to increase output). \n\nBut the latter causes what is known as an \"inverted yield curve\", short term rates higher than long term, and is often considered an indicator of recession. And government cutting spending or raising taxes can slow economic growth, and also potentially increase unemployment. \n\nGenerally, these things will only cause higher unemployment if they go farther than was actually needed (and thus cause a recessionary gap). But it can be difficult to predict just how much is needed. In addition, there is generally believed to be some tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, known as the Phillips curve relationship, where a higher unemployment rate will be associated with lower inflation.

That's what SVB changed, and it's not because SVB wasn't a special problem child (it definitely was), it's that SVB gave us a view into the balance sheet impact for banks that aren't at the very top of the capitalization pile.\n\nI don't expect a 2008-like bank collapse chain, but banks are 100% looking at balance sheets right now and assessing maturity risk on their bond portfolio, and anyone overweight long term and low rate has suffered accumulated valuation underruns, which aren't usually a problem unless you have a collapse of other holdings or of capitalization for any reason.\n\nSo lending that's high risk during a recession? That's gonna pull back HARD.\n\nIf that results in the reduction of high credit limits in order to reduce debt risk from consumers, that will shift the bell curve on credit ratings further to the left, meaning lower credit worthiness overall. (The credit agencies and modelers will catch up to this eventually, but it'll take a little time... and won't matter in the near term because the real issue is banks reducing risk.)\n\nSo what do you do if you're a bank looking for profit and stability? Well, simple: you buy more bonds at higher rates to offset losses and increase the concentration of ladders. (Which the Fed just told you is safe.)\n\nThis offsets the punishment from using the new facility to lend bonds for capital, and it's the only way you get the massive drop in rates we saw this week: massive fucking buying trying to capture high yield. (Some of this might have been the Fed trying to take pressure off banks, but banks were definitely in on this because it's the equivalent of DCAing an account, and it's the only way to compete against other banks that got higher rates.)\n\nBut they're still paying more to lend against their bonds back to the Fed than they can get in yield, so at the end of the day, all of this spells tightening risk even while bank capitalization increases in availability. So while the economy won't collapse, it will almost certainly grind into a tighter and tighter condition until something else breaks.\n\nAlso any time you see a giant change in market/bond behavior, like bond yields dropped with equity valuations, it's usually a sign of a change in market state. People think this might be bull steepening, but the unwinding happens when the damage is happening. While the market will reverse course once the reality is set in and begin rising before the recession is over, the market has to contend with the reality of tightening conditions first.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I like this", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "So they‚Äôre paying interest on these gov liquidity loans? \nOtherwise I don‚Äôt understand how this isn‚Äôt just free money which loosens lending conditions?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">So they‚Äôre paying interest on these gov liquidity loans? Otherwise I don‚Äôt understand how this isn‚Äôt just free money which loosens lending conditions?\n\nThat's right. The rate on the loans is higher than bond yield, with the interest rate being about 5% when it was implemented. It's the OIS rate + 10 basis points, which is higher than long term yields (which are the securities the banks have issues with).\n\nFurther, the extra liquidity is only the delta against the valuation, which doesn't influence lending standards per-se because long term loan risk is against bond par value return (because these are \"hold to maturity instruments\").\n\nSo if you're a bank and you're holding a 10Y you bought with a yield of 1.5% in 2021, and you had to hit up the BTFP to shore your capitalization, you're basically paying 3.5% to hold cash in case there's a run.\n\nSo from the risk sheet perspective, what you're doing is trading that 3.5% for the right to have capital instead of a \"safe\" investment in a bond, and the only reason you're doing that is because you're exposed to capital risk, because that bond is already offsetting existing lending risk on the sheet against its par value.\n\nSo the effect on the bank risk sheet is that they actually end up with LESS cash to support risk lending.\n\nSo anyone using this should have a tighter risk sheet coming out of it, even if it lessens systemic risk... and the banks using this basically have capitalization problems.\n\nNow, is it possible to parlay margins on MBS securities with higher rates on this? Maybe... but the impact is marginal, and it's limited to 1Y. Can banks swerve this into higher risk lending? Maybe... but at the risk of threatening the balance sheet heading into a possible credit tightening recession.\n\nSo if you're one of the unlucky banks that levers up while everyone else levers down and tightens to maintain capital ratios, you get kicked in the nuts in 6 months (and the market gets kicked in the nuts when you end up being the next SVB).\n\nSo this is quite a bit different than the situation in 2020.

Macroecon has some very dogmatic views in its history on monetary policy that have not aged that well. They're all true except for the instances when they aren't.\n\nIn this case, the big questions are:\n\n1. Is YoY more important or MoM, or the index value? Everyone has a different take here, and they're all right in some regard, but the one most people focus on is YoY.\n2. How will the comp respond? For the next 4 months it's favorable to inflation trending down YoY. After that is anyone's guess. I still expect some whipsaw in the numbers, but the worst possible whipsaws haven't materialized.\n3. How will this impact lending? I personally think on the negative end compared to prior trend, but maybe people were expecting everything to totally break down and the Fed to let the banking system fail, and that was never realistic.\n4. How will forward-looking metrics influence current data on inflation? Right now, that trend is heavily disinflationary.\n\nSo I would call inflation a wildcard, with a downward slope. The psych models people use to talk about inflation being \"baked in\" are based on 100 year old psychological theories that have been largely invalidated. People don't just blindly build expectations and people aren't animals explicitly. So I wouldn't necessarily count on inflation dropping to 2% (4% is more realistic given various factors for the year, IMO, and I think the Fed would be OK with that), but I also don't see it rising back up to super highs. The factors in the economy just aren't there for that at the moment without something changing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we're really in the second stage of this, where the broader economy is the bigger factor, and the question there is really about price normalization against capital availability and the impact of these outcomes to businesses, and just SVB alone will likely impact the market by drying up some degree of risk-free corporate funding, particularly for unprofitable companies that don't produce things (ugh, I hate to sound like shill Cramer, but in this case it's true).\n\nSo high risk tech right now is rallying on short position covering and high volatility, but if we have a real contraction in credit they likely get hit the hardest and any consumer pullback hits them harder, too (this is also tied into SVB to some extent).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs to whether this produces a crash, I tend not to predict the future exactly, but rather fall back to positioning on market risk.\n\nIn the near term, I have AMD calls for 2 weeks because AMD is in a technical pattern that is playing out... but I'm selling to offset losses on SPXU calls (SPY puts, basically) for 1 week (bet on a Fed drop, though I think that may generate a small rally possibly based on technicals... it's uncertain right now on the chart IMO) and 3 and 6 months out.\n\nThose are really a gamble. Just a small one. Other than that, I'm buying into a heavily hedged index position and I bought bonds at what looks like the yield top based on technicals... so I'm riding that out and seeing where things land.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you'd asked me as recently as 2 weeks ago, I would have said that the makeup of the market suggests some degree of bottoming has happened, and that while risk is high it's possible that index deleveraging and rebalancing could set us up for a rally on no negative news...\n\n...but negative news happened, and there's no \"no landing\" scenario now where things just balance out for the year, since the crypto complex collapsing is limited, but SVB (even though it's an isolated event) is really signaling a larger problem because the Fed basically broke the damn bond market.\n\nFirst Republic is right now looking for a buyer and looking to do stock dilution for funding... so we're not done here. The regionals are hurting and that's not something we can ignore.\n\nIs it 2008? Probably not... but you don't ignore this. This is bad and there's no way to sell this as good.\n\nSo I would say the risk of a crash this year is probably the highest it's been since February 2020 or spring/summer 2008. Timing it and guessing the depth is the problem, so I'm buying in and hedging with SPXU and SQQQ against SPY and QQQ and running arbitrage on positions as they make sense as I see opportunities, but cash gang is not crazy here, either. I just think timing the bottom is really hard, so it depends on what you're doing with that money.\n\nHonestly? I hate to act like a boring finance guy here, but the best return this year will be in paying down debt if you have any high interest generating debt. Consider unpaid interest and better credit options to be armoring against accumulated debt losses. Money not paid on debt is the same as money earned.\n\nOther than that, if you have the urge to gamble, I think loose timeframes for a crash and controlled positioning and risk management are the key this year.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oh I‚Äôm a gambling degen crypto extremist.

It's still fundamentally a risk asset, basically, just with some aberrant behaviors.\n\nI think the big bull thesis right now is that the bank system is collapsing so people are rushing to it as safety, but the bank system is not actually going to collapse and the signal now is that barring some weird-ass black swan event the funding exists to keep it afloat.\n\nAnd if that black swan event does happen, somehow in some way that no one can really articulate right now using real bank balance sheets, it won't stick for long like the Great Depression did because this fake-ass money system has fake-ass methods of dealing with problems, and all you need to fake-ass your way through things is to be clever.\n\nI mean, that's like the principle flaw in the anti-fiat argument from my perspective. It all hinges on this idea that \"fiat is fake, and has to return to ground at some point.\"\n\nI mean, maybe... maybe not... but in either case it doesn't mean that there's some reckoning of reality in the future and it doesn't mean that the new reality doesn't have the same problems, or perpetuate the same flaws in some way.\n\nThis is all fake. There's no currency at all in nature, it's all just systems we've bolted on top of crap to control consumption and production and distribution... so would it be fake just to mint a few trillion dollar coins and give it to the Fed and then have all that crap sit in bank reserves, not being lent out?\n\nSure... but who cares if the systemic problem is solved and credit doesn't fall into the earth's core.\n\nThat's what makes the current trending so uncertain. This chart has some potentially bullish structures that we're trading into right now, even though the trend itself is decidedly down IMO. And with risk assets running right now, where's the short term trend?\n\nI got laughed at on here by bears last Friday for predicting a dead cat bounce this week, entirely on technicals and put saturation... and look what happened: strong support and resistance lines going back to last year, with support being the 2022 bull/bear resistance divider, they were strong. And we're trading in a triangle and my rule for triangles is that they may have biases, but aren't inherently directional, they're just decision points... so in the next few weeks or so, the market has to make a decision about which way to break, and a relief rally on good news is all the market would need to move all these assets up... but similarly any bad news can force a downward break and a further de-leveraging... so guessing a direction here is a really risky business, and someone will win and think they were a genius when it might as well be a guess in this circumstance.\n\nBut at the same time, we're not entirely blind. Recent price action definitely suggests that news is dominating technicals when it comes to intra-day patterns, and the macro risk here is very real. It's potentially very dire. So my uncertainty tilts bearish over the year even with a short rally just because banking risk like this isn't something you fuck with.\n\nSo I've got my bets. I've got my long risk-free position. I've got my long index position. I've got my hedge. I'm also long cash by like 30% of my accounts at this point, because that's making a nice, fat 4.2 - 4.5% depending on the account.
