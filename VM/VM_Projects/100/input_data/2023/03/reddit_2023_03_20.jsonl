If they are per contract then double them for 2 contracts for your positional Greeks.\n\nThe price of your contracts have multiple forces pushing and pulling them in different directions.  Welcome to options trading.  Because of the extrinsic value of your contracts it’s not just price of DB that matters.  But as you can see, right now price is your biggest risk since delta and gamma are the largest values.  With long puts, for example, you will do best not just if DB goes down but how soon and how quickly it goes down.  The sooner and faster, generally, the better.  It’s entirely possible for you to be correct on your forecast but still lose or make less than you first thought if it goes down slowly because the extrinsic value you paid to buy it decays faster than the intrinsic value rises based on the movement.  Again, welcome to options. The time element matters a lot unlike stocks where you can hold your shares for as long as they exist.\n\nNews like earnings can also affect your prices. Running up to a known event, volatility can rise due to the uncertainty of the news and then fall quickly after the news is out.  This can hurt long positions even if you got the direction right if you paid up before the event.\n\nHope this helps.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, I feel like I have a higher degree of understanding it now that I can see it played out with a particular position I am carrying.

Understanding the other greeks can be helpful when asking “Why did something happen?”, but there is really not much they tell you when deciding to make the trade.\n\nDelta will help you determine the probability, or odds, of the trade being successful.\n\nRisk is another critical aspect so know how much each trade is risking before opening it.\n\nThe most important thing when selling puts is to know the stock and for it to be one you don’t mind owning if needed.  If you don’t want to own the shares then consider selling credit spreads instead.\n\nYour 8 strike put has a max risk of $800 if the stock drops to zero, which very rarely happens, but we’ve seen it recently.  The max profit is net premium credit collected which you didn’t include.  If we presume it was around .50 then the max profit would be $50.\n\nThe delta is .28 which is a 28% probability of the put option being ITM at expiration, which would likely result in a loss.  This also means the trade has a 72% probability of expiring OTM and therefore profitable.\n\nIn summary, your trade has a 72% probability of being profitable, with a max risk of $800 x 2 = $1,600, and max profit of $50 x 2 = $100.  Is this a good trade?  It looks good if you are willing to own 200 shares of DB at a net stock cost of $7.50 ($8 - .50 credit = $7.50).\n\nAs you see, the other Greeks are not typically used to make trading decisions.\n\nSee this page that explains how delta works to determine probabilities - [https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/options-delta-probability-in-the-money-14981](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/options-delta-probability-in-the-money-14981)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "My max loss is what I paid for the premium with buying this put ($45.68.)

But despite the error I see what you're saying and I appreciate the input. I am aware that delta is the most important second up is gamma, due to me being on the buying side. But if I were writing then Theta, Vega end up being more useful for those types of trades.\n\n\n*edit* I see where you mentioned selling puts. My apologies for possibly not clarifying my position: I am buying a put not writing one but either way, that information is still very useful.

You can see the odds of the stock moving far enough and fast enough to profit is smaller.\n\nWhen buying you can still use delta to know what strike based on the probabilities.  Want a 90% probability of the option being ITM at expiration, and likely a winner?  Then consider buying a .90 delta put which might be about a 13 strike and cost about $390.  The breakeven for this trade is $9.10 ($13 - $3.90 premium paid = $9.10) meaning the stock price doesn't have to move down much for the profit to start showing.  You are correct that the max loss is the amount paid.  \n\nGamma only impacts the trade closer to expiration, so how can it help when opening a 30+ dte trade?  It really is not a factor.  \n\nTheta works against long positions, so know this can occur, and this may be a factor in when to close a position early for a smaller loss.  \n\nAs you see, the other greeks are not used when making these strike and opening decisions, and then there is little to do with them once the trade is running other than know what they are and how they work.

This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.\nLet me share some additional context.\nAs part of our annual planning process, leaders across the company work with their teams to decide what investments they want to make for the future, prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. For several years leading up to this one, most of our businesses added a significant amount of headcount. This made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole. However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount. The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole. \nAs our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritization decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don’t have the right skills match from our existing team members. This initially led us to eliminate 18,000 positions (which we shared in January); and, as we completed the second phase of our planning this month, it led us to these additional 9,000 role reductions (though you will see limited hiring in some of our businesses in strategic areas where we’ve prioritized allocating more resources).\nSome may ask why we didn’t announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we’ve made them so people had the information as soon as possible. The same is true for this note as the impacted teams are not yet finished making final decisions on precisely which roles will be impacted. Once those decisions have been made (our goal is to have this complete by mid to late April), we will communicate with the impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies). We will, of course, support those we have to let go, and will provide packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.\nIf I go back to our tenet—being leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole—I believe the result of this year’s planning cycle is a plan that accomplishes this objective. I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have, both in our largest businesses, Stores and AWS, and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we’re investing.\nTo those ultimately impacted by these reductions, I want to thank you for the work you have done on behalf of customers and the company. It’s never easy to say goodbye to our teammates, and you will be missed. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to partnering with you as we make life easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so.\nAndy", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "As a former amzn corp employee, the ones that will remain will be worked harder than slaves.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "they'll get paid better", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Their stock comp, which is a significant portion, will suffer", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "As Adam Smith was famously quoted: \"them's the breaks\"", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Can confirm, they will have a bad time", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Why not re-hire internally and save some positions?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "underrated comment", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Anecdotally, I quit from doing IT in the warehouses in July and just had a recruiter emailing me last week about coming back.

{"title": "The $17 billion wipeout of Credit Suisse bondholders has not gone down well in Europe", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/17-billion-of-credit-suisse-bonds-worthless-following-ubs-takeover.html\n\nOne section of Credit Suisse’s bondholders is set to be wiped out following the struggling bank’s takeover by UBS, causing them to see investments worth 16 billion Swiss francs ($17 billion) become worthless. The Swiss regulator FINMA announced Sunday that the so-called additional tier-one bonds, which are widely considered relatively risky investments, will be written to zero as part of the deal. The move has angered Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders as their investments have seemingly been lost, while shareholders will receive payouts as part of the takeover. Usually, equity investments would be classed as secondary to AT1 bonds. Therefore, the decision “can be interpreted as an effective subordination of AT1 bondholders to shareholders,” Goldman Sachs’ credit strategists said in a research note published Sunday.\n\n“It also represents the largest loss ever inflicted to AT1 investors since the birth of the asset class post-global financial crisis,” they added. However, FINMA’s move should not come as a shock, Elisabeth Rudman, global head of financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Monday. “AT1s are there to absorb losses, so it’s not a surprise,” she said. “They’ve done what they were supposed to do.”\n\nVítor Constâncio, who was the vice president of the ECB from 2010 to 2018, commented on FINMA’s announcement on Twitter, saying it was a “a mistake with consequences” that could lead to legal action. The Bank of England has also distanced itself from FINMA’s decision, stating that the U.K. “has a clear statutory order” detailing which shareholders and creditors were expected to take on losses. AT1 bonds “rank ahead” of equity investments, the statement noted, adding that they had followed this process in the unwinding of SVB UK.", "id": "11wn5a5", "created_utc": 1679328956.0, "score": 725, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 405, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah sounds like the agreed-upon sequence of failures was not respected.

According to the news outlet, calls between the legendary investor and Biden's team focused on Buffett potentially investing in the U.S. regional banking sector. The 92-year-old chair and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway also had advice on how to navigate the unfolding banking crisis. \n\nIn 2011, during the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis, Buffett gave a capital infusion of $5 billion to Bank of America Corp. The move shored up confidence in one of the biggest U.S. banks at a time of turmoil, while also turning out to be an extremely lucrative investment for Buffett.\n\nNews of Buffett's involvement in talks about the current banking sector crisis, started by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, have been reported by several news media, which have written about heads of regional banks traveling to Omaha, Nebraska, over the weekend.\n\n\"A large number (>20) of Private Jets landed in Omaha yesterday afternoon. Jets flew from HQs of Regional Banks, Ski Resorts & DC. Did Buffett just fly all the regional bank CEOs into Omaha & offer a deal to SAVE the banks?\" tweeted market researchers Fuzzy Panda.\n\nLast weekend, the federal government tried to contain the damage of SVB's meltdown and contagion to the wider banking sector by assuring all SVB customers that their deposits will be fully paid out, whether they were insured or not. But this and other emergency measures, including the shutting down of New York-based Signature Bank, failed to appease investors, with shares in regional banks continuing to fall this week.", "id": "11wppfg", "created_utc": 1679334372.0, "score": 790, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 257, "comments": [{"body": "BRK calls.

In my view, the Tesla board completely failed to defend Tesla's valuation as a business at the end of 2022.  We know that some people here lost nearly everything as a result.  At least one member of TMC (Tesla Motors Club) committed suicide in the aftermath, and there's an unconfirmed report of another at TIC.

A company's board of directors is supposed to counterbalance the officers.  Elon has repeatedly shown that he cannot police himself.  He therefore doesn't belong on the board.  I think he can stay CEO.  I don't think he should be both CEO and a board member.\n\nAs with Robyn, if Elon can make the case that he should retain his seat on Tesla's board, I will consider it.  He hasn't made the case so far.  Based on his Twitter jokes, nonchalant attitude towards shareholders last year, failure to acknowledge any responsibility for collapse in market cap, and dismissiveness towards the possibility that his behavior has damaged Tesla's brand, it's not looking good for him either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRobyn and Elon may have some explanation or could present some factors that I haven't considered.

Further, between the GPU and PyTorch there's software such as CUDA that optimizes NVIDIA GPUs for core AI tasks, giving it a strong advantage to other GPU providers.\n\nWhile other GPU providers (such as apple silicon) are starting to optimize for AI development, they're already pretty far behind, and if this sector continue to go exponential, you may see NVDA's current lead turn into a structural monopoly, which is reflected in this price. If you don't believe me, take the basic [Fast.ai](https://Fast.ai) course and try to do the large language model section on your macbook or AMD based computer.

Pinduoduo is the company, although they've recently changed their name to PDD Holdings. So, my cost basis was $96 something, when I bought it in Late 2021. At one point, this stock cratered all the way into the 30's. Luckily, it started to finally rally late last year. I jumped out on January 9th this year at $99.22.\n\nI chose the price of $99.22 very deliberately, because I knew that it would have a bit of trouble pushing into $100, and saying at the $100's or above. On January 27th it hit like $106 something, so I did leave a little bit on the table. However, it's mostly traded in the 90's and 80's since then. Yesterday, it dropped as low as $75 due to the company reporting that their sales are going to be worse than expected. While I didn't time the sell absolutely perfectly, I did a helluva lot better than most.\n\nWhen I sell NVDA at $298, I won't be the least bit surprised to see it push into the low $300's, and I will certainly leave a little bit on the table, but I won't leave that much on the table. I will buy back into NVDA once it drops below $260 again, sometime later this Spring, or early Summer.\n\nCould I be completely wrong? Of course I could. But so could anybody.
