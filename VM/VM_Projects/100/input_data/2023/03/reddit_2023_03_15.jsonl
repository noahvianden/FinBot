It was triggered by the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, which was one of the largest trust companies in New York City at the time. The failure was caused by risky bets that the company had made in the stock market, and it sparked a wave of panic among investors and depositors.\n\nThe panic quickly spread to other financial institutions, and two other trusts, the Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust, also failed. The panic intensified when a run on the Knickerbocker's depositors began, causing many other healthy banks and trust companies to experience runs as well.\n\nTo prevent the crisis from spreading further, the banker J.P. Morgan stepped in and organized a group of bankers to provide liquidity to the financial system. The group eventually put together a pool of $25 million to lend to troubled institutions, which helped to stabilize the markets and restore confidence.\n\nAfter three weeks of turmoil, the panic eventually subsided, and the markets began to recover.

Of course people's expectations could be way off, lots of people could bet on big swings and the price could barely move at all. Or people could be predicting low volatility and some news comes out that moves things a lot.\n\nAnd also, it can be kind of a self fulfilling prophecy.

Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. Current tax rate: If you are currently in a high income tax bracket, contributing to a traditional 401(k) may be advantageous because it allows you to reduce your taxable income for the year. You'll defer paying taxes on your contributions and earnings until you withdraw the money in retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.\n2. Expected future tax rate: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or if you think tax rates will increase in the future, a Roth 401(k) could be a better option. With a Roth 401(k), you pay taxes on your contributions now, but your withdrawals in retirement are generally tax-free.\n3. Flexibility: Roth 401(k) accounts are subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs) beginning at age 72, just like traditional 401(k) accounts. However, you can roll over a Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA to avoid RMDs, providing more flexibility in retirement.\n4. Employer match: Keep in mind that employer contributions to your 401(k) account are always made on a pre-tax basis, even if you are contributing to a Roth 401(k). This means that you will owe taxes on the employer match portion of your account when you withdraw it in retirement.\n5. Diversification: Some people choose to contribute to both a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k) to diversify their tax exposure. This strategy can offer flexibility in managing your tax burden in retirement, as you'll have access to both pre-tax and post-tax money.\n\nIt's essential to carefully consider your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications before making a decision. Consulting with a financial advisor can help you determine the best strategy for your unique circumstances.\n\n***Can you show an example - let's say the person is 40 years old, 300K income and chooses to contribute to roth or the 401k for just this one year. No other contributions are made. How would either choice work out?***\n\nI am not a financial advisor, but I can give you a simplified example to help illustrate the potential outcomes of contributing to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k) in this specific scenario. Please keep in mind that this example does not take into account factors such as inflation, investment returns, or changes in tax rates.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. Age: 40 years old\n2. Income: $300,000\n3. Contribution: $20,000 (for simplicity, we'll assume the maximum 401(k) contribution limit for 2023 is $20,000)\n4. Retirement age: 65 (25 years from now)\n5. Annual return: 7%\n6. Current tax rate: 35%\n7. Retirement tax rate: 25%\n\nTraditional 401(k) scenario:\n\n* You contribute $20,000, which reduces your taxable income for the year to $280,000.\n* Your tax savings for the year: $20,000 \\* 0.35 = $7,000.\n* Your 401(k) balance grows tax-deferred for 25 years: $20,000 \\* (1 + 0.07)\\^25 = $107,328.78.\n* In retirement, you withdraw the balance and pay taxes at the assumed rate of 25%: $107,328.78 \\* (1 - 0.25) = $80,496.58.\n\nRoth 401(k) scenario:\n\n* You contribute $20,000 after-tax, so your taxable income remains $300,000.\n* Your 401(k) balance grows tax-free for 25 years: $20,000 \\* (1 + 0.07)\\^25 = $107,328.78.\n* In retirement, you withdraw the balance tax-free: $107,328.78.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the traditional 401(k) provides a tax savings of $7,000 in the contribution year but results in a lower retirement balance of $80,496.58 after taxes. The Roth 401(k) does not provide any immediate tax savings, but the retirement balance is higher at $107,328.78.\n\nIn this simplified example, contributing to a Roth 401(k) may be more advantageous if the person expects to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. However, individual circumstances, investment returns, and tax rates can vary greatly, and this example should not be taken as definitive financial advice. It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to assess your specific situation and make the most informed decision.\n\n***For fun, make the annual return 40%***\n\nSure, let's update the example with an annual return of 40%. Keep in mind that such a high return is unrealistic over a 25-year period, but we can proceed with it for illustrative purposes.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. Age: 40 years old\n2. Income: $300,000\n3. Contribution: $20,000\n4. Retirement age: 65 (25 years from now)\n5. Annual return: 40%\n6. Current tax rate: 35%\n7. Retirement tax rate: 25%\n\nTraditional 401(k) scenario:\n\n* You contribute $20,000, which reduces your taxable income for the year to $280,000.\n* Your tax savings for the year: $20,000 \\* 0.35 = $7,000.\n* Your 401(k) balance grows tax-deferred for 25 years: $20,000 \\* (1 + 0.4)\\^25 = $69,601,235.27.\n* In retirement, you withdraw the balance and pay taxes at the assumed rate of 25%: $69,601,235.27 \\* (1 - 0.25) = $52,200,926.45.\n\nRoth 401(k) scenario:\n\n* You contribute $20,000 after-tax, so your taxable income remains $300,000.\n* Your 401(k) balance grows tax-free for 25 years: $20,000 \\* (1 + 0.4)\\^25 = $69,601,235.27.\n* In retirement, you withdraw the balance tax-free: $69,601,235.27.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the traditional 401(k) provides a tax savings of $7,000 in the contribution year but results in a lower retirement balance of $52,200,926.45 after taxes. The Roth 401(k) does not provide any immediate tax savings, but the retirement balance is higher at $69,601,235.27.\n\nAgain, this is an unrealistic example, but it demonstrates the potential impact of taxes on retirement savings in both traditional and Roth 401(k) scenarios. It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to assess your specific situation and make the most informed decision based on your circumstances and expectations.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The ChatGPT example ignores the extra $7k you keep in your pocket (rather than pay in taxes) on the Traditional 401k example.
