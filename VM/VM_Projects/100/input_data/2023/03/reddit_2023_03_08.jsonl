Now that the Fed might not even finish hiking rates until the end of summer, they'd most likely hold rates there until at least mid 2024, which means high rates will continue to restrain multiple expansion, 2024 GDP will likely be fairly low, and earnings will again be under pressure in 2024.

{"title": "My 58-year-old father put his entire 401k into Tesla stock. How do you explain the volatility risk and lack of diversification to a parent?", "selftext": "Hi Reddit!\n\nI've (30M) been stressed about my father's retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock. This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.\n\nFor background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He's convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn't really reacted to the bearish arguments I've laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as \"robo-taxis\" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors in execution and is still not (and may never be) fully delivered.\n\nSetting the valuation of Tesla debate aside, I would never advise any person at any age to put 100% of their retirement portfolio in any single stock, let alone one as risky as Tesla. I've tried explaining the extreme risk in a zero diversity portfolio, where if this single company goes under he loses his entire retirement fund (\"all your eggs are in one basket\"), but he doesn't seem to take it seriously.\n\nMy fear is that he is already behind on where he probably should be in his retirement savings. He's told me before he spoke with a financial advisor before doing this, and he didn't have enough funds to manage with them. I feel he is making this gamble as he thinks its the only way to catch up, not recognizing he could also lose it all. I know he has not talked to any advisors since about his current investment strategy.\n\nSome questions I'm hoping you can help answer for him and I, so he has an outside perspective:\n\nIf you are neutral or bearish on Tesla, how would you explain the issues and risks with its va;ue going forward?\n\nIf you are bullish on Tesla, are you investing 100% of your savings in it, and would you advise a 58-year-old to do the same with their retirement savings? Why or why not?\n\nHow would you explain the risk of his current plan to him, and what alternatives would you suggest?\n\nWhat should an ideal retirement portfolio look like for someone his age?\n\nWhat resources do you believe would be good to share with him that might help reopen the conversation on reducing his risk and impressing the importance of diversification?\n\nIt's not an easy conversation to have with a parent, and ultimately I respect that he's an adult who can do what he wants with his money. I've tried a few times to have it but its difficult to balance not being taken as condescending to your own father while explaining how insanely risky you think his financial decisions are. It's made it more difficult by the high upturns TSLA has taken in stretches, validating all his beliefs, but with the subsequent downturns he's doubled down and not acknowledged the volatility and risk. I fear with him consuming positive bullish Tesla content exclusively, he is not considering bearish outcomes or basic retirement savings advice. Any feedback from the community that can offer an alternative view would be highly appreciated, as I hope I can share some of your resources and opinions with him next time I retry this conversation.\n\nThanks so much!  \n\n\nEDIT: For those asking, I believe he got in at late August 2020 timeframe, around what is now the $120 - $140 price range.  He has averaged up basically ever since, so not clear on what the current average price is.

That's basically what makes it a bubble, right? If a lot of people didn't lose a lot of money than it wouldn't be a bubble. Conversely, there are always the few people who make it out with their shirts and they're most likely either 1. connected 2. rich 3. an expert (someone who was an industry expert before the bubble happened) 4. an institution, or 5. extremely lucky. Now ask your dad, is he any of these? No. He is exactly the prototype of the \"retail\" investor who loses their shirt from this bubble. It's not the well-connected VC folks who invested in $TSLA back in 2009. It's not the wealthy ultra high-net worth individuals who's money is managed by a family office. It's not the battery scientist who's been tinkering with EV technology since 2012. It's not BlackRock who sees and hears everything.

The true wealth destruction is when $TSLA goes from $100 to $200, sucks in as many retail investors as it can so the folks from #1 - #5 can offload their positions, then goes down to $50. Right now is exactly when retail is left holding the bag. There's a really good reason why most bubble charts look the same. Whether it's $TSLA, $CSCO back in the dot-com bubble, Bitcoin, or the Dutch East India in the 1700s. At the end of the day, speculation and bubbles are driven by human greed that never changes. What also never changes is that that only the minority end up winning big (category #1-#5) and they're the ones cashing out during the initial plunge and the initial bull trap recovery.

This is more a personal preference but I'm not in love with the iPad with a car attached type interface Tesla uses and think the Hyundai especially beats them there. \n\nI've been following tesla for over 15 years; I'm actually the reason my dad learned about the company because I spent years jabbering about all the cool things they were doing and how someday i would own one. You can love a company and what they are doing for the industry while simultaneously not thinking they are a good investment.

You got good value for your money and made a decision and (surprise surprise) it was a Tesla! Hyundai/Kia are making good progress and pretty good EVs, no doubt. The ID.4 looks like crap and I know several people that have abandoned them due to bad experiences. VW also can't seem to manage any OTA updates, like almost all OEMs except Tesla.\n\n\nThe main point here is that the world is transitioning to renewable energy and storage at an ever increasing rate. Tesla is leading the charge on all fronts related to this transition. Governments around the world are doing the math and investing in renewable generation and storage. Governments are straight up throwing cash at companies to make this happen. Tesla is in front of all of it GLOBALLY! Telsa is the most capital efficient manufacturing company on the planet!\n\n\nEVs are inevitable and will be the dominant power train in the world auto market before you know it. Tesla and most other auto makers will sell every vehicle they make for the foreseeable future. The competition is between EV and ICE and pretty soon EVs will be cheaper than ICE at the time of initial purchase (they already cost the same when you factor in lifetime fuel, maintenance, etc). So the deciding factor for most people is going to be value for money based on what vehicles are actually available for sale. Tesla makes vehicles faster and cheaper than anyone else with better specs. Tesla will sell more cars because they can make more cars than anyone else. They have the pricing power. Other manufacturers are just getting started and trying to figure it out. They have legacy costs and practices that are like an anchor. Tesla was built agile with vertical integration in mind and they only get more and more vertically integrated over time (this reduces costs). If you didn't watch Investor Day I highly recommend it, along with AI day.\n\nTesla's energy division is finally going to show some money this year from Megapack sales. Next year is going to shock people (but it's just a car company!).\n\nAI is used all throughout Tesla and it was built in-house. You may not believe in FSD or Tesla bot but you should. When OEMs are ramping their EV factories, dealing with the UAW and trying to do it all profitably, Tesla will be having the bot doing a job in the factory. Also, Tesla has their own supercomputer and is building a better one. No doubt that Tesla will eventually offer a service for their compute for companies that want to train their own AI. Amazon AWS was built for themselves and then extra capacity was later sold as a service. FSD will get there but I won't speculate on a timeline. V11.3 just dropped and all of the testers are saying how amazing it is.\n\nI'm sure there's more and if you've been following along with Tesla for 15 years then I'm sure you probably already know most of what I wrote. I guess it just sounds like you've been buying into the FUD. Tesla has been thinking ahead and making appropriate plans since before the Model S launched.

That is not a good thing for Tesla, the stock. Stacking a new Tesla against the other options I would have 100% chosen the other options.  the only reason the private seller sold their car instead of just trading it in was because the trade in offers were abysmal. my price was about 40% depreciation on the original purchase price and their trade in offer was close to 50%.  \n\nFSD is a massively misleading marketing name for a level 2 system, while Mercedes may be beating them to level 3 soon.

They did this in two ways: 1) by dropping interest rates to about 0% to make money extremely accessible and very cheap to borrow, also known as QE or quantitive easing.

Yes, the stimulus checks were **structured** as retroactive tax refunds, but as recovery credits that did not exist prior to the passing of the CARES act in 2020. They sent out checks and if you didn’t get one for some reason, you could claim it retroactively on next years return. It was absolutely a “hand out”, but a necessary one. We’re in agreement here, but are arguing semantics lol. Additionally, those that didn’t file a return in previous years were very much eligible to get the payment. The government can’t just give money away, so when they want to get money into the hands of the people, they create tax credits. And other programs but in this case it was just a tax credit that they sent out an advance payment for. \n\n> the Fed running the faucet while the drain was plugged.\n\nThe Fed did what they felt was necessary to avoid a complete economic collapse. Companies could now issue hundreds of billions in new debt, and sell those bonds to the Fed to have cash on hand to stop from going under. This, coupled with PPP, was intended to save the economy from imploding and us flying into the next Great Depression. Corporate bills could continue to get paid, despite everyone being at home and nobody knowing how much worse the virus was going to get. We can go back and forth all day on whether it was too much, but it would take an entire team of people doing forensic accounting on every public company to see if they would’ve survived without QE. The Fed/Congress just threw money at the problem and decided to deal with the issue later. \n\nThe Fed can’t print money. They already had something like $8T just sitting on their books. They difference is instead of locking it up in Treasuries, they put damn near all of it out into circulation, on top of all the new money Congress issued through these new spending programs. \n\n> the patient and drug analogy\n\nYes. We’re saying the same thing in a sense. They gave “the patient” every drug in the hospital right before surgery and said “good luck idiot lmao” when the patient woke up. So rather than dragging it out and continuing to give to the average Joe over a prolonged period of time, all that money was immediately spent on food, gas, rent, etc, and accumulated upwards. Now the average person is struggling AND we have trillions extra in the economy. \n\n> the capitalism bit\n\nYeah Adam Smith had a nice little book about capitalism and the free market and the invisible hand etc etc etc. But it’s all theory. Just like Marx/Engles. It’s all just theory. In practice capitalism cannibalizes itself in order to extract money from the worker and accumulate upward until there is a “winner”. If left unchecked for too long that is how it’s designed in actuality. It’s why people vehemently hate anything that they *feel* is socialism/communism, and love capitalism despite it actively being against their best interest. None of these systems are perfect.

If you're interested in learning more about what a yield curve means you should read the paper linked to in this comment from the New York Fed's website. \n\nTime inverted is important when considering the potential for a recession.

It's called correlation and causation for a reason if there's nothing from A that's causing B then a relation is purely accidental. Like for example raising rates being a yield curve inversion cause and rates rise usually during stress and stress can cause a recession. Now if what you say would have a 100% hit rate if would mean that there's 100% of the times stress when rates rise and that stress 100% of the time causes a recession. Which in fact is not a fact.

Short term bonds are set basically by the fed funds rate that's why.\n\n>Since the fed funds rate is the rate at which you can effectively lend cash to the US Government overnight, this rate serves as the foundation of the yield curve—it is essentially a US Treasury bond with a 1-day maturity. When the Federal Reserve changes this rate, all other rates tend to change accordingly as well. \n\n[https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/yield-curve.php](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/yield-curve.php)\n\nBonds expect the rate to be high for at least 3 month so they can make money on that trade. \n\n>The Federal Reserve sets the overnight interest rate—but the interest rates on Treasury bonds from 1-month to 30-years are set by the market and fluctuate with investor demand. For example, assume that the Fed Funds rate is 2%. This indicates that investors can lend money to the US Government overnight and receive a 2% annualized rate of return. If that is true, then we would generally assume a 1-month Treasury bond rate to be a little higher than 2%. This is because investors value optionality. They like having access to their money in case something better comes along, so they require extra return if they're going to lock up their money for a full month - otherwise instead of buying a 1-month bond, they would just buy the overnight bond every night for a month.\n\nSame source.\n\nNobody wants to make a long term commitment at these rates because the market expects rates to be cut again.
