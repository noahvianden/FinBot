Your strike is waaaaay too close to your cost basis. 30 delta OTM is the conventional strike for a CC.\n\n> And this is the confusing part for me...on most tutorials I've watched/read, they talk about collecting the premium, and if the price of the stock hits the strike price, then you lose your shares.

So now I'm thinking, if the price reaches 22, will the P&L be much greater than the -0.16 I saw when the price went up to 21.52?\n\nPhew, a lot to unpack here.\n\nFirst, you misunderstood what you watched/read. You do not *instantly* lose your shares just because the price went over your strike. Your shares will be called away if and only if the short call is assigned. Assignment probability is a sliding scale, that increases when the extrinsic value on the call approaches zero. So whether or not your shares get called away is a function of how close you are to expiration and how deep ITM the call is (setting aside other risks, like ex-div dates, for now). If the call is ITM at close-of-market on expiration day, it is 99.999% likely to be assigned.\n\n\"Collecting the premium\" happened when you opened the CC. You got credited the premium for the short call into your cash balance at that time. So the game of trading CCs is really about **how much of the premium you get to keep**, before the call is closed, expires or is assigned.\n\nAbout all the P/L stuff, it depends on exactly what you were looking at.\n\nIf you were only look at the gain/loss on the call itself, not the shares, the call should have **lost value** when the stock price went up, and should have **gained value** when the stock price went down (ignoring IV and theta decay for now).\n\nIf you are looking at the gain/loss of the CC as a whole, it will be the **net** of the gain/loss of the shares PLUS the gain/loss of the call. Since the call loses money when the shares go up, the net gain/loss of the CC as a whole gets complicated when the stock price is near the strike price. Usually the prices cancel each other out and you net whatever profit you gained from the premium and from the difference between the strike price and stock price at the time of open, but no more.\n\nAnother gotcha about gain/loss is that **it is ultimately a guess made by your broker**. It's impossible to know the true value of an open trade until it is closed, so the broker has no choice but to guess. It's possible for the guess to be inaccurate.

One way to get the lowest theta is to shift your 2 week holding time to further dates from expiration, like you suggested. Of course, this has other costs and risks.\n\nAnother way is to net theta close to zero with a multi-leg structure. Vertical spreads that are $1 wide have very low thetas, regardless of when you open the trade. Of course, this has other costs and risks.\n\nApart from mechanically lower theta, the next best thing is to use the contract with the lowest extrinsic value. Theta only impacts extrinsic value and contracts that are super deep ITM have little or no extrinsic value. Of course, this has other costs and risks.\n\nSeeing a pattern here?\n\n> Is there anywhere I can find data like this?\n\nNot really, because once you understand how options work, including all the greeks, not just theta, optimizing theta becomes common sense. It's like asking if there have been any studies on how not to drive off a cliff and crash in a deadly fireball. \"Avoid driving off cliffs!\" is the common sense answer that doesn't need an academic study.\n\nWhat most people do is sell options instead of buy options. That makes theta work for them, instead of against them. There are plenty of studies about how to do that. Here's just [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ulvsck/theta_without_delta_intro_to_vol_trading/).\n\nBut sometimes you just need to be a buyer. Nothing wrong with that. You can mitigate theta in the ways already listed above. Just understand that each of those methods comes with additional costs and risks that might not be worth the theta you end up saving.\n\nAbove all else, if you take nothing else away from this wall of words, **forget about theta, it's delta that can kill you**. More generally, worry about making the trade profitable (positive expected value), before you worry about minor carrying costs like theta. Many people get their priorities mixed up.

The short call is assigned and your shares are called away if and only if some buyer exercises their long call and you are randomly matched with that exercise.\n\nSo, what would cause a buyer to exercise early? Almost nothing. Because exercising **throws away the extrinsic value of a contract**. It's flushing money down the toilet for no reason.\n\nThe value of a contract has up to two parts: \n\n1. Extrinsic value, aka time value.\n\n1. Intrinsic value: for a call, this is the difference between the stock price and the strike price, if and only if the stock price is higher than the strike price.\n\nAll extrinsic value is lost when you exercise. So, if total value of the call is $4.20 and $.20 of that is extrinsic value, *exercising will cost the exerciser $20 extra*, above and beyond the strike price that they also have to pay, plus fees. Now who  would take a $20 bill out of their wallet and set it on fire for shits and giggles? Practically no one.\n\nThe implication of this is that nearly all exercisers wait until the extrinsic value of the call is zero or very near zero before they exercise. And that happens when either (a) it is expiration or very near expiration, or (b) the call is so deep ITM that all of its value is intrinsic value.\n\nIn the case of calls, there may also be an incentive to exercise early if that means the exerciser gets the benefit of a big fat dividend the stock is about to pay. If you lose $20 of extrinsic value, but get $420.69 in dividends, it might be worth it to exercise early.\n\nMore reading here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourex", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the example and detailed response.\n\nNeed to review it and digest it!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I bought some $COIN call options at the beginning of the year when stock prices was trading at around $62.

Not likely to make much money, but simple.\n\nGoing out more than 60 days exposes you to both more cumulative theta decay AND more IV crush risk. Just because you are making a bearish bet doesn't guarantee that IV will increase over such a long holding time. If that were true, the VIX chart would be a straight line up over the last 4 to 9 months.

Especially ARKK. If the recession turns out to be even larger than the market is expecting, being right about XLK and ARKK isn't going to compensate for being laid off from your job.\n\nNevertheless, you aren't wrong about there being a bearish play on XLK, or QQQ, which is where I would make the play. Despite the 2022 decline, QQQ is still far above it's 2019 closing price. So something in the neighborhood of another 40% decline in QQQ, back to 2019 levels, would not be inconceivable. A 20% decline would have more than double the probability of a 40% decline, IMO, so if you want to play it safe, you could shoot for that.\n\nBut, QQQ has fooled me before.

So the question is, how many near rolls can you get before you exceed the cost of a single far dated hold? It's not a slam dunk that it's always 2 or 69, you have to run the numbers on a case-by-case basis. Unfortunately, taxes and fees work against the rolling scheme, increasing costs. It still might be worth it, though, if the decline happens early rather than late.\n\n> are there any other risks to a longer dated option contract?\n\nAs already mentioned, cumulative theta decay.

Buying a contract is a depreciating asset -- you lose more money the longer you hold. So it's not like you have your 542 for 9 months and then lose it all. You will lose a little of it every day, even if SPY doesn't go up.\n\nA better strategy is to either narrow down the window you expect the decline to occur in and then only buy a 30 day expiration, or, buy 60 day expirations and roll every 30 days.

As of December 31, 2022, it closed at $44.94. Additionally, BAC paid dividends totaling $6.06 per share during the period. Therefore, the total return of BAC since the end of 2008 is 246.45% (price appreciation + dividends).\n\nDJI: The index value of the DJI on December 31, 2008, was 8,776.39.

However, here are three reasons why bailing out banks can be seen as good for inflation:\n\n>1. Keeps Interest Rates Low: When banks receive bailout funds, they have more money to lend to businesses and individuals. This can lead to a lower interest rate, which makes it easier for people to borrow money. When there is more money available in the market, it could stimulate demand resulting in increased prices, and ultimately inflation.\n\n>2. Stimulates the Economy: The primary goal of a bank bailout is to prevent a financial crisis, which can cause a recession. By keeping the financial system stable, the government can prevent economic downturns that can lead to high inflation. For instance, if many businesses go bankrupt, it might lead to a situation of hyperinflation where prices skyrocket, and people's purchasing power decreases.\n\n>3. Boosts Confidence: A bank bailout can improve people's confidence in the financial system, which is essential for economic growth. When consumers and investors have trust in the system, they are more likely to spend and invest, which can increase the demand for products and services. Additionally, when investors have more confidence in the financial system, they are more likely to purchase government bonds, which can keep interest rates low and inflation in check.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "I fully expect these to be bidens exact points this morning.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Verbatim lol", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Listener: \"Hey, that doesn't make any sense!\"\n\nSpeaker: \"It may be hard for you to understand it if you lack experience in financial matters.\"\n\nListener: \"No, your AI talking points literally contradict themselves and each other!

You indicating that inflation is going to ruin people's purchasing power as they have to pay for more expensive stuff PLUS their mortgage?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "It is two pronged:\n\n(1) Ability to pay. Houses are priced on a how much can one pay per month. Inflation eats away at this as does increased interest rates. Houses are now on a purchasing power basis 50% more expensive to carry. People can’t afford it and new people can’t pay what someone with a 2.5% rate could.\n\n(2) Housing prices like a bond. Artificially low interest rates drove up the price and the value of a house now is really price of house plus the theoretical gain on the loan (having a 2.5% loan when the market rate is 6%). Since the mortgages aren’t transferable the later value can only be earned by holding the asset to maturity and not prepaying the loan. That means reduction in mobility which is great for wage payors and renters but terrible for anyone who bought in last five years and needs/wants to move. They cannot recapture they value again right now. This all happened in the early 80s but many mortgages were assumable. Go look at history to see how it turned out in many parts of the country then. Today is worse.\n\nThink about what happened to SVB simplistically. They took in tons of deposits and had no where to put the cash. They plowed it into treasuries (or government guaranteed RMBS) and the mid- to long-term duration of these bonds made them decline in value materially as rates rose. While they would still get all of the stated interest and principal, the cash flows were worth less than they paid to the market. When depositors started to pull funds, the bank realized that liquidating their “risk free” portfolio would not cover their the deposits Friday and today and had to phone the Fed and come clean. \n\nThe Fed immediately realized the ripple effects and gave a freebie (a BAILOUT) to the depositors by essentially buying the entire bond portfolio at above market prices. Most of these depositors are massive companies or sophisticated investors and knew they were running a risk. The deal is that $250,000 is guaranteed. Banks have to know their customers, depositors in excess of this should know their banks.\n\nNo rationale non-Fed entity would do what the Fed did, so it is a bailout. They tried to auction the portfolio and received zero (0) bids***. Monies were summoned from nowhere to make depositors whole immediately. Since the Fed doesn’t have to mark-to-market its portfolio and has no real balance sheet, it quickly and quietly swept the problem under the rug and hopes no one talks about what really happened. Bonds are a foreign language to most people so unfortunately ends up much ado about nothing, but value was conveyed by the taxpayer through future inflation. The Fed will never access a charge to the banks for its loss.\n\nHousing basically works in the same manner. When people lose their jobs (run on deposits) they will have to sell their house (or treasuries as case with SVB) and will likely suffer a loss.\n\nEdit: ***Apparently one bid was received, but below deposit obligation and on untenable terms.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent, thanks", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "\"Underwater\" refers to LTV, not the affordability of the payments.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "under water often means your home value is below what you paid for it", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">.

{"title": "Pre- CPI Analysis... here is my prediction (with position)!", "selftext": "***There seems to be some confusion so im prefacing this with THIS IS NOT TA.. NOR IS THIS MY NORMAL TYPE OF POST... MERELY A DISCUSSION OF CPI DAY TOMORROW... we will resume our regular scheduled and Normal TAs tomorrow night ;) if you are a regular and dont wanna hear me ramble about CPI and stuff then skip this discussion. Again this is NOT a TA... Merely a discussion on CPI day tomorrow****\n\nhey guys! no TA tonight because i have some other stuff going on and realistically predicting where we are going isnt really worth the post... We shall see where the dust settles post-CPI and see if we are going for the 400s or the 360s leading into FOMC!   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzze1lvv0lna1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01f9ce6f516dc4b3900167d0caf59ceb8836c7a7\n\nResistance: 390.1 (1.22%) -> 394.7 (2.4%) -> 397.8 (3.2%) -> 405.3 (5.2%)\n\nSupport: 378 (-1.9%) -> 374.1 (-2.9%) -> 370.6 (-3.8%) -> 365.5 (-5.2%)  \n\n\n5% would be pretty impressive whether up or down however here is what i suspect is going to happen....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rz1yizk91lna1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e3120c59b56834bd8677e2ec99d7d29b11569423\n\nBased on my estimations here is what the numbers say and what i predict...  \n\n\nCPI YoY: numbers call for 6-6.2%... I believe we will see a 6% CPI YOY  \nCPI MoM: numbers call for 0.3 to 0.6%... i am looking for a 0.3 to 0.4% MoM reading  \nCORE YoY: numbers call for 5.3 to 5.6%... i am looking for 5.3 to 5.4%  \nCORE MoM: numbers call for 0.3 to 0.6%... i am looking for 0.3 to 0.4%.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05cujsu72lna1.png?width=1089&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a438d6fd72a5ce927fc1c1a763c7b451f138cc9\n\nmy thoughts are this and really has been this for a while... however, the bank run made me size down alot for this play but in a way also helped me... but i believe what is going to happen is the above extremely bullish print on CPI. When this happens with the bank run which has now already priced in a 32.1% chance of a 0bps hike at the next FOMC meeting (next wednesday the 22nd).... we are about to see a massive breakout. I dont know if we get the type of run we got in november with that incredible 5% green day... but i think this is setting up for a massive not only green day but a massive run into FOMC...  \n\n\nthink about this... CPI is pretty much the last key piece of data the fed will get before FOMC next week. We have PPI on wednesday but should be a nothing burger... SO if CPI is the last piece of important data then when they see this bullish print we are going to get an incredible green open. We have basically had 2 opens in a row on CPI that didnt do anything and burnt everyone. The MM has convinced people to stop playing CPI and more importantly stopped people from playing straddles now... we are overdue for a massive reaction.   \n\n\ncooler cpi opens us into a huge rally... the chances of a 0bps is going to go to about 80%+ when we get those numbers. that 0bps is going to force a huge rally. what this bank run did is actually push the fed to go faster than they would probably want to with cutting rates. \n\nits like they always say... the feds gonna hike until something breaks...   \n\n\nMy ultimate target for tomorrow is 405.17... thats a MASSIVE level to watch and is almost our upside daily supply (resistance) to watch... i think we could easily open 3%+ tomorrow IF the numbers come in as good as i expect.... If you think about it after this bank run nonsense algos are ready to burn everyone that jumped heavily into puts last week and today.\n\nNow if im wrong and we get a hot af cpi then we easily are going to see a 25bps 100% priced back in and most likely open -3% and i would be targeting the 373.98 demand (support).   \n\n\neither way tomorrow is going to be extreme volatile.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbix8nln3lna1.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3e4d10c2ddc815df11589a7890051a26aaf8f86\n\nIF my calculations are correct and IF we get the standard IV pump of 80-100% and we open at 1% that would be about 400% gainer, if we open at least 2% green this should be at least a 1000% gainer... if we open 3%+ (like November) it should be about a 2600% gainer...   \n\n\nIf we open red... well TOS just got a $315 donation to hopefully prevent them from going bankrupt during this bank run so i dont have to switch brokers... Either way i only risked todays profits i have ALWAYS wanted to on a day like today buy the \"end\" of the options chain.   \n\n\ni will see you guys tomorrow night for a proper TA and analysis of where we are headed next.", "id": "11qoj1x", "created_utc": 1678747544.0, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Daddy Tom Lee over here.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "You think CPI is going to come in better than current swaps and the Cleveland nowcast?
