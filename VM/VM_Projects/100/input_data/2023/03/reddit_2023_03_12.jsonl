{"title": "Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Explained in under 400 words.", "selftext": "# Introduction:\n\nSilicon Valley Bank(SVB) is a bank that primarily serves Venture Capital/Private Equity firms in areas such as Technology and Medical start ups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reasons:\n\n**Interest rates environment**\n\nIn 2021, SVB received a substantial amount of deposit due to overall economy booming. It bought a lot of government treasury bonds at a low interest rate. ([Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-losses-push-silicon-valley-bank-parent-to-raise-capital-125e89d4?mod=Searchresults_pos2&page=1)) Government bonds are not bad but they are exposed to interest rate risk.  \nHowever, as the FEDs started raising interest rates it reduced the value of bonds SVB had outstanding. When FEDs raise interest rates, this leads to higher coupon rates on newer bonds so older bonds are sold off to capitalize on the higher coupon rates, which in turn reduces the price of older bonds i.e. their value.   \n\n\nIF a firm had held these bonds till maturity, no losses are made. However, due to poor environment it led to lower investment into VCs so more VCs pulled their deposits out. SVB had very little liquidity so it was forced to realize the losses on the older bonds. ([Source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-silicon-valley-bank-rates-securities-693c931c)) Higher uncertainty as more bad news of losses from SVB began piling up, it led to even more deposits being withdrawn and more losses crystalizing leading to a loop of destruction. \n\nSo, SVB wants to avoid losses, it tries to hold securities till maturity i.e. Held to maturity(HTM) assets. Accounting practices allows for HTM to be in terms of par value and not the updated value.\n\nAccording to the 2022 10-K, SVB has total deposits of about 173 billion but only 118 billion in relatively liquid assets. BUT 76% of liquid assets are in HTM, that 76% is according to PAR VALUE so the actual worth of HTM today could be significantly lower.  \n\n\n**Signaling**  \nIn finance, there's a theory called the Signaling theory. Basically, when a firm issues out new stocks its foresees losses ahead and wants to spread the losses among a larger number of shareholders, as it is also in manager's best interest to do so due to them usually having a stake in the company. SVB announced a $2.25 billion equity financing plan to raise capital. ([Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-losses-push-silicon-valley-bank-parent-to-raise-capital-125e89d4?mod=Searchresults_pos2&page=1))  \n\n\n**Large Exposure to Diversity Risk.**\n\nSVB's main customers had more or less the same demographic so the deposits owned by SVB are more or less the same. There's very high correlation between the deposits, a withdrawal most likely will trigger another withdrawal as customers are facing the same extent of losses or same issues so the diversity risk is high.", "id": "11p4ghc", "created_utc": 1678593098.0, "score": 2774, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 407, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2361, "replies": [{"body": "Bank take money.

Just in case you forgot econ 101, your 10Y 1.8% treasuries  will drop like a meme stonk portfolio over the next year. They'll eventually be worth face value, but in the short term will dump more than 20% if the interest rate rises more than 3% - which it will, because we're literally telling you we are going to do that, and you're getting a year's advance notice. You sure you don't want to buy a bit of 1 or 2 year bonds? Because it would be really, really fucking stupid to full port hold-to-maturity 10year treasuries when the interest rate is at a historically low  ~0% and leave yourself with no cash on hand\". \n\nBank says wow Fed, you're so right. Thanks but no thanks, no short-term bonds for us. After all we're a bank! why would we need cash on hand in the next 10 years? \n\n\n**last week** \n\n\nCustomer says hi please give me my money. You're a bank and the only reason you exist is to have liquid cash available. Bank says would you like to come back in 10 years? We'll have lots of money then. Customer says no, please give me my deposits back. \n\nBank goes to check the holdings because didn't bank buy SOMETHING that wasn't 10-year treasuries? Yes, Bank definitely did. No way bank would ever full port into 10Y hold-to-maturity bonds. Yay! Bank finally found what they did with the rest of the customer cash! Finally!\n\nShit, it's in 15-30 year mortgage-backed securities :(  Run on bank, bank ded.  RIP bank, why the fuck didn't you buy some 1 or 2 year treasuries to have cash on hand you literal fucking neanderthals (answer: they risked it all for an extra ~1.5% return on the 10Y, vs the yield on the 1 or 2Y)\n\n\n**the end**\n\nDon't let anyone tell you this wasn't their fault, there's a fuck ton of SVB apologists out here and bailout beggars. Unlike stock, you can literally fucking google \"bond price calculator\" and know almost exactly what the price of a bond would be at a future time and interest rate. \n\n**Let's be clear about SVB's \"extracurricular activities\"**: They lobbied congress to [loosen banking regulations](https://www.levernews.com/svb-chief-pressed-lawmakers-to-weaken-bank-risk-regs/), their C suite sold stock right before collapse (sales scheduled in january), they paid out annual bonuses to all their employees hours before the FDIC seized and froze the bank, and now their downstream customers are worrying about missing payroll... worst of all, they made the choice of overleveraging into 10-30 year instruments, sitting on them after the fed announced hikes, and then fire sale-ing their investments for liquidity after doing nothing for a year. This bank epitomizes the rot in across our economic, legal, and political systems. \n\nWatch out in the coming days for all the apologists and gaslighting, many are already trying to make it seem like SVB was a victim (Bill Ackman and several others are doing it already), or worse saying they need a bailout - they will use all kinds of creative language about \"restoring depositors' accounts\" and \"backstops\" and \"catastrophic to small businesses\" and they will do everything to avoid mentioning where the money would come from (because the answer is from taxpayers). \n\nIf they don't suggest a way to get money **directly** into the hands of the depositors without it going directly first to SVB, *they are suggesting a bank bailout*. Upon shutting down SVB, the FDIC created the \"Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara\" which is the name you should look out for to see if the plan might be legit. Remember that previous bank bailouts led to tens of thousands losing their jobs, their homes, etc, but the banks survived and lost nothing. In fact, they gained massively. Don't allow people to trick you without a legitimate justification beyond \"you're literally advocating for killing small business if you don't do exactly as we say\" into thinking giving *your* hard-earned money straight to a ~$300B bank that couldn't bank is the right path forward.", "score": 2772, "replies": [{"body": "> ~$300B bank that couldn't bank\n\nLove it.

Arguably though clients exceeded normal withdrawals for 30 days anyway so maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have helped.\n\nWe do get updates every quarter on what they're holding and we can figure out the market value of their securities. Based on the market value of their securities everyone knew they were technically insolvent by the end of September 2022 because unrealized losses in their hold to maturity (htm) portfolio were larger than their equity.\n\nHowever, HTM is not expected to be reflected on the balance sheet or hedged. You can think about it like your retirement account, it might be red or green but you don't care because you're not touching it till 65 anyway. Thus the unrealized losses in HTM didn't impact the capital ratios that they were subjected to and the bank remained functional. \n\nHowever, everyone can calculate the problem by themselves so by November people were catching on and some more prudent VCs were telling their startups to get out of the bank.

It was neither unpredictable nor unforeseeable", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think the issue wasn't that you or I would see it as a black swan event, more that to SVB buying the bonds at low interest rates was considered prudent at the time. They had to do something, holding cash is considered risky and buying bonds is actually the 'safe' thing to do. It is/was an acceptable move away from actual cash. However it locked them into long terms before they can pull that cash back out. So if the Fed had raised interest rates slower, that would have given SVB more time to transition to the new bond / interest environments. It wasn't raising of rates, it was how fast the rates were raising, which the Fed wanted to push the inflation down quickly. Arguably because they started too late.\n\nIn fact many banks are dealing with the exact same long term bonds, so on some levels the entire banking industry is closer to the knifes edge. However the scale of this failure ~200B, is trivial to the banking world. So it's a failure in risk management, I am not expert enough to really dive further into the specifics of risk management on if this was a good plan or not but I do know moving reserves to 10% wouldn't cover the Q1 withdraws, it might have covered the Q4 event that was an inciting incident and saved the company ~$1.8B.\n\nSo we know what the failure was, risk management, but it's actually what everyone does so is this a 2008 type event? For that we circle back to the account diversity. SVB was primarily in tech startups, and tech is seeing significant reductions in income right now. Meaning more tech companies are spending rather than depositing. The large financial hit in Q4 if it was a one time event wouldn't have required SVB to really take any further actions as again this would right itself in time by merely reaching the bond maturity. If it wasn't for those pesky customers wanting their money. SVB certainly had bonds turning over constantly providing them liquidity. If the rate of withdrawals stayed at or below the rate they can turn over the bonds profitably, there is zero issue. It's when the rate is higher that SVB has to sell bonds at a loss and eventually that's unsustainable, thus a run.\n\nOther banks are much less tied to tech sector, and some industries are actually doing just fine. So to the really large banks dwarf this one and can eat $42B withdrawal for breakfast but they also don't even have to because their clients are not having as much issue with income/expenses.\n\nFurther SVB could have gone to the central banks for bridge capital at almost no interest. I heard this wasn't done because SVB didn't have the established trust in place, but this is hear say. However these short term capital issues like in Q4 are known to happen and banks want the money to flow so they can all take the wins. \n\nThe Q1 event however was really just a body blow and if the same 21 percent happened to say JP Morgan Chase (assets ~$3.67T) would mean clients withdrawing $770B in a day. That's just insane and would likely kill JPMorgan Chase and likely many others. However if that same $770B was done over , then again no issue because the Fed would cover it at nearly 0% interest.
