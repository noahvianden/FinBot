Disney said last month it plans to cut $5.5 billion in costs, including $3 billion in content spend.\n\n“This week, we begin notifying employees whose positions are impacted by the company’s workforce reductions,” Iger wrote in the memo, which was obtained by CNBC. “Leaders will be communicating the news directly to the first group of impacted employees over the next four days.

{"title": "The world is on the \"edge of danger\" and may face three \"seismic\" changes, says Dalio in China", "selftext": "Speaking at the China Development Forum 2023, Rae Dalio, founder, chief investment officer mentor and board member of Bridgewater, said the monetization of huge debts, the huge internal conflicts caused by the divide between wealth and values, and the conflict between international powers are three factors that \"are driving all the current situations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to Dalio, the world is on the \"edge of danger\" and could face three \"seismic\" changes, \"if they happen, we could witness something we have not seen in our lifetime, but which has happened many times in history. These three forces, which began several years ago, have reached a crisis point and are driving all of the current events.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe three dramatic changes, as Dalio calls them, are, first, the monetization of huge debts, where central banks print money and issue currency to buy these debts, second, the huge internal conflict caused by the divide in wealth and values, and third, the conflict between international powers. According to Dalio, all three of these factors are now emerging to the greatest extent since 1930-1945.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDalio believes that many indicators such as real per capita income, per capita life expectancy, and nutritional levels will improve significantly in the long run due to increases in productivity and especially technology. The evolution of this upward trend is characterized by huge cyclical fluctuations, which consist of short cycles that interact with each other to form large cycles. These large cycles are the so-called \"good years\" and \"bad years.\" In addition, the events that lead to such large cycles do not occur according to a timeline, but are determined by causality, so that their occurrence is not predetermined, but manageable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDalio further emphasizes that many times, the accumulation of many short cycles to form large long cycles leads to debt write-downs and monetization of huge amounts of debt when debt ratios rise and liabilities become too large to sustain. At the same time, along with financial and economic cycles, there are political cycles within countries, and geopolitical cycles between countries, and history shows that when these three forces are superimposed simultaneously, they lead to turbulent transitions, often resulting in dramatic changes in the domestic and world order of great magnitude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDalio points out that since 1945 - since the establishment of the last new world order, the monetary order, which can also be called the world order of the United States and the dollar - it has gone through 12.5 short cycles until now, accumulating to form a big debt cycle, which is now quite high as a percentage of GDP, when Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, then began to tighten monetary policy to deal with inflation, causing cracks to begin to occur in the market, and the economy began to weaken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to Dalio, we are now entering a big international geopolitical cycle. \"What I hope is that there will be wisdom, restraint and understanding in the world and that the world will continue to be peaceful and prosperous.\"", "id": "12368f1", "created_utc": 1679879253.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|2 days ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dalio can 0DTE Deeze Nuts", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "Amen & Awoman🙏", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Well said GerryManDur / GerryWomanDur.", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "💀", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "That’s what my fortune cookie said", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "All my fortune cookies lately say something like.. \"you will have a day tommorrow\" \"tommorrow is another day\" \"tommorrows day will bring you a day ending in 'Y\".

Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. Diversify across asset classes: Diversify your portfolio across various asset classes like stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate to reduce risk and benefit from different economic conditions.\n\n2. Focus on defensive stocks: Invest in stocks of companies that provide essential goods and services and tend to perform well during economic downturns. Examples include utility companies, consumer staples, and healthcare companies.\n\n3. Emphasize on technology and innovation: Allocate a portion of the portfolio to companies at the forefront of technological advancements, as they are likely to benefit from increased productivity and long-term growth.\n\n3.5 Invest in commodities and inflation-hedging assets: With the risk of inflation and monetization of debt, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to commodities like gold, silver, and other precious metals. Additionally, consider investing in inflation-protected bonds (e.g., TIPS) to hedge against inflation.\n\n4. Geopolitical diversification: Diversify across different countries and regions to mitigate the impact of geopolitical risks. Consider investing in both developed and emerging markets, with a focus on countries with relatively stable political \nenvironments and strong growth potential.\n\n5. Alternative investments: Allocate a small portion of your portfolio to alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, private equity, and venture capital. These assets can provide higher returns but come with higher risk and volatility.\n\n6. Leverage and short-term trading strategies: In an aggressive portfolio, consider incorporating leveraged ETFs, options, and futures to enhance potential returns. Be aware that these financial instruments carry higher risk and can amplify losses, so they should be used judiciously and with a thorough understanding of their mechanics.\n\nTactical asset allocation: Monitor global economic indicators, policy changes, and market trends to make tactical shifts in your portfolio allocations. This approach requires a higher level of involvement and may include market timing strategies to capitalize on short-term fluctuations.\nActive management: Consider using actively managed funds or working with investment managers who can adapt to changing market conditions and implement strategies that align with the outlook presented by Dalio.\nRisk management: Despite having an aggressive portfolio, it's crucial to manage risk effectively. Set stop-loss orders, maintain a disciplined approach to rebalancing, and consider using diversification techniques like investing in uncorrelated assets.\nIn conclusion, the aggressive portfolio mix and trading strategy should emphasize diversification across asset classes, sectors, and regions while focusing on defensive stocks, technological innovation, and commodities. It should also incorporate alternative investments, tactical asset allocation, and active management while ensuring proper risk management practices.

But the recession from July 1981 to November 1982 (culminating in 10.8% unemployment) was a key factor in the revenue slippage. There were other epic factors that played roles in the reversal — among them the gradual transition from manufacturing to a service-based economy, the dawn of the Age of Information, and a gradual relaxation in both private and public concern about debt.\"\n\nWhat about in the early 1900s, where the tax rate was substantially lower? They seemed to be doing fine then.\n\n\"The rates were reduced in 1922, 1924, and 1925. By 1925 the highest marginal rate was 25 percent for $100,000 and more net income. By the late 1920s only about the top 7 to 8 percent of Americans were subject to federal personal income taxes.\"\n\nYour second error: You can wipe out debt by having a surplus (Surely the Government does not overspend, of course they wouldn't do that).\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD)\n\nSince 1900, there has only been one time the US has had a surplus.

Where do I even begin.\n\n1. Banks are not getting cucked, the fed has committed to buy all their treasury bonds back at par that were trading for example 80 cents on the dollar.  They are kept on balance sheet as assets held to maturity but when SVB had a run on deposits they had to sell at prevailing market price.  Fed has backstopped that and bailed out banks underwater bonds and thus buoyed balance sheet for future buybacks and divy hikes.\n2. As it relates to interest rates, banks generate more profits in a higher interest rate environment because they make a higher net interest margin vs when rates are lower.  This is the difference between what they pay on checking / savings and the rate they earn from money parked at fed at prevailing fed funds rate.  The flip side is they were under water on long maturity and high duration bond portfolios, but fed backstopped that, so contagion, was contained.\n3. Inflation is not prevalent if you look under the surface and the commodities market is showcasing a powerful deflationary wave on the horizon.  If you look at the basket of the top 20 largest commodities, on average, since the fed started hiking rates in March of 2022, spot prices are down 20% on average since then.  The inflation bubble is bursting and we are already within feds 0-3% target if you look at trailing 3-6 month inflation figures.  Inflation looks high because cpi compares data from March of 2022 vs March of 2023 aka lagging indicator.  Recession prognostications, a more normalized labor market, and rapidly unwinding supply chains lay the groundwork for a massive pivot on rates in second half.  Futures market is already predicting cuts.  Massively bullish.\n4. Slower money flow as you put it or tighter credit conditions is great to slow down GDP growth, increase layoffs, reduce spending and allow fed to capitulate hard from rate hikes to big cuts.  When this occurs stocks rally hard and bonds rally hard as equity risky premium rises and bond price rise when rates drop.\n5. Markets also were down 20% last year, Nasdaq 35% ish peak to trough which is a massive correction and small / mid cap peaked in feb 2021.  Stocks are really cheap here and mega cap tech which has fortress balance sheets will use surplus capital saved from austerity measures, notably layoffs to buy back stock and juice profits leading to above market forecasted profits for 2023 and they will experience multiple expansion as markets start pricing in a better backdrop in 2024.  Ultimately, the worse the economy does in near term, the better it is for markets.  The markets and the economy are two separate things.  The stock market tends to bottom 6 months before the economy does during recessionary times.  Also, going back to 1950, s and p 500 averages 25% return after a 20% down year.\n\nLastly markets are up 72% of the time, why are you getting bearish on stocks after coming off the worst year for the equity markets since 2008?

The base case for a earnings collapse will be largely mitigated by share buybacks and cost costs to buoy and expand margins even in a declining revenue environment.  As inflation abates, interest rates will also drop precipitously and capital will rotate out of bonds, and high yielding FDIC insured bank products and into stocks because of dislocation between return requirements and their asset allocation to insure they don’t outlive their money.  Drops in interest rates will also reduce pension plan funded ratios which still compose 8 trillion plus in assets and that leads to systematic and algorithmic rotations out of fixed income and into equities.  Stocks also do extremely well after being down 20% in a calendar year, in fact, stocks average 24% on average over next 12 months going back to 1920.  Also, the the average return generated between when economy and markets bottom is between 20-40% and the markets bottom on average 6 months before the economy does.  Lastly, everyone is focused on 2023 when the market will start to price in a better backdrop for stocks in 2024 as earnings rip higher.

And when you reference those market cycles above, what you may have missed, is we have been in a bear market across many asset classes for 1-2 years so most if not all of the damage has been done.  In 2008, 2009, markets crashed in fall of 2008 September-October, and bottomed in March of 2009 before closing the year up over 50% peak to trough across s and p 500, Dow, Nasdaq.  So that entire bear market lasted 10 months.  Again, if you actually knew anything about the history of us market returns you would know that bear markets are short lived and typically violent.  Asset classes that have experienced long term bear to flat markets are international developed equities and emerging market equity, peaked in 2008, and gold has basically not moved in over a decade.  \n\n“If history is a guide markets may not make an all time high for 10-25 years.”\n\nThis is so flagrantly and belligerently ignorant that you sound like Russian state controlled media.

The difference between you and I, is I have been doing this professionally since 2009 as a fully licensed financial advisor and fiduciary working at some of the largest global asset managers and systematically important banks EG, UsBank, Morgan Stanley, Russell Investments, Lincoln Financial and currently JP Morgan.  You are uneducated on the markets.  And the yield curve inverting?  Do you even know what that means?  Yes the yield curve is inverted because inflation expectations are coming down, labor tightness is heading towards labor slack/layoffs and the economy is weakening and longer term rates are sniffing this out and pricing rates accordingly.  Yield curve inversions are a tell tale sign of recessions, but what you are missing is that the best returns generates during a market cycle occur while markets are heading into recessions and coming out of recessions.  Your bearish thesis would have been kosher 1 year ago before we just had greatest 1 year crash since 2008, but that’s already played out, the crash you predict already happened and this is the 3 longest bear market in the last 100 years.  \n\nSo let me repeat, you are extremely uneducated and have a few buzzwords you pulled off CNBC but are completely uneducated.  This is a hobby for you, and I do this for a living.  With that being said, your username gold bug is solid.  If we can agree on one thing, it’s that gold will do very well over the next 5-10 years.  The move lower in domestic interest rates will lead to more weakness in the dollar and a compression in the spread between U.S. and international sovereign debt rates and thus weaken the dollar and strengthen gold.  Gold between 2000-2010 went from 250 range to 1800 but since 2010, gold has not moved in 13 years.

You'd essentially be telling the American people that the bank's overleveraged problem's (for being too risky) is more important than the purchasing power of the tax paying citizen--it's not. Pausing rates aren't guaranteed to do anything either because a lag exists. At the very most, some banks may have more room for liquidity however, in a scenario like this, the fed would lose it's grip on inflation which would eventually prolong rate hikes making problems for the banks even worse.\n* **Slashing rates** for the banks would trigger a massive demand for cash--hence it's purpose in stimulating the economy. However, in this case, since inflation is still relatively high and inflation is the result of too much supply of cash, institutions--who have access to tons of debt very quick--would pull as much as they can and use it before it devalues. Demand would be out the roof the moment this happens because institutions know that it's value would become less right away as supply balloons.

So even raw materials and labor can be argued to not have an intrinsic value, in fact it is the other way around,  the value of raw materials and labor is derived from the value of goods it produces which may change as technology evolve and public sentiment changes.\n\n Maybe in the future, if we figure out how to build a fusion reactor that runs on water, then suddenly we will perceive water to have a high value yet nothing fundamental about water itself has changed. \n\nSo then i again ask, is there really an inherent/objective value to anything at all?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Markets forward looking.

You increase money supply with out increasing goods and labor, you get inflation.  You lower goods or labor, you also get inflation. Right now the US has increased the money supply and at the same time lowered  goods and labor participation.

We import more than we export, and we have fewer people producing, and we increased our money supply. \nInflation isn't going anywhere. The Fed could make interest rates 10 percent tomorrow and we would still have inflation. We need to build more homes, grow more food, produce more energy. We need more people in the workforce, we need to make it easier for people to be productive labor.  Until then, it's hooverville time.

Low rates were no longer seen as a discount, they were just normal. Getting a mortgage at 4% or less was basically standard practice for a decade.

When they started to tick up again covid hit, and we went back to low rates.  So now you have the banks having an entire decade of low rates on the books. As rates go up, any fixed rate asset is worth less and less, think T bills, Mortgages, stuff like that.  There is no tool the fed can use to fix this problem. By leaving rates so low for so long, they broke their own tools. If they raise rates, banks take huge losses, liquidity crisis 2.0, inflation runs rampant. If they lower rates, inflation runs rampant. if they print more money  inflation runs rampant. As yet, they don't have the discipline to follow through on QT, Inflation runs rampant.

{"title": "The economy in 2023 for dummies", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThose who have borrowed lots of money to buy assets, such as banks and insurance companies, are in a lot of trouble because the assets they bought have gone down in value, meaning they have lost a lot of money. This means they are going to have a difficult time paying back the money they borrowed.\n\nThe government has to come step in and fix this situation to make sure that the banks are able to pay people back. To do this, they have to borrow a lot of money, and they do this by raising money by selling bonds (which are essentially getting loans from people).\n\nIn order to raise money by selling bonds, the government has to make bonds an attractive asset. That is, the bonds have to be a good investment, and provide good returns to those who buy the bonds.\n\nThis means that the federal reserve must raise the interest rate, because that determines the yield of bonds. Nobody is going to buy a bond at 1%, because the return on investment is so low, in fact, even losing money because inflation is higher than 1%. So the government has to set bonds at something like 7% or even 10%, because then people will buy it, because it will provide a good return even with inflation.\n\nBut if bond yields are at 7% or 10%, then that means interest rates are at 7-10% as well.\n\nHigher interest rates hurt banks because interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. And banks' whole business is the business of borrowing money. It makes it more expensive for them to borrow money to make investments. If banks have to pay 7% to borrow money, then they have to charge 8% to loan money to people. And if people have to pay high rates to borrow money, then less people will borrow. This makes banks lose profit.\n\nFor example, if you want to buy a house, and want to get a loan from the bank to pay for the house, it would be nice if the bank offered you a loan at 1%. Then, the loan to buy a house will be cheap, and many people will buy houses. If the bank is charging 8% on a loan, then getting a loan to buy a house will be expensive, and people won't buy houses (or get bank loans).\n\nSo as you can see, when the government has to raise money, they have to sell bonds, and to sell bonds they have to raise the interest rates, and when the federal reserve raises interest rates, banks must pay more to borrow money, and they must charge their customers more for loans, which means less people will loan, which hurts the bank.\n\nAnd why does the government have to raise money at the moment?   \nBecause they have to help out the banks who have made bad investments and can’t repay the money they borrowed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, one must note that the banks and insurance companies are in two situations.
