Ok ok politics nobody likes to hear it.. buarg.

{"title": "I needed some time to process everything and I'm ready. Some banks may shut down and stock market may crash by fall.", "selftext": "I'll try to write this without the use of our usual degen language here and I'll refrain from using memes. Hope this helps some of you to take it more seriously this time. \n\n\n*\"Depositors will have access to their money\"*\n\n*\"Investors will lose their money ... that's how capitalism works.\"*\n\n\nIn the last week, this struck me more than anything. Banks have had insurance to a reasonable amount and now we're promising people and businesses that they'll get their money (even over the insured limit) as long as they are just deposits and not on some risky investment. That's the message I get from Washington's wording. That should have cooled the markets down. Instead some people created the opposite narrative and it's getting dangerous for investors prone to FOMO. \n\n\nOn top of that, Federal Reserve is taking responsibility for the damage it's inflicted on banks by increasing rates too high too quickly. Despite the new bond buyback facility, if you fail, you're on your. That's what I get from the actions taken and words spoken in the last few days. Therefore I don't expect a dovish fed next week. Federal Reserve will increase their rates once again. IMO it will be another 25 bps. The rate of which it will increase in the next few meeting *\"will depend on the data\"* as Jerome Powell says at almost every meeting since last year Q3. \n\n\nThere is no reason higher interest rates should cause any more problems, because the fed will provide cash for MBSs and government bonds. So when they say it's not a bailout it's really not if they don't keep doing this forever. The only thing that favours banks at this point is the lack of consequences for over-extending right before interest rate hikes. Let's say they borrow for their MBS and bonds? What are they supposed to do with it now while FDIC watching them like a hawk? \n\n\nI'm pleasantly surprised that FDIC is on top of things that they intervened the way they did when they had to. So this brings me to my next point, consequences. With no bailout for investors during this administration, investors in stocks should be extra careful where they put their money. The drop in banking stocks is fully justified. IMO they will decline further. If a bank fails, you will have your securities as long their books aren't baked and you will have your cash... eventually. But the bank will be no more. I suggest everyone takes a deep look at where their securities are, where their cash is. If you have gold or crypto, do you really want to keep it in a bank or exchange that you cannot trust. The next 6 moths is all about risk management... because some banks didn't do theirs right. And now we have real-life examples at nearly hundreds of billions of dollars of assets being risked because they overextended. It's not a conspiracy theory. This all happened. \n\n\nWe may see panic and even stock market closure for a day ~~if~~ when one of the larger banks go under. At a time of depleting savings and working class slowly running out of cash, this would create total chaos. I can even see Washington increasing the debt ceiling quickly when they need to supply cash to people and not banks this time. I see that as a more likely and a better fix than bailing out a bank. \nThanks for reading. \n\n\nTL:DR The scenario I see has the fed increasing rates at 25bps until they can't and more banks going under in the next 6 months. You as investors may lose money on bank stocks and it may take time having access to your other investments and cash. What's guaranteed is only what's on your contract. No bailouts. Do yourself a favour and asses your risks and manage carefully. \n\n\nP.S. This doesn't mean you can't or won't make money by being long. You can for a while until you can't. \n\n\nDisclaimer: These are all my opinions and should not be your only source for making investment decisions. \n\n\nOf course reddit had to break as I was typing this... sigh\n\n\nWhile I was waiting to post this, Wells Fargo, $WFC, filed for $9.5 billion mixed shelf offering.

How does that make any sense? It'll be like Pearl Harbor, except China didn't even restrict Japan's trade yet, it's just that they *could*, which by the way is already possible today without invading Taiwan.\n\nPlenty of other countries *could* threaten Japan's trade and occupy Japan's islands too (in fact we already do). Why didn't Japan join on Iraq's side when the US invaded them? Russia also occupies 2 islands claimed by Japan. Why didn't Japan join the Ukrainians with a strike at the Russian far east?

I have to say it the stock market won't be crumbling. The Economy will be under a lot of pain, not from banks or stocks breaking. Rather from inflation. The reasons for why inflation will start to flare up instead of a crash in the latter part of the year are as follows: \n\n1. The swift bailout for the banks shows the willingness of the FED/Treasury to bailout any defaults in order to stem the tiniest possibility of **\"instability\"**. Meaning the FED for all it's tough talk is a barking dog, but no bite. This action by the FED/Treasury shows the FED have no appetite for going thru a **\"slowdown (recession)\"** if necessary to quell inflation. We all know that it took a hard landing/recession to quell inflation in Volcker's era.\n2. There's an election coming in 2024, and you bet your ass that the current administration will not shall not under any circumstances allow the economy go into a **\"recession\"** because it's bad optics for an upcoming election. They would rather cope with high inflation and pass blame off to any excuses (Trump tax cuts, Republicans 2020 excessive spending + Ukraine war, Putin pricehike etc.)\n3. Stock markets go down = people's livelihood/401k/retirement plans dies too. Everyone will be angry and look for someone to blame. And unlike 2008, where people had some level of restraint and respect for law and order. We're in an era of polarization where people rather use violence than words to communicate, because everyone expect words won't work already. So it'll be social discord and chaos, no way the government will want that. So government will rather print or support/prop up markets.\n4. A potential re-ignition of a cold war is already on the horizon. Not between Russia and America so much, but primarily China & US. While China is one country it is still the second largest economy in the world. Further, we the west depend too much on the east, and despite many people desiring a \"decoupling\" from China, it will take years. So how does tie into the stock markets? People have to remember Chinese institutions/citizens can also invest into the American stock market too. And if the stock markets go kaput, you bet that there will be a withdrawal of much needed capital. Followed by potential restrictions from China for their companies/people in the name of **\"protectionism\"** to invest in the western institutions. This will cause a tit for tat between America and China and a further deterioration in relationship. Finally, China if desiring a retaliatory move, but needed a justification could use the excuse of deteriating relationship to start selling its vast amount of U.S. bonds/treasuries and that will crush the U.S. dollar. Thereby, spurring inflation.\n\nOverall, from my perspectives there's too much at stake for the FED/Treasury/US administration to allow a stock market crash. There maybe a temporary crash, but it will be immediately stopped or responded by insane amount of support/QE. You just have to see how the all the main wallstreet analysts response to rate hikes based off of the recent bailout. These people were anticipating 25-50 Bps for March's FED meeting and no rate cuts this year. To now crazily analyst saying no hikes/even rate cuts at the March meeting... CPI did come down to 6%, but mom it's still up 0.4%, yet all these analysts and FED seems optimistic. How can you be optimistic, if inflation is still going up MoM, and with inflation well beyond 2% (6% now)? So what can we conclude? The **FED is no longer prioritizing inflation and has chosen stability** first, this is what Arthur Burns did in the 1970's, something was about to break, put the brake on rate hikes and even do rate cuts, when inflation showed disinflation. Then inflation went wild and rate hikes had to go, while telling everyone to be optimistic and don't worry. So inflation is going to go higher as much as we don't want it to. Of course this is **this degenerates thought process** and I have no degree in Economics/financing. So take it with a grain of salt and this is no financial advice lol.\n\n**TLDR:** We F'd cause FED/Treasury/Government too afraid of instability therefore, they go BRRRRR on printer, and inflation goes BRRRR x2!", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
