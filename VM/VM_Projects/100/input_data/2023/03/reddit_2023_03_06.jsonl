Then they mark up the price to make $1 of profit, so they sell it to retailers for $3.  Then retailers mark it up an addition dollar for their own profit, and sell it to the public for $4.  So we can say that the price of a $4 widget consists of $1 materials, $1 labor, $1 manufacturer profit, and $1 retailer profit.  Then, if the cost of materials increases, so that the same materials now cost $1.50, the retail price of the widget might go up to $4.50, and we could say that 50 cent increase was due to the cost of the materials increasing by 50 cents.\n\nBut options aren't like that.  The price of a financial security traded on a free open market is determined by the market.  The price is whatever the bids and asks agree upon, and these concepts like extrinsic and intrinsic value are concepts we retroactively apply to the market-determined price.  Options pricing models *describe* or *explain* the price more than *prescribing* it.\n\nSo the price of the option is 4.65.  We choose to say \"well, an option that's ITM should always be worth at least the difference between the strike price and the underlying's spot price, so we're going to call this difference 'intrinsic value.'  And then we're going to call any additional value it has on top of that 'extrinsic value.'\"   But the price is not derived by starting with an intrinsic value and an extrinsic value and then summing them together.  The price is what it is, and then we choose to break it down into those two concepts.\n\nFurthermore, there aren't a separate \"time chunk\" and \"volatility chunk\" of extrinsic value.  The fundamental reason extrinsic value exists is time, and in fact an older term for extrinsic value is \"[time premium](https://www.optionseducation.org/optionsoverview/leaps-time-erosion-versus-delta-effect).\"  If there are two different options with all other characteristics being equal and one's premium is higher than the other's, we would say that's because of IV, but there isn't an IV component and a time component that are summed together to get the extrinsic value.\n\nRemember, it's not just delta that describes a change in the option's total premium rather than its extrinsic value only.  The same holds true for theta and vega.  Theta is the change in the *option's premium*\\--not its extrinsic value--per day, and vega is the change in the *option's premium*\\--not its extrinsic value--per point change in IV.

This is why there is no consensus.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?\n\nThe answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.\n\nIn the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.\n\nWhich brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.\n\nIn 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor.

{"title": "Pre-JPOW day… the dove or the hawk? 3-6-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well after two massive green days covering $10+ today started off hella strong only to find ourselves rejecting off a major 5, 15min, daily and weekly resistance at 407.3 intraday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8bncailu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7caf8ab985b53a8ca981357cb82f9c1ed49c9d7\n\nFor those of you that don’t know JPOW testifies to congress tomorrow and Wednesday. This is a yearly thing that he has done since at least 2021. \n\nIn 2021 we saw a red day, however, in 2022 we saw a pretty big green day putting in nearly 2%... the question we have to ask is… “will markets listen to jpow and interrupt what he is saying as hawkish finally? Or is this going to be like the last 3-4 times he spoke where the markets had blinders on?”  \n \n\nBased on the last 2 weeks of downtrend (outside of Thursday and Friday) I honestly think markets (and more importantly the algos) are more ready to accept a hawkish JPOW and are more ready to sell off depending on what he says. \n\n**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si3wu0ylu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f898b77756e444f6589dcf17c64f2d4dce73eaab\n\nTaking a look at supply and demand here on SPY daily if you remember I said one of the more short term bullish but longer term bearish scenarios was that SPY would come up and take out 405.74 demand from 2/10. We did just that today. Now what is important is what happens next. With this evening doji star pattern here and the techicals pointing to a new supply being established soon… IF spy closes below todays low there is a very good chance we are going to see this 405.74 demand turned into supply. Turning a demand into supply (resistance) is extremely bearish and would cement not only this level but would also cement a lower supply than the previous ones up in that 414-417 area. \n\nAll eyes remain on tomorrows close to see what that technical show. If we establish this 405.2 as supply tomorrow then my ultimate target realistically is 396.5 supply from 2/24. If we can take that supply (currently support) out and turn it into a new demand or reconfirm previous demand (support) at 394.88 that would be very bullish going forward. I would 1000% play a bounce from that 395/396 area back to 405. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACITON** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3xonzgmu6ma1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=1481bb182177eb80e0499a38ffd0b6f489c863c4\n\nLooking at the daily chart here everything is screaming put here. This evening doji star pattern is one of the highest probability setups for a put. If it wasn’t for jpow speaking tomorrow and Wednesday and my overall lack of trust in this market and the fact that pre markets have seen some incredibly volatile overnight swings… I would 1000% be in at least a 14-30dte put. I fully expect the 400 support area (which is the daily 200ema) to be retested this week when we see a structure like this. \n\nSPY:\n\nSupply- 396.46 -> 414.13  \n Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  \n Daily Support- 404.4 -> 399.7 -> 397.8  \n Daily Resistance- 405.3 -> 407.2 -> 408.2\n\n**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kghecwxmu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f33db70929df2416ee139c1c09d383b9bb3cfa\n\nNow if you remember on futures last week we had taken out previous demand and now we are officially in a no mans land. We either need to find the extra strength to push to 4096 before we establish a new supply (resistance) short of that. OR we need to establish a new supply (resistance) and come take out lower supply at 4015/ 3991.\n\nFor me personally based on the technical and daily price action we should turn todays candle into a supply (resistance) here at 4055. Doing so will then open up a retrace to “take out” previous supplies at 4015 and 3990. IF we take those out and can establish a new demand before retesting 3960 then I would like a push back to 4096. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qcfyqydnu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=68a1a182915378ea0a1d8cb1b43acc8cdf697c0c\n\ntaking a look at futures daily price action here are one could imagine the candles are similar to spy (which isn’t always the case) and we are actually seeing a pretty significant reversal candle set up here too. With the SPY and Futures daily reversal set ups I would be surprised to not see a retrace to minimally 4020 tomorrow. 4020 is currently where the daily 8, 50 and 200ema sit. However, there is a chance with JPOW speaking tomorrow that the algos could do something funky which obviously would result in a breaking of technical. \n\nAgain if it wasn’t for JPOW I would have felt pretty darn comfortable in overnight 25-30dte puts. But little reason to take the risk. \n\nFutures: \n\nSupply- 3990 -> 4015 -> 4160  \n Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  \n Daily support- 4050 -> 3983  \n Daily resistance- 4085 -> 4095 -> 4113\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ohkn1jou6ma1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a628091d41c598357db70ca843d8def5fb37cc\n\nOverall the VIX is still in a down trend here as you can see. However, it put in a really nice inside day today. Historically speaking inside days result in continuation but is not always the case. \n\nI mentioned on Friday that the 18.2 support touch on Friday should have resulted in a VIX bounce which is clearly did. However, that apparently did not account for the fact that SPY wouldn’t care that the VIX was green all day long too… nor would it account for the fact that yields once again were elevated again while SPY was green. \n\nThe only thing that played correctly was that DXY was down just slightly today while SPY was green. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgvcj82pu6ma1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=0379884c36bc0da0fefa6ae2c1f4a1c440214e5c\n\nAbsolutely a great way to start off the week! No complaints at all. I got burnt as you can see twice in calls though. The first one I stopped myself out of when we were playing around that 406.5 to 407.3 morning/ mid day chop… I entered a call on support (what I thought was) and price action broke a key level. I took my exit and then of course it pushed to HOD. Tough bounce but was the right play and the right stop loss. \n\nOnly other loss today was a stop out when we  bounced off support and once again had a fake break down.\n\nThe morning was extremely frustrating to trade as we were seeing that VOLD was extremely bearish along with the VIX and the yields, however, SPY continued to push up. Made for some choppy trading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7qhh2npu6ma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d026e9df963078295c57b83ce49fa2e27718157\n\nHowever, the best play of the day was the 1225am retest of 407.3 resistance. I saw it as a short opportunity and took a beautiful 9.4% win. I ended up closing for profits when we came back down and were holding 405.3 support at 1pm. I actually was looking for a bigger recovery back up to 407 again. However, EOD actually ended up being fairly bearish. \n\nI am bearish to neutral. If bulls take back 405.3 tomorrow then I would be bullish until we touch 4096 supply. However, I feel fairly confident unless jpow pumps us tomorrow that we establish a new supply and will push back to that 3990/4015 area this week. \n\nRemember after JPOW speaks we have a TON of data EOW too..", "id": "11keysk", "created_utc": 1678138811.0, "score": 125, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4437|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: JPOW speaks tomorrow and Wednesday.

But it’s a slippery slope to allow the government the keys to what can be banned. Why do you support government overreach?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I don't support government overreach. I'm a life long computer scientist, from a very young age. Tiktok is exactly what we were warned against in the early 90's, programs that acted like something else that would try and steal your personal data, to know more about you, to gather dirt or other intelligence in case you become a government worker, ceo, or politician; to increase the reach of their domain or surveillance state (exactly what china is trying to do) and to drip feed false or misleading information, cheat algorithms to show a little bit of what they want you to see. Tiktok is worst, it plays the long game and causes damage to the brain.\n\nThis is exactly why we used avatar's and user names, never told anyone our real name or location, and never freely gave out our information online. Myspace and facebook changed that and made people feel comfortable giving away their information, that no harm came to it. It changed our very culture, and this culture just so happens to be extremely weak to mental attacks. Think trump, andrew tate, and even musk with his blatant manipulation of the stock market. People are heavily swayed by information that turns out to be false and delivered by social networks.\n\nIf i'm right, China is testing its control and surveillance abilities trough tiktok. They want to see how much information they can get from people, how they can influence people to do things (think tik tok challenges) , how to extend their surveillance technology, and maybe even how to damage another person's brain with an app. If this is all true, then this is a national defense issue that must be handled with the utmost of care. The US government is doing exactly what they should be doing, and protecting it's citizens/the rich people's batteries that benefit them, not china.\n\nIf this is all really happening, think of the damage it's all ready caused. People that don't even use tiktok will feel the affects and ramifications of others using the app. A whole generation of people could be damaged on the wide scale and they'll be studying the affects on people for years. No way to tell what all is being snooped on, the data is encrypted on the way in and out so we have no idea what exact information they are gathering on people. If they're moving to ban tiktok then it's because there're people advising the government that this app is the most dangerous psychological weapon and surveillance tech we've ever seen, and it's astounding and scary coming from some place like china. If we respect them as a power, we treat them as a proper threat and remove their control on our people.\n\nAlso there aren't ANY other social media apps that upload and download gigs of data in the first couple days of downloading the app on a fresh install, not even facebook, i've tested this myself. Despite all the evidence, this one thing should scare people the most, it's incredible that people don't seem to care.\n\nTLDR: In all due respect, you guys are ignorant to the potential damage TikTok can cause. It could be an incredibly dangerous weapon and a trojan horse. If they're moving to ban it, I suspect they know for sure it's a weapon and don't want to cause panic. Many Chinese phones are all ready banned on our networks here for the same reason tiktok is about to be banned.

Your case can be made for many apps like I said before. I'm not ignorant and I know what the capabilities are.  I agree with everything you said about what the potential tik tok can do to Americans. I've seen the brainwashing it can do to people, even my on children. There's paid campaigns to make Americans think a certain way on a topic, say like something simple and dumb as Andrew Tate. There's a ton of videos making American sympathetic to him.  Or the videos of young gen Z women saying they expect $300k a year salary from their husbands. There's a lot to unpack.  I just believe if you're not in government, you're a parent and should be allowed the right to parent how you feel is right. If you don't want your children on it, don't allow it.
