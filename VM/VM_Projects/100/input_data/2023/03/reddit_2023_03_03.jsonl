Rather, its the insane demand to be here which I doubt, will ever go away. People simply dont want to go anywhere else... Can you blame them? We have the best weather, literally, in the world. Voters, made up of people who pay the taxes for the cities they live in, dont want to urbanize their own areas. Can you blame them?\n\nThe reality is two fold.\n\nFirst, we are running out of flat easy to build land. In fact, I would say, we are practically all out of it here in San Diego unless you go east which is rather rural or build in the rocky hills which is hard. They are pushing east but you know how it is... See point 2.\n\nSecond, no one wants more people around them. They especially dont want medium or high density builds. Would you? I personally dont see a problem with this. To me, this is actually a positive thing because it means that people care about their neighborhoods and are trying to protect their quality of life.\n\nAs for investors, thats how capitalism works. These guys dont always win. Ask Zillow how their venture into RE went. They didnt do well at all. Blackstone is brought up a lot because they are targeted by right wingers who want to eliminate the environmental investment stuff and they chose BX to focus on. Thats just politics. Otherwise, they are no different than any other investment group and these guys are no where near the worst. Go see what Bain and other corporate raiders do but I digress.\n\nIt is what it is. Demand will always be high and if you do add density, you will just make quality of life worse for those who live there. Damned if you do, damned if you dont. You help one group (new residents) at the cost of hurting the other group (current residents). Id rather they dont build mainly because I feel like the current owners should have the final say and frankly, I dont want every area to be like LA. Also there is so much undeveloped land in the USA... people need to spread out for petes sake. We dont need everyone to cram into the coastal west. There are lots of really nice places to live... so maybe the price should be a lot higher? I dunno. \n\nBut back to the point, Im still surprised at the current RE action. I felt like prices needed to come down a little, and they did last year, but I also didnt expect a rebound so soon. Not with interest continuing to increase. I also figured that wages might be stagnating and disposable incomes declining which might make people more nervous, tempering the hot market... I guess not.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't feel your logic. Higher density will bring down quality of life? Have you ever been to Europe?

End of the day most folks dont like high density. They put up with it because they have to not because they prefer it. \n\nThe financial argument is a myth though. Smaller cities do just fine without being \"subsidized.\" High density does mean more tax revenue and less service sprawl (thus cheaper per population) but the downsides are obvious. If a SFH burns down, it generally only effects one household. When a person burns their apartment, many people are impacted. Similar problems with disease spread and service breakdowns.\n\nBut the worst part is crime rate by area. Though \"bad person\" rates are the same anywhere (in general), the number \"bad persons\" per area is much higher in urban areas. This along with the anonymity that comes from urban population flow, gives nasty folks more opportunities to target victims. \n\nAsk women from EU about their bad experiences on public transit and out in public in general. \n\nI have a family in Sweden and one of the mother told a story about a night she was going home after shopping. A guy followed her off the bus. She tried to walk slow to let him pass and then walk away fast to get away but for whatever reason  he just stayed a few steps behind her. When she got to the apartment, she opened the door to get in and he grabbed the door before it closed. Then he asked her \"why are you afraid?\" Imagine that... and then proceeded to entered the apartment complex with her... she then ran to the elevator and closed it quick. She said he was walking to the same elevator as it closed but it closed on time and she got away. She called the police but he was gone by the time they showed up. She doesnt know if he lived there or not but she thinks he didnt. This was in Sweden of all places... where its supposed to be nice and safe.\n\nThis type of stuff is simply more frequent in urban areas. I get less horrifying stories from my family in London and other areas but the women always have scary stories to tell. Now you tell me, is that worth it? And its not just women. I have been held up at gun point twice and both times it was at work in a high density area. My brothers wife was indeed raped in her early 20s (around 2006 I think... didnt ask) while living and working in downtown San Diego. Thankfully no one else I know was killed or hurt but man... I dont think I know any woman who doesnt have a scary story to tell. My own wife hates going to the gym because of how many times creeps tried to talk to her when working out. She wears a wedding band but certain creeps just dont seem to care. We dont realize it as men, but this kind of crap happens to females all the time and it just gets worse in places with more people. \n\nSo is the extra tax money is worth it? I really dont think so. I respect people who like urban life and I do think people should live how they like but it will be very hard to convince the average person that urban life is better than suburbs or rural... especially if they actually lived there before. You might be able to convince young folks or even rich folks who can afford the best locations and cars (despite high taxation in EU). But to put it into perspective.

So if the Tesla team reaches its goals, Tesla should be making enough 4680s to build 2k Model Ys/week by the end of Q1 '23.\n\nDave Lee also [went into some detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsC7OF5iG_U) on the cell production lines he saw while touring Giga Texas.  He was told that Tesla's 4680 pilot line at Cato Road in Fremont, was running 5th Generation production hardware, while Giga Texas lines are using 6th Generation hardware. \n\nMr. Baglino mentioned that the 4680 team is steadily perfecting both the cell and manufacturing process, so I don't expect a parabolic increase in 4680 production until the company has accomplished all the goals they set out on Battery Day 2020.  We know that anode formulation is still undergoing refinement, as different candidate formulas are undergoing parallel manufacturing at the Giga Texas lines, to determine which is optimal.  \n\nAs far as I know, current Tesla automotive cell/pack usage looks like this:\n\n* Fremont factory gets most of its battery packs from Giga Nevada, and the majority of these are made from Panasonic 2170s built on-site.  I believe this may be supplemented by packs made with 2170 cells from LG in South Korea, but I am not entirely sure.  Fremont also uses a substantial number of LFP batteries imported from China, probably mostly made by CATL.  A minority of packs, all for Model S/X, use Panasonic 18650/1865 cells imported from Japan. \n* Giga Texas uses a mix of 2170 and 4680 based packs.  4680 packs are made on-site from cells also built on-site, and some cells from Cato Road in Fremont.  I don't know where the 2170 cells or packs are sourced from.\n* Giga Berlin uses 2170s from LG, which are imported from LG factories in China and/or South Korea (this information is based on reporting from late 2020 and early 2021, when the supply contracts were signed).  The cell plant at Giga Berlin assembles the cells into packs.\n* Giga Shanghai uses packs based on LG 2170s made in China, as well as LFP batteries, also made in China and probably mostly from CATL.  The LFP packs are used in RWD Model 3s and Model Ys.  \n\nPanasonic is known to be developing 4680 cells.  I believe the company intends to build these cells at a facility [being built in De Soto, Kansas](https://na.panasonic.com/us/panasonic-energy).  I discovered this through an announcement from Palantir Technologies that [Panasonic had chosen Palantir Foundry as the software platform to run the new factory](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/palantir-technologies_we-are-excited-to-be-working-with-panasonic-activity-7006028827193663489-AYFI?utm_source=li_share&utm_content=feedcontent&utm_medium=g_dt_web&utm_campaign=copy).\n\nFinalizing development of mass-production 4680s is very important for Tesla, not just for scaling up product manufacturing, but for localization efforts too.  Berlin is heavily dependent on China manufactured cells.  Fremont also needs a lot of Chinese cells, though to a lesser degree.  Having a steady supply of local 4680s will save a lot of $ on logistics, and reduce the chances of disruptions from transportation issues.\n\nSupply chains have a lot of moving parts, so I do not know how accurate my \"big picture\" of the cell situation is at this exact moment.

A Model S RWD w' 265 miles rated range could easily cost $90,000-$100,000+ depending on options.  Today's RWD Model 3 has more range and features at less than half the price.  Tesla will continue to be able to reduce prices because the company is laser focused on improving manufacturing efficiency.  On the affordability front, I don't see any long term problems.  Model 3/Y will get more affordable, and NGV will only improve this. \n\nI have seen arguments that Tesla does not refresh its vehicle exteriors or interiors enough, but I think this may matter less than it used to.  Mobile phones still look mostly the same as they did a decade ago (glass slate), with most of the improvement being in software, processors, displays, cameras, and network connectivity.  Likewise, Tesla constantly improves the technological aspects of its cars to make them more comfortable, more safe, and more useful to the owner.  \n\nThe old way of doing things: a new body style every 5 years, may have been largely due to the fact that ICE cars of the late 20th and early 21st centuries just did not fundamentally improve that much between generations.

The town is almost completely encircled at this point and will fall in a matter of days, if not hours. \n\nCombine that with multiple reports from Ukraine, NATO, and others of the absolute dominance of Russian artillery fire VS the lack of supply for sustained Ukraining artillery power.  I have seen figures from NATO sources claiming anywhere from 5,000/day to 50,000 artillery strikes/day from Russian forces compared to Ukraine's ability to provide 1/2 or sometimes 1/3 or less than that. https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-politics-jens-stoltenberg-business-c50b44b430ae86f289baee9da5e35345 Stoltenberg says NATO needs to ramp up production, but just like the delivery of tanks that Ukraine requested (and got less than 1/3 of what they asked for) these things take time.  Lots of time. \n\nArtillery is the king of battle for a reason.  Napoleon dominated Europe primarily through the use of artillery.  Comparing small unit tactics to battalion level tactics, artillery of that magnitude is essentially suppressing fire.   Most people think of artillery and air strikes as precision munitions used for targeting specific positions, and it can be used that way, but when you're firing 20k- 50k shells a day that's just straight up suppressing fire for maneuvering forces. \n\nIf you're getting even a 1% kill rate that means you're killing 500 men a day with that rate of fire.  Which aligns with reports we've heard.  It's insane how much shelling that is, and not all shelling casualties are from direct baro or penetrating trauma.  It isn't a stretch at all to assume 5%-10% of those strikes are causing casualties of one sort or another (think shell shock from WW1).  So that puts your numbers at thousands per day decommissioned from the battlefield.  Put simply, a force cannot sustain under that level of bombardment if it doesn't have the ability to answer back in equal force or with other means. \n\nCould go on but those are some primary examples", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "How long do you think Russia can fire 50,000 shells a day?

NATO countries are going to ramp but capacity isn't near what Russia's is according to some experts who have weighed in on the subject.  Then again, you'll get conflicting reports saying otherwise.  \n\nI'm personally inclined to side with the pro Russian reports on this matter because the NATO war machine is oriented towards precision guided munitions of which Ukraine only has so many platforms and not large volume, Russian standard shell casings.  Ukraine has a lot of Russian weapons platforms.  It becomes an issue of skilled manpower, weapons platforms, and logistics to the front lines- all of which are far more difficult for Ukraine to obtain, and they're also reliant on others to do for them. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the 50k/day figure is surge capacity for the battle of Bakhmut and not something they're sustaining daily.  Daily looks more like 5-20k which is far more sustainable, but is still reportedly 3x the daily amount Ukraine is firing. \n\nI expect after the battle of Bakhmut daily usage will decline pretty significantly as Russia either consolidates and defends what they've gained or makes a new push somewhere.  There are rumors abound that Transinistria may be the next major battle ground as Russia attempts to cut all Ukrainian sea access out, or possibly they'll sweep towards Kiev in the north.

The S&P 500\n lost 2.6% in February, but is still up 3.4% this year through the end of last month.\n\nThe stock market staged a rebound in 2023, led by beaten-down tech shares, as investors bet that the worst of the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle is over. But some big name investors like Greenlight’s David Einhorn believe that stocks have more room to fall.\n\nThis year’s gain comes after a stellar year for the hedge fund, which soared 38% in 2022, marking the firm’s best year ever and outperforming its largest competitor, Millennium, by more than 3 to 1. Citadel has also racked up a nearly 117% return over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022.\n\nHedge funds aim to offer downside protection during market turmoil, and Citadel managed to shine during the worst chaos in the market in years. The S&P 500 tumbled into a bear market in 2022 as recession fears intensified on the back of the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to tame the highest inflation in 40 years.\n\nMacro hedge funds, those making bets around political or economic events, have fared particularly well as tighter monetary policy from global central banks stoked wild moves in different asset classes, from bonds to stocks, and commodities to currencies.\n\nCitadel’s equities fund, which uses a long/short strategy, is up 2.4% this year, while its global fixed income fund is higher by 1.6% so far in 2023, the person said.\n\nCitadel’s assets under management exceeded $54 billion as of the start of 2023.\n\n>TLDR, Kenny Boy is making returns that his competitors don't even come close to without explanation. There is no way this is possible without acquiring information not publicly available to his competitors OR (more likely) Citadel must be taking a lot of risks to make these returns for a hedge fund.
