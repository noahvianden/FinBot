{"title": "In just a few minutes this week, Powell changed everything on market’s view of interest rates", "selftext": "* **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell set out a new paradigm for how the central bank views its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time.**\n* **Markets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.**\n* **What changed was the January inflation data, plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed’s efforts to slow it down.**\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman [Jerome Powell’](https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/)s prepared speech this week to Congress took just a few minutes, but it changed everything.\n\nIn those remarks, the central bank leader set out [a new paradigm for how the Fed views](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/fed-chair-powell-says-interest-rates-are-likely-to-be-higher-than-previously-anticipated.html) its policy path, one that apparently will see even higher interest rates for a longer period of time than previously thought.\n\nThe aftermath has forced the market, which long had been looking for the Fed to blink in its inflation fight, to recalibrate its own views to coincide more with policymakers who have been warning about a higher-for-longer approach to interest rates.\n\n“We have clearly had a choreographed chorus of Fed speakers for two weeks that was getting us to that place,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. “It took Jay Powell, over the course of a very brief prepared statement and a Q&A, to get those expectations cemented into a higher place.”\n\nAs part of his mandated [semiannual testimony on monetary policy](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/watch-fed-chair-jerome-powell-speak-live-in-second-day-of-capitol-hill-testimony.html), Powell spoke Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee then the day after to the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nHeading into the appearances, markets had been looking for the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at its meeting later this month, then perhaps two more moves before stopping, with the end point around 5.25%.\n\nThat changed after Powell’s appearance, during which he cautioned that if inflation data remains strong, he expects rates to go “higher than previously anticipated” and possibly at a faster pace than a quarter point at a time.\n\nMarkets now strongly expect a half-point increase in March and the peak, or terminal rate, to hit close to 5.75% before the Fed is finished.\n\n## When the facts change\n\nSo what changed?\n\nBasically, it was the [January inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/key-fed-inflation-measure-rose-0point6percent-in-january-more-than-expected.html) plus signs that the labor market remains remarkably strong despite the Fed’s efforts to slow it down. That made Powell, who only weeks earlier had talked about [“disinflationary” forces at play](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/07/fed-chief-powell-says-the-the-disinflationary-process-has-begun-but-has-a-long-way-to-go.html), switch gears and start talking tough again on monetary policy.\n\n“He’s adjusting to data coming in, which the entire board should be doing,” Hogan said. “If the facts change again through the February and March data, he’ll likely become flexible on that side and not push this too far to the point where they need to break something.”\n\nIndeed, Powell said he’ll be watching a pivotal array of upcoming data closely — Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report, followed by next week’s look at the consumer and producer price indexes.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists are holding to their forecast for a quarter-point hike at the March 21-22 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but concede that it’s a “close call” between that and a half point.\n\nShould the Fed have to tilt in the more aggressive direction, Goldman [warned in a client note](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/goldman-warns-that-higher-fed-rates-could-lead-to-sharp-sell-off-in-stocks.html) that it could have market impacts, with stocks selling off “more sharply” and downward pressure on commodities, plus upward pressure on the dollar.\n\nStocks tumbled Tuesday then [again on Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?&amp;qsearchterm=stocks%20live%20updates) as investors grew more nervous about the Fed’s future path. Thursday’s sell-off, however, did trigger a shift lower in terms of expectations for a half-point hike this month, down to 58% most recently, according to a CME Group estimate.\n\n## Worries over consequences\n\nPowell faced some questioning this week over the Fed’s inflation-fighting strategies.\n\nSome more progressive legislators such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., charged that the rate hikes will result in 2 million layoffs and hurt working-class families disproportionately. Powell countered that inflation also is hammering those at the bottom end of the income spectrum.\n\n“This is what he is supposed to do,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at advisory firm RSM, said of Powell’s evolving policy stances. “Jay Powell is a punching bag in Washington at this point. He’s going to take the blame for establishing price stability. If he does that well, in the years to come he’ll be venerated. People will speak very highly of him.”\n\nBrusuelas is among those who think the Fed should accelerate its inflation battle with a half-point rate hike.\n\nHowever, he said policymakers could be swayed by a potentially softer jobs report and inflation data next week that reverses course and shows price increases abating. Economists expect that payrolls grew by 225,000 in February, according to Dow Jones, and there’s widespread belief that [January’s 517,000 surge](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/03/jobs-report-january-2023-.html) will be revised down in this report, perhaps significantly.\n\n“The economy is just too resilient at this point,” Brusuelas said. “They need to generate sufficient labor slack to cool off the economy.”\n\nSlack was not evident in this week’s Labor Department report of [job openings in January](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/job-openings-declined-in-january-but-still-far-outnumber-available-workers.html), which outnumbered available workers by a 1.9 to 1 margin.\n\nData like that could push the Fed into even further tightening, according to economists at Nomura. The firm said future actions could include adjustments to the Fed’s program to slash its bond portfolio, with one option being to remove the $95 billion monthly reduction cap currently in place.\n\nFor the moment, markets are continuing to price in higher rates.\n\nThough Powell made a special point Wednesday to emphasize that no decision has been made yet on the March rate move, markets essentially ignored him. Traders in the futures market were pricing in a terminal rate of 5.625% later this year, well above where it was before Powell spoke.", "id": "11n9fcz", "created_utc": 1678408863.0, "score": 272, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 432, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

Many of them just find other tech jobs, or otherwise use their education and experience to find some other high paying job.\n\nYou're ignoring, or maybe not aware of, two critical things, here:\n\n1. Tech has been in a glut for a long time now. These first rounds of layoffs were framed as companies shedding some fat that they incurred during the hiring rush in the pandemic. And that's partially true, but also obscuring another thing: there are \\*a lot\\* of software engineers, and not that much work to go around. Part of the reason for the glut were these bootcamps and training programs, which led to a lot of very generalized jr engineers getting into the market place. There is less and less low hanging fruit to have to pick, and positions are becoming a lot more specialized. But now we're getting second and third round layoffs that are directly tied to the fact that revenues are just going down and companies can't balance the payroll vs. investor expectation. The problem with that is that the companies can cut, investors will be happy for a week or two, and then it's clear that it didn't do anything and so we get into this cycle.\n2. For this reason, and other reasons.. like tech companies are just not hiring right now.. software engineers and other support personnel in tech are not having a good time finding new positions. One of the common stories right now among colleagues is that people who were laid off 4, 5 or 6 months ago, still cannot find jobs. People who have resumes that would otherwise be highly regarded, cannot get a job. When a job does come along, it is not these high salaried positions. I work in tech, and I see a lot of companies posting short-term contract positions. Tech is starting to move into having a class of precariats.\n\nThis is seen in the jobs report that was just released. Tech shed a lot of jobs, and companies have no plans to backfill any of those positions. The industries that did experience payroll growth were, by and large, industries with high turnover and low wages. If you were fired from a tech job this year, you're not looking at another position with a $143k salary. You're looking a job that pays out weekly and where the majority of your income will be from tips. That's the situation that we're facing. Those mortgages will slip.  \n\n>I do agree foreclosures will increase, but nowhere near the level of 2008. Underwriting standards are much stricter now. They don’t give out as large mortgages as easily to high risk borrowers anymore.\n\nThis is part of my point: the mere fact of how we treat housing investment, makes everyone a high risk borrower. Underwriting seems less risky because an underwriter's job isn't to take in the big picture of the job market, but to look at a snapshot of an individual borrower. That doesn't tell you anything, really, about the risk of that loan, though, over the long term. Not anymore. \n\nNormal investments happen on the basis of whether a business can bring back a return for selling a product or service in a market, and the prospect of that product or service growing in the long term. Depending on the asset you're investing in, it could be or may not be vulnerable to market fluctuations and participation. \n\nHousing is different. It's tied to whether the borrower can have a secure enough job to take on that large amount of debt. The only way to guarantee that investment is to guarantee that borrower will have a job that pays enough to shoulder that debt for 15 - 30 years. With the way the economy is, that's never a sure thing. The days of having lifetime, stable jobs and a pension are gone, buried and will likely never come back. We are an economy of precarious workers now, from high-salaried to low-wage jobs. That's by design, so companies can scale their team as they see fit at any given time.\n\nThe software engineers and other tech workers who were shed and will continue to be shed, are little more than gig workers with a W2 and an NDA, or, worse if you've accepted a severance, an NC agreement. That presents a problem when you hold an expensive mortgage, even with a low rate. Underwriter guidelines can be strict and still have to deal with this.\n\n>I think you need to elaborate on this. The main reason MBS values have crashed is because of higher rates - even the office sector has held up better than most expected, even including the high profile defaults recently.\n\nI think I elaborated quite a bit on it. SVB's collapse is a harbinger of the fact that jobs and housing are unstable right now. Their specific case is due to rates, but it's not just that. People are trying with everything they have to ignore what's going on, because the drive to continue to make easy money is there. It's just that the environment doesn't exist anymore.\n\n>We did learn some lessons from 2008. Like I said, mortgage underwriting requirements are much stricter now, which in turn has decreased the risk of some MBS. There are obviously still high risk loans, but not nearly to the extent there were in 2008.\n\nNo, the fact that we're still treating housing as an investment means we haven't learned our lesson. \"Strict underwriting\" was never just the issue itself: housing is a predatory industry, either through the encouragement of buying and selling housing as a stable long-term investment (only to not be upfront about how mortgages work, mortgage companies themselves being complete trash), through to institutional investors getting in on it and turning housing stock into unaffordable rentals.\n\nYou can make underwriting as strict as you can; but the problem is with the basis of the industry itself. Quality housing is a need but we treat it as a luxury.

If Bank A already has a 15% exposure to mobile communications, it might deny a $5B loan to Verizon to limit its own risk to that sector - or it may draw up a loan offer of $2B that only covers the cable service expansion that Verizon outlined in the application.\n\nIf a bank does something brain dead, like concentrate nearly 50% of its lending in one sector (like, say, venture backed capital for tech start ups, the way that SVB did) it irresponsibly exposes itself to outsized risk in that sector.  Then when venture capital / hedge funds shift money from tech startups into bonds, like when 5.2% 8 week t-bills are out there and 100:1 leverage is available for those at a 1.5% margin interest rate while clown show EV startups can't even make a running car, and those startups lose their ability to pay their loans in a timely fashion, that bank starts having a tough time fast", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not that simple, sivb was following great financial crisis rules for having liquid reserves in the form of bonds.

Why only this kinda of people are here?\n\nMajority of the online community does not have sufficient resistance to being manipulated by the popular narrative they are exposed to.\n\nPeople online are exposed to narratives in places that they have \"voluntarily\" chosen (or so they think). Often such places tend to be echo chambers and/or places that appeal to people's other interests. Therefore, they are favorably disposed to narratives that show up in those places. This makes them doubly susceptible.\n\nAlso, participation in online communities is directly proportional to how strong one's opinions are. This results in the more opinionated (regardless of how informed they are) people making more noise, reinforcing the prevailing narratives. This is a triple whammy.\n\nModern narratives are packaged in ways that tickle the lizard brain response rather than the pre-frontal cortex logic response. So, people have emotional responses to headlines / post titles, and do not even pay attention to the details which may be the exact opposite of headline. For example, they read a headline that shouts, \"Did Elon fire a cripple via Twitter?\" and get all riled up. They won't even notice it if the actual story under the headline provides details showing Elon did not actually fire him. This is the final coup de grace to any semblance of reason, logic, civility, humanity.\n\nThe result is that people online can be played as finely as a fiddle in a master musician's hands. For example, grandma who never pays attention to tech news complains about Elon firing 3000 Twitter employees, but she does not even hear about Zuckerberg firing over 10,000 employees. Worse, even when you tell her about Zuck's firing, she is not quite as riled up as she was when she read about Elon in her favorite echo chamber!\n\nOne has to be constantly cynical and vigilant to the point of being an asshole to avoid being lizard-brain-hijacked by these narratives. Even then, we are susceptible. For example, many of susceptible to pro-Tesla narratives, and might have a blind-spot for something anti-Tesla, even if it is true.\n\nPersonally, I use 4 types of tests to be suspicious about something:\n\n1. A narrative suddenly becomes hyper-popular, especially among average-IQ friends and acquaintances.\n\n2. A narrative is pushed by a source that had previously turned out to be deceptive. Eg: CNN / MSNBC / NPR.\n\n3. A narrative is repeated by a cabal of mainstream media sources and promoted by big tech.\n\n4.

{"title": "I sold my 0dte spy puts too early today and I need to tell someone", "selftext": "Hi, I'd like to apply to be the head dummy around these parts...For context I swung spy calls overnight (like a buffoon but it worked out) and sold them at open at the high. I felt like a king. Immediately following after, I dumped my winnings into spy puts because why stop gambling at 10 am when the market closes at 430? So I did just that. Dumped around 600 bucks into 398 poots (I know I'm not super baller like some of these idiots in this sub)\n\nI had a rule though.... I told myself that once I hit a certain profit, I will sell half and then at another level sell the other half. I **know** 0dte contracts on spy wither away as fast as you can say \"my wife's boyfriend\". Spy dropped quick enough for me to see some profits and gaze at my phone while my boss asked when is this big project done. He could kick rocks for all I cared. I made his monthly pay in 20 minutes on my phone. Eventually spy dropped more for me to sell all my puts. I felt great I liked the price I sold at. Spy hit a reversal heading back up and I felt like I played the Wall St. Cucks in NYC. \n\nAfter showboating for a mere 10 minutes, Spy dropped......and dropped....and kept....on.....dropping. I was shocked. I was terrified to look at what my 398 puts were at. I sold at $1.00 a contract (100 dollars each for the idiots). And these contracts hit $7.00 each. I wanted to cry just thinking about it. With tears in my eyes I pulled out my calculator and did the math. It was disgusting what I missed out on. My measly $2400 cash in my Robinhood didn't compare to the $11,000 (or so) missed profit. \n\nI felt like I just got punished for listening to myself and following my rules. Why couldn't I have just let them *rideeee* out. \n\nAnyway I was so furious the entire day and just had to write this out. I may just take the remaining money and spend it on something that won't stab me in the ^(fukin) heart like these puts did to my soul. Just kidding, I dumped half my equity into Aapl calls for tomorrow. I literally cannot wait for them to expire worthless so I can quit trading.
