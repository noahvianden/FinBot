He heavily rewrote the entire novel between 1866 and 1869.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace#cite_note-Knowles-5)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace#cite_note-FeuerMiller2008-9) Tolstoy's wife, [Sophia Tolstaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya), copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before Tolstoy considered it ready for publication.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace#cite_note-FeuerMiller2008-9) The version that was published in *Russkiy Vestnik* had a very different ending from the version eventually published under the title *War and Peace* in 1869. \n\nLooks like draft title was 1805.\n\nI was going for the cinematic masterpiece Rush Hour with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|3o7TKo6uiyLXcb4fqE)\n\nHehe.

So I decided to just wait until they were all released, and then I guess I forgot about them. The recent re-release of Persona 3 Portable on all platforms reminded me these movies exist, so I watched them all.\n\nPersona 3 was originally released in 2006 on PS2 and from there it has an interesting history. An expanded version of the game titled Persona 3 FES was released a year later in 2007 and features an entire (smaller) second game as an epilogue to the original game. These two parts, retroactively titled The Journey (original P3) and The Answer (added in FES), combine to tell the full story. A year after that, a heavily cut down version of P3 was released as Persona 3 Portable on the PSP. This version of P3 omits The Answer and a lot of content but adds the option for a female playable main character and adds a variety of gameplay improvements. Because P3 was branched into 2 different versions, P3 FES and P3P, there is no single \"definitive\" version of P3 in the sense of Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal. This aggravates fans of P3 to this very day, and the recent re-release of the cut down P3P while ignoring FES is only rubbing salt in 15 year old wounds.\n\nThe P3 film quadrilogy covers only the events of The Journey. If you have played P3, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, these movies aren't for you anyways. P3 is an immensely long game, and in order to condense the events of an 80+ hours game into 4 movies which only total about 375 minutes of run time, the story is very rushed and many things happen with little background or explanation. You will not know what's going on unless you have played P3.\n\nWhat we do have here is a surprisingly faithful attempt at trying to coherently tell the emotionally dense story of P3 without actually skipping anything because of the tight time constraints. I admit that it was so long since I played P3 that I had forgotten most of the story and the movies were nice for reminding me about all the stuff that happened. They also reminded me that P3 has far and away the best story, the best characters, the best setting, and the best themes of the \"3D era\" of Persona, and by that I mean Personas 3, 4, and 5. Any other longtime fans of the series will offer their own opinions as to which Persona had the best story but quite frankly you either agree 3 was the best or you're wrong. Deal with it.\n\nThe animation was produced by Aniplex's internal anime studio A-1 Pictures, with the exception of the first film. In general, plenty of budget was allocated to the many battle sequences which fill the 4 films, and quite a bit less budget was allocated for non-battle sequences. The general quality of animation tended to improve from one film to the next, while the first movie had some really sus looking faces, by the last film faces were generally drawn reasonably well enough to be recognizable as faces. I would say that overall the movies look decent and they do manage to look good when it counts the most. Similarly, the audio of the movies sound fine with clearly audible dialogue, and the soundtrack is heavily carried by the music of Persona video game music computer Shoji Meguro who contributes remixed version of game tracks and also new tracks just for the movies.\n\nThe presentation is alright, but the strength of these movies is in the actual storyline of P3. Unlike the 2 games which came afterwards, P3 tends to be closer thematically to other games under the Shin Megami Tensei franchise umbrella. Themes of accepting mortality and death, the meaning of friendship and loss, and of course the end of the world are prevalent in this narrative and closely align with SMT titles in ways that the stories of P4 and P5 do not. This is why P3 is the best one, and progressively from P4 to P5 the Persona games have grown less and less connected with the franchise they originated from.\n\nIf you have played P3 and you haven't watched these movies, I would think you should. Not only will you get to enjoy this fantastic story again, you can completely ignore the recent P3P re-release and keep waiting and hoping that Atlus will get off their asses and produce a proper remaster of P3 which finally merges the FES and P3P branches back together. If you haven't played P3 or are scarcely aware of what Persona even is, this probably isn't the place to start. \n\nFinal Score: 8/10 would shoot myself in the head again", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|5hc2bkC60heU)", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I've had enough restraint this year.\n\nI'm getting my hopes up.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.\n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%.
