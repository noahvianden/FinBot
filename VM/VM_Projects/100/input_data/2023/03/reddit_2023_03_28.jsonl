{"title": "SPX 12 Delta Srangle - Day in the life Example", "selftext": "I wanted to give a day-in-the-life example of 12-Delta SPX strangle entered before the banking craziness that caused a volatility spike.  You generally don't want to enter trades before spikes so I thought this was a great example as I rode the wave fo SVB/Schwab/etc.. issues.\n\nI've provided my roll frequency, premium collected and my mechanics.  For reference, I've been running this strategy for about 4 years and net about $30k/month.\n\nFor reference, these trades typically close every 15 days.  This example took twice as long because of the volatility spike after entering the position.  Feel free to ask questions, and I hope this helps provide a mechanical options trading perspective.  This can also be accomplished using XSP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trade Mechanics (based off TastyTrade):**\n\n* SPX because I don't have to worry about early assignment, individual stock risk, and SPX is very liquid\n* Opening Positions: 12-Delta SPX strangles twice a week until \\~$500k spread requirement reached\n* DTE \\~45 days, monthly expirations only\n   * I typically have around 12 to 15 open positions\n* Roll Mechanics\n   * When untested option drops below 12-delta\n   * When untested option is less than 50% of tested delta\n   * When option expiration is less than 21 days.  This example doesn't include a monthly roll\n* Exit when I'm able to collect 55% (50% of the premium with a little extra to cover roles) of the original premium.  Original premium is recalculated after each roll and *original premium* target is maintained.\n* GTC order to close position opened immediately after entering or rolling\n* Black Swan and Risk Mitigation, I stop entering trades and exit higher delta positions if VIX is 35+\n* Strangle cost is \\~$50k in buying power per position.  I typically use around \\~$500k in buying power or around 15 positions.\n* Premium collected through rolls is transferred each night to SWVXX (high yield mutual fund for additional (\\~4.5%) gains, then sold when the position is closed to pay for the close\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trade Example**\n\n* 2/27: Sold 3645p/4320c (4/21/23) 12 delta strangle\n   * **Premium ($22.82 + $13.63) $36.45 profit of $2k (about 55%)**\n* 3/1: Rolled down Call\n   * Bought 4320c for $7.11\n   * Sold 4260 for $13.16\n   * **Gained $6.52**\n* 3/2: Rolled down Call\n   * Bought 4260 for $10.45\n   * Sold 4230 for $14.15\n   * **Gained $2.71**\n* 3/3 Rolled Up Put\n   * Bought 3645 for $17.00\n   * Sold 3695 for $22.10\n   * **Gained $5.82**\n* 3/6 Rolled Up Put\n   * Bought 3695 for $15.21\n   * Sold 3780 $23.81\n   * **Gained $6.89**\n* 3/6 Rolled up Put\n   * Bought 3780 for $22.25\n   * Sold 3815 for $26.6\n   * **Gained $1.56**\n* 3/9 Rolled down Call\n   * Bought 4230 for $12.70\n   * Sold 4195 for 17.80\n   * **Gained $1.45**\n* 3/10 Rolled down Call\n   * Bought 4195 for $12.75\n   * Sold 4150 for $19.70\n   * **Gained $5.05**\n* 3/10 Rolled Down call\n   * Bought 4150 for $15.42\n   * Sold 4130 for $18.87\n   * **Gained $4.28**\n* 3/14 Roled down call\n   * Bought 4130 for $17.22\n   * Sold 4105 for $22.27\n   * **Gained $1.65**\n* 3/15 Rolled Down Call\n   * Bought 4105 for $19.82\n   * Sold 4080 for$ 25.47\n   * **Gained $2.45**\n* 3/27 Closed Position\n   * Bought 3815 for $29.02\n   * Bought 4080 for $40.98\n   * **Cost to close (loss) $17.93**\n\n**Total Premium collected throughout the life of trade is $20.45 or $2,045**", "id": "124wb3v", "created_utc": 1680025092.0, "score": 175, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 232, "comments": [{"body": " If at least five people say yes, I will create an interactive explainer for this.", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "As promised, here  is version 1 of the video and the interactive tool to explain this discussion to \"beginners\".

Every strangle management strategy I've ever seen recommends rolling the untested side once the *tested* side has met some criterion: for example, the underlying has crossed the strike price, or the delta of the tested side has reached double its original delta.

In addition, Call premium will drop (unrealized gain).  Premium is realized when the untested option (Call) is rolled down.  Aggressive rolling allows faster premium collection since it keeps the untested delta high.\n\nSPX bounces around so it may go down for one to three days, but also reverses.  During a reversal, the tested side premium/delta drops quickly.  \n\nMy exit strategy is to add original premium with rolled premium until I hit 50% of the originally-established premium.  So if the position is opened (shorted) for $2,000, I'm want to close (Buy Back) when it's worth $1,000.  Realized premium summarized after each roll, then I enter a GTC order that exits the position when $1,000 profit is reached.

Money, unfortunately, buys influence in politics and young people just don't have the ability to compete in that respect.\n\nI don't necessarily agree with this, as I think older people can hold a lot of wisdom as long as they have the right attitude and move with the times, but I can see how it may seem that way if you never lived in any of the top-democracies in the world. In my country, money doesn't really play a role in getting elected because there are clear rules. For example, you're not allowed to advertise unless during specific airtime paid for by the government, where each party gets the same amount of airtime. Bribing is illegal instead of called \"lobbying\", and people get kicked out of politics for it or even put in jail. Our politicians are also not allowed to earn more than ~$200K a year, even the prime minister, and they need to report all income or actually suffer consequences (not just a small fine).\n\nThat said, there are still strong lobbies from big corporations, either by convincing politicians what they want is good for the economy or by offering them the revolving door. So things aren't perfect and money still plays a big part in society and politics, but not really in getting elected. Just getting there would make the US a much better country, but it's almost impossible to do when only those who got there through the corruption have the power to abolish it.\n\n> I think lowering the maximum age would get so many more younger people involved that even if a young-ish boob was elected, they'd quickly be replaced by an opportunistic, charismatic and qualified individual that saw the discontent among the voters.

{"title": "Stop rooting for a crash, regards", "selftext": "First off, the S&P 500 is about 1000 points below ATH. We’re still about 20% off the highs. For sure things can, and probably will (eventually) get much worse, but there’s also a chance you dumbasses already got your crash and you haven’t yet realized markets are forward looking. Realistically, we’re probably due for something much worse than the 20% drop from ATH that already happened, but I just wanted to make this point in case the market never dips again. What might be most realistic is a slow-ish decline over a longer time frame, which is a lot harder to profit from then some sort of sudden crash, which is a lot rarer of an event; the market could also just be sideways for a decade, who the hell knows.\n\nMore importantly, I understand the opportunity a crash provides, but you shouldn’t be *rooting* for a crash. Do you know what crashes really look like? A shit ton of people, probably including *you* since most of you *are* brain dead, losing everything, or at the very least, watching the value of your assets disintegrate quickly.\n\nWhen crashes happen, most people get fucked. You will *not* time the crash. Most people won’t. The few who do will have movies made about them, with Christian Bale eating crayons for months to get in character. And you know what happens when the market crashes after everyone loses their shit? The ultra rich just buy up more of the market at a discount, because they’re the only ones with assets. You will not be one of the privileged few who comes out unscathed. Way smarter people than you will also be fucked. You won’t see it coming if it happens and if you did, you won’t have the assets (or brain power) to profit. Most of you turned yearly losses in the longest bull market ever, or maybe you weren’t even investing then… but now you’re gonna profit somehow when the rest of the country (and possibly world) is watching their assets deteriorate?\n\nI’m not anything close to a permabull, but there’s a reason why most people just keep buying the market. I know a lot of you regards only know how to buy 0DTE SPY calls, but there’s a thing called DCAing that was recently invented by smart and conservative investors that generally benefits you in the long run. Of course, most of you won’t live that long, but if you do, you’ll notice that there’s a shit ton of people just parking their money in things like the S&P500 and buying with every paycheck. That, people who are contrarian investors, and people who areactual permabulls, are the forces the crash is working against.\n\nRealistically, all of us will be fucked no matter which side we’re on. But if you keep hammering SPY puts and losing all your money only for the “big crash” you’ve been waiting for to happen in a year, you’re just as wrong as the classic permabull idiot. So stop rooting for it because it just means we’re all fucked anyways.\n\n\n\nETA: I knew that the average reading comprehension ability in this sub was that of a goldfish, so I figured I would have to further explain as it seems some of you in the comments don't seem to fully follow what I'm saying. This is not a bullish or bearish post. I'm not *predicting* anything here.\n\nThe market could shit the bed tomorrow, or in the near future. It could also stay in a bear market territory that slowly gets worse over the course of the next decade or so; it's probably far more likely that the pain in the markets that people are predicting is a slow burn that few will profit from rather than some sort of flash crash that ends it quickly, which is what many of you seem to be looking for and lighting money on fire in 0DTE puts to try to time. Certainly if the bank situation continues to get worse (though the government will likely keep bailing them out), a more rapid crash could still happen, that just doesn't seem as likely as a sustained period of economic downturn dragging down the markets. The far less likely option, though still a possibility, could be that the worst is over and you already missed the crash - this is probably not the case but should at least be considered by an informed investor, which obviously a lot of people in here aren't. \n\nMy point was solely that there's too many idiots in here rooting for a big crash, and not considering the implications of that, or the fact that very few of you will profit from it.", "id": "124kmrd", "created_utc": 1680000261.0, "score": 963, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 685, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|557|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I want to make that point that you shouldn’t be rooting for the market to crash, and I think we already had our crash.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">will have movies made about them, with Christian Bale eating crayons for months to get in character. \n\nThat's hilarious", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "HAHA \" ThiS tiMe iS DiFferEnT\" it only has half the requirements of a crash based on historical data.

The federal reserve is the safety cushion that allows big banks to lend way too much on a regular basis, because they know the fed can bail them out in the event of a collapse.  When banks have to worry about total failure and executives take on personal risk, they become a lot more cautious.  Funny you should reference the Great Recession, when that example works entirely for my position and against yours.\n\n>Debt system is not some all you can eat buffet,\n\nIt literally is.  We could pass a constitutional amendment tomorrow requiring the government to have a balanced budget each year.  \n\n>Also not sure where exactly the idea of “tangible assets only” prevents federal debt.\n\nIt doesn't, but it greatly limits the amount they borrow.  They can no longer simply borrow an infinite amount of money from the future.  They have to borrow real assets from the present from parties that believe they will be able to pay them back on time.\n\nDebt is not a binary.  It is a sliding scale.  It is possible to use a modest amount of debt to jumpstart growth and productivity.  However, what we have now is a debt monster that is devouring our entire economy and extracting most of the value of our labor right out from under us.  It is long past time to reel this monster back in.\n\n>as government regularly did before the invention of central banks\n\nThat is a good thing.

There have been several compelling arguments made that WWI was only enabled by the establishment of fiat currency, since the participating governments were only able to finance the war by borrowing from the future.  Without it, we may have avoided the bulk of WWI and subsequently WW2 entirely.\n \nAnd let me conclude with your daily reminder that [the Federal Reserve caused the Great Depression.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm) \n\n>(Ben Bernanke): Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve.

At least according to your very own source.\n\n> Regional banks also began to assert themselves more. Thus, power became diffused; worse, what power there was accrued to men who did not understand central banking from a national and international point of view, as Strong had. The leadership vacuum and the generally low level of central banking expertise in the Federal Reserve System was a major problem that **led to excessive passivity** and many poor decisions by the Fed in the years after Strong's death. (...)  We don't know what would have happened had Strong lived; but what we do know is that the central bank of the world's economically most important nation in 1929 was essentially leaderless and lacking in expertise.

This ushered in an era of rapid contractionary policy, at which point everything collapsed and fell apart.

The study found that about two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and generative AI could replace up to a quarter of current work.\n\nWhite-collar workers, particularly those in the US legal and administrative sectors, are at higher risk of being affected by new AI tools. This is because the legal services industry consists of a relatively small number of occupations already susceptible to AI automation. Despite the potential disruptions, the widespread implementation of generative AI could lead to labor cost savings and the creation of new jobs, such as prompt engineers who write text to test AI chatbots.\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/generative-ai-chatpgt-300-million-full-time-jobs-goldman-sachs-2023-3?utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/generative-ai-chatpgt-300-million-full-time-jobs-goldman-sachs-2023-3?utm_source=reddit.com)", "id": "1256696", "created_utc": 1680046116.0, "score": 575, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 362, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|25|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Generative AI systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are becoming increasingly popular, leading to concerns about their potential impact on the labor market.

However, the fact that people think legal practitioners are going to be gone in 5-20 years is, in my mind, unfounded. On the one hand, we as a society place a lot of agency in the law’s communicative function. This encompasses meeting face to face with a lawyer, who will go through your distinct legal problem with you. Moreover, when a case goes to trial, would people be willing to have the judge replaced by a computer? I don’t think so. (Not to mention the political and moral ramifications such a computer driven and adjudicated legal system would operate). \n\nAirplanes can fly on complete auto-pilot, but we still want to have a pilot to be there. \n\nLastly, we have to remember who is in control of society. The generation that is soon to be glimpsing power 40-60, does not want to have complete AI usurpation. Not to mention, the only people who would take away the legal profession, would, ironically be the legal profession. Lots of high government officials are lawyers, who have implement a statutory regime that the only people capable of giving legal advice are lawyers. Would the law, operate to destroy their own profession? Not a chance.\n\nNot to mention that the law itself is about 20 years behind current societal advancements. In my country, most big firms have to keep paper copies of every file. Somewhat surprisingly, we also have the requirement to utilize a typewriter for certain draftings.\n\nLastly, I would like to mention that there is a current debate about how a AI program like ChatGPT is rampantly committing copyright violations. This is an area of the law that will skyrocket in the future. \n\nLastly, I would like to mention that Wills for example, present a huge problem for an AI system. Sure, perhaps it will get advanced enough to draft one, but to interpret one? I don’t think so. For jurisdictions that retain the separation of a determinable and subsequent interest, there is a huge difference in outcome for vesting. The only way to distinguish such a difference, is by analyzing the intention of the parties. Sure, language can be used, but it is not determinable in any regard. Often, it requires looking at extrinsic evidence. Which is outside of the four corners of a document. \n\nJust my thoughts.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good.
