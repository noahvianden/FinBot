{"title": "Tesla stock falls more than 5% after hours as Investor Day falls short on detail", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/tesla-2023-investor-day-after-the-bell-master-plan-part-3-teased.html\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla hosted a 2023 Investor Day presentation in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his ‚ÄúMaster Plan 3,‚Äù and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.\n\nThe presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.\n\nNear the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, ‚ÄúThere is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesn‚Äôt require destroying natural habitats. It doesn‚Äôt require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIn fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.‚Äù\n\nMusk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, Drew Baglino. They discussed a future in which the company would play a role in ‚Äúre-powering the grid with renewable fuels‚Äù as they ramp up battery production, both for Tesla‚Äôs electric vehicles and for the company‚Äôs utility-scale energy storage systems.\n\nTesla‚Äôs goal is to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030, executives reiterated. The company reported full-year deliveries of around 1.31 million vehicles in 2022.\n\nDuring a question and answer session following the 3-hour presentation, executives fielded a question about how Tesla could grow its market share in China.\n\nElon Musk passed the question to Tom Zhu, who is heading up global production and has run the China and APAC businesses for Tesla for years. ‚ÄúAs long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you don‚Äôt have to worry about demand,‚Äù Zhu said. ‚ÄúWe try everything to cut costs,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúand pass down that value to our customers.‚Äù\n\nMusk then added, ‚ÄúDemand is a function of affordability not desire.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúEven small changes in the price have a big effect on demand.‚Äù\n\nZhu also announced that as of Wednesday, Tesla had produced 4 million cars in total.\n\n‚ÄúIt took us 12 years to build the first million, and about 18 months to the second million. The third million, 11 months. Then less than 7 months to build the 4 millionth,‚Äù Zhu said touting the company‚Äôs improving operational efficiency.\n\nHe said that the company plans to build new car and battery cell factories, and also to produce more cars per year at its existing factories.\n\nTesla charging leader Rebecca Tinucci said that in 2022 the company provided 9 terawatt hours across charging methods, including home charging including 40,000 Superchargers. (By way of comparison, the entire U.S. consumes about 4,000 terawatt hours of electricity per year.) Tinucci also noted that about half of the company‚Äôs Superchargers in the EU are open to other vehicles, and that the company just opened 10 Superchargers in the US to non-Teslas.\n\nTesla design leader Franz von Holzhausen and vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy took the stage to show off a number of planned manufacturing changes meant to improve the efficiency of Tesla vehicle production. But von Holzhausen said that Tesla would not yet reveal its ‚Äúnext gen‚Äù vehicle.\n\nThe company‚Äôs powertrain vice president, Colin Campbell, said that Tesla‚Äôs next powertrain factory will be 50% smaller than the one in Austin, Texas, but will have the same capacity. He also said the company is working on a new kind of drive unit that is compatible with any battery cell type, and a motor that will be built without any rare earth metals.\n\nAhead of the 2023 Investor Day, at a press conference on Tuesday, Mexico president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tesla had agreed to build a large factory in Monterrey, Mexico. He said Tesla agreed to use recycled water and take other initiatives to cope with water-scarcity in the region.\n\nMusk confirmed the factory plans on Wednesday, and said production there would supplement, rather than replace, any manufacturing at other Tesla facilities.\n\nTesla shares have rebounded from declines during 2022, and are up more than 60% for the year so far. However, the stock dropped 1.43% on Wednesday prior to the event, and 5% after hours.\n\nMizuho Securities analysts maintained a buy rating on shares of Tesla ahead of Investor Day, seeing Tesla in a leadership position in a growing market for fully electric vehicles. They wrote in a note earlier this week, ‚ÄúNear-term, we see continued strength in TSLA‚Äôs market share, but see cheaper competitor EVs coming to market as potentially dilutive to TSLA‚Äôs share of the US EV market.‚Äù\n\nCurrently, the lowest-priced Tesla available is the Model 3 sedan, which starts at a price point of around $43,000, they wrote. Seven models from other automakers are currently priced below that, Mizhuo noted.\n\nMusk‚Äôs ambitious Master Plan Part Deux was published in 2016, and has not been completely fulfilled. It included four main objectives:\n\n‚ÄúCreate stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúExpand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDevelop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEnable your car to make money for you when you aren‚Äôt using it‚Äù.", "id": "11frmg2", "created_utc": 1677727906.0, "score": 1117, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 405, "comments": [{"body": "I watched it live.

Good if you can scale it. Bad if it's taking forever and you're losing money in the hopes of it one day reaching the market.\n2. People have been talking about Amazon's R&D eventually coming to fruition for years now. Sorry, but some of their shit have been absolute failures. Drone delivery, how's that going? They tried to get into video game development and failed miserably with a long-term project losing money and not having enough players. I can't remember the other projects they had that ultimately were scrapped but there are many of them.\n3. E-commerce is highly competitive and low margins. That's why Amazon has had trouble with it lately. Walmart and other retailers have become very competitive in improving shipping times, prices, and item availability. I used to make Amazon orders like twice a week. I'm barely even touching my Amazon account these days. If I didn't have it for free, I would never pay. Increased labor costs, increased transportation costs, supply constraints... all have reduced Amazon's margins.\n4. AWS is a positive but cloud is highly competitive with large players willing to spend billions to compete here and growth has slowed. I think AWS is like 15% of Amazon's revenue but represented 75% of their profit. That is more negative than positive. It's unlike Apple where services is high margins but at the heart of the company, their hardware is still insanely profitable. Again, e-commerce is tough business and Amazon is finding that out now. It's too late for them to ditch it so can they find a way to be more profitable with huge retailers capable of giving them a battle?\n5. Internationally, they haven't had too much success. Difficult to replicate in foreign countries because the logistics is far more challenging when you're competing against domestic companies.\n\nPositives, services revenue is bigger than sales revenue so higher margins and less dependability on their e-commerce. Operating margins have been increasing after a terrible two years so that's a good sign. Ad services have been huge for Amazon. They should really take advantage of that. Huge growth and they have the means to scale. Large consumer base, easy target.\n\nBig issue is: Too much money being used up on projects that haven't really made any money and investors want results now. Especially when cash is hard to come by because of the rates, you can't be burning cash flow on projects that may or may not work. That's why Apple is still the cream of the crop.

So if people have borrowed money, then demand also reduces bcoz of higher interest rates. Or until money runs out and people stop paying increased prices of manufactures. \nSo price control happens organically, but that takes times, months to years based on type of goods. \nPeople who has money moves their money to bonds and fixed income products.

People with savings manage inflation with interest income. \nEconomy cools down ( not destroyed)- growth reduced but thats good for coming years/decades. \n\nThis is a idea of economist who things high interest rates and reducing money supply can stop inflation. \nThere is another set of economist, mainly Japanese who can control inflation with federal price control and increasing exports to manage your currency‚Äôs buying power itself.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So maybe some more economically inclined minds can weigh in on what I'm overlooking.\n\nIn practical terms, I have no idea how this transition would occur. But what if (and I am NOT talking about Crypto here, nor a gold standard) we changed from a floating monetary system (i.e. a system where the amount of capital is in flux) to a fixed system, where the amount of currency is fixed. \n\nI think this would have some very interesting implications in our financial system. \n\nBacking up a bit, the value of a US dollar is roughly related to the amount of dollars floating around the value of our economy, which roughly correlates to GDP. As we're all familiar, more dollars generally leads to more inflation, but we can print more dollars with minimal consequences as long as GDP keeps up. \n\nI think that's why 2% target inflation is the sweet spot... Healthy GDP grows around 1-3% annually (~3.1%, historically). So, matching the monetary supply with economic growth keeps everything pretty steady. \n\nUnfortunately, maintaining this equilibrium requires a lot of hands-on intervention from whomever is in charge of maintaining this equilibrium (i.e. the Fed in the good Ole U S of A). This works fine until too much stress is put on the system - i.e. too many dollars are pumped into the system, and the result is inflation that now needs to be tamed. \n\nSo, what if we remove the variable amount of dollars in the system and just established a fixed amount of currency?? \n\nWell, I think it would turn our financial dynamics upside down, but for the better. The biggest difference would be the value of our currency is no longer deflating. In fact, it's value would actually appreciate over time as GDP grows, at a rate of 1-3% on average. Essentially, as the economy grows, becomes more productive and creates value, that wealth bolsters an economy's GDP, oncreasing the value of their currency & transferring some of that new wealth to everyone rather than just those at the top. \n\nIn this system, i think people would actually be inclined to both save & invest their money. By just holding currency, it's value will increase relative to economic growth, incentivizing saving. But there's still incentive to invest your money. Just holding cash would be similar to investing in a broad index, or investing in a bond, both of which currently exist and don't necessarily hurt people's incentive to invest. \n\nI wonder if there would actually be more incentive to invest/create business because with the appreciating value of money, just breaking even would actually leave you with more value than when you started. So, the risk of opening a business might actually be lower because profits in regards to the actual value of money are more easily achievable. \n\nI don't want to be more long winded than I already have been, but it could also have interesting & beneficial effects on wages and debt (specifically in regards to govt debt and how they can operate). Obviously, this wouldn't affect inflationary pressures like supply and demand but I do think it would remove a significant contributor from the equation to the benefit of the individual people in the economy. \n\nTL;DR: I theorize that an economic system with a fixed monetary supply would remove some of the inflationary pressures from commodities and actually cause inflation in the value of currency instead, to the benefit of everyone. \n\nEveryone, I know this idea is pretty half-baked (if that, maybe more luke-warm?).

Firstly it would mean during expansions the labour market would get tighter and employees would be able to demand higher wages. Inflation for corporates would also fluctuate in unpredictable ways.

You also want to control PPI to ensure corporates can make predictable economic decisions.\n\nThe problem isn't really inflation, you see. College tuition can increase in price rapidly, property prices can increase rapidly, even oil prices can rise to some extent.

{"title": "The Inverse Jim Cramer ETF Has Officially Arrived", "selftext": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/inverse-cramer-etf-is-coming-to-the-real-world\n\nAn enterprising and clearly meme-savvy fund manager out there, Tuttle Capital Management, has actually filed prospectuses for two Cramer-tracking funds:\n\n- The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM)\n- The Long Cramer ETF (LJIM)\n\nI'm not surprised. Tuttle Capital is known for its hilarious yet strangely effective ETF lineup. Case in point, their earlier Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK) that bet against Cathie Wood and her funds is still up 73% year-to-date. \n\n**How the Inverse Cramer ETF might work**\n\nMake no mistake, SJIM and LJIM will be actively managed funds. Although Index One was able to construct an Inverse Cramer tracking index, the actual operations of a Cramer-based fund would be significantly more complex. This is not your vanilla buy-and-hold index fund. \n\nAccording to Tuttle Capital, both ETFs will hold 20-25 Cramer picks in an equally weighted allocation. Because Cramer often makes his picks live on TV (or via tweets), the fund will likely have significant turnover to maintain low tracking error with Cramer's recommendations. I'm curious to see if there will be large capital gains distributions every year due to this. \n\nSJIM is the more interesting fund in my opinion and will require some intricacies to carry out its daily inverse exposure target. This will likely necessitate shorting or the use of total return swaps. I'm curious to see if the team at Tuttle plans on using options given their complexity and susceptibility to time decay and changes in implied volatility. \n\nIn many ways, SJIM is basically a long-short alternative fund. If Cramer is bullish a pick, the fund shorts it. If Cramer is bearish on a pick, the fund goes long on it. Buying the fund means basically betting against Cramer in the most explicit and hilarious of ways.\n\n**Benefits and risks of SJIM ETF**\n\nThe premise behind SJIM is theoretically sound and can be boiled down to one observation: \"the average stock picker performs horribly .\"Stock-picking is extremely difficult to pull off consistently. Everyone is a genius in a bull market, but during bear markets like these, the average stock picker tends to trail a simple index fund significantly. \n\nCase in point, studies have found that just a handful of stocks (86 in total) account for half of the total stock market's return in the last 90 years, with 96% underperforming risk-free Treasury Bills. Another study found that a blindfolded monkey could beat most stock pickers. Unless you think he‚Äôs a prophet with his stock picks, betting against Cramer is like betting against any stock picker. \n\nWhat is the bull case for SJIM then? In a nutshell, the fund would likely outperform if just over half of Cramer's picks were wrong in the short term. The inverse exposure will likely be reset daily like most inverse ETFs on the market. Thus, the best-case scenario is a sudden, volatile movement against one of Cramer's recommendations that the fund trades in and out of. \n\nMost inverse funds have high negative carry due to the positive expected returns of the underlying, volatility drag, and high expense ratios. SJIM could feasibly post a positive long-term return if Cramer was consistently wrong with his picks over the short term, the fund doesn't employ leverage (which amplifies volatility drag), and keeps expense ratios low enough.  \nIf you're dead set on betting against Cramer, SJIM might be one of the safer ways to do so. Otherwise, you'll have to actively manage dozens of positions, keep up to date with Cramer's news segments and Twitter, use margin to sell stocks short, or fiddle with options.

They're not special in I think any other way at all.

It's usually just one person with serious talent that adds the secret sauce.  Even if they effectively teach it to others (and while many manage to do so, quite a few never do), they can only teach what they know... which will be limited in scope and stay in a certain domain.\n\nSometimes  that person is excellent at hiring talent themselves... in which case they're much, much better at finding talent in the same area they're experts in.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to recognize and evaluate talent in fields you are not very familiar with.  It's also MUCH harder to FIND those people.  \n\nIf you were say doing insanely cool stuff in a PHD program and moved to the commercial world even as a small group... you can't exactly (or at least few seem to) go find the people doing insanely cool stuff in unrelated fields in the same sort of environment.  You nearly always just put job postings out and hope for the best.  Even if you look for groups like that.. they're busy with their own advancements and are almost never both aligned with what you need and ready to join you right then.\n\nEven large companies have this problem... although many have over time managed to eventually get lucky with hires to expand the domains they're good at (or at least competent in).\n\nSome companies attract talent... Tesla, SpaceX, and Apple (mostly in the past?) come to mind... if they're large enough to find a spot for the talent when they approach, they'll have a much bigger pool to draw top people from when the next project rolls around.\n\nThose top people are also much better at recognizing and evaluating the skill levels of people within their domain.  That's super important.\n\nThat leads into possibly the most significant advantage Tesla has.  They have (I think) virtually no \"professional managers\" who are only good at managing and don't know the fields of the people they oversee.  These non-expert managers will have very limited ability to recognize extremely good ideas when they see them.  They'll be particularly biased towards stuff they know already works.  It is extremely difficult to break any molds with those people.\n\nThe thing is, almost the entire business world has bought up this professional manager concept.\n\nIf there is anything you can point to to explain Tesla's success... well, it's f\\*ckin' that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis completes this randomly occurring, random rambling event.
